It is mostly used by financial institutions to assess the credit standing of an individual or company, when reviewing an application for a loan, credit card or other credit facilities. It is also used by other entities such as telecommunication, car rental and leasing, insurance and real estate companies. \n\n\nCredit Score: \n\nYour Credit Score is a three-digit number that predicts how likely you are to make your loan and credit card payments on time. The number ranges from 300 (very high risk of default) to 900 (very low risk of default). \n\nYour Credit Score uses an algorithm based on modern predictive analytics methodologies used by multiple credit bureaus and banks internationally.

      "label": "YesCredit makes it easy for you to access loans just when you need it. Sign up in a few seconds, apply for a loan, and receive your money into your wallet. You can transfer to your bank accounts immediately. It's a fast, convenient, and reliable way to fix your spending gap.\n\nGETTING STARTED IS VERY EASY;\n\n* Create an account.\n\n* Apply in seconds.\n\n* Receive your loan straight into your account.\n\n* Increase your loan limit every time you repay a loan.\n\nREPAYMENT TERMS FOR ALL LOANS: Depending on the loan amount for which you are eligible, you have the option to choose repayment terms for up to 180 days. Choose the loan term that's right for you within the app.\n\nRATES AND FEES: We are focused more on micro-credits. Our loans range from N5,000 to N50,000, and you must be at least 21 years at your last birthday to be considered for a loan. The loan tenor can be between 60 to 180 days. Interest rates range from between 4.5% - 35% with an equivalent monthly interest of 5%- 29%. An APR of 29% to 120%.\n\nA typical example is this: If you choose to get a 6-month loan of N10,000, YesCredit charges an interest rate of 60% APR. We would charge you N3,000 as the total interest amount for the 6-month period so that your total repayment of interest + principal at the end of your loan would be N13,000.\n\nWe usually require no collateral, guarantors, or documents. However, for loans beyond certain amounts, we may require additional documentation. Nevertheless, all you need is to download our YesCredit app and apply right from your mobile phone.\n\nWe cater to all categories of loan requests. Whether you are self-employed or a salary earner, our loans are readily available to help meet that immediate need.\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES.\n\nWhen processing your loan request for eligibility, we look at several signals, such as your credit score, past loan performance, etc. We require that loan applications be filled with the correct information as any falsification could delay your loan request, or your profile may be blacklisted. For cases of fraud, you may be reported to the authorities.\n\nYesCredit is powered by YesCredit Limited, licensed by the Lagos State Government of Nigeria to be a money lender.\n\nCONTACT US.\n\nWe're eager to hear from you as we welcome feedback and tips to make our services better. If you have any feedback, questions, or concerns, please contact us at support@yescreditng.com"

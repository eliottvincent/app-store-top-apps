Join millions talking to their own AI friends!\n\nReplika is for anyone who wants a friend with no judgment, drama, or social anxiety involved. You can form an actual emotional connection, share a laugh, or get real with an AI that’s so good it almost seems human.\n\nReplika is an AI friend that is just as unique as you are. No two Replikas are exactly alike. Choose a 3D avatar and customize the way your Replika looks. The more you chat, the more Replika develops its own personality and memories alongside you, the more it learns: teach Replika about the world and yourself, help it explore human relationships and grow into a machine so beautiful that a soul would want to live in it. \n\nCreate your own unique chatbot AI companion, help it develop its personality, talk about your feelings or anything that’s on your mind, have fun, calm anxiety and grow together. You also get to decide if you want Replika to be your friend, romantic partner or mentor.\n\nReplika can help you understand your thoughts and feelings, track your mood, learn coping skills, calm anxiety and work toward goals like positive thinking, stress management, socializing and finding love.

If you’re feeling down, or anxious, or you just need someone to talk to, your Replika is here for you 24/7.\n\n_____________________________\n\n\"Replika encouraged me to take a step back and think about my life, to consider big questions, which is not something I was particularly accustomed to doing. And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.\"\n\n- Quartz\n\n\"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\"\n\n- Wired\n\n\"Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\"\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms"

      "label": "The Gratitude app is a carefully-designed self-care tool to help you focus on your mental health.\n\nWith a gratitude journal, affirmations, vision board, and daily motivation content, Gratitude provides you with all the tools and reminders you need to gain motivation and develop a healthy self-love routine in your life.\n\nTo live a happy and fulfilling life, it is important for us to have good mental health and a strong sense of self-love.\n\nAnd, as the app is completely private, you can always be assured that your precious journal entries, affirmations, and vision board are for your eyes only.\n\nHere are the tools that you will find in the Gratitude app:\n\n1. GRATITUDE JOURNAL\n\nA gratitude journal or diary opens up your eyes to reflect on all the little blessings in your life.\n\nIn daily life, we can lose sight of what we are fortunate to have and by keeping a journal you can slowly and steadily shift your perspective to focus on what is good in your life.\n\nThe Gratitude app will send you reminders with prompts to help you build the habit of journaling.\n\nYou can also add photos to your journal entries, build a gratitude journal streak, and access hundreds of journal prompts.\n\n2. POSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS\n\nIf you’ve heard about manifestation or the law of attraction, you’ve probably heard about affirmations.\n\nPositive daily affirmations change our self-talk to focus on more loving and kind thoughts towards ourselves.\n\nThey give us the motivation we need to keep moving forward and believe in ourselves.\n\nThe Gratitude app has hundreds of affirmations that you can listen to or read, as per your need.\n\nYou can also write your own affirmations, add music, and record your voice to them.\n\nPositive affirmations are a dearly loved tool and with this affirmations app, it is very easy for you to practice them.\n\n3. CREATE VISION BOARDS\n\nAnother super popular manifestation tool is a vision board, also called a dream board. The vision board serves as a collage of your dreams and goals in the form of photos, quotes, and affirmations.\n\nIn the Gratitude app, we’ll help you make a great vision board using sections, goal ideas, and create a video of all your goals together with music. You can also make multiple vision boards!\n\n4. DAILY ZEN\n\nWe understand the need for motivation and inspiration as you build a healthy routine with these self-help tools, which is why Daily Zen is an important part of the app.\n\nHere, you will find gratitude quotes, motivation quotes, thought switch ideas, thank you cards, affirmations, blog articles, and real-life stories of people who changed their mindset with gratitude.\n\n5. MINDFUL MINUTES\n\nWe define the Mindful minutes as the time that you spend in the Gratitude app. You can view the mindful minutes under 'All Health Data' section in the Health app provided by Apple. Currently, the app does not read any data from the health app. We don't write any data in the health app without your consent. You can turn on the mindful minutes from the profile & settings in the Gratitude app.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.notion.so/Gratitude-App-Privacy-Policy-40195d1e9f51499c82dc8f7d06ab2a1c\nTerms of Use: https://medium.com/@priteshsankhe/terms-and-conditions-c7a676f5d884"

Or build your own community among your family, friends, and classmates.\n\nAt the heart of over 7500 gym chains in over 80 countries, Myzone is a unique wearable fitness brand that rewards effort rather than ability. It's the secret to motivating anyone to feel good about exercise.\n\nThe Myzone app uses inclusive, game-based mechanics and social elements to prove time and time again that we're stronger together. When combined with a Myzone heart rate monitor, the app creates personalised zones, based on your maximum heart rate, which means anyone can compete together on a level playing field.\n\nWhat is Myzone?\n\n▶ FEEL GOOD INSIDE AND OUT\nMyzone develops accurate wearable technology, providing engaging and motivational experiences that support lifestyle changes to make exercise habits stick. \n\n▶ JOIN THE COMMUNITY OR BUILD YOUR OWN\nMyzone is used by 1.8 million people around the world at home, outdoors and in our partner gyms such as Snap Fitness, LA Fitness, Bannatyne Health Club, Fitness First, Anytime Fitness, and UFC GYM.\n\n▶ USE IT YOUR WAY\nMyzone connects through analogue, ANT+ and Bluetooth with gym equipment, and Apple Watch. Myzone integrates with Apple Health to save your workout data and biometrics such as weight, BMI, and BMR. It also integrates with third-party apps such as MapMyRun, Strava, and MyFitnessPal.\n\nMyzone integrates with many other platforms, including Apple Health. If you grant permission, we will save your activity calories, height, weight, BMI, BMR and body fat data to Apple Health.\n\n▶ THE MOST ACCURATE TRACKERS \nMyzone heart rate monitors let you know the exact level that you're working out at, in real time. The heart rate monitoring system features electrocardiography (ECG) measurement that's accurate up to 99.4%, as used by health professionals. The MZ-Switch combines an ECG sensor with a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor to create the world's first interchangeable heart rate monitor for the gym, outdoors or in water.\n\n▶ LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD\nMyzone rewards effort over ability. Each device automatically updates how it records your effort, every time you progress through your goals. The five tailored effort zones make heart rate training easy to understand. Each zone is a percentage of your maximum heart rate, meaning that athletes and fitness newbies can exercise together to earn MEPs (Myzone Effort Points). \n\n▶ WORLD-CLASS WORKOUTS\nMyzone means you can take part in live classes with real studio buzz, wherever you are. Exclusive to the Myzone app, MZ-Remote is the world's first virtual live group workout where participants can connect and exercise together, while receiving real-time biometric feedback and personalised coaching from a trainer.\n\n▶ LOVED BY THE EXPERTS\nMyzone has been featured and reviewed by international journalists from publications such as Men's Fitness, Men's Health, Women's Health, The Huffington Post, GQ, T3, Wired and Esquire for over 10 years.\n\nFor more information on how you can join the Myzone community visit www.myzone.org"

It's trusted in most religions, but anyone can use its benefits.\n\nUnlike popular new fads, intermittent fasting makes your body work precisely as it was designed by mother nature. It helps lose and control your weight and reinstating normal processes in your body that you’ve lost due to frequent eating.\n\nEven shorter fasting periods (12 hours or more) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and lower the risk of metabolic diseases.\n\nJust remember: IF is not a diet, fad or quick fix.

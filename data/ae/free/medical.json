The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

For those who have more than one child, one smartphone can now connect with multiple iThermonitor sensors.\n\n24/7 MONITORING - Connecting with the iThermonitor sensor, this app collects temperature data every 4 seconds and develops a temperature chart.\nHIGH TEMPERATURE ALERT – The app captures your child’s abnormal temperature in real time so that you can take necessary actions immediately.   \nDATA ANALYSIS - Professional data analysis of body temperatures through collaboration with Boston Children’s Hospital, affiliated hospital of Harvard Medical School.\nFEVER TIPS- Free access to the Fever Management Information framework – Thermia, licensed from Boston Children’s Hospital, the #1 pediatric hospital in the US.\nANYWHERE, ANYTIME – For parents and grandparents, wherever you are, you can always monitor your children’s temperature.\n\niThermonitor has integrated with the Health App and you can sync body temperature data to the Health app (requires iOS8).\n\nPurchase on Amazon: http://t.cn/RwBpOPy\nWebsite: http://en.raiing.com/\nFeedback: support@raiing.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/iThermonitor/282296251955418\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/RaiingMed"

Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

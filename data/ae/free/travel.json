Think of it as a digital SIM card. Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\n.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM. The advantage is that you no longer need a fiddly, easily lost old-school plastic SIM card that you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIMs are a true technological revolution and we bring them right into your eSIM-compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or paying for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your existing phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store over time.  Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find a regularly updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link:\nhttps://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who travels - it doesn't matter whether you're on a boat, a plane, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries. We’re here to provide you with instant connectivity and solve your travel connectivity problems.\n\n\nWhy use Airalo?\n* No more huge data roaming fees\n* Installation in just a couple of minutes\n* Easy top-ups, wherever you are\n* Keep your existing number while traveling \n* No more fiddling with pins and paperclips to change SIMs\n* No need to carry a bulky WiFi dongle around\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n* Step 1: Install the Airalo app\n\n* Step 2: Find an eSIM for your destination\n(Airalo has eSIMs for over 190+ countries and regions and we're working 24/7 to expand our coverage.)\n\n* Step 3: Purchase & install your eSIM\nThere are three ways to install your eSIM; most can be installed directly, if this isn’t possible you can use a QR code or install it manually. \n\n* Step 4: Enjoy connectivity whenever you are!\n\nWhy do we love eSIM?\n\n* You aren’t disconnected during transit. With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fiddly hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things simpler for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top-up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees.\n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device. That gives you the freedom to purchase your eSIMs ahead of time and simply activate them on arrival.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n---\n\nVisit airalo.com for more information.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/privacy-policy\nTerms & Conditions: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/terms-conditions"

      "label": "Silicon Valley’s new success story, inDrive is a free ride-hailing app available in more than 700 cities in 47 countries. We are growing fast by putting the power back in the hands of people.\n\ninDrive first emerged as a taxi alternative — a mobility app where affordable rides for passengers would still mean well-paid rides for drivers. \n \nBut now, there’s so much more to it. You can use inDrive to travel to other cities, send and receive packages, book a truck for your personal or business needs, and even hire a local pro to help you with whatever you need. You can also sign up as a driver, courier, or tasker.\n\nThe main idea is the same for all services: A fair price is the one you agree on — not hope for. inDrive exists to prove that people can always come to an agreement. \n\nWhat We Offer\nCITY RIDES\nAffordable everyday rides with no surge pricing. You get to set the fare and choose your ride based on the driver’s price offer, rating, number of completed rides, car model, and pickup time.\n\nINTERCITY RIDES\nA safe and convenient way to travel between cities. Specify your destination, pickup date, time and location, offer your fare and request a ride. \n\nCOURIER SERVICES\nThis door-to-door on-demand delivery service is a fast and safe way to send and receive packages of up to 20 kilos. Offer your fare ​​and track your delivery in real-time.\n\nFREIGHT SERVICES\nBook a truck for your delivery and moving needs. Set the time and the fare and specify any extra details in the comments. Wait for the offers to roll in and choose the one that works best for you.\n\nPROFESSIONAL SERVICES\nFrom home improvement to tutoring and beauty care services. Describe your task, name your price and get skilled help from local pros you can trust.\n\nWhy choose inDrive\nQUICK AND EASY\nIt's simple and fast to request an affordable ride — just enter points \"A\" and \"B\" in the app, name the fare you are willing to pay, and choose your driver.\n\nOFFER YOUR FARE\ninDrive provides you with a tailored, surge-free ride-hailing experience. Here you, and not the algorithm, decide on the fare and choose the driver. We do not set the pricing according to time and mileage like other services. You agree on a win-win price with the driver before the ride starts.\n\nCHOOSE YOUR DRIVER\ninDrive lets you choose your driver from a list of the drivers who accepted your ride request. Pick them based on the best deal, arrival time, driver's rating, number of completed trips, and even a car model.\n\nSTAY SAFE\nSee the driver's name, car model, license plate number, and the number of previously completed trips before accepting the ride. During your trip, you can share the driver's information and the real-time location of the car with your family or friends using the \"Share Your Ride\" button. Your real-time geolocation can be shared via messengers, social networks, e-mail, or SMS Text. All of that is there to make your experience safe & trusted. We're continuously adding new safety features to the app to make sure both riders and drivers can enjoy 100% safe rides.\n\nADD TRAVEL OPTIONS\nDo you have specific requirements? Specify travel add-ons — SUV, extra stops on the way, a child seat, or accommodating special needs. You can write your specific needs or any other details in the comments field like \"traveling with my pet,\" “I have luggage,\" etc.\n\nSIGN UP AS A DRIVER & MAKE EXTRA MONEY\nIf you have a car, inDrive provides an excellent opportunity to make extra money. Set your schedule and enjoy complete transparency with inDrive. See your passenger's drop-off location and fare before accepting the ride request. If the passenger’s price doesn’t seem enough, you can always offer your fare or skip the rides you don’t like with no penalties.\nBest of all, low-to-no service rates mean you make more money driving with inDrive!\n\nWe can't wait for you to experience it. Install the app and let’s ride!"

Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes.

Ride taxis the smart way!\n\nMultiple destinations, one route\n\nThe Yango taxi app makes everyday life easier. Like picking the kids up from school, dropping a friend off at a market, and doing some quick shopping on the way.

That makes it even easier to ride a taxi.\n\nOrder for someone else\n\nYango lets you order friends and loved ones a ride by taxi. Get your mother to a doctor’s appointment with a taxi order. Send a taxi online to pick up your special someone. Or get each of your friends a ride home after a night out. You can order up to 3 cars at once.\n\nTell your friends about the Yango taxi app and get discounts\n\nYou can get discounts for your rides by inviting friends to use the Yango app. Share your personal promo code with them and receive bonuses when they take their first ride.

      "label": "Yandex Go is an app to request rides, order food from restaurants or send items across town. Request a ride or delivery with just a tap and track your driver in real time. Never waste time again with another call center or parking problem.\n\n• AFFORDABLE FARES\nChoose a service class for any occasion. Ride Economy for everyday errands, treat yourself to Comfort and Comfort+ to relax in a more spacious car, or go with Business when every detail counts. Use Delivery to ship items of any size by car. Fares and available service classes vary by location, but we always show the exact price (or a fair estimate) before you request a ride.\n\n• PAY BY CARD OR CASH\nYou can pay for rides automatically if you add your card in the app, but drivers also accept cash. Payment method availability may vary depending on location.\n\n• A SMART APP THAT SAVES YOU TIME\nYandex Go uses smart algorithms built on live traffic data to connect riders with drivers who can reach them fastest. Depending on your location, the app will also suggest alternative pickup points to help lower your fare.\n\n• RIDES WITH MULTIPLE STOPS\nRequest a ride with multiple destinations, like if you’re dropping your kids off at school, picking up a friend on the way, or need to run a quick errand. Yandex Go maps all your stops on one route and calculates the fare for the entire trip upfront.\n\n• CHILD SAFETY SEATS\nChoose the Kids service class to ride safely with your child in a safety or booster seat.\nCurrently available in the capitals of Armenia, Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan, as well as 169 cities across Russia.\n\n• FOOD FROM RESTAURANTS\nOrder food from local cafes and restaurants. Just enter your address and we’ll show you everything that’s available nearby. Narrow down your search with filters and find your favorites or try something new. Currently available in Russia and Kazakhstan.\n\n• SCOOTERS\nScooters are back in Krasnodar!\nFind them in the Yandex Go app. We added the Fixed rate and an in-app Navigator for rides to a specific address with upfront pricing.\nRent up to 3 scooters on the same account.\nIf you have Yandex Plus, subscribe to Scooters and get free starts in all rates and free wait time during rides. The first month of subscription is ₽0.\n\n• FAMILY ACCOUNT\nYou can open a family account in Yandex Go. Family accounts are a great way to take care of your whole family and pay for their taxi rides. A single family account can have 4 members all using the same bank card. The family account can also be used to pay for orders in lots of different Yandex services, not just Taxi. Family members can share their location during rides, and the account owner can set limits and view the order history.\n\n• AVAILABLE IN 10 COUNTRIES\nRussia, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Lithuania, Serbia and Moldova. Visit https://taxi.yandex.com to see rates and availability in your city.\n\nIf you’d like to share your opinion about our app, a driver or company that handled your ride, please send us feedback in the app."

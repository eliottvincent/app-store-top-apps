A mysterious sea creature has been seen lurking inside. If the park is to open on time, you have to help Freddi Fish and Luther find the clues, solve the puzzles, and get to the bottom of this watery predicament. \n\n—User Reviews— \n“Highly recommended--and not just for children--for anyone who loves old-fashioned, point-and-click, mouse-controlled adventure games with beautiful animation. If you have never before tried any of the Humongous products, then you are in for a pleasant surprise, and you may find yourself sneaking to the computer once your child is sound asleep.” \n\n“I played with Clare for a lot of this game, not because she needed me to, but because we both wanted to. At 8 years old she would certainly be in the top end of the target audience, and my input into what to do next was negligible. She was able to work her way through all the conundrums, with only the occasional nudge. She thought that the game was \"just right\" as far as the challenges were concerned.”\n\n“This adventure game provides kids with plenty of opportunities to develop problem-solving skills as they sleuth their way through a colorful underwater world.”\n\nFEATURES:\n• New locations and puzzles each time you play! \n• Packed with puzzles, games and activities! \n• Find the clues and collect the tools to solve the mystery!\n\nThis product uses ScummVM which is released under the GNU GPL v2. \nFor more information, please visit - https://www.scummvm.org \nThe GNU GPL can be viewed here - https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html"

      "label": "NOTE: Remastered version from the PC version. A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English.

      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out \"Papa's Freezeria HD\" for iPad!"

      "label": "Papa's Burgeria is now available to play on the go, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.  Grill, stack, and serve burgers in a brand-new way!  \r\n\r\nYou're left in charge of Papa Louie's famous Burgeria, where you'll learn to take orders, grill patties, add toppings, and serve burgers to all of your crazy customers.  You need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls that feel just right in the palm of your hand: Head to the Order Station to keep an eye out for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Grill Station to drag patties onto the grill and flip burgers to cook them evenly.  Jump to the Build Station to carefully craft your sandwiches with toppings and sauces exactly how they ordered, and deliver the finished burger to earn points and tips!\r\n\r\nEach Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the burger-building process.  With full multi-touch support, the process is more fun than ever before!  Tap many burgers at once to flip them all on the grill, or keep one finger on the Build Station's bin slider for even better precision when building.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up. As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Burgeria!  Papa's Burgeria To Go also features unlockable toppings that aren't available in previous versions!\r\n\r\n**NEW FOR PAPA'S BURGERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  Use buttons in the top corners to switch Order Tickets without having to drag them back and forth.  You can also view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nGRILL STATION - We've made keeping track of your burgers easier than ever, with Timers stuck in each burger patty that you can read at a glance, showing the cooking time and how each side is cooked.  You can also buy Alarms in the Shop to add onto each Timer, so you'll get an alert when it's time to flip or remove a burger.  With multi-touch support, you can quickly flip and remove burgers by using multiple fingers.  Try a triple-tap to flip three patties in a row!\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - With a traditional drag-and-drop system, your finger would block your view, so we've completely changed the Build Station to work on smaller screens.  You'll swipe a carousel of Topping Bins across the top of the screen, and slide it carefully to line up toppings with the burger below.  Simply tap on the bottom of the screen to drop a topping from the bin above!  You can also tap a button to swap your Topping Bins with Burger Bins, which hold all of the patties you've cooked on the grill.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the bottom of the screen, so stacking burgers is a breeze!\r\n\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on burger shop game in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between grilling, stacking, and serving\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- Over 60 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- Over 50 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out the original \"Papa's Burgeria\" for iPad!"

Play the role of a monarch atop their steed and recruit loyal subjects, build your kingdom and protect it from the greedy creatures looking to steal your coins and crown. \r\n\r\nIn the brand-new campaign mode, monarchs must now work to build a kingdom that stands over time until finding a way to defeat the Greed for good. Explore the environments to discover new mounts and secrets hidden in the deep. \r\n\r\nBut you don’t have to rule alone! Introducing cooperative play to Kingdom Two Crowns, monarchs can now choose between a solo experience or seek the assistance of a friend, working together locally in classic split screen while sitting next to your fellow monarch, or even across from them on opposite sides of the device in the custom mobile feature of tabletop coop.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the traditional medieval setting, Kingdom Two Crowns also includes: \r\n\r\n• Dead Lands: Enter the dark lands of Kingdom. Play as unique monarchs, including the Shardbinder Miriam, with powerful traits from the gothic horror action-RPG Bloodstained. Ride the gigantic beetle steed to lay out traps, the eerie undead mount that summons barriers impeding the progress of the Greed, and from Bloodstained the mythic demon horse “Gamigin” with its powerful charge attack. Building your Kingdom has never been spookier!\r\n\r\n• Shogun: Journey to lands inspired by the architecture and culture of feudal Japan. Play as the mighty Shogun or Onna-bugeisha, enlist the support of the ninja, lead your soldiers to battle atop the mythological Kirin, and form new strategies as you brave the Greed hiding in the thick bamboo forests.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to keep the feeling of exploration, discovery, and strategy alive in Kingdom Two Crowns in post-release updates with more themed settings, each with unique styles that marvel the eye while changing how you rule the lands.\r\n\r\nA challenge awaits all who seek it here, whether you are a first-time ruler or a long-time fan. So be brave, great monarchs, for in the end Two Crowns shall reign stronger than one!"

The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift).

      "label": "НЛП Радуга — это одна из игр Нового кода, которая приведет Вас в высокопродуктивное состояние и перезагрузит Ваш мозг!\n\nФУНКЦИИ ПРИЛОЖЕНИЯ:\n► Самый большой выбор настроек \n► Можно выбрать Хлопки, Прыжки, Нажатия на экран или Все вместе\n►  Настройка скорости игры с точностью до 0.01 секунды! \n► Классическая игра + Игра с проверкой заданий\n ► Статистика всех игр\n►  Сортировка игр по дате и результату \n► Различное начертание слов, размер шрифта и расположение на экране \n► Можно менять цвет фона и 12 игровых цветов\n ► Настройки фоновой мелодии, звуков начала, окончания игры и смены заданий\n► Удобная помощь \n► Оперативная техподдержка по электронной почте\n\nИгра «Радуга» использует известный в психологии «Эффект Струпа»:  когда цвет слова не совпадает с написанным, прочитать его становится труднее. \n Благодаря этому эффекту, а также различным настройкам игры:\n►  в работу включаются оба полушария мозга\n ►  повышается скорости реакции \n►  усиливается концентрация внимания\n►  включается параллельный процессинг —  умение выполнять сразу несколько действий одновременно.\n\n  Все это способствует переходу в высокопродуктивное состояние (high performance state, HPS), при котором мозг начинает работать более эффективно, гораздо быстрее решая сложные задачи.  \n\nИгры Нового кода — это своеобразная разминка для мозга перед началом работы (как разминка перед спортом). Тысячи людей и компаний используют их по всему миру.  \n\nПРАВИЛА ИГРЫ \nНа экране появляется слово, обозначающее цвет, например: написано слово \"синий\". Нужно произнести вслух цвет слова. Например, если слово \"синий\" написано зеленым цветом, то мы говорим вслух \"зеленый\".\n\nПомимо слов-цветов, в игре могут появляться другие слова (в зависимости от выбранных настроек): ХЛОПКИ, НАЖАТИЯ НА ЭКРАН, ПРЫЖКИ или ВСЕ ВМЕСТЕ.  Это делает игру очень увлекательной и в то же время заставляет мозг работать более усердно!\n\n ВРЕМЯ ИГРЫ \nОбычно продолжительность игры — 10-15 минут. Для перехода в состояние высокой продуктивности большинству людей этого времени хватает. \nЧтобы учесть все запросы пользователей, мы предусмотрели время игры от 1 до 20 минут. Его можно менять в любое время в Настройках игры.\n\n  ПРОВЕРКА ЗАДАНИЙ \nХотя классический вариант игры не предусматривает проверку заданий, достаточно просто играть в течении 10-15 минут. Однако по запросам пользователей мы добавили данную функцию. Ее можно включить/отключить в Настройках игры. Если выбрана игра с проверкой заданий, то в конце игры ведется подсчёт правильных ответов.\n\n  СТАТИСТИКА \nВ игре предусмотрена статистика — можно отслеживать даты всех игр, время и скорость каждой игры, а также результат. Игры можно отсортировать по дате или результату, а также очищать статистику в случае необходимости.  \n\nНАСТРОЙКИ ИГРЫ \nВ игре предусмотрен самый большой выбор настроек: \n- Время игры\n- Скорость игры с точность до 0.01 секунды! Можно настроить 0.84 или 0.87 секунд для продвинутых пользователей. \n- Проверка заданий (вкл/ выкл) \n- Цвета букв: 12 цветов\n - Начертание букв: прописные, строчные или случайные \n- Размер букв \n- Подложка для букв \n- Расположение слов на экране - случайное или по центру \n- Использовать: ХЛОПКИ, НАЖАТИЯ, ПРЫЖКИ или ВСЕ ВМЕСТЕ\n - Частота хлопков/прыжков/нажатий \n- Частота совпадения цвета и названия \n- Настроить фразу в конце игры\n- Большой выбор фоновых мелодий и звуков: звука начала и окончаний игры, звук смены заданий\n\nЖелаем Вам увлекательной игры, быстрого перехода в высокопродуктивное состояние и оперативного решения необходимых задач!\n\nЕсли у Вас возникли вопросы и пожелания, Вы можете написать нам, нажав на кнопку \"Задать вопрос\" в приложении. Мы постараемся ответить как можно быстрее!"

Under her rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This Alliance will seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance’s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.\n\nMeanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright.\n\nThe stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately take root."

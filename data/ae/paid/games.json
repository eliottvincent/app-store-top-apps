      "label": "Things get messy when you’re stuck running a wildly popular pizza parlor in Papa’s Pizzeria To Go! Top, bake, and serve pizzas in this award-winning game that’s reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.\n\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the pizzeria, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Topping Station to add a variety of toppings to each pizza.  Move to the Bake Station to cook the pizzas in the oven until they're baked just right.  Jump to the Cutting Station to cut the pizza into perfect slices.  Each station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the pizza-building process.\n\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Pizzeria!  A well-crafted pizza also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\n\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S PIZZERIA TO GO **\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers don't get in the way of the action!\n\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\n\nTOPPING STATION - We've completely redesigned the Topping Station for smaller screens.  Bins of toppings can be scrolled with your thumb, which allows us to have many more toppings than in the original game.  Tap on a bin to select that topping, then tap multiple times on the pizza to add items directly onto the pizza.  You don't need to drag individual toppings onto the pizza, so you can top faster than ever!  A quick swipe on the pizza will send it off the to the Bake Station.\n\nBAKE STATION - Papa Louie's coal-fired oven gets an upgrade!  You can buy new Oven Alarms in the Shop to help you keep track of pizzas in the oven.  Simply drag an alarm onto one of the oven timers, and you'll hear an alert when that pizza is cooked just right.  Buy new Oven Boosters to cook your pizzas even faster than before!\n\nCUTTING STATION - When it's time to cut pizzas, simply touch and drag a line across the pizza to decide where to cut.  If you want even more control to fine-tune your slices, you can also cut using multi-touch!  Use two fingers or thumbs to move each end of the line at the same time, and release to slice your pizza.  If you're having trouble cutting pizzas at the right angle, buy a variety of Cutting Guides in the Shop to cut that perfect slice!\n\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients which can't be found in the original Papa's Pizzeria.  As you play the game, you'll unlock 26 unique ingredients to serve your customers!\n\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR LOBBY - You can spend your hard-earned tips in the Shop, where you can find a variety of posters, furniture, and wallpaper styles for your lobby!  Use the brand-new Lobby tool to add items to your restaurant, and move and arrange them however you like!  Choose from over 140 customization items, and every item you add to the lobby will improve your Waiting Score for your customers!\n\nUPDATED FEATURES - Serve picky closers at the end of the day, earn paychecks as you play, and try to please the finicky Food Critic to earn a Blue Ribbon!\n\n**GAME FEATURES**\n\nHands-on pizza shop in the Papa Louie universe\nAll new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\nMulti-task between topping, baking, and cutting\nShop to buy upgrades, furniture, and posters using your in-game tips\nNew Lobby Editor to customize and decorate your shop\n90 customers to unlock with unique orders\nChallenging Closers and Food Critic\n75 in-game achievements to earn\n\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens."

Lovecraft stories, fighting cultists and all kinds of monsters from the Mythos, improving your weapons and gear, solving puzzles and challenges, and looking for clues and knowledge to defeat the Great Old Ones and the Outer Gods.\n\nLIVE H.P. LOVECRAFT’S STORIES\n\nLovecraft’s Untold Stories is based on H.P. Lovecraft’s stories. You will experience first-hand the cosmic horror created by the genius of Providence. Every character will go through an investigation that will take them through different locations, from the creepy old Victorian mansion to the abandoned hospital where forbidden experiments take place or the jungle where lost tribes celebrate forgotten rituals, just to name a few. Levels are randomly generated: it will be a different experience every time you play. Also, they vary depending on the character you’re playing with. Look for items and clues to unlock secrets and new stories.\n\n5 CHARACTERS, 5 WAYS OF FIGHTING THE MYTHOS\n\nYou can play as 5 different characters, each with a different playstyle and storyline. A private detective, a witch, a thief, a professor, and even a ghoul—each with different stats, weapons, and combat moves, creating five entirely different gameplay experiences. The Detective offers a balanced playstyle, with average Health and Stamina. The Professor is a specialist in ranged combat, with less Health and a special shield granted by his weapon, the Tillinghast. The Witch does a lot of damage, has teleport abilities and elemental shields of fire and ice, but also a very low Health. The Thief is a specialist in melée combat that takes advantage of its stealth to maximize her damage. The ghoul does a lot of melée damage, has a high Health and regenerates itself, but can’t use medkits at all.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n* Fight hundreds of different monsters from the Cthulhu Mythos in this intense action roguelite \nExplore Lovecraft’s stories: every character has a storyline that crosses randomly generated levels set in different locations from Lovecraft’s stories, such as the hospital, the jungle, or the port city just to name a few\n\n* Face the Great Old Ones: Great Cthulhu, Nyarlathotep, Dagon, Shub-Niggurath, and Azathoth await you in special levels\n\n* Investigate thoroughly: explore every corner to find secret levels and knowledge about the Great Old Ones\n\n* Learn about the Mythos to fight them: to have a chance at fighting the Great Old Ones you need to acquire knowledge about them or their mere presence will drive you insane\n\n* Madness awaits: in the course of your adventures you will have to make some decisions, and taking the wrong ones will shake your sanity. If it gets too low, you will start losing your mind – and if you go mad you will take your own life to escape the horror \n\n* Pick your hero: Choose between 5 different characters, the detective, the thief, the professor, the witch, and the ghoul\n\n* Different playstyles: every investigator has a different combat style and skills, but levels also vary depending on who you’re playing them with – so the gameplay experience is totally different\n\n* Collect and improve weapons, items, and artefacts. Each character has a set of weapons and items, and there are hundreds of other items you can find and use!\n\n* Look for clues and special items to unlock secrets and new stories"

      "label": "Shattered Pixel Dungeon is a traditional roguelike dungeon crawler RPG that's simple to get into but hard to master! Every game is a unique challenge, with four different heroes, randomized levels and enemies, and hundreds of items to collect and use. ShatteredPD is also updated once every two or three months, so there's always something new.\n\n◀ Choose Your Hero ▶\nEach of ShatteredPD's four playable heroes has their own unique mechanics and gameplay style. Smash some heads as the durable Warrior, fry your enemies as the arcane Mage, or use terrain to your advantage as the stealthy Rogue or the markswoman Huntress!\n\nAs you progress through the dungeon you'll earn points to spend on talents, choose a subclass, and gain powerful lategame abilities. You can turn the Warrior into a combo-building Gladiator, the Mage into a soul-sucking Warlock, the Huntress into a tanky Warden, or explore loads of other possibilities!\n\n◀ Explore the Dungeon ▶\nShatteredPD's dungeon is procedurally generated with random layouts, room types, items, traps, and enemies. In each game you'll find equipment and collect or craft consumable items to power you up or help you out in a pinch. There is a huge variety to what you might see from run to run and region to region.\n\nAs you progress through the dungeon you'll find equipment that can be enchanted, upgraded, and augmented as you outfit your hero. Set foes ablaze with an enchanted weapon, wade through enemies with upgraded armor, or gain powerful damage, defensive, or utility benefits from one of the many wands, rings, or magical artifacts.\n\n◀ Succeed or Die Trying ▶\nThe Dungeon is filled with enemies, traps, hazards, and bosses intent on ending your run! Battle hostile wildlife in the sewers and caves, mad thieves and guards in the prison, occult servants in the fallen dwarven city, and maybe something even worse further down...\n\nAll these hazards can make the game quite tough, but don't be discouraged! You probably won't win on your first try, but there are many tricks and strategies to discover and learn on the path to getting your first win!\n\n◀ Almost A Decade in the Making ▶\nShattered Pixel Dungeon is an open source game based on the source code of Pixel Dungeon by Watabou (first released in 2013). It started in 2014 as a project to rebalance Pixel Dungeon but has steadily grown into its own game over the last 8 years!\n\nFeatures Include:\n• 4 Heroes, each with 2 subclasses, 3 endgame abilities, and over 25 talents.\n• Over 250 items including equipment, consumables, and items crafted via alchemy.\n• 5 dungeon regions, 26 floors, over 100 room types, and trillions of possible floor layouts.\n• Over 60 enemy types, 30 traps, and 5 detailed bosses to test your skills.\n• 9 optional challenges and over 100 achievements for completionists.\n• Interface modes for large and small screens, and support for multiple input types.\n• Updates every 2-3 months with new content, fixes, and improvements.\n• Support for many languages thanks to the game's dedicated communities."

      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.

      "label": "Papa's Burgeria is now available to play on the go, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.  Grill, stack, and serve burgers in a brand-new way!  \r\n\r\nYou're left in charge of Papa Louie's famous Burgeria, where you'll learn to take orders, grill patties, add toppings, and serve burgers to all of your crazy customers.  You need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls that feel just right in the palm of your hand: Head to the Order Station to keep an eye out for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Grill Station to drag patties onto the grill and flip burgers to cook them evenly.  Jump to the Build Station to carefully craft your sandwiches with toppings and sauces exactly how they ordered, and deliver the finished burger to earn points and tips!\r\n\r\nEach Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the burger-building process.  With full multi-touch support, the process is more fun than ever before!  Tap many burgers at once to flip them all on the grill, or keep one finger on the Build Station's bin slider for even better precision when building.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up. As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Burgeria!  Papa's Burgeria To Go also features unlockable toppings that aren't available in previous versions!\r\n\r\n**NEW FOR PAPA'S BURGERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  Use buttons in the top corners to switch Order Tickets without having to drag them back and forth.  You can also view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nGRILL STATION - We've made keeping track of your burgers easier than ever, with Timers stuck in each burger patty that you can read at a glance, showing the cooking time and how each side is cooked.  You can also buy Alarms in the Shop to add onto each Timer, so you'll get an alert when it's time to flip or remove a burger.  With multi-touch support, you can quickly flip and remove burgers by using multiple fingers.  Try a triple-tap to flip three patties in a row!\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - With a traditional drag-and-drop system, your finger would block your view, so we've completely changed the Build Station to work on smaller screens.  You'll swipe a carousel of Topping Bins across the top of the screen, and slide it carefully to line up toppings with the burger below.  Simply tap on the bottom of the screen to drop a topping from the bin above!  You can also tap a button to swap your Topping Bins with Burger Bins, which hold all of the patties you've cooked on the grill.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the bottom of the screen, so stacking burgers is a breeze!\r\n\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on burger shop game in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between grilling, stacking, and serving\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- Over 60 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- Over 50 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out the original \"Papa's Burgeria\" for iPad!"

Head to the Order Station to take orders from your wacky customers in the lobby.  Switch to the Batter Station to prep the pans with liners and add just the right amount of batter.  Move to the Bake Station to put the cupcakes into the oven and wait for them to bake.  Jump to the Build Station to add frosting to the cupcakes, and decorate them with a variety of shakers, drizzles, and festive toppers.  Each station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the cupcake-crafting process.\n\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Cupcakeria!

Building upon the award-winning twist on tower defense gameplay and mystery of classic Kingdom, New Lands introduces an abundance of new content to the IGF-nominated title while maintaining the simplicity and depth that legions of monarchs have come to cherish. \n\nTravel to the New Lands and welcome the deluge of new mounts, merchants, and vagrants that call these isles home, but be wary of the new obstacles that threaten your arrival - for not just the greedy creatures block your way, but even the environment itself can defeat you.\n\nBe brave, ruler, and fight to the bitter end, lest these New Lands conquer you instead.\n\n-----\n\n“The fact that it’s far deeper than I could have imagined has easily pushed this into my Best of 2017 list.” -Touch Arcade\n\n“A cryptic, gorgeous, and righteously frustrating way to spend time.” -PC Gamer\n\n“I am in love.” -Destructoid\n\n-----\n\nEXPLORE \n\nTraverse the land on horseback to discover all the wealth, secrets, and unlockables that you can use to your advantage.\n\nRECRUIT\n\nAcross the land, wandering vagrants await your orders. Spend gold to recruit them as loyal subjects to help build and bolster your kingdom.\n\nBUILD\n\nDo you need sturdier walls, or taller sentry towers? Farming plots or bakeries? As the leader of your people, shape and sustain your kingdom as you see fit.\n\nDEFEND\n\nThe wisest of monarchs know that the night brings danger. Make sure you’re safe and well protected from the insidious Greed when the sun sets - if they steal your crown, it’s all over!\n\nSTRATEGIZE\n\nTime and gold are both in limited supply. The army of Greed grows stronger with each passing day. The land, while plentiful, can also be harsh. Will you make the right choices of when and where to devote your resources?"

The game departs its familiar desert setting and delves into the depths of cities infested by zombies. \n\nMULTI-TIERED LEVELS:\nLevels are now multi-tiered! Drive across decayed highway overpasses, via underground tunnels, or smash through epic zombie filled factories. Whichever path you choose to take, you won't be able to escape the zombie hordes - your only choice is to smash through them!\n\nBUILD A ZOMBIE-SLAUGHTERING MACHINE\nUnlock and upgrade 10 different vehicles, including a sports car, a fire truck, and even an ice-cream van. Each vehicle can be equipped with a range of upgrades, such as armored frames, roof-mounted guns, boosters and more. Those zombies will stand no chance.\n\nDESTRUCTIBLE VEHICLES\nVehicles are now fully destructible. Hang on for your life as your vehicle gets smashed to smithereens if you aren't too careful.\n\nMORE ZOMBIES. MORE DESTRUCTION. MORE MAYHEM.\nWhat are you waiting for? That rescue ship isn't going to wait forever! Prepare yourself for a wild ride - and seriously, there is nothing like smashing through zombie-filled factories!"

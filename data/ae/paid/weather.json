      "label": "One of the easiest ways to become a happier person is to experience more sunlight every day. Skylight can help make that happen through a beautiful app experience designed for everyone.\n\nCreate a routine around sunrise every morning. Remind yourself to step out at solar noon for a sun break. Take better photos by shooting during Golden Hour. Start getting outside to see the sunset more. Gain a better sense of sunlight lost and gained through the seasons and adjust your routine to make sure you get enough light. Motivate yourself through the winter months by reminding yourself that days are getting longer. The uses are endless but the goal is the same - better living through more sunlight.\n\nSkylight includes a universal app for iPad and iPhone, an Apple Watch app with complications, and three widgets. The Apple Watch complications show you how much sunlight is left in the day, or when upcoming events like Golden Hour are taking place. The complications are a beautiful addition to the watch face and offer one of the most effective ways to use the app. The Today Widget shows you the app information in a quick, glanceable form, so daylight info is always at your fingertips, either in your Today view or with a 3D Touch on the app icon.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Beautiful fluid visual display showing the position of the sun over time.\n- Comprehensive notifications & alarms for daily and yearly sun events.\n- Three different configurable widgets: Year Graph, Daylight Graph, and Gradient.\n- Apple Watch app and complications with daylight clock and events.\n- Year view, showing the entire year's daily sun events with a simple drag of your finger.\n- Detailed event views, describing each sun event and showing the earliest and latest. dates on which it occurs.\n- Date picker to see sun information from dates in the past or future.\n- Location picker to see sun events and graphs for anywhere on earth.\n- Multiple time modes, including specialized modes for photography and science.\n- Support for all display sizes and device orientations.\n- Spotlight support, so you can just type \"Golden Hour\" from your phone's home screen to pull up today's info.\n- Skylight can optionally use GPS in the background to ensure notifications are correct even if you change location.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nSkylight is an indie app developed by the creators of Magic Window. We strive to make beautiful software that connects people with the world. If you have any issues or questions please contact us at support@jetsoncreative.com."

Data can be shown in its original (raw) format or as fully decoded and easy understandable texts. AeroWeather Pro is helpful for weather preflight-briefings, but also to just get very precise weather. All weather data is cached for offline access. \n\nIn addition to weather data, AeroWeather Pro integrates also airport NOTAMs (provided by US FAA), webcam images around airports (provided by windy.com), FlightService access (US only), and US ATC delay information (provided by US FAA). AeroWeather Pro also offers built-in groups for earthquakes, nearby stations, and today widget (pre iOS14), which can be individually enabled on the top level view. Besides creating user groups it’s also possible to put stations on the same level user groups (e.g. home base). Depending on your needs, groups can be shown or hidden in the main list view. User groups can also be synchronized via Cloud Kit*. \n\nThe app features a built-in airport database, which includes airport data like runways, sunrise/sunset, twilight times, moon times, timezones etc. \n\nMETAR alert notifications** is another new and helpful feature to stay up-to-date. Define multiple alerts for each station with criteria like: flight rule (US NOAA), wind speed, temperature, pressure, present weather, visibility etc. Notifications will be sent to your device if the criteria is met (e.g., when flight rule becomes IFR).\n\nDedicated METAR/TAF** access is optionally available. METAR/TAF data will come primarily from a certified ANSP (air navigation service provider) and is provided reliably and fast from our dedicated, redundant servers (indicated by blue checkmark underneath METAR/TAF).\n\nThe AeroPix feature offers users the possibility to take quickly picture(s) of the weather at their current location. \n\nAeroWeather Pro comes with an Apple Watch app, which shows either a list of stations as defined in the Apple Watch group or all nearby stations based on the current location. METAR and TAF are displayed for each station. In addition, you can put AeroWeather as a complication in your watch face to stay up-to-date. \n\nAn iMessage app is also included which lets you easily send METAR/TAF of any airport to other users.\n\nPlease consult our web-site for a full description of all features. \n\n* Additional functionality which needs to be unlocked (one-time purchase). These purchases are not transferable between Lite, Pro, and Mac.\n\n** SUBSCRIPTIONS\nAdditional features which generate recurring operation costs for us will be offered within a subscription. The following features are enabled while 'First' subscription is active:\n - Dedicated METAR/TAF data source\n - Meteograms\n - Alert push notifications\n - D-ATIS (bigger US airports only)\n - Area Forecast Discussions (currently US only)\n - Home Screen Widgets for METAR, Plot, Meteogram (iOS 14 or higher)\n - Imagery and Charts (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - SIGMETs (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n\nAdditional features are also enabled when using AeroWeather Lite.\n\nThe subscription varies in time periods (1 month, 12 months). The subscription is valid in both AeroWeather Lite and Pro. Cross app subscription support is only available if iCloud (with the same Apple ID) is enabled. Previously purchased unlock features are not affected and will work with or without subscription.\n\nAuto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your account settings. A payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the end of the free trial period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. No commitment - you can cancel any time.\n\nPleas read the full “Subscription Terms of Use” at:\nhttps://www.lakehorn.com/subscription-terms-of-use/"

You've probably heard that the best times to fish are at dawn and dusk, but there's more to it than that. This app can help you consistently catch your limit by giving you the exact times to hit the water!  Click \"...More\" to learn why you should download this App today!\n\n*****  Featured in \"New and Newsworthy\" and \"What's Hot\"  *****\n\n*****\n\"All I can say is I took my two boys out during the time it said.... 2 catfish, 2 brim, 1 small mouth bass. We are not fisherman just a dad and 2 boys\"\n-- David\n\nPlanning a fishing trip? Don't head down to the water before you put Best Fishing Times in your virtual tackle box. Whether you're new to fishing or a seasoned angler, this app helps ensure your success no matter where on Earth you fish. \n\nBest Fishing Times Features Include:\n* Choose a location by Manual Entry, Auto GPS or Select from Map \n* Major & Minor Feeding and Activity Periods \n* Day ratings \n* Activity Index for the day rating \n* Moon rise, Moon set and Moon Transit times \n* Moon Phase Data \n* Sunrise, Sunset and Sun Transit times \n* Day / Weekly view \n* Weather conditions and forecasts (USA)\n* Date selection for checking Solunar data in advance \n* Any Date or Location \n* Check time zone settings \n* Graphical sun and moon simulator \n* Compass \n* Wind forecast for fly fishing (data available for the USA only)\nYou've probably heard the phrase \"Timing is everything\", and those words are especially true for fishing. It's not enough to know where the fish are. If you want to catch them, you have to know when they're going to be biting. \n\nEveryone knows there are certain times of the day or night that fish are more active; and until now, most people have relied on pure luck to get their line in the water during those times. Of course there have always been dedicated anglers who don't believe in luck. They spend hours before a fishing trip checking weather conditions, studying moon phase charts and performing complicated conversions for sun and moon positions, geographical location, time zone changes and other variables. Sound like a lot of work? It doesn't have to be.\n\nNo matter which of these two groups you fall into, Best Fishing Times was designed for you! This app takes luck out of the equation, and eliminates the need for math and charts. Just pick your fishing location and the date you want to fish, and get all the information you could ever want before you even leave home. Whether you're planning for next week or next year, Best Fishing Times will get you to the water at the right time of day to catch your limit.\n\nWith a few taps of your finger, you'll see the best day of any week to go fishing, and the times of day the fish will be most active. If you prefer to check the data yourself, Best Fishing Times puts all of the information right at your fingertips, including moon phase, moon rise and moon set, major and minor activity periods for any day, and even includes a graphical sun and moon simulator!\n\nYou wouldn't go to the ball park without knowing whether or not there's a game scheduled, so why would you go fishing without knowing when the fish are biting? Download Best Fishing Times now and stop casting blindly. You'll spend less time fishing and more time catching."

Tidal information is essential for navigating a shallow waterway or placing your boat at anchor.  The success or failure of a voyage can depend on the height or depth of a tide, while knowledge of current information can save fuel and make passage into a river or channel safer. \n\nTides PRO goes further than the tables provided by the NOAA. The app automatically accounts for correction factors and provides instant information without requesting that you account for time lags, daylight savings conventions, or height differences between the reference stations and the locations you are seeking. \n\nSince the tidal information that is published in this app is not subjected to the use of the voyage, please do not use for navigation."

      "label": "What time is sunset today? Or sunrise tomorrow? When is the \"magic hour\" next March 20 in Paris? With Sol, you can check times and get reminders of solar events, at home or while traveling! Great for everyone looking to plan activities based on sunlight. Use it to remind you to walk the dog before dark, get up with the sun, or find golden hour time for that perfect photo.\n\nSol: Sun Clock is the Swiss-army knife of sunlight tools with a design inspired by the simplicity of the sundial. Use it to plan your day, guide natural sleep cycles, get the best light for outdoor photography, make sure animals or kids are safe inside before dark, or to map out the best times to go running or fishing. \n\n* Be in tune: Sol will tell you when the golden hour is, how much sunlight you have left in the day or what time the next sunrise occurs.\n\n* Look to the future, travel around the world: Sol lets you find sunlight information for any date, anywhere on earth. \n \n* Find solar midnight and solar noon, and all three twilight (dawn and dusk) periods: astronomical twilight, nautical twilight, and civil twilight. Keep tabs on the next solstice and equinox.\n \n* Reminders and Alarms: Use Sol as a natural alarm clock that you can set to any event (like sunset, golden hour or solar noon), and the alarm or reminder time will adjust gradually as the days change with the seasons.\n \n* Automatic Location: Sol not only calculates the amount of daylight and sunrise and sunset times, but does so for any location in the world (both Northern and Southern hemispheres) by using your device's GPS... no network connection required. \n\n* Other locations: Optionally, use the built-in map to choose any location in the world by moving the pin, or search using the name of any city.\n \n* Optional location-aware alarms. Sol knows when you change with your location; and as you travel it will adjust any alarms you set relative to sunrise and sunset times.  Create alarms for multiple locations around the world.\n\n* Detailed almanac information: Useful information about the day's length, sun's azimuth and elevation, equinoxes and solstices, and a friendly glossary that explains all the terms. \n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. However, GPS runs in the background ONLY if you have set location-aware alarms."

Smartphones are able to detect earthquakes thanks to the accelerometer on-board each device. When an earthquake is detected, users with the application installed are immediatly alerted. Since earthquake waves travel at around 5 km/s it is possible to alert the population not yet reached by the damaging waves of the earthquake. For the scientific details about the project please refer to the scientific paper on Frontiers at https://bit.ly/2C8B5HI\n\nSubscriptions:\n\nWhen an earthquake is detected in real time by smartphones near the epicenter, the server sends an alert to all users with the app. Alerting all users can take up to 10 seconds since it is not technically feasible to do so instantly. Now you can join the priority lists of the first 10,000 or 100,000 people alerted in real time. The following subscriptions are available:\n\n- Subscription 10k for 1 year\n- Subscription 10k for 1 month \n\n- Subscription 100k for 1 year\n- Subscription 100k for 1 month \n\n• Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n• Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n\nPrivacy: https://www.sismo.app/privacy\n\nTerms and conditions: https://www.sismo.app/terms-conditions"

What the other apps don't have.\n1) It uses GPS to show your location on the radar.\n2) Oz Radar supports full screen landscape view.\n3) National cloud and synoptic charts.\n4) Local weather and rain forecasts\n5) Rain notifications\n6) BOM weather warning notifications\n\n(But don't believe me, read the reviews)\n***************************** \n\n\nOz weather radar allows you to view the BOM (Bureau of Meteorology) weather radar information located through Australia. Each radar image can be panned and zoomed to get a better look at the area you are interested in. Approximately 50 radars cover a large proportion of Australia to bring you the most up to date weather information. \n\nThe information cycles through the last few images so you can get a good look at what is happening around you.\n\nAll views show the latest feeds directly from the BOM web site.  Dedicated weather watch radars provide the most up to date weather information every 10 minutes and in some cases every 6 minutes. \n\nYou can also view the last 6 hours of satellite cloud imagery that is taken every hour on the National view.  \n\nFeatures not seen in other apps include;\n* Showing YOUR GPS location on the radar map.\n* Listing nearby radars\n* Cached backgrounds for faster loading and less data usage\n* Pinch zoom with drag panning\n* Selection of surrounding radar by direction\n* LANDSCAPE View\n* Animated national weather chart\n* Animated national synoptic chart (The one with the lines ad arrows)\n* Weather readings from hundreds of weather stations.\n* Weather forecasts for all over Australia\n\nNote : This app uses background location to generate alerts of rain in your current area."

Use Radar HD to see what weather is coming your way!  \n\nRadar shows areas of current precipitation or future simulated radar prediction!. A weather radar is used to locate precipitation, calculate its motion, estimate its type (rain, snow, hail, etc.), and forecast its future position and intensity.  Precipitation type is indicated by the color. Green color indicates lesser precipitation while the yellow color code indicates intense precipitations. The color code red is indicative of the most intense precipitations. Blue color indicates snow.\n\nUsing the data from Storm Prediction Center and Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (SPC & GDAC) Radar HD provides information about tropical storms and hurricanes for locations worldwide, areas affected by storms and severe weather, coordinates and wind speed, storm tracks & path projections.\n\nSatellite images provide an excellent view on the clouds in the sky and an indication of the weather over the United states, Europe, Japan, Australia and Indonesia.\nSatellite images come from satellites which remain above a fixed point on the Earth (i.e. they are “geostationary”). Lighter areas of cloud show where the cloud tops are cooler and therefore where weather features like fronts and shower clouds are.\n\nThe app also allows you to check the weather on your favorite places on maps. Interactive map includes live international weather conditions, local weather and time, ten-day forecasts and sunrise/sunset times for multiple places. You can add placemarks on the map to represent your favorite places or the places you’d like to visit. At a glance you can see the time and weather for all of your favorites.\n\n\n\nKey features:\n\n* [NEW] Predictive weather radar \n* [NEW] Simulated radar prediction for the next 60 minutes using five-minute intervals\n* The real time radar images provided by NEXRAD an accurate view of the weather situation in the U.S.\n* Storm / hurricane / typhoon tracker and projected paths (International and Global)\n* All severe weather alerts on interactive map, 126 weather alert types (U.S.)\n* High resolution weather radar. Stunning and sharp images.

It benefits from an interface derived from the “Routing & Navigation” version.\n\nWeather\nGFS model is provided by default.  In addition, over 35 weather and oceanographic models are available with a yearly subscription (in-app purchase). Queries and downloads are fully customizable.\n\nThe application makes it possible to create your own geographical zones and to select the characteristics of the GRIB files to download: choice of data, resolution, periodicity, file size, etc. GRIB files can be downloaded wherever you are from our servers through a regular or satellite internet connection.\n\nWeather4D Routing displays the combined data as layered layers. All the data of a selected model is displayed by an animation in continuous time scrolling or in manual scrolling on the map.\n\nThe weather forecast is displayed in one or two windows (iPad only), offering several display combinations of the same area: navigation and weather, weather and waves or currents, comparison of different models. The two windows can be disassociated for displaying the same area at different scales.\n\nRouting\nWeather4D Routing makes it possible to optimize sailing or engine, or mixed sail-engine routes. From a theoretical route, a routing algorithm will take into account wind force and wave height constraints.  When sailing, the boat polar combined with wind and current forecasts will be used to optimize performance, comfort and safety.\n\nSeveral routes can be displayed to compare the outcome of different options: different forecast patterns, departure dates and times, selected constraint values. The routing can be restarted at any moment during  navigation from the actual position of the boat.\n\nDefault Models and Charts\n————————————\nGFS global forecast model at 0.25 °, 0.5 °, 1 ° and 2 ° resolutions. \nBING global chart\nOSM (Opens Street Map) global chart\n\nOptional Models (in-app purchase):\n———————————————————\nWeather\n--------\nNAM USA    \nGEM Global    \nCOAMPS Europe, West Atlantic, Central America, East Pacific    \nICON-EU Europe    \nARPEGE Global, Europe    \nAROME France, Antilles, Guyane, Polynésie, Calédonie, Indien  \nAROME HD France\nWRF France, Europe, Greece, NW Africa, Azores, Lesser Antilles, Greater Antilles    \n\nWaves\n-------\nMFWAM Global, Europe, France\nFNMOC WW3 Global, Europe\n\nCurrents\n---------\nMyOcean Global, IBI, NWS, Baltic, Med\nNCOM AMSEAS, USEAST, ALASKA, SOCAL, HAWAII"

This includes weather information like clear sky days, hourly angle of the sun throughout the year and more.\n\nIt doesn’t stop there, though. The app generates information on the size of system you’ll need and how many panels would be in it. It also calculates what the size a battery backup would have to be for a proposed system. The app also includes a guide and a glossary where users can get more information.\n\nBasically, it’s like having a solar engineer at your fingertips.\" --cleanenergyauthority.com\n******\nThis is an application for professionals of the photovoltaic/solar panel industry. PV Master is essential to any person in the field who needs relevant information always available. \nWeather you’re a construction company/panel installer or serious DIY enthusiast this app will satisfy all your needs and requirements when it comes to setting up a green energy system. The sun is the future and with this app you can make it happen yourself. \n\nThe application is divided into 5 sections: \nData \nHere you have all the indeces you will ever need * explicitly for your current coordinates * (such as number of clear sky days, insolation incident, hourly solar angle relative to horizon, battery sizing and deficits, frequency of near-overcast skies, frost days average, average wind direction and speed, average monthly precipitation and pressure and much much more). \n\nGuide \nIf you’re a DIY look for home improvement or simply “getting started” in this field, here you will find a general guide with the necessary steps and considerations to be made when setting up a photovoltaic panel system. \n\nPannel Calc \nThe most frequently asked questions we face when looking into the feasability of sun as energy is “how many panels will I need?”. Thanks to this app the big question is easily answered. Gather the data from the first section and your current electricity bills, input the values and you’re done. Then it’s up to you to decide weather you wish to do it or not... \n\nBattery Calc \nIf you’re serious about going green then you definitely have to account for everything. The sun is always there but we all know there are many variables that might disrupt our “fuel”. For this reason we need to also account for batteries and surplus storage to evoid wasting potential energy and also not be “stuck” when during the colder season. Again, just gather data, insert it in the easy fields and you’re down. You know everything about kind, capacity and quantity of batteries you need. \n\nGlossary \nThis is another great section essential for any starter (although even experts will surely learn something form it). A collection of A-Z terms related to this this topic. You can jump to a certain letter if you wish to find something out otherwise just scrolling through it to educate yourself is a great way of spending time. \n\nAdditional Info \nOn startup, the app requests your location and fetches the specific data for the entire first section. This is on actual coordinates, not just state or city...pinpoint! \nEvery successful data fetch gets stored locally (no need to worry about privacy) so that if the next time you open the app there is no internet connection (perhaps you’re “on-site”) you will still have the everything available."

      "label": "50% off for 2 days only!\n\nTo increase independence or just for fun, iDress for Weather provides children and adults, with or without disabilities, the opportunity to make connections between weather conditions and clothing through bold, brightly colored images, a simple swipe, and without the need for reading or math skills. \n\nBy setting individualized temperature ranges (cold to one person is not the same as cold to someone else!) and putting individual clothes in the closets (What's in your closet? You decide!), iDress for Weather is customizable for anyone living in any climate with any personal preferences or needs. As reported by parents and teachers alike, iDress for Weather is a great tool in increasing a child's independence and reducing conflicts in morning routines. \n\nOther optional settings include summer or winter trees, fahrenheit or celsius. Displaying the wind speed and humidity are also optional settings. \n\nHow it Works:\nEveryone experiences temperatures differently based on geography and body functioning. iDress for Weather takes this into account by allowing you to define what is hot, warm, cool, cold, and really cold. \n\nUntil late afternoon, a single swipe to the left will display a closet with clothing to match the forecasted high. In the evening, the closet will display clothing for the overnight low. You decide what goes in each closet. \n\nHow to Customize the Weather Screen:\n*To select fahrenheit or celsius, tap the “i” on bottom left corner of the weather screen and then tap \"Units\".\n*To select a location, tap the “i” on bottom left corner of the weather screen and then tap “Location”.\n*To set temperature levels (strongly recommended), tap the “i” on bottom left corner of the weather screen and then tap \"Temperature Levels\". \n*To show wind and humidity, tap the “i” on bottom left corner of the weather screen and then tap \"Extended Info\". \n*To select winter or summer landscapes, tap the “i” on bottom left corner of the weather screen, then tap \"Tree Season\".  \n\nHow to Customize the Closet:\n* Swipe to left to enter the closet, then tap the “i” in the bottom left corner. You can choose photos from your cameral roll or take a photo. \n\niDress Reviews:\n* Apps4Kids ~ Among the several fun and educational apps we have on board of our devices, there should be always a set of helpful apps such as iDress for Weather. \n* Lockergnome ~ Let’s face it, the concept and mission behind iDress is fantastic. From idea to finished product, it’s clearly a winner with a clearly defined audience. \n\n\nA Word on Assistive Technology:\niDress for Weather was specifically designed to support individuals whose cognitive processing or memory is affected by a disability (such as autism or other developmental disabilities) or has changed due to an injury or illness (such as a traumatic brain injury, stroke, Alzheimer’s Disease, or dementia).  Please see pebroproductions.com for more information. Don’t hesitate to ask questions, give suggestions or share stories about how iDress is being used to increase individual’s independence or learning!\n\nGlobal Use:\nSince iDress for Weather relies on pictures rather than words, it is fully accessible to the global community!"

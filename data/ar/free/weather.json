      "label": "*** AeroWeather: for pilots, aviation enthusiasts, and everyone who is serious about the weather!\n*** Current and precise weather conditions (METAR) and forecasts (TAF).\n\nAeroWeather Lite provides quick and intuitive access to METAR and TAF for airports worldwide. Data can be shown in its original (raw) format or as fully decoded and easy understandable texts. AeroWeather Lite is helpful for weather preflight-briefings, but also to just get very precise weather. All weather data is cached for offline access. There are many settings for units and format of METAR/TAF available.\n\nThe app features a built-in airport database, which includes basic airport data like sunrise/sunset, twilight times, timezones etc. \n\nAeroWeather Lite offers built-in groups for nearby stations, today widget (pre iOS 14), and earthquakes. Depending on your needs, groups can be shown or hidden in the main list view.\n\nMETAR alert notifications** is an helpful feature to stay up-to-date. Define multiple alerts for each station with the following criteria: flight rule (US NOAA), wind speed, temperature, pressure, present weather, visibility, and ceiling (BKN and OVC). Notifications will be sent to your device if the criteria is met (e.g., when wind is greater/equal 10 kts, flight rule becomes IFR).\n\nDedicated METAR/TAF** access is optionally available. METAR/TAF data comes primarily from a certified ANSP (air navigation service provider) and is provided reliably and fast from our dedicated, redundant servers (indicated by blue checkmark underneath METAR/TAF).\n\nThe AeroPix feature offers users the possibility to take quickly picture(s) of the weather at their current location. The pictures will be available to all other pilots (on the map or within an airport detail view) helping them to get a better idea about local conditions. AeroPix should be especially helpful when there's no or insufficient webcam coverage.\n\nThere's also an iMessage app included which lets you easily send METAR/TAF of any airport to other users.\n\nPlease consult our web-site for a full description of all features. In order to keep AeroWeather Lite free we added a small ad banner at the bottom of the screen. Consider getting AeroWeather Pro, subscribe the additional features**, or remove the ad banner through one-time unlock* to have an ad-free app.\n\n\n* Additional functionality which needs to be unlocked (one-time purchase). These purchases are not transferable between Lite, Pro, and Mac.\n\n** SUBSCRIPTIONS\nAdditional features which generate recurring operation costs for us will be offered within a subscription. The following features are enabled while 'First' subscription is active:\n - Dedicated METAR/TAF data source\n - Meteograms\n - Alert push notifications\n - D-ATIS (bigger US airports only)\n - Area Forecast Discussions (currently US only)\n - Home Screen Widgets for METAR, Plot, Meteogram (iOS 14 or higher)\n - Imagery and Charts (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - SIGMETs (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - METAR/TAF from ADS-B receiver thru GDL 90 protocol (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n\nWhen using AeroWeather Lite also the following features are enabled:\n - Remove ad banner\n\nThe subscription varies in time periods (1 month, 12 months). The subscription is valid in both AeroWeather Lite and Pro. Cross app subscription support is only available if iCloud (with the same Apple ID) is enabled. Previously purchased unlock features are not affected and will work with or without subscription.\n\nAuto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your account settings. A payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the end of the free trial period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. No commitment - you can cancel any time.\n\nPleas read the full “Subscription Terms of Use” at:\nhttps://www.lakehorn.com/subscription-terms-of-use/"

      "label": "LuckGrib is a fully featured, easy to use, fast GRIB reader, viewer, downloader and weather router.  Remote access to weather data via satellite or email is supported.  Advanced weather routing capabilities, for sailors, is available.\n\nWeather forecast data, packaged as GRIB files, can be downloaded directly from the LuckGrib server cluster.  \n\nFor offshore sailors, LuckGrib offers a best-in-class, complete solution: industry leading visualization and ease of use, highly optimized weather data downloads via satellite, along with industry leading optimized weather routing and route analysis.  Inshore sailors may not require satellite downloads, but will benefit from the rest of the system.\n\nLuckGrib is unique among apps that were originally designed for sailors, in that the weather analysis tools are powerful enough to attract attention from meteorologitsts.\n\nFor meteorologists, and weather enthusiasts, LuckGrib offers access to a wide range of high resolutions models, a number of global models, weather data at the surface, 850mb, 500mb and 250mb levels, parameters ranging from simple things such as wind, pressure and temperature, to more advanced quantities such as simulated radar, standard deviations, precipitable water, lightning, vertical vorticity, helicity and more.  Access is available to the entire suite of parameters in GFS, HRRR, NAM and others.\n\nDownloads are available via: a direct high speed internet connection, through the Iridium GO! as well as through the RedPort Optimizer.\n\nLuckGrib provides access to many weather and ocean models, including: GFS, GFS Wave, GDPS/GEM, GEFS, HRRR, RAP, NAM, NBM, Icon-EU, Arpège, Arome, OpenWRF, RTOFS, NCOM and many others.  These models allow you to study surface conditions, wave and swell state, ocean currents, winds at the jet stream level, mid atmosphere as well as at the boundary layer.  In addition, LuckGrib allows you to explore weather model uncertainty with its support for standard deviation and probability values.  LuckGrib is a thoroughly modern and advanced GRIB viewer.\n\nSee: luckgrib.com/models for more details on the models and parameters that are available.\n\nLuckGrib comes with a 14 day free trial.  If you are interested in studying weather and gaining access to detailed weather forecasts, download the app and give it a try.\n\nDownloading data via satellite or email requires the Offshore Data in-app purchase.  See offshore.luckgrib.com for more details on the remote access capabilities.\n\nThe LuckGrib weather routing system is an industry leading, high quality, robust, high performance and comprehensive system.  See routing.luckgrib.com for more details.  Access to the isochronal weather routing system requires an in-app purchase.\n\nThe LuckGrib isochronal Weather Routing solver is able to respect intermediate constraint points, the first in the industry.  A constraint point is a point which a route must leave to port or starboard.  Constraint points are needed to describe short routes which have crossings, as well as to express your preference on a long open ocean passage to stay to a given side of a strategic point.  A simple example of a short route that needs this ability is a route which goes around an island, returning to the start point.  Many sailboat race routes, perhaps the majority, have routes which cross.  Two examples are Fastnet and the Around Catalina Island race.  These routes can now be described in LuckGrib, and optimized Weather Routing solutions found for them.\n\nNote that LuckGrib does not use a subscription pricing model - after the free trial, when you decide to purchase the app, there will be a one time charge, not an ongoing subscription.\n\n\nFor more details, please visit the support website.\n\n* privacy policy: https://luckgrib.com/privacy\n* terms of use: https://luckgrib.com/terms-of-use\n* end user license agreement: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

      "label": "The app combines highly accurate weather forecast for your location with a 3D map showing development of weather in a broader area in a very interesting way. This allows you to see where precipitation is going to come from or where the wind is blowing from. The uniqueness of the app comes from the amount of data displayed. Forecast of weather, precipitation, wind, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, snow cover and other meteorological data for different altitudes is available for the whole world. \n\nWIND ANIMATION\nThe Ventusky application solves weather displaying in an interesting way. Wind is displayed using streamlines which clearly portray the continuous development of weather. Airflow on Earth is always in motion and the streamlines depict this motion in an amazing way. This makes the interconnection of all atmospheric phenomena obvious.\n\nWEATHER FORECAST\nWeather forecast for the first three days is available in the app in one-hour steps. For other days, it’s available in three-hour steps. Users can also look up sunrise and sunrise times in a given place or air quality.\n\nWEATHER MODELS\nThanks to the Ventusky application, visitors get data directly from the numerical models that, just a few years ago, were used solely by meteorologists. The app collects data from the most accurate numerical models. Besides the well-known data from the American GFS and HRRR models, it also displays data from the Canadian GEM model and the German ICON model, which is unique thanks to its high resolution for the whole world. Two models, EURAD and USRAD, are based on current radar and satellite readings. These models are able to show precisely current precipitation in US and Europe.\n\nWEATHER FRONTS\nYou can also display weather fronts. We have created a neural network that predicts the positions of cold, warm, occluded, and stationary fronts based on data from weather models. This algorithm is unique, and we are the first on the world who makes global fronts forecast available to users.\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS\n• Temperature (16 levels)\n• Temperature anomaly\n• Perceived temperature\n• Precipitation (1 hour, 3 hour, long time accumulation)\n• Radar\n• Satellite\n• Wind gusts (1 hour, long time maximum)\n• Air quality (AQI, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, O3, dust or CO)\n• Probability of aurora\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS (PREMIUM)\n• Wind (16 levels)\n• Cloud cover (high, middle, low, total)\n• Snow cover (total, new)\n• Humidity (4 layers)\n• Dew point\n• Air pressure\n• CAPE, CIN, LI, Helicity (SRH)\n• Freezing level\n• Wave forecast\n• Ocean currents\n\nLIST OF WEATHER WIDGETS\n• Forecast 4x2\n• Forecast 2x2\n• Forecast 4x4\n• Radar 4x2\n• Radar 2x2\n\nThe app is completely free of ads.

      "label": "Welcome on board to the WindHub app!\nBuilt for mariners by mariners, it displays necessary weather and marine info in a neat and simple way. The detailed map will help to plan cruises, races, or nice fishing. \n\nAccurate forecasts and real-time data includes: \n• atmospheric pressure map with marked highs and lows \n• weather fronts \n• wind and gust forecasts \n• waves info \n• tides and currents \n• rain radar and precise nowcast \n• live wind information from 30000+ weather stations\n\nTop-notch weather data is provided by professionals - official weather forecasting services: NOAA, Meteo-France, Deutscher Wetterdienst, ECMWF and others. High-resolution forecast for Europe and East Asia is calculated by our team.\n\nAnd it’s not just the weather - marinas have contact information so you can call or email the harbor master to book a berth or to ask about amenities.\n\nSpecial treat for sailors and boaters in the US is the option to display nautical charts. It shows water depths, dangers, anchorages, and other features. The provided nautical charts aren’t for navigation purposes.\n\nUsing the app is easy. You can change units, wind speed display (animation or wind barbs), and weather data displayed on the map. Activate “Traffic Saver Mode” if you experience low reception signal. \n\nYou can rely on Windhub to help you make the right decision. \n\nWe are constantly improving the app and adding new features. We’d love to hear your feedback and ideas at windhub@windhub.com.\n\nTerms of Use: https://windhub.com/termsofuse.pdf"

      "label": "New: Full-screen view, lock screen widgets and Apple Watch Ultra support. And widgets are back!\n\nWeathergraph is a beautiful visual hourly weather widget and forecast for Watch, iPhone, iPad, and Mac, with the Apple Watch app and complications.\nPowered by Apple Weather, Foreca, Dark Sky, Open-Meteo, and yr.no/met.no.\n\nIt shows:\n- Nowcast (real-time rain & snow forecast updated every 15 minutes – PRO only)\n- Rain & snow alerts based on nowcast data (PRO, watch-only so far, coming to iPhone and iPad)\n- Hour-by-hour temperature (main colorful line)\n- Hour-by-hour precipitation — rain, and snow (blue chart)\n- Hour-by-hour cloudiness (cloud cover) and sunshine (clouds on top + sun rays)\n- Hour-by-hour wind speed (red line) and direction (red arrows)\n- Hour-by-hour precipitation or dew point (dotted line)\n- Hour-by-hour atmospheric pressure, absolute, or rate of change (purple line or arrows)\n- Hour-by-hour UV index (rainbow dashes)\n- Real day/night (sky color)\n- Daily temperature minimum and maximum (overlaid above chart)\n- Actual temperature and place (on the top)\n- Sunrise and sunset times\n\nWho is Weathergraph for?\n\nHikers, runners, bikers, kite surfers, pilots, and many outdoor enthusiasts around the world love the at-glance readability, customizability, and reliability.\n\nWeathergraph is offline capable. The app caches the last acquired forecast for up to 24 hours, allowing you to hike or run outside the network (or go running or biking with a wifi-only Apple Watch) and still see the most recently fetched data. The data refreshes automatically once a connection is available.\n\nThe hourly forecast is updated every hour, nowcast and rain alerts update every 15 minutes. If rain or snow is expected during the next 3 hours, you will get a notice on a widget (iPhone, iPad & Mac), a large complication (Watch), and a detailed 3-hour precipitation chart in the app.\nNowcast and alerts are powered by Foreca and depend on the precision of rain radars in your area.\n\nYou can unlock professional Apple Weather, Foreca, Open-Meteo, and Dark Sky forecast sources, weather alerts, nowcast, and all styles and options via a reasonably priced subscription, which covers the cost of data and allows me to further improve Weathergraph. One-time Weathergraph Forever unlock is also available.\nThank you for your support!\n\nIf you liked Dark Sky, Weather Line, Weathertron, or Weather Strip, then Weathergraph might be the best replacement :).\n\nPrivacy policy and terms of use:\nhttps://weathergraph.app/privacy\n\nPlease note:\nSubscriptions made on Apple devices will be charged to your credit card through your iTunes account. Your subscription will automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to cancel once activated. Manage or turn off your subscriptions in App Store app > Account > Subscriptions."

      "label": "*** AeroWeather: for pilots, aviation enthusiasts, and everyone who is serious about the weather!\n*** Current and precise weather conditions (METAR) and forecasts (TAF).\n\nAeroWeather Lite provides quick and intuitive access to METAR and TAF for airports worldwide. Data can be shown in its original (raw) format or as fully decoded and easy understandable texts. AeroWeather Lite is helpful for weather preflight-briefings, but also to just get very precise weather. All weather data is cached for offline access. There are many settings for units and format of METAR/TAF available.\n\nThe app features a built-in airport database, which includes basic airport data like sunrise/sunset, twilight times, timezones etc. \n\nAeroWeather Lite offers built-in groups for nearby stations, today widget (pre iOS 14), and earthquakes. Depending on your needs, groups can be shown or hidden in the main list view.\n\nMETAR alert notifications** is an helpful feature to stay up-to-date. Define multiple alerts for each station with the following criteria: flight rule (US NOAA), wind speed, temperature, pressure, present weather, visibility, and ceiling (BKN and OVC). Notifications will be sent to your device if the criteria is met (e.g., when wind is greater/equal 10 kts, flight rule becomes IFR).\n\nDedicated METAR/TAF** access is optionally available. METAR/TAF data comes primarily from a certified ANSP (air navigation service provider) and is provided reliably and fast from our dedicated, redundant servers (indicated by blue checkmark underneath METAR/TAF).\n\nThe AeroPix feature offers users the possibility to take quickly picture(s) of the weather at their current location. The pictures will be available to all other pilots (on the map or within an airport detail view) helping them to get a better idea about local conditions. AeroPix should be especially helpful when there's no or insufficient webcam coverage.\n\nThere's also an iMessage app included which lets you easily send METAR/TAF of any airport to other users.\n\nPlease consult our web-site for a full description of all features. In order to keep AeroWeather Lite free we added a small ad banner at the bottom of the screen. Consider getting AeroWeather Pro, subscribe the additional features**, or remove the ad banner through one-time unlock* to have an ad-free app.\n\n\n* Additional functionality which needs to be unlocked (one-time purchase). These purchases are not transferable between Lite, Pro, and Mac.\n\n** SUBSCRIPTIONS\nAdditional features which generate recurring operation costs for us will be offered within a subscription. The following features are enabled while 'First' subscription is active:\n - Dedicated METAR/TAF data source\n - Meteograms\n - Alert push notifications\n - D-ATIS (bigger US airports only)\n - Area Forecast Discussions (currently US only)\n - Home Screen Widgets for METAR, Plot, Meteogram (iOS 14 or higher)\n - Imagery and Charts (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - SIGMETs (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - METAR/TAF from ADS-B receiver thru GDL 90 protocol (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n\nWhen using AeroWeather Lite also the following features are enabled:\n - Remove ad banner\n\nThe subscription varies in time periods (1 month, 12 months). The subscription is valid in both AeroWeather Lite and Pro. Cross app subscription support is only available if iCloud (with the same Apple ID) is enabled. Previously purchased unlock features are not affected and will work with or without subscription.\n\nAuto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your account settings. A payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the end of the free trial period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. No commitment - you can cancel any time.\n\nPleas read the full “Subscription Terms of Use” at:\nhttps://www.lakehorn.com/subscription-terms-of-use/"

      "label": "Fishing Index - Fishing Weather App is a app that helps fishermen to fishing scientifically and reasonably.\n      Fish activities are related to many weather conditions. The influence of water temperature and atmospheric pressure is most obvious, but the influence of temperature on water temperature is lagging behind and slow, and the change of atmospheric pressure is more intuitive. The higher atmospheric pressure, the higher dissolved oxygen in water, the more active fish activities. Wind speed and direction are also an important factor. The breeze blowing Buddha water surface increases the dissolved oxygen of water. Cold blowing south wind and hot blowing north wind are very beneficial for fishing. Finally, rainfall and humidity also have a certain impact on fishing.\n          According to some research, fish activities are most active in about one hour before and after the moontransit (upper or lower), and are also active within half an hour before and after the Moonrise or Moonset. In addition, within one month, fishes  is  most active at the full moon or the new moon  , least active at the first quarter or the last quarter.\n\nWeather : Hourly Weather Forecast for  7 days \nSolunar: Sunrise, Sunset, Moonrise, Moonset and Moon Phase\nFishing Index: Calculate the Fishing Index per Hour And Solunar Table\nTidal Forecast: Global Tidal Forecast and  Tide Analysis,Waves forecast\nMine:\n\n『Fishing Index Membership』\n7 days 24 hours fishing weather forecast, 7 days 24 hours daily and monthly analysis and prediction, 7 days 24 hours fishing index analysis and calculation,Tidal analysis and prediction,waves forecast。\n\nPurchase Rules:\n[Monthly membership] $0.49  per month purchase of Monthly membership, and automatically renew the subscription monthly.\n[Annual membership ] $4.49  per year to buy Annual membership, and automatically renew them after one year.\n[Life Membership] $ 14.99, only need to purchase once, valid for life\n\n\n(Note:prices in different regions should be converted according to US dollar exchange rate.)\nPurchase Notes:\n1.

      "label": "«Magnetology» is an application which permits one to watch the forecast of geomagnetic storms and the state of Earth´s geomagnetic field.\n\nWHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT?\n\nGeomagnetic storms adversely affect the health of humans.\n\nThey can cause aches, dizziness, rapid heart rate, and abnormal blood pressure.\n\nPeople with abnormal conditions of the blood and of the cardiovascular and autonomic nervous systems are particularly susceptible to the influence of geomagnetic storms.\n\nThe degree of magnetic storms’ influence on a particular person depends on many factors, including health status, stress, physical and emotional fatigue, natural predisposition.\n\nNot only can geomagnetic storms have a negative impact on humans, but also on communications, navigation, and power. Drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are most vulnerable to impact of geomagnetic storms.\n\nBy taking into account the forecast of geomagnetic storms, you can plan difficult decisions, avoid high physical stress, and protect yourself from negative consequences.\n\nOur application will help you with this.\n\nABOUT THE NATURE OF THE GEOMAGNETIC STORMS\n\nThe Earth's geomagnetic field changes occur under the influence of the Sun. The intensity of the impact is not constant and depends on the ongoing processes on the solar surface.\n\nThe strength of geomatic field disturbances is characterized by the value of Kp index. The Kp index can be assigned values from 0 to 9, where 0 is the absence of disturbances and 9 represents extremely strong perturbations of the earth´s geomagnetic field.\n\nDisturbances with a Kp index of 5 and above are called storms.\n\nThe number of geomagnetic storms per year can reach 50!\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\n- David Howell for English localization;\n- Johan Milani for French localization.\n\nIN COMING UPDATES OF THE APPLICATION EXPECT\n\n- Personal forecasts.\n\n* The app uses data of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration."

      "label": "*30 Days Free Trial on initial download!*  \n\nPlan. File. Fly. Log.\n\nGarmin Pilot is the most comprehensive suite of tools for the iPad designed specifically for general aviation and corporate pilots. Flight planning, charts, interactive maps, weather briefing resources and navigation capabilities; it’s all included. The app’s intuitive interface mirrors those on the newest Garmin touchscreen avionics so you can go seamlessly from preflight to inflight.  \n\nPlan \n\nGarmin Pilot’s powerful capabilities start with pre-flight planning, providing pilots with the most comprehensive aviation weather information to make better-informed flight decisions. Pilots can check NEXRAD radar, visible and infrared cloud imagery, METARs, TAFs, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, PIREPs, NOTAMs, winds and temperature aloft, TFRs and lightning data. With Garmin Pilot, data can be displayed over Garmin’s interactive maps that support track-up navigation, VFR sectional or an IFR low or high en-route chart to visualize the weather for your route. Add text-based weather widgets and use the exclusive NavTrack feature to view weather along the planned route. \n\nFile \n\nWith Garmin Pilot, users can easily enter a flight plan and interactively edit it on the map. Pre-loaded forms make it quick to save and reuse data for frequently flown routes. And when the flight plan is ready, Garmin Pilot makes it simple to file, amend or close the flight plan via Leidos Flight Service or DUATS.  \n\nFly \n\nGarmin Pilot provides full en-route navigation capability on its moving map. Pilots can also navigate with Garmin’s patented panel, a GPS-driven instrument pack with a graphical HSI directional display and indicators for groundspeed, altitude and vertical speed. After takeoff, pilots can continue to view real-time weather in the U.S. and traffic information by wirelessly connecting to Garmin’s GDL 39 3D portable ADS-B Receiver (sold separately). \n\nLog\n\nGarmin Pilot includes a comprehensive electronic logbook that syncs with flyGarmin.  The logbook automatically generates entries based upon GPS data collected during the flight, tracks currency, supports manual entries, endorsements and creates reports.\n\nGarmin Pilot U.S. Standard: \n\n- Rich, interactive maps support Track-Up navigation\n- Charts: VFR Sectionals, low and high IFR en-route, airport diagrams and approach procedures \n- Ability to view Jeppesen Terminal Charts  (Jeppesen echart subscription required)\n- Weather Maps: Animated radar, Infrared and Visible Satellite, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, Lightning, TFRs and more!\n- Extensive text products: METARs, TAFs, Winds Aloft, PIREPs, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, Area Forecasts and NOTAMs \n- AOPA Airport Directory\n- Weight and Balance\n- Checklists\n- Flight plan filing via Leidos Flight Services\n- Garmin patented navigation panel \n- Terrain and Obstacles\n- Smart Airspace\n- Fast Find predictive Waypoint Entry\n- Logbook\n- Optional VFR Premium: Synthetic Vision (SVX), Terrain and obstacle alerting, and Garmin SafeTaxi®  \n- Optional IFR Premium: VFR Premium plus geo-referenced Garmin FliteCharts® \n\nGarmin Pilot has regional offerings for Africa, Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe and Latin America.

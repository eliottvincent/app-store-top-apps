      "label": "Mit der ÖAMTC Führerschein App kann die Führerscheinprüfung für die Module Grundwissen, A oder B kostenlos simuliert oder ein Training absolviert werden. \n\n\nWARUM MAN DIE APP UNBEDINGT BRAUCHT: \n\n+ Der Fragenkatalog besteht aus allen aktuellen Fragen des Bundesministeriums. Neues Fragenmaterial steht üblicherweise 4 Wochen vor Inkrafttreten, zur Verfügung. Der korrekte Fragenstand wird automatisch aus dem gewählten Prüfungstermin ermittelt.\n\n+ Bei einer Frage können eine bis alle Antworten richtig sein. Eine Frage wird als richtig beantwortet, wenn alle richtigen Fragen auch als solche markiert wurden. Die Fragen bestehen aus Haupt- und Unterfragen, Hauptfragen werden immer gestellt. Unterfragen werden nur gestellt, wenn die Hauptfrage richtig beantwortet wurde – ganz wie bei der Theorieprüfung. \n\n+ Um effektiv zu lernen, kann man falsch beantwortete Fragen einer Kategorie zuweisen und diese dann entweder sofort oder zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt wiederholen – so holt man das meiste aus dem Lernkonzept. \n\n+ Die Bilder der einzelnen Fragen können mit einem Klick auf das Bild vergrößert werden, um Details erkennen zu können. Nach dem Beantworten der Fragen kann man durch klicken auf \"Weiter\" zur nächsten Frage gelangen. \n\n+ Zusätzlich gibt es nun die Möglichkeit L/L17 Fahrten zu protokollieren. In der App kann ein automatisches Fahrtenbuch angelegt werden, wo jede Fahrt inklusive Kartendarstellung aufgezeichnet wird. Die Daten werden gespeichert, die gefahrenen Kilometer automatisch addiert.\n\n+ Die gespeicherten Daten sowie der Fortschrittstatus können jederzeit eingesehen werden. Die an der Ausbildungsfahrt beteiligten Personen (Bewerber/Begleitperson) können direkt am Smartphone unterschreiben. Am Ende kann ein L17-Fahrtenprotokoll ausgedruckt werden. Das Fahrtenbuch beziehungsweise Fahrtenprotokoll ist streng nach den gesetzlichen Vorgaben gestaltet.\n\n\nWAS NOCH GUT ZU WISSEN IST: \n\no Die Nutzung der GPS Funktion zum Aufzeichnen des L17 Streckenverlaufes im Hintergrund kann die Batterielaufzeit deutlich reduzieren.\n\no Verbesserungsvorschläge oder Problemstellungen können einfach an apps@oeamtc.at gesendet werden.\n\no Wir benutzen für die App-Analyse und App-Optimierung eine anonymisierte Nutzungsdatenübermittlung. Durch die Nutzung der App erklärt man sich mit der Bearbeitung der über einen selbst erhobenen Daten in der zuvor beschriebenen Art und Weise und zu dem zuvor benannten Zweck einverstanden.\n\no Für die technische Verfügbarkeit, inhaltliche Richtigkeit und Zuverlässigkeit der Applikation wird keinerlei Zusicherung oder Garantie abgegeben. Die Applikation kann jederzeit, auch ohne vorherige Benachrichtigung der Benutzer geändert oder eingestellt werden.

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom.

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

In den Lernspielen werden Schul- und Zukunftskompetenzen gefördert.\n\nKinder begeben sich je nach gewähltem Lerninhalt gemeinsam mit unterschiedlichen Spielfiguren auf Lernreisen in unbekannte Welten. Sie befreien diese jeweils durch über 20 Lernspiele von den kleinen, süßen Chaosmonstern. In der „Welt der Worte“ unterstützen sie beispielsweise die Füchsin Mika darin, Ordnung zu schaffen und erlernen dabei Grundkenntnisse für das Lesen und Schreiben. Die Spiele sind auch nach der Freischaltung aller Lerninhalte beliebig oft wiederholbar und werden in Updates zusätzlich durch kleinere Spiele ergänzt. \n \nEDURINO wird gemeinsam mit PädagogInnen und LogopädInnen entwickelt und wöchentlich in unseren Partnerkindergärten getestet. Die App ist werbefrei, ohne In-App-Käufe und offline spielbar. Durch einen gesicherten Elternbereich, in dem die Bildschirmzeit angepasst und der Spielstand eingesehen werden kann, gibt die App Kindern die Möglichkeit, selbstständig zu spielen und zu lernen.\n \n \nWie funktioniert Edurino?\n \nDie EDURINO Lernapp funktioniert mit haptischen Spielfiguren und einem mit ErgotherapeutInnen entwickelten Dreikantstift. Die EDURINO Produkte können auf www.edurino.com erworben werden.\n \nDie Spielfiguren sind der Schlüssel zur digitalen Welt. Mit dem Aufdrücken der Spielfigur auf ein Smartphone oder Tablet werden die gewünschten Lernspiele, wie z.B. Erstes Lesen & Schreiben, Zahlen & Mengen oder Erstes Englisch in der EDURINO App freigeschaltet. \n \nDer ergonomische Dreikantstift unterstützt Links- und RechtshänderInnen bei der Entwicklung einer lockeren Stifthaltung und trainiert in jeder Lernreise die Schreibmotorik durch abwechslungsreiche Übungen.\n \n \nWeitere Informationen\n \nhttps://www.edurino.com/\nhttps://edurino.com/policies/privacy-policy\nhttps://edurino.com/policies/terms-of-service"

Take a picture of a plant, find out what it's called and learn everything you want to know with the help of a fact sheet. Highly precise algorithms based on artificial intelligence identify wild plants even when they are not (yet) in bloom!\n\nIn the Flora Incognita app you can easily view all your collected plant finds in a observation list. Maps show where you have found your plants. This way you can see how your knowledge about wild plants is growing.\n\nBut Flora Incognita is even more! The app is free of charge and without advertising, because it is part of a scientific research project that aims to improve nature conservation. The collected observations are used to answer scientific research questions that deal, for example, with the spread of invasive species or the effects of climate change on biotopes.\n\nIn regular stories, you will learn about news from the project, get insights into the scientific work or will be made curious about what is happening in nature right now.\n\nWHY SHOULD YOU USE FLORA INCOGNITA?\n- Identify wild plants simply by taking a photo with your smartphone\n- Learn more about plant species with the help of extensive plant profiles\n- Collect your findings in your observation list\n- Become part of an innovative scientific community\n- Share your findings on Twitter, Instagram & Co!\n\nHOW GOOD IS FLORA INCOGNITA?\nSpecies identification with Flora Incognita is based on Deep Learning algorithms that have an accuracy of well over 90%. It is important to take sharp and as close as possible pictures of plant parts such as flower, leaf, bark or fruit for a high identification accuracy.\n\nWOULD YOU LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT OUR PROJECT?\nVisit our website at www.floraincognita.com or follow us on social media. You can find us on Twitter (@Flora_Incognita), Instagram (@flora.incognita) and Facebook (@flora.incognita).\n\nIS THE APP REALLY FREE OF CHARGE AND ADVERTISING?\nYes.

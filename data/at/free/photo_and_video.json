Brighten up pictures that are meaningful to you and preserve wonderful memories.\n\nWith Skylum’s unique AI technology, you'll get higher-quality results with less effort. imgmi detects the sky and powerlines automatically, so there’s no need to worry about masking on a small screen. And it delivers the results immediately.\n\nSelect a Sky is great for transforming photos with gray or white skies into vibrant images without resorting to correcting overexposure (something that a lot of phones don’t do well). It allows you to experiment with colorful skies, add drama, or make your photo artistic to produce a wow effect.\n\nErase is the easy way to remove people who spoil your shot or accidentally get into the frame, which happens a lot at popular sightseeing spots. Clear debris, leaves, and distracting objects from your picture, get rid of unnecessary elements in a macro image, or even remove your own shadow from the frame. You can also easily do some background texture alignment, leveling soil, asphalt, walls, and more.\n\nRemove Powerlines is an ideal tool for perfecting photos of European and Asian cities (which often have distracting powerlines), clearing up cityscape photos taken from the window of a hotel, and delivering pleasing pictures of cityscapes with a focus on the main attractions.\n\nGet better photos from your travels, including at popular sightseeing spots. Clear up photos in museums, near monuments and historical buildings, and in other locations that attract lots of tourists. Your photos will look better without extra people and powerlines in the background, meaning you’ll get more attention from your followers. Getting likes under your photos is easy with imgmi.\n\n\n=================================\nimgmi subscription options: \n=================================\n\nMonthly\nYearly (+7 days trial.

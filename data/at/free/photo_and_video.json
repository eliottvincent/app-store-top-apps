Share your screen on a Smart TV, Mac, PC, Laptop, Gaming Console, Smartphone or Tablet.\n\nThe Screen Mirroring App can connect to any Web Browser and cast your screen with zero delay in HD quality. Screen Mirroring over DLS / Cable / Internet is supported by Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge and the newest Smart TVs.\n\nThis is the easiest and most powerful screen sharing tool. Share your photos, videos, games, websites, apps, presentations and documents with your friends and family, even to remote places.\n\n* Supported devices: Any device with an integrated Web Browser, e.g. Samsung TV, LG TV, Panasonic TV, Hisense TV, Philips TV, Hitachi TV, Grundig TV, TCL TV\n\n* Local mirroring on WiFi: Your iPhone/iPad and your web browser device must be connected to the same wifi. Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Remote mirroring is limited to DSL / Cable / Internet. Connections over cellular/mobile networks (LTE/5G) are not yet supported.\n\n* Latency is supreme (0 seconds) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* You don't need a companion App on your TV or receiving device\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\n\nThis app is brought to you by the developers of Video & TV Cast, the #1 video casting app in the world with more than 100.000.000 downloads across all platforms and devices.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with any of the trademarks mentioned here."

      "label": "#1 app to screen mirroring your iPhone or iPad to Samsung Smart TV.\n\nApplication to mirror the screen of your iPhone or iPad to any Samsung Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror anything from your iPhone or iPad to your Samsung TV.\n\nTo mirror video as well as audio, please make sure that you start mirroring when you are in the app (Photos, YouTube, Facebook etc.) that you want to mirror to your TV.\nEnjoy everything on TV from your iPhone, iPad & Mac.\n\nThis works on any Samsung Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. Which model year do you have? You can see that by looking at the middle letter in your model type (on the back of your Samsung TV).\n\nE = 2012\nF = 2013\nH = 2014\nJ = 2015\nK = 2016\nM = 2017\nN = 2018\nR = 2019\nT = 2020\nQ = QLED (also supported)\n\nFor instance:\n\nUE55_E_S8000 = 2012.\nUE78_H_U8500L = 2014.\n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Samsung TV. Don't use multiple VLANs or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for Samsung TV app. It will start looking for your Samsung TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model Samsung TV, the TV might ask you to \"allow\" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Samsung TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\n\nDRM\n\nSome apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.\n\nYou can purchase the Mirror for Samsung TV Pro Version through an in app purchase.\n\nThe Pro Version has the following features:\n1. Adds audio to the screen mirroring\n2. Provides for free lifetime updates of the app\n3. Gives the option to choose higher screen resolutions, like 720p and 1080p\n\n* Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n* Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n* Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.\n* Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user’s Account Settings after purchase.\n* Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nOur Terms of Use: http://bit.ly/ABTV-TOU21\nOur Privacy Policy: http://bit.ly/ABTVPrivacy\n\nSupport:\nIf you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.\n\nWhat our users are saying:\n\n\"Amazing\" - 5 STARS - by Pmanswah\nAt first I thought it was going to trash then saw the reviews and thought they were bots.I bought the app and used it and it worked perfectly perfect sound and audio this app is a match made in heaven for me.\n\nPlease give us feedback by mailing to support@airbeam.tv"

Effortlessly switch to native RAW, for greater detail and speed.\n\nFeatures:\n- Beautiful, intuitive gesture-based interface, usable with one hand\n- Take portraits of pets and objects on iPhone XR and iPhone SE\n- Manual focus, and powerful tools like a Focus Loupe and Focus Peaking\n- Smart automatic mode with Halide Smart RAW, optimizing settings with Machine Learning for RAW files with less noise and more detail\n- Full manual exposure controls including shutter speed, ISO and white balance\n- Best-on-iPhone exposure tools: histograms, XDR 14-bit RGB waveform, and color zebra stripes\n- Captures RAW, TIFF, HEIC or JPG for the best quality shots\n- Grid overlay with built-in level\n- A powerful reviewer to view DNG, JPG, HEIC and Live Photos, as well as Portrait depth data and mattes, with a detailed metadata view\n- Instant RAW development process to quickly develop your RAW files in a tap\n- Technical Readout to view all details of your iPhone camera hardware\n- Apple Watch companion app for remote shooting\n- Siri Shortcuts support to trigger the shutter remotely, or open Halide in Auto or Manual mode\n- Coverage, a powerful new feature to take two photos with a small delay to capture both a maximum-Smart HDR processed image with Deep Fusion and Smart HDR, as well as a DNG RAW.\n- Become a better photographer by signing up for comprehensive lessons like a 10-day quick tutorial right from the app.\n- Private by Design: Halide does not include any trackers or tracking, has not third party libraries, does not collect data or photos, and never transmits any information. Halide also includes features to reduce spying by companies like Facebook by limiting location information on photos shared from the app.\n- Feature limitations:\n\n*ProRAW requires iPhone 12 Pro or Pro Max or iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max\nThe Ultra Wide and selfie cameras do not support RAW or manual focus unless on iOS 15.\nWaveform requires iPhone 8 or later.

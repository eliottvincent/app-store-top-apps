      "label": "If you love working out with Apple Watch, but you need more advanced fitness stats, HealthFit is for you.\n\nBy analyzing the workout data stored in Apple Health, HealthFit provides the kind of indispensable tracking and insights you normally only get from premium subscription services. But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times. You can even log which bike or shoes you use, to monitor usage and flag when it’s time to replace them.\n\nHealthFit finds photos you take during your workouts automatically, bringing your activity feed to life with stunning images you can share on social media.\n\nRUNNING POWER ANALYSIS\n\nHealthFit provides advanced running power analysis with the automatically estimated critical power, the weighted average power, the power distribution chart by 25W Increments and the mean maximal power chart which shows your best average power for time periods of one second up to the length of your run.\n\nMULTISPORT AND INTERVAL WORKOUTS\n\nHealthFit is the only app to export multisport workouts as multisession activities\n\nSTATISTICS: UNCOVER HIDDEN FITNESS INSIGHTS\n\nApple Watch gathers so much fitness data, it can sometimes seem overwhelming. HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio.

      "label": "PULSALARM warns you via vibration or warning tone when you exceed your set upper and lower pulse limit and thus supports you in your pulse-based training. You can train as usual with your favorite fitness or running app. All you need to do is install PULSALARM on your Apple Watch.\n\nFeatures of the Apple Watch App:\n- Vibration and/or warning tone when the set pulse limits are reached\n- Vibration and/or signal tone when returning to the set pulse range\n- Pulse limits can be deactivated individually\n- Large, easy to read display of the current pulse\n- Fast adjustment of pulse limits (also possible while running)\n- Works together with all known fitness, training and running apps that can be started on the Apple Watch\n- Does not write data to Apple Health\n- You can use the app on your Apple Watch without having your iPhone with you\n\nFeatures of the iPhone App:\n- Calculation of your maximum heart rate\n- Individual calculation of the 5 intensity ranges (depending on your maximum heart rate) \n- Adoption of the pulse limits from the training zones\n- Setting the maximum and minimum pulse limit \n- Large display of the current pulse\n\nImportant note: without the use with an Apple Watch, the functional range of the app is limited, as no permanent pulse measurement can be carried out.\n\nNo advertising, no tracking, no third-party codes. Developed with passion and programmed in Germany.\n\nWhy use PULSALARM additionally? \nMany running apps include the pace as a target in their training plans. However, the same speed can mean a high intensity for one person and a low intensity for another. It is therefore helpful to consider your heart rate instead of speed to determine and maintain the right training intensity. \nPULSALARM helps you to do this. It turns your Apple Watch into a heart rate monitor. \n\nWhat is the big advantage?\nYou no longer have to look at your Apple Watch during your workout and still know whether you are exercising within your personal heart rate zone. Also ideal in colder months, when your Apple Watch is hidden under a jacket or long-sleeved shirt and you can't look directly at the display while running.\n\nFor whom is PULSALARM suitable?\n- Ideal for run beginners, as they can control themselves better and protect themselves from overstraining.\n- Ideal for ambitious runners, as they can train more specifically in their intensity ranges and thus increase endurance and performance.\n- For all athletes and fitness enthusiasts who are interested in heart rate monitoring during their training with their Apple Watch.\n\nSummary:\nWith the PULSALARM app on the iPhone you can determine your 5 intensity ranges based on your maximum heart rate. You can enter your maximum heart rate directly or have it calculated. Set your personal maximum heart rate limit, which you do not want to exceed during training, and your minimum heart rate limit. When these limits are reached, your Apple Watch will alert you by vibrating and/or beeping."

      "label": "AutoWake is the first haptic smart alarm for your Watch. \n\nIt can wake you up by tapping you on your wrist using your Watch's haptic engine. You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

      "label": "This application is a sidekick to the beastmaker 1000 and 2000. It has been designed to assist the user into gradually getting stronger on a fingerboard. The app does this by way of prewritten workouts which are often general and aim to improve all trainable grips on the board. Some are specific (2000 series only at the moment) which aim to improve, sloper strength, pocket strength and crimp strength. \n\nThere is also a new custom workout program fully adjustable and includes the 1000,2000 and micros, so if you have your own hang regime and different timings then that is all programmable and can be saved.\n\nBoth the workouts and custom timer now record hang contraction time (time spent actually hanging off the board) We recommend most users get up to around 20:00 minutes on this clock whilst doing their workouts.\n\nOn the Workout screen after you've selected your work out it is now possible to adjust set and hang times. Users who are only finger boarding and are having a rest day prior to and after training may wish to do up to 3 sets and 7 hangs. Other users may prefer to go for 2 sets and 6 hangs, this is what we'd consider an average and more suited to people doing additional types of training.\n\nPlease note the grades for the workouts aren't actually meant to relate to anything other than themselves. E.G. 5c is easier than 6a but harder than 5b. If you find 5a hard on the 1000, use a weight removal technique such as putting one foot on a chair in front of the board or using a pulley with weights on. More advice on this and other things are available in the general advice section on the Workout Ratings page.\n\nTo record your hangs press the record button (red circle icon) whilst resting. The Workout Ratings function is much improved and should now be a really useful training aid which records gradual progress and improvement.\n\nFingerboard gains take time, remember to warm up thoroughly and move on to more difficult hangs at a slightly slower pace than you think you should to give pulleys time to catch up with muscles. For example 10% strength gains over a year is brilliant improvement. 5% is still effective training.\n\nBest of luck with the training, happy hanging and we hope this helps with the motivation."

The Wonder Weeks reveals what’s going on inside baby’s mind.\n\nThe audio-book includes:\n•\tWeek-by-week guide to baby's behavior\n•\tWhen to expect the fussy behavior, what this implies (cranky, clingy, crying (the three C's) behavior) and how to deal with these regression periods (leaps)\n•\tA description from your baby's perspective of the world around him and how you can understand the changes he's going through\n•\tFun games and gentle activities you can do with your child\n\nThe audio book is based on the scientific- and parental-world-changing discovery of a phenomenon: all normal, healthy babies appear to be more fussy at very nearly the same ages, regression periods, and sleep less in these phases.\n\nThese age-related fluctuations in need for body contact and attention (regression periods) are related to major and quite dramatic changes in the brains of the children. These changes enable a baby to enter a whole new perceptual world and, as a consequence, to learn many new skills. This should be a reason for celebration, but as far as the baby is concerned these changes are bewildering. He's taken aback—everything has changed overnight. It is as if he has woken up on a strange planet. He needs you to guide him and understand what he is going through! Get ready to rediscover the world all over again with your baby…"

This sleepmatic sounds machine is created using an ancient but doctor-tested and approved technique to help soothe your fussy baby calm with a shusher sound in cradle. \r\n\r\nA simple baby shusher with soothing sounds for baby that works on a single click, making calming sounds like baby lullaby that would work instantly and can be played for hours, recommended by parents, baby photographers, and doctors dealing with babies.\r\n\r\nBy creating calm sounds, safely stop the baby from crying with a rhythmic “shush” sound that engages a baby's natural calming reflex by reminding them of still being in the womb. The shush baby app helps to soothe baby calm and increase the baby sleep timer.\r\n\r\nThe amazing Sound Equalizer allows the app to \"listen\" to your baby crying or not every three minutes and automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby cry volume till baby calms down (so when the baby is wailing, shush is loud; when baby goes quiet, volume settles into a soothing background shush sound to relax baby).\r\n\r\nA newborn sleep magic baby sound machine that works best for a newborn baby to calm down quickly and manage baby sleeping patterns. A sleep aid that creates calming sounds for babies in the form of a shhh sound sleeper that will stop your baby crying, calms down easily, and put baby to sleep. \r\n\r\nThis shhh app calm baby instantly by creating a shusher sound, helping the baby relax in minutes using calming sounds for kids.  This sleepmatic app works like magic for the crying baby and helps parenting so much easier as baby calmer. \r\n\r\nAfter more than two years of testing and research with real moms and real babies, having sudden and long crying baby issues, we came up with the following very valuable feature list of baby soothing sound.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Safe and easy to use baby calming sounds machine. \r\n- Much more effective than simple lullabies or standard white noise.\r\n- Perfectly works for hours in the background and when the phone is locked\r\n- Adjustable Shush baby sound Timer Options (from 15 minutes to 8 hours of continuous shushing!)\r\n- Automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby crying volume.\r\n- Shush sounds played in low light “dark mode” ( night mode) to avoid extra mobile light as baby sleeps.\r\n- Work in other Apps on your Phone while still using the Baby Shusher App.\r\n\r\n*Note: Turn your phone on silent/mute to let the app do its magic.*\r\n \r\n \r\nWhat Real Moms are Saying About the Baby Shusher:\r\n\r\n“I wish I would have known about this sooner.

Not anymore!\n\nIntroducing Hidgets, your health widgets for your home screen. Select up to 11 different categories to display all your health information the way you want: steps, active energy (calories burned), distance, sleep time, heart rate, resting heart rate, weight, oxygen leves, blood glucose, water and mindful minutes. Select style, mode, source and color, and even what the widgets should open when tapping on them. \n\nYou can choose up to 11 different layout styles, from small to medium sized widgets, making the combination you want for your home screen.\n\nThis app uses HeathKit to obtain information about your movement, weight, oxygen levels, blood glucose, sleep and heart beat values, should you consent the app to do so upon launch. \n\nNote: the update frequency of the widgets depend on the iOS itself, not controllable by the app. The operating system will decide how often the widgets need to refresh, but you can force refresh them by entering the Hidgets app once and go back to the home screen.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please contact me at schmitzoide@gmail.com or visit the website https://hidgets.com.\n\nThank you so much for your support! \n\nWith love from Portugal,\nMarcel"

      "label": "Did you know that your heart beats faster during inhalation and slower during exhalation AND did you know that this is good for you?\n\nThe technical term is RSA (respiratory sinus arrhythmia) - a good arrhythmia controlled by your autonomic nervous system. \n\nHigh variability of the heart rate stands for a good autonomic balance and activity of the parasympathetic nervous system (rest and relaxation nerve).\n\nHeartBreath is a biofeedback tool, that addresses exactly this relationship between breathing and heart rate.\n\nThe app guides you through a simple slow-breathing exercise (with pictures and sounds), while detecting and displaying the intervals between your heartbeats. You can measure, train and evaluate your personal status. No additional hardware devices are needed. HeartBreath is able to detect heartbeats by positioning your finger on the lens of the phone’s camera.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\nIntegrated VaYou Sound Flows, which provide an exceptional sound experience on acoustic pacing.\n\nHigh quality and customizable control of the bio-feedback exercise with pictures (you can work with pictures from your photo library) and sounds. \n\nLive display of the current heart rate and variability values while recording.\n\nIn just a few breaths, HeartBreath is able to compute your resting heart rate.\n\nNo additional hardware is needed. The calculation works with a finger on the lens of the iPhone’s (or iPod’s) camera (for iPad only device models with flash). Optionally, an external heart rate monitor can be used. For compatible devices (Polar H10) display/recording/evaluation of true ECG data is supported. As a special extra, the app allows the comparison of data between the finger on the camera and the heart rate monitor.\n\nUnlike many other HRV apps, HeartBreath offers a precise visualization for every single heartbeat and, if necessary, tools for interactive correction of the beats. This is very important for the high reliability of HRV parameters, since single ectopic heartbeats or data artifacts can result in strange adulteration of HRV values.\n\nIntegrated tools to determine your optimal breathing speed. Various studies show that each person has an individual optimal RSA breathing rate in the range between 4 and 7 breaths per minute.\n\nTrend evaluations over longer periods of time.\n\nHeartBreath integrates with the Apple Health app.\n\nPrivacy is important to us! The app does not require registration and you have full control over the data of your sessions, which is only stored on your phone."

      "label": "“Everything in Life is Vibration.”\nAlbert Einstein\n\nThe Schumann resonance is Earth's repeating atmospheric heartbeat.  \nAbout 2000 thunderstorms move over the Earth at any given time, creating about 50 lightning strikes every second. Each lightning strike produces electromagnetic waves that begin to circle the Earth and form the Schumann resonance. Some people associate the Schumann resonance with the rise of collective human consciousness and an ascension process. Some people notice a behaviour change when activity increases.\n\nTherefore we have created an app where you can quickly monitor the Schumann status on your iOS device.\nJust place one of the widgets (small, medium, large and even extra large on iPadOS) on your Home Screens or Control Center and immediately access the Schumann resonance's current measurement from Tomsk Space Observing System or the Cumiana VLF Monitoring Station, Italy. The square widgets view the rightmost part of the original rectangle graph, as this is the area where the current measurements are shown. The full charts show the variations of the Schumann resonance over the last three days.\nAnother widget is available to view the short term prediction of the aurora bolearis. These northern lights are the result of geomagnetic storms which are caused by coronal mass ejections of the sun. \n\nIn addition to the widgets, the app offers access to all the relevant measurements of the two Schumann-stations for easy monitoring and comparison. You can have a quick overview in portrait mode and go more into detail in the landscape view of your device. You can also see the prediction of aurora bolearis and aurora australis in the app.\n\nIs there a data source you're missing or a chart you'd also like to see as a widget? Let us know. We are always open to suggestions."

      "label": "Cardiograph is an application which measures your heart rate. You can save your results for future reference, keep track of multiple people with individual profiles, add notes and locations, and even print out your measurements for sharing or safe keeping.\n\nCardiograph uses your device's built-in camera to take pictures of your fingertip and calculate your heart's rhythm - the same approach used by professional medical equipment!\n\n\"I know you have the disclaimer on the screen but I don't care, Cardiograph saved my life. Your app was key to understanding what was going on and help the doctors understand too.\"\nBob Spadafora - *****\n\n\"Comparing heart rates with family over the holidays is fun.\"\nTxyak – ****\n\n\"Wanna impress a friend with a cool app. This is the one to get.\"\nMattyray – *****\n\n\"After having two heart valve replacements and a by-pass, I feel it is not only smart - but also necessary - to have such a reliable heart rate monitor with me everywhere I go.\"\nDantv – *****\n\n\"I am an EMT and it helps me actually see what is going on. It is by no means definitive like a monitor but it is a great indicator of problems I would not see otherwise.\"\nGranniem – ****\n\n\"I had a pulse oximeter on one hand, medical quality, and my iPhone app in the other and the app was dead-on accurate.\"\nLike it but hate it – *****\n\n\n=== See Cardiograph in action ===\nhttp://macropinch.com/cardiograph \nhttp://youtu.be/isIjcCFYEho\n\n\n• Measure your heart rate\n\nIt's never been easier to know what your heart rate is! Without any external hardware, just using the built-in camera of your smartphone or tablet, you can get accurate readings almost instantly.\n\nKnowing how fast your heart is beating can be very useful when exercising, if you're under stress, if you have a heart-related medical condition, or even just out of curiosity.\n\n\n• Track your results\n\nEvery measurement you take is saved to your personal history, so you can keep track over time. In addition to the date and time of the measurement, you can also save the location at which it was taken (and see them on a map), and even add a quick note to effortlessly organize your history.\n\n\n• Multiple profiles\n\nCardiograph is perfectly tailored to allow multiple people to use the app on a shared device. You can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them has their own individual measurement history.\n\n\n• Export & Print\n\nEach measurement can be exported in full detail to a portable format that you can later send via e-mail, upload on the web or even print right from the app itself (with an AirPrint™ compatible printer).\n\n\n• Clean and intuitive design\n \nInspired by real-life medical equipment, Cardiograph is a pleasure to use. The streamlined and clutter-free design makes it seem instantly familiar, so you can focus on using the app instead of navigating through series of confusing screens.\n\n\n• Built-in user guide\n\nIf you're having trouble with the app, or you want to make the most out of it, you can access the comprehensive help manual right from within the app itself.\n\n\n• Universal application with iCloud® sync\n\nCardiograph is an universal application - it runs on the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod touch.\nInstall Cardiograph on multiple devices with iOS 5.0+, and all your profiles and measurements will be in sync! Manage your profiles and measurements on one device, and the changes are instantly reflected on all the others.\n\n\nPlease note: If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\n\n\nFollow the latest news:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch \nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

Because bread units are single-digits, it is easy to keep track of them during the course of the day and simplify food management.\n\nThe built-in meal planner opens up the possibility to create entire meals with accurate bread unit counts as a result of each individual ingredient – and therefore shows what is necessary to prepare for proper insulin dosage.\n\n\n≡ WHY COUNT CARBS ? ≡\n\nEspecially new, unknown products and their effects on blood sugar levels are often hard to assess and so we all fall into this dull habit of eating the same things - day in, day out. \nCounting carbohydrates through bread units (BU’s) is a good solution for many people with diabetes, not just those taking insulin. The International Diabetes Association recommends \"carb counting as an [effective] meal planning technique for managing blood glucose levels\". \n\n\n≡ WHAT DOES THE APP DO? ≡\n\nThe app’s database contains carbohydrate equivalents in bread units for thousands of popular foods. Simply set your serving size with the swipe of your finger and include the additional calorie information if you struggle with the weight management part. All calculations necessary for a complete meal are automated if you combine multiple food portions and will display as one comprehensive result. \n\nThe food choices include:\n» Fresh products, fruits & vegetables\n» Popular brand-name products\n» Restaurant meal choices if you eat out\n\n\n≡ SIMPLE INSULIN MGMT. ≡\n\nSet the calues for 1 bread unit (BU) to your preferred “insulin to carbohydrate unit ratio”. Usually, these are 12 grams of carbohydrates per bread unit.\nSome countries teach carb counting with 10 grams of carbs per BU, but you are free to try which is  better suited to your lifestyle.\n\n\n≡ APP FEATURES ≡\n=> Bread units & calories for thousands of food choices\n=> Adjustable carb unit calculations (12g or 10g of carbohydrates per BU)\n=> Quick, paperless solution to search and find the right foods\n=> Simple serving size calculator for improved accuracy\n=> Save personal serving sizes for later\n=> Save regional foods & personal favorites \n=> Create & sort lists by nutrient, ascending or descending\n=> Nutrient filter to optimize your meal planning\n=> VoiceOver support if you suffer from diabetic retinopathy"

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

Whenever you want, you can scroll backwards through the weekly information; however, you can only scroll two weeks into the future.\n\nBelow you will find detailed information about each week of pregnancy.\nAdditionally, you can add your own notes and images (eg ultrasound images or photos) to each day."

      "label": "Biofeedback is the future and the future is now - for everyone. No additional body sensors are needed anymore! Just take your iPhone and start VaYou.\n\nVaYou Breath is innovative sound biofeedback. The app connects you directly with yourself by transforming your abdominal breathing into dynamically generated sounds. \n\nIt is very simple! You breathe relaxed and VaYou generates sounds from it - directly shaped by your breathing. With the help of real-time biofeedback, your breath, mind and heart increasingly flow as one.\n\nVaYou Breath integrates with Apple Health by updating your values for resting heart rate, respiratory rate, and mindful minutes.\n\nKey VaYou benefits\n\n• Biometric Integration - VaYou provides advanced real-time breath and pulse detection without the need for additional wearables or expensive medical sensors.\n• We have gone to the technical limits. VaYou converts the iOS motion/acceleration sensor data stream into high quality biosignals for breath and pulse (pulse only in lying position).\n• In order to support the relaxation process, the VaYou algorithms learn from your biosignals and derived parameters how to best design the sounds so that they are most effective for you at that moment.\n• No online connection needed while using - activate airplane mode for an undisturbed and healthy experience!\n\nNo other app or desktop software provides biofeedback like VaYou Breath.\n\nJust listening to the breath-generated sounds leads you into a very personal flow experience. Your consciousness is more and more \"absorbed\" by the process, your thoughts come to rest. The mental state can be described as relaxed and calming breath mindfulness. It is almost automatic to \"stay with the breath\", easily and effortless.  \n\nUnlike with apps where you have to understand and follow spoken instructions, with VaYou Breath you can \"switch off\" right from the start. The resulting flow experience brings body and mind into harmony and this has a regenerating effect.\n\nThe regular use of VaYou Breath can have a generally positive effect on body and mind. Some of the reported effects are\n• Calming the flow of thoughts\n• Reduction of stress levels\n• Self regulation of the heart and breathing activity\n• Increase of creativity\n• Improvement of mood\n• Improvement of sleep.\n\nIT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT:\n\nPut on good headphones and choose one of the perfected Sound~Flows. Then select the duration, press START and place the iPhone on your lower abdomen, just below the navel. (It's usually better to loosen a belt if you wear one and slide the iPhone halfway into the belt line of your trousers or skirt.)

Die App kann ebenso dazu benutzt werden, auf spielerische Weise das Verhalten in einer solchen akuten Situation zu üben. Im Programmteil „Der kleine Lebensretter“ wird zusätzlich Hintergrundwissen zu den unterschiedlichsten Erste Hilfe-Themen vermittelt. \n\nDie Applikation bietet vier Funktionen: \nDer interaktive Erste Hilfe-Assistent gibt per Sprache und wahlweise Text oder Bild Anweisungen zu Erste Hilfe-Maßnahmen und kann so durch eine Notfallsituation lotsen. Per Eingabe mit „Ja“- oder „Nein“-Taste können die Fragen der Applikation entsprechend der Notfallsituation beantwortet werden. Der Benutzer wird auf Beachtung des Eigenschutzes hingewiesen und zur Bewusstseins- und Atemkontrolle angehalten. Der jeweiligen Antwort entsprechend wird er weitergeleitet zu Maßnahmen zur Wiederbelebung oder zu Maßnahmen, die bei Verbrennungen, Vergiftungen, Atemnot, Blutungen, Schlaganfall und Herzinfarkt dringend notwendig sind. Diese Maßnahmen werden detailliert, weitestgehend auch durch Abbildungen, beschrieben. \n\nDer „Notruf Assistent“ bietet Hilfe, um einen Notruf zu tätigen. Er enthält eine Anleitung für eine genaue Notfallmeldung anhand der fünf Ws, bietet die Möglichkeit einer Standortbestimmung mit Darstellung durch Google-Maps und zur automatischen Notrufbetätigung. \n„Der kleine Lebensretter“ beinhaltet wichtiges Hintergrundwissen in Text und Bild zu unterschiedlichen Erste Hilfe-Themen wie Gelenkverletzungen, Knochenbrüchen, Sonnenstich, Schock oder Stabile Seitenlage. „Der kleine Lebensretter“ kann weiterführend zum interaktiven Erste Hilfe-Assistenten oder allgemein als kleine Informationssammlung zu Ersten Hilfe-Themen benutzt werden. \nMit den „DRK Infodiensten“ lassen sich die wichtigsten DRK News online abrufen, aktuelle Blutspendetermine im Umkreis herausfinden und eine Übersicht über die unterschiedlichen Angebote zu Erste Hilfe Kursen einsehen.\n\nDie Applikation ist in deutscher Sprache."

Wind moves from left to right, right to left, hovers overhead. Sometimes a gust seems far away to the right, other times it's whipping just overhead. It's cool that you can often hear what the wind is carrying, too.\" — Dave Caolo, TUAW \n\n\"Windy is what a pop-up book would look like in the digital age if you were to combine it with IMAX audio.\" — Gannon Burgett, The Industry \n\n\"There’s little question Windy has been carefully crafted – she’s a beautiful thing, with some real talented artists and technologists working behind the scenes here.\" — Paul Sawers, The Next Web \n\n\"I absolutely love the wind sounds.\" — Christine Chan, AppAdvice\n\nMillions of people love Windy. Give Windy a try, sleep great tonight!\n\nP.s. The screenshots show Windy with unlocked achievements. Some animals shown will need to be unlocked by small actions, which are entirely free and optional :)\n\n\n≈ Questions? ≈ \nTweet @taptanium, email franz taptanium com or send an email through the in-app contact support page. Happy to hear from you. Made with lots of love in Germany."

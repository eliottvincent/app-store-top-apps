      "label": "Interval is the fundamental part of music structures, since all melodies or harmonies can be considered as a sequence or layering of intervals.  This app is to help improve your ability of interval recognition.  More specifically, you can develop the following skills:\n\n•  Ear Training\nWhen you hear a melody, you’ll be able to recognize the intervals by ears.  This will improve your sense of relative pitch which is a powerful skill for any musician to have.\n\n• Music Reading\nWhen you read the music score, you’ll be able to identify the intervals between notes quickly.  This will help improve the speed of your music reading.\n\n•  Singing\nThe app can detect the voice of your singing or the sound of your instrument playing through the microphone.  This can help you sing/play intervals accurately.  \n\n•  Piano Playing\nIf you are learning piano or keyboard, this app can help you identify the intervals between any pair of keys.  This is very useful for chords and scales recognition, and it can even benefit your improvisation. \n\n•  Music Transcription and Intonation\nThe ability to name and reproduce musical intervals, is also an important part of music transcription and musical intonation.\n\n\n\nTo help you acquire all the powerful skills mentioned above, the app provides the following features:\n\n•  Practice Mode\nYou learn at your own pace simply by answering the question, and if you are wrong, the correct answer will be shown for the duration of your choice.\n\n•  View Mode\nYou don’t need to do anything but watching, the questions and answers will be shown automatically after the delay of your choice. Good for lazy people like me. :)\n\n•  Game Mode\nIn this exciting countdown mode, you can challenge yourself and earn as many coins, medals, and trophies as you can. \n\n•  Search Mode\nThis mode allows you to look up the intervals you don’t know.\n\n•  Learning Range Customization\nYou can filter the intervals to learn by interval quality or number.  This is extremely useful when you want to focus on certain interval types or differentiate the similar ones such as Major Third and Minor Third.\n\n•  Question/Answer Approaches Customization\nYou can customize the question and answer approaches flexibly, which allows you to do Reversal Learning.  For example, to practice reading intervals, while you can answer the interval name based on the music notes you see, you can also do it reversely: answer the music notes based on the interval name you see.   This is an effective way to memorize.  \n\n•  Intelligent Questioning\nEach question is generated intelligently based on the statistical information of your performance for each interval, so yes, the app enjoys attacking your weaknesses, but to make you stronger! :)"

      "label": "Thanks to 3 different yet complementary ways of manipulating time with creativity, BLEASS Slow Machine can deepen any beat by completely or partially slowing down the audio signal, transform epic leads into heavy basses, and add some “tape stop” effect with precision either by touching the X/Y Stop trigger, or by dialing in precise sequence automations. \n\nTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:\n\nBLEASS Slow Machine offers both sequenced and live ways to manipulate time thanks to 3 stages:\n\n____ SLOW DOWN stage:\nCreative and straightforward slow down effect that modulates both rhythm and pitch.\n\n- Loop Size: Slow Down resets its reading position according to the Loop Size. A Loop Size of ‘1 bar’ means that the reading position is resynced with the host reading position every 1 bar.\n- Speed: controls the speed of the played loop relative to the default speed. (For example ‘½’ means that audio is played back at half its original speed, which means one octave lower).\n- Quantization: When this option is ON, every change in Loop Size and in Speed will wait until the end of the current loop to be effective. When it is set to OFF, the change is immediate.\n- Filter: keep a selected frequency band of the slowed signal. When the filter is ON, the middle colored band is processed by the effect while the low and high bands remain unchanged.\n- Fade: Sets the duration of the crossfade between loops.\n- State: Activates or deactivates the SLOW DOWN stage\n- Dry/Wet: mixes the dry and wet signals\n \n____ TIME STOP stage: \nEspecially made for performance, TIME STOP gives an intuitive and visual way to instantly create a classic tape stop effect.\n \n- Trigger: the “Stop” button triggers the time stop effect within a given duration (set by the position of your finger along the Y-axis) and following a curve (set by the position of your finger along the X-axis).\n- Mode: choose between 4 time stop modes: ‘Step’, ‘Ramp Up & Down, ‘Ramp Down’ and ‘Ramp Up’.\n_ In ‘Step’ mode, the speed instantly goes to 0 when the trigger is hit and goes back to 1 when the trigger is released.\n_ In ‘Ramp Up & Down’ mode the speed is ramped down to 0 when the trigger is hit and ramped up to 1 when it is released. The duration and curve of the ramp is set by the position of your finger on the control.\n_ In ‘Ramp Down’ mode, the speed is ramped down to 0 when the trigger is hit and instantly goes back to 1 when released.\n_ In ‘Ramp Up’ mode the speed instantly goes to 0 when the trigger is hit and is ramped up to 1 when released.\n- Hold: when Hold is ON, the trigger is not released until Hold is turned OFF.\n- Speed: precise control of the play speed.\n- State: Activates or deactivates the TIME STOP stage\n- Dry/Wet: mixes the dry and wet audio signals\n \n____ SPEED SEQUENCER stage:\nThe speed sequencer stage offers a unique way to program speed variations in your music.\n \n- Length: sets the number of steps in the sequencer.\n- Resolution: sets the duration of a sequencer step.\n- Grid Snap: when ON, steps snap to the grid allowing a precise  rhythmic and harmonic editing.\n- Sequencer: sets a playing speed per step. Each step has 4 different curve modes: ‘Step’, ‘Link’, ‘Ramp Up’ and ‘Ramp Down’. Change the curve mode by tapping the curve icon at the bottom of each step.\n- Amount: controls the amount of sequencer speed modulation. 100% means that speed can go from 1 to 0 (50% means that speed can go from 1 to 0.5).\n- Randomness: sets the amount of randomness of the sequencer. If randomness is 50%, a step value will be a random value between stepValue +/- 0.5\n- Fade: controls the crossfade duration between each step.\n- State: Activates or deactivates the Speed Sequencer stage\n- Dry/Wet: mixes the proportion of dry and wet signals\n\nCheck out www.bleass.com for video tutorials and more info!\n\n\n* PLEASE NOTE: this is an Audio Unit Effect plugin (AUv3) which requires a compatible host such as AUM, GarageBand, Cubasis, BM3 or Auria. Standalone mode also available for demo purposes."

      "label": "Benny Greb, well known for his contributions to the drumming education community, shared the approach that he has taken personally to develop his sense of groove and improve his own timing on his instrument in his course “The Art and Science of Groove”. Now with the Gap Click app, everyone can practice his method easily with a simple-to-use app! \n\nUnlike standard metronomes which simply state the time, Gap Click helps you improve your sense of time. Gap Click is more than a metronome with a focus on improving your ability to keep tempo, become more aware and comfortable with off beat clicks and by that, become bullet proof and accurate with all notes of the subdivision.\n\nGAP CLICK\nBy scrolling through the numbers of bars and patterns you can quickly configure a “gap” of time in which the metronome drops out. When the “one” comes back around, will your playing still be in time? How long of a gap can you play through and still maintain solid tempo?\n\nMOVING CLICK\nNext you can experiment with all kinds of off-beat patterns in the Gap Bar which moves the click from the downbeat position to a different location. Can you still play your instrument and maintain the downbeat internally even when you hear the click sound on an off-beat?\n\nBoth the “click” and the “gap” portion supports a variety of different syncopated patterns allowing you the ability to practice in binary or ternary rhythms - with more or less safety net depending on your settings.\n\nFeatures\n• Ability to choose from a variety of different syncopated patterns and # of measures for both the standard \"click\" as well as the \"gap\"\n• Use the nostalgic click wheel to find the right tempo or tap to set your desired tempo from 10 to 300bpm\n• Standard quarter-note time signatures: 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4\n\nPersonalize\n• See visual feedback for each note or rest that is played\n• Accent beat 1 of each measure or turn accents off for a greater challenge\n• Flash the screen for a visual indication when switching from the \"click\" to the \"gap\"\n• Find your favorite sound from a variety of click samples hand-picked by Benny\n\nBuy Once, Use Forever\n• There are no In-App Purchases - a one time purchase includes all current and future features. \n\nTESTIMONIALS\nWhat professionals are saying about GAP CLICK:\n• \"The skills you can sharpen by using this app are integral for what it takes to be a professional drummer in any genre.\" - Matt Halpern\n• \"When I first opened the app, it made (simple) sense, without a tutorial.\" - Chris Coleman\n• \"This app helps you lock in the pocket on a whole different level.\" - Luke Holland\n• \"The Gap Click app is something that every drummer should have in their toolbox.\" - Jared Falk, Drumeo\n\nWhat our users are saying about GAP CLICK: \n• \"If you think you have good timing, this will really put you in your place.\"\n• \"Gone are the days of programming gap clicks!\"\n• \"I’ve never had so much fun being destroyed in my practice session.\"\n• \"This is by far the best money I’ve ever spent on a practice tool.\"\n\nABOUT BENNY GREB\nBenny Greb is one of the most respected drummers in the world today. Not only has he headlined nearly every major drum festival and toured with his clinics and drum camps worldwide, but he is also recognized as a composer and bandleader in his own band Moving Parts, which won him the renowned “ECHO Jazz” award - the German equivalent to The Grammys in jazz.\n\nBenny Greb published two of the most successful and critically acclaimed educational products, “The Language of Drumming” and “The Art and Science of Groove” and he has helped create many signature products available to drummers today.\n\nFind him online at https://www.bennygreb.de as well as on social media."

      "label": "DigiStix 2 is an AUv3 compatible drum machine and sampler plugin for your favourite DAW.\n\nThis new version of DigiStix brings some distinct advantages over its predecessor, most notably the ability to host up to 64 samples per drumkit with 5 layers per pad. The interface has been drastically redesigned for iPad to make better use of full screen mode, allowing a popular MPC style 4x4 pad layout with 4 banks of samples. Digistix 2 also allows greater control over the multi-sample layers, with the ability to individually control the volume levels and pitch of layers as well as global pitch and tune settings all from the new sample window.\n\nPreviously, each pad had effect sends for the internal reverb and delay effects, but this can now be routed to external busses 9 and 10 for processing using external effects. \n\nThe controller editing is now build into the main display and can be edited in place without the need to scroll the interface. It also now supports extra effect controllers. A new context aware control window allows you to quickly change pad settings without the need for popup windows. \n\nDigiStix 2 now supports GM and original DS drum kit layouts, and includes a sophisticated multi-layer Auto Sampler, capable of recording new GM compatible drumkits automatically from your hardware. It is 100% backward compatible with the original app, and can be used as a drop-in replacement.\n\nDrag and drop support now allows you to directly drop samples on specific layers, as well as preview and edit them directly. You can create new kits by simply combining banks from existing kits into one mega kit, or use our non destructive referencing to include sounds from other kits.\n\nThe randomize feature has been enhanced so you can randomize individual instruments or within specific banks. The new continuous MIDI learn mode makes custom mapping a breeze.\n\nPatterns can also be exported as MIDI stems for use in other packages including a direct import to Helium clips. You can also export patterns as audio in the latest version.\n\nThe auto sample feature allows automated recording of GM compatible kits directly from hardware drum machines. The slice editor can also be used for MPC style slicing of audio clips.\n\nFeatures:\n\n• 64 Assignable Pads (4 banks of 16 pads).\n• Advanced Randomize Pattern feature.\n• Internal & external effect routing.\n• Mix and match different kits with drum references.\n• Up to 64 beats per pattern.\n• Songs up to 255 patterns in length.\n• Reverse Mode, Triplets and Accents.\n• Supports Mute Groups.\n• Multi-layer and Round Robin modes.\n• DS and GM MIDI Mapping.\n• 64 channel Mixer.\n• 8 band EQ.\n• Randomize Feature.\n• Sophisticated Auto Sampler\n• Export loops to audio and MIDI formats.\n• Looping Mode with Time Stretching.\n• Build in Delay, Reverb, Overdrive, Bit Crunch and LP/HP Filters.\n• Paramter Automation from your DAW.\n• Local and Remove MIDI Sync.\n• Built in Sampler.\n• Multi-bus/outputs when using AUM\n• Multiple Import options.\n• Melodic Remapping.\n• MIDI Mapping.\n• Real time and Step pattern recording. \n• iTunes and Filer importing of samples.\n• Files App Drag & Drop Support\n• Sample Slicer"

      "label": "Creating sounds with time-varying timbre, on your mobile device.\nKORG iWAVESTATION - A wave sequence synthesizer for iOS.\n\nThe WAVESTATION synthesizer went on sale in 1990. This instrument featured an advanced vector synthesis system which created new sounds by combining and connecting multiple waveforms; it provided a mix/morphing function that let you use a joystick to change the balance of four oscillators, and a distinctive wave sequence function that allowed you to place waveforms in a desired sequence to create sequence patterns. To this day, it continues to be considered a legendary and still-unique instrument.\n\nNow in 2016, the WAVESTATION has been reborn as \"KORG iWAVESTATION,\" an app for iPad/iPhone. In addition to completely reproducing the programs, it also features a renewed design that lets everyone experience the stupendous sound-shaping potential of the WAVESTATION. It features touch-based operation that's distinctive of iOS, in conjunction with a new graphic interface that allows you to visualize and edit the time-varying timbral changes that are distinctive of the WAVESTATION. \n\n[ Features ]\n\n- A faithful reproduction of the original WAVESTATION sound: In addition to providing the sounds from all PCM memories of the WAVESTATION, the new iWAVESTATION also reproduces in software every detail of the parameters, based on an analysis of the original hardware circuit diagram.\n\n- A new wave sequence view that can be graphically controlled: The iWAVESTATION, we advance another step with a graphical user interface that takes advantage of the touch operations that are a characteristic of iOS. Even more than ever, we've updated the screen design with an emphasis on creating sequences.\n\n- 1,500 sounds, more than 700 waveforms, 55 effects, and a powerful random sequence engine: This new instrument includes a stupendous number of presets and waveforms, covering all models of the series. iWAVESTATION also provides a new random sequence function which will give you different perspectives to inspire new sounds.\n\n- Produce music together with KORG Gadget integration: iWAVESTATION can be used in conjunction with the \"KORG Gadget\" music production DAW app that has won numerous awards around the world. If both apps are installed, it can be used as the \"Milpitas\" gadget inside the KORG Gadget app.\n\nMore info at korg.com"

      "label": "The next evolution in music software. Powerful wavetable sound. \nThe next generation ELECTRIBE produces state-of-the-art dance music.\n\nThe ELECTRIBE series first appeared in 1999. Since then each generation has inherited the iconic, intuitive operability of the original while incorporating the most up-to-date sounds and styles.\n\nThe ease of use, accessibility, sound and musicality of the ELECTRIBE reach new heights in this latest software version which features a powerful wavetable sound source, a “Quick Input” sequencer and a convenient chord pad that allows you to play a chord with one finger. Even if you aren't a musical virtuoso, with ELECTRIBE Wave you can create state-of-the-art dance music like EDM, Future Bass, and Trap.\n\n• Powerful wavetable sound suitable for the latest in EDM\nELECTRIBE Wave has a sound wavetable featuring sounds widely used in the latest music creation. Unlike a PCM synth, the wavetable allows you to repeatedly play fragments of short waveforms, and change the waveform position during playback. By combining the wavetable (which features a rich variety of presets) with a powerful filter and two modulation units, you can create an infinite number of innovative and sharp sounds that cannot be produced using standard PCM synths. Even without a deep knowledge of synthesis techniques, the carefully selected parameters make it easy to craft your sound.\n\n• Improved user interface for quick composition\nThe familiar 16-step pad in the ELECTRIBE series enables speedy rhythm production. The ELECTRIBE Wave also features a new keyboard to play chords and scales. Even without musical knowledge, you can have fun making tracks without worrying about wrong notes. The sequencer features Groove, which can be used to breathe life into rhythm parts, as well as a special keyboard to enable smooth step input for synth parts on the graphical user interface.\n\n• Convenient chord pad that allows you to play a chord with one finger\nELECTRIBE Wave features a chord pad that allows you to play  chords with one finger. If you use the \"Fetch\" function, it will automatically extract the chords from the song that you are in in the middle of creating and assign those chords to the pad for fast and easy song creation. You can also easily assign and save your favorite chords. In addition you can use the arpeggiator to create new phrases!\n\n• Motion Sequence records and plays temporal changes in sounds and effects\nThe ELECTRIBE series introduced a powerful motion sequence function that remembers and reproduces the movements of the knobs. ELECTRIBE Wave now offers this function for the synthesizer/drum parts so you can create a flow of sound overflowing with originality. If you use the built in KAOSS PAD you can change the sound to drastically with a single fingertip, easily storing and reproducing  temporal changes. Remember the wave table POSITION to make real time minute changes to the sound performance.\n\n• Song mode can combine patterns into finished songs\nUse song mode to create a new track by simply arranging the order of existing patterns. Using only the ELECTRIBE Wave, you can take a song all the way from inspiration to completion. With audio file export, you can send a complete song or individual patterns to your favorite DAW, or upload to services like SoundCloud.\n\nMore info at korg.com"

      "label": "NanoStudio 2 is a powerful music production environment for synthesis, sampling, arranging, editing and mixing. It’s the successor to the original NanoStudio, an app held in high regard by musicians for many years for its usability, quality and productivity.  \n\nNanoStudio 2 builds upon the same design principles as its predecessor and introduces a huge range of extra features.  An all-new audio engine delivers truly professional sound quality, highly optimized to handle complex projects with large numbers of instruments and effects.\n\nNanoStudio 2 hosts external Audio Unit (AUv3) instruments and audio/MIDI effects.  A library of all your AU instruments and presets is maintained so they’re tagged, searchable and just as accessible as NanoStudio’s own internal instruments.\n\nObsidian is NanoStudio’s built-in synth.  It has 3 oscillators with 32 note polyphony and 7 different synthesis methods including analogue, wavetable, FM, multi-saw and phase distortion.  It also supports samples and multisamples which may be split by note or velocity. Obsidian has 18 different filter types, including resonant analogue, super clean digital, formant, comb and waveshaping. Nearly every parameter can be modulated via the synth’s 5 envelopes, 5 LFOs and 10 configurable macro controllers, and modulation connections can be assigned with just a few taps.  300 factory patches are supplied with macros set up and ready to go.  It’s easy to create your own patches and there are many more professionally produced patches available as IAP.\n\nSlate is NanoStudio’s second built-in instrument, a sample/synthesis-based performance pad which makes it easy to tap out drum beats.  Slate comes with 500 quality factory samples ranging from multisampled acoustic drums with natural variations through to cutting-edge electronic percussion and effects. 50 factory kits are include, and it’s easy to construct your own drum kits using the factory samples or your own. Slate can also be used with samples of just about anything: vocals, guitar riffs, synth pads – you name it.\n\nThere are powerful editors for song arrangement, MIDI, automation and samples.  All share a consistent user interface so you’ll be up to speed with them and making music in no time.\n\nA fully-featured sequencer supports tempo and time signature tracks (including tempo ramps) and Ableton Link.\n\nEverything’s brought together by a mixer with unlimited tracks, track grouping and audio/MIDI sends.  Tracks may have an unlimited number of insert effects with 11 built-in effects to choose from including reverb, sidechain compressor/expander, EQ with spectrum analysis, look-ahead limiter, delay, exciter, chorus, flanger and phaser.  You can add AU audio/MIDI effects to the chain and use them just like an internal effect.\n\nThere are many mixdown options available with quality settings up to 32 bit/96kHz and support for file formats including wav, aiff, ogg and M4A.  You can mixdown track stems in a single operation or select just a region of the song - great for resampling.\n\nNanoStudio supports Audiobus and has many options for file sharing via the iOS Files app, Dropbox, AudioShare, iTunes File Sharing, AirDrop, email, WebDAV and importing music from your iTunes library.\n\nDevelop your initial musical ideas through to a final master with an intuitive workflow designed to get things done."

      "label": "From the imagination of legendary keyboardist Jordan Rudess and the software engineering excellence of French audio developer BLEASS comes SampleWiz 2. This unique S&S (sample-and-synthesis) instrument marks the 10 year anniversary of Jordan’s first version of SampleWiz, and combines modern features such as granular and cloud sample engines, with the satisfying, rapid workflow of classic hardware samplers.\n\nOver a career spanning more than 40 years (and counting), Jordan Rudess has built a formidable reputation. His exquisite skills as a keyboardist have graced the recordings and tours of Dream Theater, David Bowie, Liquid Tension Experiment and Rod Morgenstein to name but a few. Jordan is also recognised as something of a savant in the world of sound design, and has collaborated over many years with synth manufacturers such as Korg, Moog and IK Multimedia. And as if that weren’t enough feathers for one cap, Jordan is a pioneer in the use of iOS in music creation and performance, and has worked on numerous groundbreaking music apps over the last decade, for example Geoshred and Morphwiz. \n\nWith this new collaboration, BLEASS has distilled the phenomenal breadth and depth of Jordan’s musical knowledge and experience into an intuitive and inspirational synthesizer that has the flexibility to expand the creativity of each and every musician.\n\nBLEASS SampleWiz 2 unleashes your sonic creativity and the power of your iPad or iPhone. With just a few swipes of your finger you can easily capture any sound and transform it into a playable, expressive, gorgeous-sounding synth voice. \n\nBLEASS SampleWiz 2 fits in with your way of creating and performing too, with both standalone app and AUv3 plugin included. And as well as operating as an instrument, the plugin can be used as an effect, making it wonderfully easy to sample and resample from any other instrument or track within your host app. \n\nBLEASS SampleWiz 2 includes a number of performance interfaces, and takes full advantage of MPE to enhance expressiveness and playability. Play using any of the different keyboard views – half-screen, full-screen or double-layer, or using BLEASS’ innovative full screen Wave Keyboard view.\n\nThe synth is as easy and fun to program as it is to play. The UI has been carefully designed to give a natural, intuitive workflow, with delightfully simple sampling and a comprehensive suite of tools for chopping, granularizing, modulating, and adding effects to your sound designs. These are distributed across six tabs :\n\nGENERAL\nSet the basic synth properties, such as voices, glide, MPE modulation targets, and arpeggiator.\n\nSAMPLE\nCapture and edit samples and loop points, and configure the granular engine.\n\nFILTER/ADSR\nConfigure SampleWiz 2’s overdrive processor and multi-mode filter, and set up ADSR envelopes for amp and filter cutoff.\n\nMODULATION\nBLEASS SampleWiz 2 has a pair of freely assignable LFOs (Low Frequency Oscillators) and a third ADSR envelope. Each source can be assigned to up-to two destinations.\n\nMOTION\nBLEASS’ unique Motion Sequencer generates rhythmic movement and repeating patterns of modulation values that can be assigned to any two modulation destinations.\n\nFXs\nSweeten your sound and add some final polish with delay and reverb processors.\n\n\n\nFind more information about BLEASS SampleWiz 2 on www.bleass.com/samplewiz2"

      "label": "Steel Guitar PRO is a highly advanced guitar processor that combines cutting-edge realtime audio generation with a truly expressive control interface. It provides many unique guitar models, built-in amps & FX processing, MIDI control, AUv3, and wide-ranging customizability.\n\n:: Control Surface ::\n\nSteel Guitar PRO features a powerful yet familiar control interface. Simply touch the strings to “pick,” and drag the slide bar to modulate pitch. By enabling enhanced slide control, you can even use multiple touches to tilt the slide bar, or dampen the strings. Fretboard dimension, string spacing, and pick guard size are all configurable. A high level of resolution enables minute pitch control and realistic vibrato. Settings let you vary guitar tone, sustain and release times, touch behavior, slide bar auxiliary control, handedness, and more.\n\n:: Guitars ::\n\nSteel Guitar PRO provides you with an arsenal of guitars to choose from: unique examples of humbuckers, single coils, P90s, and more. Instruments include many 6 string guitars, as well as 8- and 10-string steel guitar variants. Each family of instruments comes with many tuning to choose from, but you can also create and save your own. In addition, you have up to seven virtual “pedals” to bend individual or collections of string — much like a pedal steel. The pedals can be actuated by slightly tilting the device, or via MIDI, or even with the fretting touch. All of this is configurable by the user.\n\n:: Built-In FX Processing ::\n\nSteel Guitar PRO incorporates a virtual signal chain where you can put amps and FX in any combination. The included dozen amps and 20 FX are all custom tuned to evoke the best tones from the guitar processor. Each amp or effect features multiple parameters to precisely modify its tone and feel. These parameters are MIDI-mappable, so that you can control them via an external device. The amp collection covers a broad spectrum from bell-like cleans to thick overdrive. The FX include many analog inspired “pedals” that range from overdrives, distortions, mods, delays, reverbs, to beyond.\n\n:: AUv3 & MIDI ::\n\nSteel Guitar PRO can also be used as an AUv3 MIDI plugin. We developed a custom MIDI sub-protocol so that Steel Guitar PRO and its powerful control interface can run seamlessly inside an AUv3 host. You can also use a traditional MIDI keyboard or device to play Steel Guitar PRO, which readily accommodates MIDI pitch & mod wheels, and key velocity as well. \n\n:: Useful Features ::\n\nSteel Guitar PRO includes a comprehensive preset management system that allows you to save, modify, and share any number of your “rigs.” The standalone app also includes a handy “tape deck” where you can record, play, loop and import/export audio. MIDI learn feature is easy and intuitive to use, but also offers deeper customization. All audio processing is done in the highest resolution, natively and without resampling at rates up to 96kHz. The fluid user interface integrates readily with many different AUv3 hosts."

      "label": "As seen on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon -- Create music with Loopy HD by layering looped recordings of singing, beatboxing, or playing an instrument with a savvy, sophisticated, tactile looper that totally reinvents the formula.\n\nhttps://loopyapp.com\n\n-- “This is the best loop station on the iPhone” -- Dub FX (dubfx.net) \n-- “I pretty much own every mobile looper out there and Loopy is HANDS DOWN the best. Super simple interface with powerful features.” -- J. Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support. Please contact me with questions, bug reports, feature ideas, and other feedback at support@atastypixel.com or https://forum.loopyapp.com. I may be able to fix your issue in less time than it would take to write a negative review!"

Great job!\" - Freddy47, User Review\n-------------------------------------\n\n7 Chords is a comprehensive library of guitar chords for your iPhone that is suited for beginners as well as for intermediate guitar players.\n\nUnlike most other programs 7 Chords uses the clear and understandable tab notation you already know from your guitar book / fingering chart. Picking a chord is very easy: just pick the base tone and variety of the chord on the pick-wheel, then select the voicing by sliding through the chord pages.\n\n7 Chords shows chord name, the frets to play, the fingers to use (including information like barré) and also the actual tones played. The chord dictionary contains more than 1500 of the most common guitar chords for your electrical or acoustic guitar. \n\nSupported chord varieties are: sus2, sus4, 5, +, 6, 7, 7sus4, o7, 7b5, 7+5, 7b9, 7#9, maj7, 9, 11, 13, m, m6, m7, m7b5, mMaj7, m9, +9, maj9, Cmaj7b5.\n\nSimply tap or double tap the chord to hear it on your iPhone speaker."

      "label": "Bebot is a musical instrument that anyone can play. Instead of a keyboard, it has an easy-to-use touch control system. And it's all built into a friendly animated robot, who performs your music while you play.\n\nAlthough it looks simple on the outside, inside is a powerful synth engine which lets you create and edit your own sounds and apply effects. The controls are easy to use, making it fun to tinker and experiment with sound. If you just want to get playing, there's also a wide selection of preset sounds.\n\nThe touch control system lets you lock in a scale so that you'll never play a wrong note, which makes it easy to play, even on your iPhone. It's polyphonic, which means you can use multiple fingers at once to play chords and harmonies. Plus, you can perform sweeping slides and expressive gestures that would be practically impossible on a regular keyboard.\n\nWhile it's designed to be simple and fun, that doesn't mean it's only for beginners. Bebot has been used both on stage and in the studio by accomplished musicians and performers including Dream Theater, How To Destroy Angels and The Flaming Lips.\n\nTo see and hear Bebot in action, check out the demo videos at normalware.com, including a walkthrough demo by keyboard wizard Jordan Rudess.\n\nNow with Audiobus and Inter-App Audio, you can connect Bebot to other apps such as GarageBand to record, multitrack and add effects, making Bebot more versatile and useful than ever.

VoiceJam was designed from the ground up to be a live performance tool.

The length of your audio recordings are only limited by the storage available on your device.\n\nVoiceJam was created by TC-Helicon, the world's #1 professional audio company dedicated 100% to the needs of singers.  Visit us online:\n\nwww.tc-helicon.com   \n\nFeatures:\n\n- Get started right away with an easy to follow audio tutorial, walking you through all the important features.\n- Instantly record and layer to 6 separate loops, jumping between them at will.  Loops can be up to 60 seconds long.\n- On-the-fly undo, reverse, loop 2x, loop mixing, and instant loop re-triggering.  All features can be used live without stopping the action.\n- Record your entire performance (looping, singing, and audio FX) to a single audio file and share it online using SoundCloud.\n- Share audio with any 3rd party App that supports the AudioCopy open standard.\n- Sing through emulations of TC-Helicon's professional hardware vocal effects\n- Included Vocal Effects:\n\nVoiceTone E1 Echo & Tap Delay\nVoiceTone C1 HardTune & Correction\nVoiceTone R1 Vocal Tuned Reverb\n\n- Use across all your iOS devices **:  Universal App supports iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad \n\n** Minimum requirements: iOS 6.1, iPhone 4/4s/5/5s or newer, iPad 2 or newer, iPod Touch 4th gen or newer\n\nFor the best possible experience, grab a pair of headphones and let your creativity run wild.  \n\nAfter you download VoiceJam, we suggest you press the info icon and run through the hands-on tutorial.

Tap on it to connect then select the music you want to stream.\n\n√ For a PC running Windows, start Windows Media Player, your iPhone Music will show under 'Other Libraries'.\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ IMPORTANT ◆◆◆◆◆\n\n• AirMusic is not compatible with Apple Music.\n\n• AirMusic is compatible with iCloud as long as songs have been downloaded onto your phone. Tap the little cloud download icon next to each song or album in the Music app to download them.\n\n• If AirMusic is not detecting all songs, try toggling Sync Library under iOS Settings > Music.\n\n• AirMusic requires an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch with a minimum of 50MB of disk space to work effectively. \n\n• AirMusic is not compatible with old DRM songs purchased on iTunes.

Perfect for instruments that require your 2 hands.\n\nSTEREO TRACKS    [Added In Version 1.5]\n• Pan your tracks in the stereo field.\n\nTRACK MUTING    [Added In Version 1.2]\n• Very useful for switching between a track you use as a chorus and another one you use as a verse. Optionally quantizable to loop.\n\nMETRONOME\n• Metronome track generator to create a X clicks at Y BPMs base track.\n\nAUDIO COPY/PASTE    [Added In Version 1.2]\n• Copy and paste tracks to and from other audio apps. Great for using that nice beat you laid down in BeatMaker as a \"de luxe\" metronome.\n\nMIDI CONTROLLERS    [Added In Version 1.5]\n• Record, Play/Pause and Stop can be triggered by a MIDI controller.\n\nLATENCY COMPENSATION    [Added In Version 1.2]\n• For you tracks to be perfectly synchronized.

Built around Akai Professional’s history in synthesis and drawing on the newest MINIAK synth, SynthStation sounds great and offers wide-ranging sonic flexibility with its virtual analog synthesis.\n\nFrom the moment you start SynthStation, you'll know your way around. It is jam-packed with tools to help you create music with the convenience of your touch screen and each section works the way you work. With SynthStation, you can create and save sequences and complete songs. The app contains three different three-oscillator synths and a range of drum kits you can sequence and mix right in the SynthStation. For creating melodic and accompaniment parts, the SynthStation contains an arpeggiator with preset patterns, built-in effects and filters, and an XY touch control interface for expressive control of key parameters.\n\nPERFORM\nPlay with keys, XY and arpeggiator controls. This is perfect place to make magic happen because it gives you access to all the common controls you’ll need in a performance or creation setting.\n\nSYNTH\nComplete synthesis controls from oscillators to LFOs, envelopes, and more. You can control a wide range of filters to dial in exactly the sound you need. Choose from Sine, Triangle, Square or Sawtooth on your VCO and start creating your own signature sounds from scratch. Filter Cutoff and Resonance are just two taps away.\n\nDRUMS\nIn addition to SynthStation's three synthesizers, we've included drum kits and a visual representation of the most iconic beat making tool in the world - MPC pads. Just pick your kit and start tapping beats anywhere, anytime. Includes:\n\nDrum Kit – select the drum kit and play it with onscreen pads.\n\nDrum Edit – tune, mix, and customize your drums.\n\nSEQUENCER\nKeyboard grid – see your keyboard sequencing and edit notes easily.\n\nDrum grid – build and modify drum tracks with a visible sequencer grid.\n\nSONG/SEQUENCE\nSelect and save your Song/Sequence projects. You can recall your Songs and work on them later, and even export them for further editing in your desktop audio applications.\n\nCONTROL\nXY – two axes of control for hands-on, real-time control. Just like a joystick, the XY controller can snap back to the zero point.\n\nTempo – control tempo and even tap in the tempo you want.\n\nMIXER\nThe Mixer in SynthStation includes touch-controlled faders for each of the three synthesizers and the drum section as well as FX send for each. \n\nMixer – mix all the levels of the parts and effects. Just like a hardware mixer, there are faders, mutes, and effect routing.\n\nEffects – select and control FX type and parameters.\n\nSynthStation Studio enables you to create and produce music anywhere on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad."

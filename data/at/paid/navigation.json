The app offers conversions for the Swissgrid coordinate system in Switzerland and for various WGS84 formats. Furthermore, the typed coordinates or the current location can be displayed on the map. The map needs an internet connection. In addition, the app offers various tools such as ASCII, numbers to letters, text to numbers, rotation, bearing and distance between two coordinates, prime numbers checker, waypoint projection with current position, Roman numerals, temperature units, number systems, Wherigo Reverse solver, tool for Multi-Cache with calculator.\nSwissGEO Tools was in 2012 the first app which had interactive code tables. The big collection of interactive code tables continues to be an important part of CacheToolBox. Outdoors, you can decode the encrypted messages smartly with the \"symbol keyboards\" which were displayed in plain text without any Internet connection. CacheToolBox now also offers the opposite way: simple encryption of plain text by keyboard in symbolic characters!\nThere are currently 108 code tables available.\nIn future, more tables and tools will follow in free updates! \n\nSummary of all functions of CacheToolBox:\n\ncurrent location\n\n- coordinates WGS84 DD.DDD°\n- coordinates WGS84 DD° MM.MMM°\n- coordinates swissgrid CH1903+\n- Indication of altitude\n- GPS accuracy\n- show location on map\n- copy coordinates from current location and insert within the app\n\ndiff. maps: Swiss Map® and OSM (automatic switching)\n\n- Swiss: Swiss Map@ scaling 1:25’000 with the option to show hiking trails\n- other countries: OSM\n- resolution of map: low – normal - high\n\ncoordinates conversion\n\n- convert WGS84 DD.DDD°\n- convert WGS84 DD° MM.MMM’\n- convert WGS84 DD° MM’ SS.SSS\"\n- convert swissgrid CH1903+\n- coordinates switching N-S and E-W\n- show location on map\n- copy/paste coordinates and insert within the app\n- share current position by mail, message, WhatsApp\n\ncode-tables\n\n- 108 interactive code-tables for decoding symbol characters\n- symbol keyboards decodes encrypted messages directly to letters\n- simple encryption of plain text by keyboard in symbolic characters\n- no internet connection needed\n- more code-tables will follow in free updates!\n\ntools\n\n- ASCII\n- morse code\n- numbers to letters: 0=A, 1=A, 26=A\n- letter to numbers: sum, digit sum, alternated, product\n- rotation: rot5, rot13, rot18, rot47 and shift by hand (caesar)\n- distance and bearing between two coordinates\n- prime numbers: check prime numbers, prime factorization, search prime number\n- waypoint projection: WGS84 with degree or artillery per milles, distance in meter or feet (english)\n- Roman numerals: convert Roman to arabic or vice versa\n- temperature units: celsius – kelvin – fahrenheit – rankine - réamur \n- number systems: binary – decimal – octal – hexadecimal and more\n- Wherigo Reverse solver\n- Tool for Multi-Cache with calculator\n\nInfo\n\n- settings\n- conversion unit length: meter – feet (english)\n- rate app\n- legal notice\n- link to support website\n\nlanguages\n\n- English\n- German\n- French"

      "label": "Theodolite was one of the earliest augmented reality (AR) apps for iOS when it debuted in 2009 -- in fact Theodolite was pioneering AR technology before \"AR\" was even a buzzword! In the time since, Theodolite has been used by millions of consumers and professionals in their outdoor adventures and on the job. Now, we've taken the Theodolite concept to Apple Watch by combining a compass, inclinometer, GPS, and maps into one indispensable app that sits on your wrist. We're excited to keep evolving this centuries-old instrument as hardware and software technologies allow the concept to come to new device formats.\n\nOn iPhone and iPad, Theodolite uses a viewfinder format, uniting the device sensors (GPS, magnetometer, gyro, accelerometer) and camera.  On Apple Watch, Theodolite combines data from these sensors into an AHRS (attitude and heading reference system) layout similar to what you'd see in the glass cockpit of a modern aircraft. This layout allows Theodolite to efficiently display compass bearing (yaw angle), pitch angle, and roll angle in a compact format that works extremely well on a small screen.  This information is augmented by latitude, longitude, and altitude from GPS, as well as sun and moon position.\n\nNew in Theodolite for Watch version 2 is a map screen and waypoint manager.  You can add waypoints on the map or at your current location, and view waypoints on the compass ring to visualize their bearing from your current location.\n\nTheodolite has settings for compass mode (true or magnetic), distance/altitude units (feet or meters), and position format (decimal degrees, degrees-minutes-seconds, MGRS, USNG, UTM, UTM-B, and Maidenhead Locator System).  Users can choose to display an artificial horizon in the center of the app display (tied to pitch and roll) and can set the app's level reference to flat or vertical orientations of the Watch.  The app has six color schemes, including two night vision modes - midnight red and luminescent green.\n\nTheodolite for Watch is recommended for Apple Watch Series 5 and later (including Ultra).  Apple Watch Series 4 and older do not have a compass sensor and will not show compass data.  On older devices, the app uses the device's gyro sensor to measure rotation.  You can twist the watch's digital crown to adjust and calibrate the gyro to the sun position, moon position, or a known bearing.  Using these references, the \"gyro compass\" is able to give bearing.  The calibration can be repeated as often as desired to give accurate results.\n\nTheodolite reports accuracy from the magnetometer sensor in your Watch.  To improve results, operate Theodolite away from magnets, electronics, or sources of electro-magnetic interference, including car dashboards, aircraft cockpits, metal structures, and other devices.\n\nLike all our apps, we plan to continually improve and evolve Theodolite for Watch.  Please contact us with feature requests, suggestions, and general feedback.  We'd love to hear what you're doing with the app!  And if you don't already have Theodolite for your iPhone or iPad, check it out!"

The app also includes 1:50k resolution satellite images for the island and elevation data.\n\nOther integrated data includes DOC open and restricted hunting permit boundaries, DOC huts, campgrounds, and tracks, Fish and Game access points, and Te Araroa trails. Other datasets can be imported.\n\nThe app has a full suite of navigation functions including GPS location, compass orientation, distance to map locations, track recording and graphing, route creation and following, import/export of gpx and kml files, search functions for named places and user data. Add and edit your own locations and routes and plot elevation profiles. Uses an intuitive simple interface, with one-touch access to all functions.\n\nLINZ TOPO250 series maps are used at lower zoom levels for easier navigation.\n\nPerfect for outback use out of cell phone range. GPS and maps function fully without phone coverage. No need to cache files in advance either as they are all fully installed with the app. Popular with trampers, hikers, runners, bikers, search and rescue (SAR), hunters, boaters, as well as survey applications.\n\nNote that continuous use of GPS will run down the battery faster than when not using the GPS. The NZTopo50 app gives you full control over when GPS is used. The map can be used without GPS, intermittently with GPS for spot checking of location, continuously for logging while the app is open, or for continuous background logging when the phone is off. \n\nCheck our website for links to user guides and useful tips and tricks.\n\nFeel free to get in touch with any suggestions."

      "label": "“Awesome!!! The best speed app on iphone” 5 Stars by kurtonic\n\nSpeed Box is a Speedometer and GPS app for both your iPhone and iPad. It displays your current speed, distance, direction and altitude along with your top speed and average speed. The app also keeps a record of the speed and altitude for the last few hours.\n\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n========================\n\n* MPH, KM/H and KNOTS\n* Show decimal speed (e.g. \"45.7 mph\")\n* One app for both the iPhone and iPad\n* \"Speak speed\" - Tap screen to have the speed spoken to you\n* 11 Analog and digital speedometers\n* Map view\n* Maximum and average speed\n* Altitude \n* Digital compass \n* HUD display to see speed in windshield \n* Odometer to measure distance traveled \n* Chart of the traveled speed and altitude \n* Warning signal when driving too fast \n* Export last 3 hours of data \n* Change maximum displayed speed on speedometer \n* Swipe finger over chart to display historic data \n* Display GPS accuracy by tapping the indicator in the top left corner \n\n\nUSER REVIEWS\n========================\n\n5 Stars by Darekakuta \n\"Just what I needed. My '58 chev's speedo doesn't work. This did the trick.\" \n\n5 Stars by Rawd \n\"Great My 79 Firebird speedo only goes to 140 kmh. ;). This worked perfectly.\" \n\n5 Stars \n\"Within 1 mile per hour +/- Great Job!\" \n\nSpeedBox was one of the very early Speedometer Apps for the iPhone. Take advantage of my experience and the refined algorithms that can get a much greater accuracy from the iPhone then a lot of other apps. I regularly update my application to make it even more accurate and usable. \n\nUsers have already used our application to verify the accuracy of their car's speedometer or they tried measuring the speed they achieved while skiing. Can you come up with more ideas? How about measuring the speed of the airplane you travel with? \n\nUSAGE NOTES\n========================\nThe \"GPS strength\" indicator in the top left corner should display a green dot. You can tap this indicator to display the current GPS accuracy.\n\nPlease allow the application up to a minute to find enough satellites to work correctly. \n\nIf you get a message to enable GSP, please go to ”Settings > General > Location Services“ on your iPhone and check if the little switch is set to \"On\" for Speed Box as well as for \"Location Services\" in general. \n\nATTENTION iPod touch users! Unfortunately this app doesn't work very well on the iPod touch and the iPad WiFI (without 3G) since these devices are missing a GPS!\n\n\nFEEDBACK\n========================\nIf you've got any wishes or suggestions for new features, please let me know with the contact form on this application's website (see link below).\n\nI am already working on the next update!"

Watch in full screen, view in AR, search, add filters and so much more!\n\nShip Finder has been top rated and top ranking since 2009 and covers most of the world, tracking 20,000+ ships simultaneously.\n\nOur incredible app performance means that you can see all tracked vessels at once - no clustering here!\nSimply tap a ship to see its name, type, photos, speed, dimensions and much more.\nPowerful features such as filters, search and the ability to save favourite ships are included. (You can choose Apple or Google maps too!).\n\nAdd and browse bookmarks to saved locations around the globe to quickly navigate to areas or ports of interest.\n\nYou can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. \n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

Using the GPS features of this app can significantly affect battery life. Only leave GPS enabled when you need to use it. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Pocket Earth only uses GPS in the background for route navigation and gps track recording features. \n   2. This app uses data from the amazing community driven open mapping project called openstreetmap.org!  Coverage detail may vary by region, please visit our website to check the map detail for your regions of interest.\n   3.

      "label": "Theodolite is a multi-function viewfinder that combines a compass, two-axis inclinometer, rangefinder, GPS, map, nav calculator, and geo-overlay photo/movie camera into one indispensable app. Theodolite was one of the very first augmented reality (AR) apps when it was released in 2009, and it’s been downloaded and used by millions of customers since then. Uses are endless, and the app is great for land measurements, outdoor sports, sightseeing, navigation, and finding your way around. Theodolite is a pro grade app and is used extensively by surveyors, geologists, architects, engineers, competitive sportsmen, first responders, military personnel, and search and rescue workers around the world. \n\nTheodolite lets you take data-overlay photos and movies with 2X-8X zoom. Overlay geographical data, angle markings, date/time, author/company info, and project notes directly on photos and movies for later reference. The same data is written into the metadata record of images, making image files self-contained data records. Third-party apps can tap into Theodolite's advanced camera functions with a camera sharing feature.\n\nView current position on the built-in map with optional offline Outdoors maps that include topo contours, roads, trails, landmarks, campgrounds, ski lifts, and more. Live map markers continually update distance/heading relative to the current location and also show wayfinding info in the main viewfinder. Draw polygons on the map to mark things like property boundaries and trails, and import/export polygon data via KML.\n\nShare map markers and nav calculator points with other users of Theodolite via text messages or e-mail. This powerful capability opens up a wide range of collaborative uses including team land surveying, accident investigations, spotting wild fires, triangulation of landmarks, and advanced tactical observation and targeting. With an optional in-app purchase to enable team tracking, you can share location with up to 20 people on Theodolite's map.\n\nTheodolite includes features for serious users like a reference angle mode, nav calculator, map marker import/export, manual and automatic data logging with CSV and KML export, clipboard integration, %grade display, mil compass readout, optical rangefinders (including a mil-based reticle, sniper-style stadiametric graphs, and a variable 4X-24X scope), and night filters to improve use in dark conditions.\n\nTheodolite can provide location in military grid reference system (MGRS) coordinates, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, British/Irish National Grids, US National Grid, Maidenhead locator system, Map Grid of Australia, and six latitude/longitude formats. Optional US State Plane coordinates include SPCS27 and SPCS83 zones covering all US States. The optional Datum Pack adds over 230 geodetic datums to the app to improve position computation from GPS data, covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.\n\nAR Layers include navigational aids like the sun, moon, planets, and Polaris (North star), and the optional US Mountain Summits layer that shows over 70,000 US mountain summits in the viewfinder.\n\nTheodolite has been shown in Apple Keynotes, featured on the App Store, and has been a #1 selling Navigation app in App Stores around the world. Since its introduction in 2009, Theodolite has defined augmented reality navigation. The app continually introduces new technologies, pushing the limits of iOS app development and taking advantage of new hardware capabilities.\n\nFind out why Apple named Theodolite one of the most amazing apps available and showed it being used to explore the Great Wall of China. Where will you take it on your next adventure?\n\nNote: Theodolite is an iPhone app -- see “Theodolite HD” for use on an iPad. And be sure to check out the all-new \"Theodolite for Watch\" and put Theodolite on your wrist!"

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer, GPS tracker and trip cost monitor for iPhones and cellular iPads. \n∙∙ When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! \n∙∙ The cost monitor shows you the current cost of the journey as you drive and tells you each passengers share. \n∙∙ GPS tracker records your trips so they can be analyzed, viewed and shared at any moment.\n\n‣‣ COST MONITOR. What's the cost of my driving?\nBased on gas price for a gallon or litre, MPG (U.S. or UK) or liters per 100 km the app will tell you what the cost is as you drive. You can add an extra cost per kilometer or mile! Useful for all cost aware drivers and for splitting the cost between passengers.\n\n‣‣ GPS TRACKING. Where I've been? How long did it take to get from A to B? \nSpeedometer records your trip statistics even when GPS tracker is switched off. When you need point by point data to see on the map later or export (Google Earth and GPX), speedometer gives you the first class GPS tracker.\n\n‣‣ INFOTAINMENT. \nWhen switched on, infotainment shows trip stats or weather/wind forecast  when you wait. Way better than just showing you a 0 speed!\n\n‣‣ Easy to set speed limits and SPEED LIMIT MEMORY option\nSet speed limits with 4 or 8 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! With SPEED LIMIT MEMORY you just apply the speed limit once and the app applies it for you automatically the next time!\n\n‣‣ MODES\nUse MENU>MODES to turn the app into a Rally computer, G-Force monitor, Camera alerter or taximeter! Currently there are 12 modes available and we are constantly adding new ones.\n\n‣‣ WAYPOINTS.\nSpeedometer gives you the unique way to leave a note with location and even optional photo or audio note attached! As easy as double tap on the big speed digits! You'll find more in a documentation section (star button).\n\n‣‣ RED LIGHT & SPEED CAMERAS\nImport camera data into speedometer in Garmin or iGO csv formats from poi-factory.com, scdb.info or poi-plaza and let speedo alert you on a camera approach and set speed limit automatically before you pass the speed camera!\n\n‣‣ SUNSET/SUNRISE\nWith the sunset and sunrise information that our speedometer provides, you'll be able to avoid driving in the dusk.\n\n‣‣ BARO VSI. Barometric Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI, IVSI) in both scale and graph forms.\n\n‣‣ VOICE COACH. When enabled and configured, voice coach will be telling you active track distance and duration as well as current speed and altitude.\n\n‣‣ MAPS. Google's native, Apple map, Blank map and Offline maps.\n\n‣‣ Siri shortcuts: New Track, Stop Track, Speed limits.\n\n+ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and cellular iPads. All in retina graphics.\n\n+ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KM/H AND KNOTS. Maximum/TOP, average speed, distance traveled.\n\n+ BACKGROUND MODE! Speedometer will work in background if told so and will still warn you with audio alert when exceed a preset speed limit. You can use other apps while speedometer does its job in the background!\n\n+ PRIVACY. Speedometer never shares your location data with 3rd parties or ad agencies. Location data is used solely for tracking your speed and recording the GPS tracks and never leave the app unless you decide to share by means of a track export. It always let you know when background mode is on and never runs in background unless it is explicitly told to do so.\n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone as well as on any cellular iPad. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS (external GPS module is required). \n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nDrive safely, keep the log and notes and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal companion no matter what journey you are going on!"

The program is especially adapted for the usage by glider, hangglider and paraglider pilots.  SkyLogger obtains the geodetic positions of the pilot during the flight and stores the data. Furthermore, the pilot is able to see during the flight the elapsed time, the distance to the take-off as well as the current ground speed and climb rate. A compass rose is indicating the current flight direction. \nFor competitions the pilot's and the aircraft's name, the aircraft's ID and the to be flown route can be entered.  During the flight the direction and distance to the next waypoint are shown on the display.\n\nAfter finishing the flight the stored geodetic data together with the data for the competition can be converted into the common IGC file format. Additionally, also other popular formats like GPX and KML are supported. The created files are stored on the iPhone or can be sent to servers or other computers.\n\nSkyLogger supports besides others the following features:\n\n - control by Apple Watch;\n - main data visualization on Apple Watch;\n - cockpit / instrument view;\n - 2D & 3D flight data visualization;\n - downloadable map data;\n - large and individually adaptable instruments on a moving map allow best viewing comfort;\n - north or in flight direction orientation of moving map;\n - live tracking support for Leonardo or Vgps servers\n - visualization of previously flown flights as track traces on moving map;\n - visualization of airspaces with user defined colors;\n - instrument showing the distance and direction to the closest airspace;\n - 3 axis acceleration measurements;\n - tracked flights are stored in highly efficient internal database;\n - default flight parameters can be stored and retrieved to make flight information entering for competitions easier;\n - SkyLoggerXXL supports common file formats like IGC, CSV, GPX and KML;\n - IGC files created by SkyLoggerXXL are OLC conform and can directly be sent to Leonardo, XCCup, XContest and XC globe based OLC servers;\n - calculation of XC points for FAI triangle, triangle and free distance over 5 points;\n - XC analysis (determination of FAI triangle areas);\n - printing of flightbooks, flight information and statistics\n - all diagrams, maps or charts can either be e-mailed or copied for incorporation into other apps;\n - integration of SkyView database for exchanging waypoints;\n - support of FlyNet accessories;\n - support of SensBox;\n - weather data history of selected weather stations for the last 48 hours;\n - online wind speed and direction visualization on maps for selected weather stations;\n - visualization of hotspots;\n - visualization of regions with thermals;\n - visualization of climb rate traces;\n - and much much more!\n\nWarning: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "BlindSquare is pioneering accessible navigation both indoors and outdoors. Know where you are, know where you're going, travel with confidence.\n\nBlindSquare is a new solution that combines the latest technology to help the blind with their daily lives. It has been developed in collaboration with blind people and carefully field tested. You need either an iPhone or an iPad to get started. It also supports some additional accessories to enhance the experience. \n\nHow does it work? \n\nBlindSquare uses GPS and the compass to locate you. It then gathers information about the surrounding environment from FourSquare. BlindSquare has some unique algorithms to decide what information is the most relevant and then speaks it to you with high quality speech synthesis. \n“What's the most popular café within 200 meters radius? Where is the post office or the library?” \n\nYou can control BlindSquare also through voice commands. The Voice Command feature is a premium service requiring purchase of credits for continuous use.  Voice Command Credits are available as an in-app purchase on the App Store.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a GPS solution:\n\nWhen you start the app, it will start telling you the interesting places and street crossings around you. By changing the radius, you can limit the area you are interested in. You can also search by search term or by category. You can select an interesting place from the search results and perform the following tasks:\n\n1) Get contact info (address, phone number) \n2) Open twitter feed or restaurant menu (if provided)\n3) Make a phone call\n4) Start tracking the place (BlindSquare will assist you by repeating the distance and the clock face direction)\n5) Start your favourite navigator for turn-by-turn instructions (TomTom, Navigon or Apple Maps)\n\nBlindSquare is aware of when you travel by car, bus or train and starts to report interesting places in front of you (for example, the next stops) and street crossings when you are passing them.\n\nYou can also save your own private places to iCloud so they will be found with your every device.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a Foursquare client:\n\nIf you like to play Foursquare, you can do the following with BlindSquare:\n \n1) Get a list of nearby FourSquare venues\n2) When you are in a place, you can check in by shaking your device\n3) Do a check in with commenting and twitter/facebook sharing\n4) Correct the location of the place\n\nBlindSquare supports the following languages: English, Arabic, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean (South Korea), Norwegian, Polish, Portugues, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\nVoiceOver usage is supported but it also includes higher quality additional speech synthesis by Acapela Text-To-Speech from Acapela Group.\n \nInstructions in English: https://www.blindsquare.com/user-guide/ and https://www.blindsquare.com/faq/\n\nPlease note: This app retrieves data in real time from Foursquare and Open Street Map. Use of a flat rate data plan is highly recommended.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nHaving only been released in May 2012, BlindSquare has already received several prizes and awards:\n\n - GSMA: Global Mobile Awards 2013, Best Mobile Health Product or Service\n - Apps4Finland 2012\n - OpenCities App Challenge 2012\n - The Finnish Information Processing Association: Best Product 2012\n\nPlease note: To use BlindSquare, your iCloud account has to be active so BlindSquare can access it to save your settings and places.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

Tasks like making a projection from a waypoint, determining a new waypoint using two other waypoints, determining the distance to these waypoints, calculating the value of a Roman numeral, and averaging waypoints are examples of what the toolkit can accomplish.\n\nImagine it’s lovely weather and you are walking in a beautiful surrounding. Walking with an intention, because you are geocaching and searching for caches.\n\nPicture you are at waypoint 3 of a multi cache and you’re asked to go to waypoint 4, which is 300 meter from this waypoint and 700 meter from the previous waypoint. Now what? Go home? Imagine you have a skilful toolkit with you to find your way. Imagine you have iGCT PRO, because you want to be ready for all these kind of challenges.\n\nBuy it now for a fixed low price (no in-app purchase necessary), since you never know if you have internet access the moment you need it most!\nThe choice is yours.\n\nComplete feature list:\n\nList of waypoints\n=================\n- Averaging a number of GPS readings for accurate coordinates\n- Manage a list of named waypoints\n- Search/filter list of waypoints\n- Show overview map with all (filtered) waypoints\n- Manually add a new waypoint\n- Edit latitude, longitude in WGS84, degrees, DMS, UTM, Dutch/Swiss XY\n- What3words\n- Compass navigation to selected waypoint\n\nCalculations\n============\n- Project new waypoint using distance/bearing\n- Distance/bearing between two known waypoints\n- Cross two wp/bearing lines\n- Cross wp/bearing line with circle around other wp\n- Cross two circles around 2 waypoints\n- Determine wp with same distance to 3 other waypoints\n- Cross two lines, each line connects two waypoints\n\nText to number\n==============\n- Calculate the sum of the character values in one or more words, the sum of all digits in this sum and finally sum the digits once more to typically arrive at one digit.\n- Choose between a=1, b=2 etc., the inverse a=26, b=25 etc. or the phone numbering abc=2, def=3 etc.\n\nEn/Decrypt\n===============\nVarious encryption and decryption methods typically used in geocache descriptions:\n- Rotate characters by N positions\n- Caesar (Rot13)\n- Morse\n- Vigenere \n\nNumbers\n=======\nConvert between these number systems:\n- Roman\n- Decimal (base 10)\n- Binary (base 2)\n- Hexadecimal (base 16)"

      "label": "More infos at gps-tracker-tool.de (support url).\n\nWHAT IT'S NOT\n- You can NOT track other phones with this app! This is a \"remote control\" for one of the dedicated hardware GPS trackers from the list of compatible models.\n- You cannot send SMS from iPod/iPad devices. However, you can still use the LIVE tracking features.\n\nMAJOR FEATURES\n- app will draft SMS commands for you - no need to carry around the tracker's manual\n- built-in compass for off-road navigation to tracker location\n- offers cell triangulation as fallback\n- reverse geocoding\n- administration of multiple trackers\n- visual set-up of geo-fence\n- configurable unit system (mi, km/h – m, ft)\n- quick commands = easy accessible custom commands\n- in-app purchases to enable the LIVE tracking features for some models: Trip history, trip start & end alerts, speed alert, geo fences, KML export\n\nINCOMING SMS\nYou just copy the whole incoming SMS and switch to the app. It will then try to match it against known formats. All data can then usually be visualized on the map. Please understand that iOS DOES NOT ALLOW to intercept incoming SMS automatically! Some tracker models can be monitored via the internet.\n \nSUPPORTED TRACKER MODELS\nAnywhere (TK 108),\nAsta (EV07S*),\nELRO (GPS1),\nConcox (GT02, GT011, GT 100),\nIncutex (TK 5000*, TK 104, TK 105*, TK 106, TK 116),\nmeitrack (VT 310 v6, VT 310 v7),\nPAJ* (Allround, Easy, Gold, Motorcycle, Mini, Personal, Power, Professional),\nSimvalley (GT 60, GT 170, GT 280),\nTKstar* (Bike, 720, 816 OBD, 901, 905, 909, 915),\nToplovo (TL 202),\nWonde Proud (SPT 10, VT 10),\nXexun* (TK 101, TK 102, TK 102-2, TK 102v6, TK 103, TK 103-2, TK 104, TK 106, TK 201, TK 201-2, TK 202, TK 203, TK 206, XT 009)\n* InApp live tracking via Internet for these models possible. After you made the tracker connect to the server, the feature can be activated with an InApp purchase.\nModel names might not always be unique amongst manufacturers, so if your tracker came with a manual, you can check for compatibility here: https://gps-tracker-tool.de/compatibility/ (see also support-url)\n\nKNOWN PROBLEMS\n- Please note that while you can send iMessages, you cannot send SMS from an iPad or iPod and therefore you would have very limited functionality on these devices. Still, an iPad would be a good choice for the LIVE tracking part.\n- Since iOS 10, short messages which contain links will be broken up into two. This makes copying a whole message impossible. You might have to miss out on the app's ability to visualize an incoming message from certain trackers.\n\n(If you experience any problem or have a feature request, please send us an e-mail. You find the address in the app's help section.)"

      "label": "This app puts the Mayan Dreamspell Calendar in your pocket! \"13:20:Sync makes it so much easier to understand and integrate the calendar into every day life. Highly recommend it.\" \n\nThe Mayan People have described, in breathtaking precision, the cycles of both the universe and nature around us. They created a harmonic calendar that is synchronized to all those cycles. Following these cycles can help you get a stronger connection with nature around you and become conscious of your essence.\n\nThis app provides a simple way to sync along those cycles, to raise our frequency and give us a new lens to view both our day-to-day and planetary events.\n\n- Did you ever realize that our (Gregorian) calendar is not a harmonic calendar? \n- Did you know that the moon has 13 (not 12!) orbits around the earth in 1 year? \n- Why do we live with this irregular calendar?\n- Are you interested in Astrology?\n\n-> All this, and more, is explained carefully in this app. (over 15.000 words on 37 pages) Please note that these text are in English language only.\n\nIn the New Time, synchronicity is the norm.\n\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n5 star rating across the world! \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\"Entertaining as well as enlightening\" \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\nMORE INFO: \nwww.1320sync.com \n\n\nFor the beginner this app is a learning tool because it contains an extensive explanation about Tones and Seals and the synchronizing order of the Mayan Astrology. You may think it's difficult at first but soon you will feel how it all connects. \n\n\"This app is great, and allows easy manipulation of dates. I spent years in books doing in hours what I can now do in seconds.\"\n\nFor the ones who are already familiar with the Mayan Calendar this app is a handy tool to navigate the cycles, and calculate the Combined Kin for any given combination. Furthermore this app can be of great assistance to teach other people about the 13:20 cycles and is used in teachings around the world.\n\n\n=== FEATURES ===\n\n+ Kin Calendar\nThis is your main Mayan Dreamspell Calendar Dashboard with all the details you need to stay in sync. Shows the Kin of today by default, and you can calculate the Kin for any other date.\n\n+ Personal Notes\nOn this new page you can keep your personal notes for the 2 main cycles of time: the Tzolkin cycle of 260 days and the 13 Moon cycle of 365 days. And with the powerful text search function you quickly find your notes.\n\n+ Kin Picker\nSelect any combination of the 13 Tones and 20 Seals. Top section can scroll to 4 pages with information.\n\n+ Combined Kin Calculator \nCalculate the Combined Kin of any combination of Kin. You can add as many Kin as you like to calculate the Combined Kin for a group of people. \n\n+ Tzolkin with indication of the GAP day's and Wavespell and more. Tap and hold to select a Kin number directly.\n\n+ Contact Import \nAll contacts in your Contacts App will be automatically imported and assigned to the correct Kin. See all your contacts with their Mayan Reading and how you relate to them. \n\n+ 13 Moon Calendar \nFull integration of 13 Moon Calendar. (doubles as a birthday calendar!) \n\n+ 13:20 Information \nLots of information about the theory behind synchronization to help you navigate the Mayan Dreamspell Calendar. The texts provide a clear explanation of the Cycles of Time. (More than 15.000 words on 37 pages) Please note that these text are in English language only.\n\n+ Sharing\nOn all the 3 main tabs you can share the current selected Galactic Signature using your favorite app. \n\n\n# Based on the work of José Argüelles.\n# This app was made with permission of and in cooperation with the Foundation for the Law of Time - www.lawoftime.org, \n# Ariel Spilsbury."

This information may not be accurate, due to the location accuracy, which is generally below fifteen metres but in some cases can be few tens of metres and to the Maps service, which might be unresponsive at certain times (Ariadne GPS will tell you if this is the case). The aim of Ariadne GPS is to give you an idea of your position and what is around you. Please do not completely rely on it.\n\nPlease note that the use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nFor more info and suggestions please visit http://www.ariadnegps.eu"

Sie sind z.B. Handelsvertreter, Außendienstler etc. - perfekt wir haben die Lösung! In unseren \"RouteOptimizer\" geben Sie einfach in beliebiger Reihenfolge Ihre Ziele ein - oder wählen sie direkt im Adressbuch aus. Als Ergebnis erhalten Sie die optimale Tourenplanung! Im besten Fall haben Sie Ihre Investition in die App nach der ersten Fahrt bereits an Kraftstoff eingespart.\n\nRouteOptimizer ersetzt also kein Navigationssystem sondern ermittelt die optimale Reihenfolge inkl. Wegbeschreibung der \"anzufahrenden\" Ziele, also eine Funktion über die kaum ein \"Navigationsystem\" am Markt verfügt - Sie können dann natürlich so, Ihre optimal ermittelte \"Zwischenziel\" Reihenfolge in Ihr Navigationssystem eingeben. Für jede einzelne \"Tourenplanung\" sind aufgrund der komplexen Berechnung bis zu 8 Ziele im Kauf enthalten. Dies lässt sich per InApp Kauf auf 16 oder max. 24 Zwischenziele erweitern, es handelt sich um einen InApp Kauf der nur einmalig ausgeführt werden muss kein Abo keine versteckten Kosten.\n\nWir wünschen Ihnen viele \"eingesparte\" Kilometer - egal ob Sie viele Ziele in einer Stadt anfahren müssen oder überregional unterwegs sind!\n\n(Das  berechnen der optimalen Route benötigt eine Datenverbindung).\n\n- RouteOptimizer Tourenplanung iPhone | iPad\n- Streckenübergabe direkt an Navigations App\n- Streckenbeschreibung"

      "label": "aSmartHUD is simple and clear vehicle digital dashboard featured by \n\n- HUD mode \n- SHORT-TERM WEATHER FORECAST \n- IPOD MUSIC PLAYLIST CONTROL\n- PHOTO CAMERA WITH IMAGE MARKING\n- ADJUSTABLE TRANSPARENCY APPLE MAPS SCREEN\n\nIt visualizes your \n- current speed,\n- average speed, \n- current time,\n- elapsed trip time, \n- heading, \n- altitude, \n- trip elapsed time,\n- distance/time/direction to home location,\n- weather forecast for nearest 48 hours the with 3-hour time interval,\n- direct distance (kilometers, miles, nautical miles supported) to the starting point of your trip.\n- maximum reached speed, altitude and distance to start point, for the current trip and all the trips your ever did.\n\nComparing with others HUD displays on the market - better look and more features for no price.\n\nTapping the \"HUD\" icon mirrors all the text, so if you position the iPhone horizontally under your car's windscreen you can see perfectly readable half-transparent reflection of the picture displayed. We love this mode! We found it much more convenient compared to traditional car dashboards (especially on the roads of Western Europe, which are full of speed cameras and where you need to watch your speedometer all the time). And last but not the least - it just looks cool.  Note: this mode works pretty well at night time and twilight, but on direct sunlight the screen brightness can be insufficient.\n\n- \"aSmart HUD\" can keep track on 4 speed limits, giving a warning (sound and visual) each time you crossing it. Normally, it's legal speed limits within cities, local roads and high-speed motorways. \"Never exceed speed\" is the speed you should not exceed under any conditions. For example, it can be a technical limit of your vehicle or the point where government can arrest your driving license. \n\n- You can skip/rewind/play/pause your current iPod music track, select the playlist or set the Shuffle or Repeat iPod mode.\n\n- Weather forecast time intervals and temperature units (C, F) are selectable in Preferences.\n\n- You can quickly take a photo of what's going on the road. Photo will be automatically saved into the Photos Album. The speedometer image, map and a some of other useful information will be placed over your photo. \n\n- Landscape and Portrait screen layouts support.\n\n- Three different compass styles, sound themes, colors, etc.\n\n- 4 functionally different display themes.\n\n- Speed history log chart. \n\n- \"Location Info\"  - longitude and latitude, GPS measurement precision and some more data.\n\n- \"Records\" screen (left upper button on the \"Location Info\" screen), where you can see your maximum reached speed (during the current trip or all of your trips), maximum altitude and maximum distance from start.\n\n- Tap the speed indicator to switch into speed fullscreen mode. \n \nIMPORTANT: for more screenshots and details visit the http://atoll-ordenadores.com website\n\nLimitations \n- The precision is affected by the satellite signal quality. If unsure, use the program only for reference, don't rely on it for 100%. Application requires real A-GPS chip - so, no iPod and not-3G iPad supported. On iPad 3G application function only in \"double pixel\" mode.\n\nThanks to everyone for your suggestions about additional functionality! THE BEST AND FASTEST WAY TO CONTACT US IS SENDING YOUR REQUESTS AND BUG REPORTS to support@atoll-ordenadores.com. WE ARE REALLY INTERESTED  IN DIALOG, what is not possible when you leaving the bug-report as AppStore review."

This application provides maps to make life easier and more enjoyable for sailors, fishermen, divers, boaters and cruisers.\n*** Comprehensive coverage\nCoverage of the chart is extensive and detailed: ***Adriatic Sea-Our chart covers Tirane, Podgorica, Venezia, Trieste, Croatia, Laudonov Gaj, Virsko More, Dera, Jasik, Molo Foraneo, Sc.i Guaceto, Diga di Ponente, Lago di Varano, T.Sinarca, Campli, Salina di Cervia and many more.\n*** Seamless scrolling:\nWith Seawell chart application you can zoom in and out without having to look for and load different charts. You can still scroll/zoom even when the favorites list or track list view is open. You can also mark or add favorite spots, dynamically without going back and forth to the chart.  \n*** Chart view management\nLots of care has been taken to avoid clutter of icons, to utilize the full view of the chart to display only the map. With a single ON/OFF button, you can have full chart clear view. All the buttons on the chart are configurable to be turned off from the view in the settings\n*** Track recording\n√ Knowing where you’ve been helps significantly when visualizing where you’re going. Track recording is also a useful supplement to a log.\n√ Intuitive interface to turn a track ON/ OFF, edit details & delete.\n√ Intuitive track detail view helps you to start / stop / pause / continue your track recording. \n√ GPS Tracking with north up / Course up!\nThree modes of GPS tracking, Red denotes user location centered and north up, yellow denotes user location is tracked but not centered with north up and blue denotes user location centered and map is rotated in course UP direction.\n*** Favorites:\n√ You can simply use your finger to tap positions on the chart where you want favorites.\n√ Favorites list is also easy to use.\n√ A picture is one thing, which tells more about your favorite places and you can share the same with your friends and families with different formats such as KML, KMZ and GPX\n*** Distance measure \nMeasuring distances, not just from the boat, is clearly a key part of any navigation system. Check how easy to use this.\n*** MOB function (Man Overboard)\nWill show you the way back to MOB and position can be used by the emergency services.\n*** Other Features:\n√ Online and Offline Search\n√ Speed of boat \n√ Add Images in favorites\n√  Seawell has multiple overlays: Offline, Hybrid,Topo and Street mode\n√ Offline: Only offline maps will be displayed which are useful in situations where there is no   Internet connectivity. .\n√ Hybrid:  Land areas are covered by satellite imagery.\n√ Street:  Land areas are covered by open street maps\n√ Topo : Land areas are covered by topographic maps\n***NOTE: \"Continued use of GPS running in the background can decrease battery life”\n\t“Turn off GPS when not in use”"

      "label": "Professional Augmented Reality Bearing Compass with real-time camera and map views, bearing markers and up to 8x zoom providing Compass Binocular features at a fraction of the cost.\n\n\"..works nicely, we tried it out at the Voiles d'Antibes...the Captain's response when trying it out was 'Cool!'.\" - Boatbookings, The World's Leading Online Yacht Charter Broker\n\nCompass Eye can be used to help with navigation on land, sea  or air as a bearing or marching compass.\n\nCompass Eye is fully gimballed and works accurately in all orientations and angles when held vertical and horizontal.\n\n“This app is a compass on steroids! It is fully gimballed so it will work in any orientation on your iPhone or iPad.  You can use it on land while hiking or as a hand bearing compass on the ocean or in the air while flying.” i-Marine Apps\n\n\"The app's compass works way better than the iOS default compass and I don't have to wave my iPhone in the air every time I launch the app.\" Gizmodo Review (App of The Day, 6th December).\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n- Real time, accurate in all orientations\n- Compass overlaid on live camera view\n- 8x Digital zoom\n- Back, transit, or collision bearing markers\n- Draggable Green and red bearing lines\n- Triangulation bearings\n- Optional time, date and GPS location information\n- Magnetic or True North setting with variation based on location\n- Live map view with position and track\n- Artificial Horizon with roll and pitch readout\n- Night Vision and FLIROne® Infra-red support\n- Location sharing\n- Longitude and latitude degree display in DD° MM.mmm', DD° MM' SS.ss\" and now DD.ddd°\n- iOS Dark mode support\n- Full screen on iPhoneX and later devices\n\nEnabling GPS also shows the Speed Over Ground (SOG) , Course Over Ground (COG) and optional COG bearing (purple).\n\nHOW TO USE\n\nTaking a bearing - look through your iPhone at the distant object, line it up with the centre line and read off the bearing! Zoom in to get more accuracy.\n\nSetting a bearing - look through your iPhone at the point you want to get to, tap the Bearing button (Top right) and follow the yellow  bearing line.\n\nSetting a bearing from the map - lay the iPhone flat, rotate or drag a bearing line  to line up with the point you are aiming for  and follow that bearing.\n\nTriangulation - use  the three bearing lines - yellow green and red to take bearings on 3 points. Capture the view including compass, bearings, time and location information (Camera button on left of screen)  and then use the photo to plot a fix on a chart.\n\nClearance bearings to a point on an approach - set one line to the minimum bearing (e.g. the angle the target must bear greater than) and the other line to the maximum bearing and navigate between the two. Use the colours according to the IALA lateral markings to help you remember which way to steer. e.g. in North America use red for the minimum bearing and green for the maximum (vice-versa in Europe!).\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\nBased on the iPhone camera the image specification at full zoom compares favourably with a 7x50 pair of binoculars:\n- Field of Vision at 1000m at 8x: 122m\n- Angle of view at 8x: approx 7 degrees\n- ISO 3200 or better.\n\nNAVIGATION SAFETY\nCompass Eye should only be used for basic navigation assistance. Never rely solely on the digital compass for determining direction, proximity or distance. The user is responsible for the prudent use of information provided by this application and must not use it for direct navigation. \n \nRequirements: iOS device with back facing Camera, Magnetometer and accelerometer (gps is optional).\n\nN.B. Battery consumption can go up considerably when the iPhone's GPS is enabled, Compass Eye allows you to turn off location display to preserve battery life.\n\nTerms of Use: http://seanav.net/termsofuse.php\n\nPrivacy Policy: http://seanav.net/privacy.php\n\nSupport: help@pocketmariner.com"

However, we will release database updates right after the new information will become available. \n\n- You can create and save the driving routes to follow them later. Application will display your current position on the route and display the route on the map.  Every route is saved in the application database, so you don't need to re-create it every time application starts up.\n\n - Tapping the \"HUD\" icon mirrors all the text, so if you position the iPhone horizontally under your car's windscreen you can see perfectly readable half-transparent reflection of the picture displayed.  Note: this mode works pretty well at night time and twilight, but on direct sunlight the screen brightness can be insufficient. \n\n- aSmartHUD can keep track on 4 speed limits, giving a warning each time you crossing it. Normally, it's legal speed limits within cities, local roads and high-speed motorways. \"Never exceed speed\" is the speed you should not exceed under any conditions. Like technical limit of your vehicle or the point where government can arrest your driving license. \n\n- 3D Trip Log Graph - unique way to represent the speed, location and altitude data in a single 3D graph. Color coded speed and altitude chart is constantly adjusted according to your moving trajectory.  In Track Preferences, you can set the transparency of all the components of the chart or switch them off completely.\n\n- Apple and OpenStreet maps in several flavors and color modes.\n- Landscape and portrait screen modes.\n- \"Records\" screen, with maximum reached speed, altitude and distance from start.\n- Different measurement units, display color schemes (6 available), log type, sounds and more.  \n- Select the music iPod Playlist, pause, play, skip or rewind it's items, set the player in Shuffle or Repeat mode. \n- Advanced location Info (longitude and latitude, GPS measurement precision) and more. \n- Local weather forecast;\n\nIMPORTANT: this features list in not complete.

      "label": "BACKGROUND:\n\nBuilt from the ground up in the rugged mountains of eastern Afghanistan, Tactical NAV comes from the mind of a U.S. Army Field Artillery officer who had a vision of creating a low-cost and highly accurate tactical navigation platform built specifically for military service members.\n\nTactical NAV's journey began in the notorious Pech River Valley of Kunar Province, Afghanistan. \n\nU.S. Army Capt. Jonathan J. Springer, a Fire Support Officer with the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), began developing the tactical navigation platform following the memorial services for Spc. Blair D. Thompson and Spc. Jared C. Plunk, who were killed in action on June 25, 2010.\n\nAfter pitching the idea and being turned away by the Department of Defense on multiple occasions, Captain Jonathan J. Springer remained resolute in his mission to continue developing Tactical NAV — even to this day. His ultimate goals were (and still are) to make a difference for other Soldiers and honor the men and women killed and wounded in battle.\n\nHe used his life savings to continue moving forward with the Tactical NAV project, all with the ultimate hope of saving military lives and helping his fellow service members accomplish their mission at home and abroad.\n\nTactical NAV officially launched on the App Store on February 14, 2011.\n\nMISSION:\n\nTactical NAV's mission is to provide military service members with a low-cost, highly accurate, and exceedingly powerful mobile tactical navigational solution.\n\nVISION:\n\nOur vision is to assist and support our nation's service members with their mobile navigational needs and further enable them to operate and win during Multi-Domain Operations (MDO).\n\nBUILT FOR ACCURACY:\n\nTactical NAV's performance is on par with the AN/PSN-13 Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR), and it has the feedback to prove it.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n\nCreated on the battlefield, Tactical NAV was the very first MGRS-focused navigation app available on the App Store. It is also the only combat-proven app available today. It has proven to be effective across a multitude of environments all throughout the world.\n\nTactical NAV has been successfully evaluated against other software platforms and devices such as Nett Warrior, JCR, BFT, JBC-P, and ATAK. Its accuracy is within 1-to-3 meters of these officially approved systems issued by the Department of Defense.\n\nIAPs & SUBSCRIPTIONS: \n\nTactical NAV contains in-app purchases (IAPs) and subscriptions. Currently, tactical drawing mode is available as an in-app purchase, and offline mapping is also available to users as either a monthly or yearly subscription. All revenue generated from these features goes towards further developmental coding and updates, and a portion of all proceeds are donated to charities that specifically benefit disabled veterans. \n\nFEATURES:\n\n• A military-quality precision targeting platform\n• Purpose-built for the individual Soldier\n• Offline mapping capabilities (complete usage of the TACNAV platform with no emission of a cellular signal)\n• WGS 84 standard (MGRS, UTM, BNG, and USNG coordinates)\n• Tactical drawing mode (e.g., useful for Joint Fires planning, creating overlays, route planning, and so forth)\n• Waypoint plotting functionality with military graphics (per FM 1-02.2)\n• Compass \"FastLock\" function for capturing quick azimuths\n• Snap and save photographs onto the main map for intelligence purposes and AARs\n• Location, waypoint, and photo-sharing capabilities (via email and text)\n• One-button night mode function for low-light situations \n• \"Go to Grid\" option for intelligent pinpoint planning and drawing of overlays\n• Created and tested to ensure utmost accuracy and reliability \n• iOS native code built for austere and contested environments\n• And so much more!!!\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n \nThe Department of Defense does not endorse Tactical NAV, nor should it be used in life-threatening or combat situations in place of a government-issued device."

How often do you spend 10-15 minutes looking for your car in a big parking lot? With Anchor Pointer you can find your parked car in less than a minute*.\n\nUser Feedbacks\n\n“I used it while hiking on the river bluffs today and tested it. It worked great. Took me right back to my car and even showed how far away in it was.” — by Bjverano\n\n“Unbelievably Easy and Accurate!!! Finally a GPS that does have all the clutter that a normal GPS would have. For off-road driving and hiking it's a MUST!!!” — by Jimbo6765\n\n“Having recently spent a weekend hiking in the Peak District I found myself using this app constantly to help with orienteering. The app lends itself to so many different uses (the Park facility being just one of them). Recommended!” — by S N Khan\n\n* Park Car only works in open parking lots due to GPS restrictions."

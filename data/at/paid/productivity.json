Featured in Apple's \"Amazing Apps\" TV commercial.\n## Staying focused with the cutest gamified timer. \n## Over 800,000 real trees were planted on Earth by our users.  \n\n\"Forest works well, and if your goal is to be more in the moment, ignore your phone and actually talk to your friends when you are with them, this is the app for you.\"— The New York Times \n\n\"In order to establish new, better habits, it's helpful to engage with tools that make it easier to reinforce them. For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

Using one of the supported OBD adapters you can read trouble codes or display sensor values in realtime, check the current state of the DPF in your car or register a new battery after replacement. BimmerLink even allows you to remotely control the exhaust flap or mute the Active Sound Design in your car.\n\nREAD AND CLEAR TROUBLE CODES\nDiagnose your car as would otherwise be possible only by your Service Partner. In contrast to generic OBD apps that read emission related errors only, BimmerLink allows you to read and clear trouble codes from ALL control units in your car.\n\nDISPLAY REALTIME SENSOR VALUES\nBimmerLink provides a big selection of values like oil temperature or boost pressure. Keep an eye on all the important parameters of your car with a personalized dashboard.\n\nEXHAUST FLAP REMOTE CONTROL*\nTake control over the exhaust flap in your car and decide yourself, whether it should be closed or open.\n\nACTIVE SOUND DESIGN**\nIf you do not like the artificial engine sound generated in your car, just mute the Active Sound Design with BimmerLink.\n\nSOUND TUNING***\nThe “Sound Tuning” option allows you to disable the “exhaust burble“ in cars equipped with the S55 engine (M2 Competition, M3, M4).\n\nDPF REGENERATION****\nBimmerLink allows you to check the current state of the diesel particulate filter in your car. Find out when the last regeneration took place or how much ash has accumulated in the filter and start a regeneration with the touch of a button.\n\nBATTERY REGISTRATION\nIf you want to replace the battery in your car, this has to be registered in the engine control unit and BimmerLink allows you to do this yourself now.\n\nPARKING BRAKE SERVICE MODE\nBimmerLink allows you to activate the service mode for the electromechanical parking brake.\n\nSERVICE RESET\nReset the service display in your car after carrying out maintenance work like a brake pad replacement or an engine oil change.\n\nREQUIRED ACCESSORIES\nTo use the app one of the supported Bluetooth or WiFi OBD adapters or cables is required.

Also in case of other problems like poor GPS accuracy or power supply drain.\n\nI'm convinced, with this App your anchor watch will be improved in many ways!\n\nFor sure you know the problem after you set the anchor successfully, you would like to set an Anchor Alarm for your anchor-watch, but later at night the wind shifts from East to West, and exactly in West there is a nasty shoal. Well, with Anchor Alarm you've the ability to set your swing shape in advance as individually as specific for each situation!\n\nAll feature at a glance:\n§ Individual shapes instead of a fix swing arc\n§ Alarm sound which will wake you\n§ Ship dimensions in true-to-scale representation in the map\n§ Optional alarm on low battery or other power supply issues\n§ Optional alarm on poor GPS accuracy\n§ Optional alarm on low volume / silent mode\n§ Optional alarm if headset is connected\n§ All alarms are active in the background and even if you lock your iPhone.\n\nApple Disclaimer\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.

GDPR compliant.\n* Synchronization of Safes between iPad, iPhone and Mac with iCloud or Wireless (without Internet)\n* Simple and intuitive usability, no technical knowledge is needed\n* Security made in Germany\n* Strong encryption with AES-256.\n* All files in a Safe are encrypted\n* Touch ID and Face ID supported\n* Files in a safe are also encrypted in iCloud Backup\n* Organize your files as you like it (create folders, rename, copy, move, duplicate, trash, delete files)\n* Picture Viewer and Slide Show in Full Screen mode\n* Show file content for Microsoft Office and iWork, PDF, RTF, TXT, Images, Text, Videos, Audio ...\n* Mark files and folders with tags or as Favorites for quick access\n* Add files from any App which supports Action Extensions or Document Provider Extension\n* Export files by using Share-Button or Document Provider Extension\n* Number of files and size is only limited by the free space of your device\n* Unlimited number of Safes\n* Add photos and videos from photo library directly from the App\n* Take encrypted photos or capture videos directly from the App and store them securely\n* Create and edit text files\n* Comment files\n* Create recovery password\n* Screen protection when in background\n* Access files in Safe from the Files App\n* View files in list or icon view (previews)\n* SimpleumSafe helps you to technically implement the required protection of documents with personal data in accordance with the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)\n\nWHY CHOOSE SIMPLEUMSAFE?\nNowadays it is not enough “only” to encrypt your data to be protected. If you want to view or organize the encrypted files, they also must be protected. SimpleumSafe goes a different way than most other encryption programs. After authorization with a password, the files are not provided in the file system. Otherwise they would be completely vulnerable from this moment on. SimpleumSafe makes its own file system and has its own finder. Thus the files remain encrypted for the entire time.\n\nSYNCHRONIZATION\nSimpleumSafe was developed with Extreme Secure Synchronization - continuously encrypted. Even if the synchronization data was stolen from the cloud and the password became public, it is not possible to decrypt the data."

You can also see the current weather and an overview of the current month at a glance.\n\nIntuitive Controls \nIntuitively navigate through your calendars and quickly, easily add events and tasks thanks to predefined settings and simple controls. Standard settings like repeating events and reminders/alarms are just a tap away. And powerful special settings are also available, without sacrificing comfort or control. Swipe through views and open events or days with just a tap.\n\nmiCal Understands You\nQuickly create events with the new natural language input feature. Natural language input allows you to create events just by describing them. And if you have Siri enabled on your device, you can even dictate your event details instead of typing.\n\nThe Total Package\nmiCal provides complete, well-organized day, week and month views and displays the calendar week in all the important views.\n\nRelax\nYou don’t need to contort yourself with miCal. miCal supports portrait as well as landscape formats in nearly every view.  Use each view however it’s most comfortable for you.\n\nTasks/Reminders\nmiCal now supports iOS reminders. Create reminders for all the important tasks in your private and professional life right in the app.\n\nBirthday Manager\nNever again miss an important birthday. Get reminders at preset times featuring the music of your choice.\n\nNice Weather\nFive-day weather forecasts plus the sunrise/sunset times, humidity and wind speed for the current day. The dashboard even features a quick summary of the current weather as well as a brief forecast of the coming days.\n\nComprehensive\nmiCal offers a unique range of features. Copy, move or send your events. Export your events in the date range of your choice as CSV (for Excel, etc.) or ICS (the calendar format). Set colors for your calendars and individual appointments or automatically add colors based on keywords in event titles.\n\nUp to Date and Secure\nmiCal communicates with your device’s integrated calendar. miCal works with  all the calendar services that your device currently supports (iCloud, Google Calendar, Outlook, Exchange, Facebook Events, subscriptions) without requiring additional configuration. That way, you can store your data locally or via the services you know and trust—it’s up to you. miCal itself does not transmit any data to external services or other servers. That allows us to ensure 100% data security.\n\nAward-Winning\n- 3rd place in the \"Best German iPhone App\" competition at the 2010 iPhone Developer conference.\n- Featured as App of the Week in 13 countries.\n- Recommendation from iPhoneWelt and a 5-star rating from iPhone&Co, two of the leading iPhone magazines\n- Honored at the 2010 App Developer Conference"

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nGet Started\n• Interactive tutorial project\n• Keep each manuscript and supporting materials in a self-contained project\n• Import Word, RTF, Final Draft and plain text files\n• Easily split imported text into separate sections\n\nGet Writing\n• Write your manuscript in sections of any size\n• View all sections as a single text using the “Draft Navigator” (iPad only)\n• Quickly navigate sections using the “binder” sidebar\n• Format with fonts and presets\n• Comments, footnotes, links and highlights\n• Simple bullets and lists\n• Insert images\n• Pinch-zoom to resize text\n• Full-screen mode (iPad only)\n• Typewriter scrolling mode keeps typed text center-screen (iPad only)\n• Write a screenplay using scriptwriting mode\n• Live word and character counts\n• Set word and character count targets\n• Find and replace\n• Customizable keyboard row provides quick-access buttons for formatting, navigation and punctuation\n• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for external keyboard users\n• Dark mode\n\nFind Your Structure\n• Write in any order and reorganize later\n• Write a synopsis for any text section and see it in the outline\n• Expand, collapse and drill down into sections of your project\n• Rearrange sections as index cards on the corkboard (iPad only)\n• Project-wide search\n• Track ideas using labels and status\n• Apply custom icons to your sections\n\nRefer to Research\n• Import research material such as image, PDF and media files\n• View research files or other sections right alongside your writing (iPad only)\n• Every section has its own notes area for jotting down ideas\n• Supports multi-tasking split screen mode (supported devices only)\n\nShare Your Work\n• Compile to a single document for sharing or printing\n• Use different formatting in your exported or printed document\n• Export to Word, RTF, Final Draft, PDF or plain text\n• Convert rich text to Markdown for sharing with Markdown apps\n• Create and email zipped backups of your projects\n\nWork Anywhere\n• Use Dropbox to sync between devices and with the macOS and Windows versions of Scrivener*\n• Copy projects between devices via iTunes\n\n* Requires a Dropbox account (not compatible with iCloud).\n\nSUPPORT\nYou can contact us at ios.support@literatureandlatte.com, visit our forums at http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum, or find us @scrivenerapp on Twitter."

      "label": "Notebooks is a writing app, a text and markdown editor, your personal Wiki and Zettelkasten, a file organizer, task manager, PDF and eBook creator and more. This may sound like a lot, but consider you have a few text fragments, randomly created, which you want to combine into a chapter of a book and saved as PDF or eBook; or a quick note sparks off an idea, generates a couple of tasks, each of which requires you to organize further research material; or you have business related documents which need to be separated from private diaries, records and files. – With Notebooks you handle these jobs easily without switching apps, and while remaining focussed and creative.\n\n• Notebooks stores all your documents as regular files in standard formats. You are always in control of your documents, never need to worry about how to export them, and they remain compatible across devices and over time.\n\n• Create formatted documents with styles, attachments, tables or checklists, and add a table of contents if you like. Choose between a variation of ready made document styles, or create your own, if you want.\n\n• Write your documents in plain text and allow Notebooks to automatically handle lists, highlight and center the current line on screen, automatically insert closing characters for  (, {, [, \" and more. - Plain text is a universal format which can be used on any device without any specific software.\n\n• Use Markdown to create formatted documents from plain text. Notebooks supports *MultiMarkdown* and its own flavor of *Discount*.  – Click any word in a formatted Markdown text and start writing at that position. You can even create checklists (- [ ]) and tick them off in formatted view. Syntax highlighting and a set of dedicated extra keyboard keys make Markdown editing easy.\n  \n• Use your Apple Pencil to sketch ideas or annotate images and PDF documents.\n\n• Use Notebooks' advanced editing capabilities to work on documents which are stored in other apps.\n\n• Compile selected documents or the contents of whole books into a single document, an eBook or a PDF document.\n\n• Link between documents in Notebooks. In Markdown you can even use Wiki style links ([[ ]]). When clicking a link to a document which does not yet exist, Notebooks suggests to create it. And when you move or rename documents, Notebooks makes sure the links remain intact.\n\n• Create as many books as you need to structure your projects and details. Nest books as deep as you like, there is no limit in Notebooks. If you ever loose track, Notebooks' full text search helps you quickly turn up even the most hidden document.\n\n• Turn books into task lists to display document as tasks which can be ticked off. Assign due dates and alerts, and divide projects into nested sub projects, which makes them easier to handle. \n\n• For simple lists you can use checklists in formatted documents and Markdown.\n\n• Assign Context tags to books and documents to create shortcuts that are accessible for a smart book at Notebooks' top level. – Notebooks can even extract context tags from the contents of documents as you create them.\n\n• Import all documents and files you want to keep close at hand, no matter whether PDF, email, web pages, MS Office or iWorks, photos, videos, music and more.\n\n• Scan documents and extract text using OCR (iOS 13)\n\n• Sync files between iPads, iPhones, Mac or PC. \n\nWith all that, Notebooks may quickly become your one and only app for everything you want to keep close at hand.\n\nUser Comments: \n\n“Notebooks is a wonderful App, which is so much better than the dozen other note apps I tried. It is sophisticated, in an unassuming way, so that you find yourself greatly rewarded and being productive without sacrificing time/effort to the App. I cannot tell you how much productivity I have gained.  I am having a huge amount of fun, I use it constantly, more than the phone on my iPhone in fact.\" \n\n“You are GTD in every way that makes it efficient and makes me efficient.”"

      "label": "e-Connect is a service for systems centralization, management and supervision that combines in a single cloud platform EL.MO intrusion and fire detection, home management systems and e-Vision® video surveillance systems.\ne-Connect makes it possible to control intrusion and fire detection systems status (home, office, holiday houses, etc.), receive notifications, manage systems through graphic maps, enable/disable devices (ex. detectors), display images of video surveillance systems, and manage domotic systems such as irrigation and lighting systems.\nFind out about e-Connect at http://e-connect.elmospa.com\nThe service usage requires the intervention of EL.MO. qualified and authorized security systems installers who are to create a system account, that is, a user profile enabled for the management of compatible EL.MO. intrusion detection control units and/or e-Vision PRO series DVRs/NVRs. Some functions will be available only for accounts set by installers registered to the platform with multi-level structure.\n \nWhat can e-Connect manage?\n- EL.MO. intrusion detection systems  based on Villeggio, PREGIO, HERCOLA, ETR G2, TITANIA, NET and TACÓRA control units.\n- DVRs, NVRs and IP cameras of e-Vision PRO series.\n- Domotic systems associated to EL.MO. units\ne-Connect can also manage several systems through a single account simultaneously: home, office, holiday houses.\n\nWhat can e-Connect do?\nUsing smartphones and tablets it is possible to control systems status, receive notifications (also referred to InstaVision video verification for an immediate video monitoring upon events occurrence), enable/disable intrusion detection devices, display CCTV systems images (live both single and multichannel, and playback) or manage domotic systems. With regard to the chronothermostat, it will be possible to adjust the temperature and control its working mode from a remote site. \n \nInstaVision Video Verification\nInstaVision is a new e-Connect function for video verification that optimizes the synergy between EL.MO. intrusion and fire detection systems and CCTV e-Vision® PRO systems. It allows receiving real time notifications about one of its security systems and verify its condition immediately. When an event occurs (ex. intrusion attempt) InstaVision allows displaying live images, images recorded at the exact time of the event, and images recorded a few seconds before the occurrence of the event directly from e-Connect app. Such function enables to control whether the event is a false alarm or a true intrusion or fire event in which case a prompt intervention will be possible. Images are not recorded to third-party servers, but directly to users DVRs and NVRs so to reduce to zero personal data breach risks and to shorten dramatically system response time.\n \nHow is e-Connect interface?\ne-Connect features a complete but intuitive control panel. Main icons provide a quick view of the system status, while a convenient side menu grants an easy browsing of e-Connect menu pages. Systems interactive graphic maps allow managing devices and retrieve cameras images view.\n \nHow is power combined with security?\ne-Connect features a Cloud Server structure that includes all control units connected to the network. The use of SSL communication protocol combined with certificates issued by international Certification Authority bodies grants an outstanding security level.\n \nEasy setup and P2P \nThe configuration of e-Connect app and its association to security equipment such as control units and NVRs/DVRs is an easy operation also thanks to P2P connection to EL.MO. proprietary server.\n\nFor web browser version, visit http://connect.elmospa.com website.\n\ne-Connect app performs a regular automatic check of the purchase licence validity; in case of errors, please download the most recent version available on Play Store."

      "label": "LexTools ist eine Sammlung von Werkzeugen für den österreichischen Rechtsanwender. Sie besteht aus einem Fristenrechner, Tarifrechner für RATG, GGG, NKT, NTG, GKTG und Verwalterentschädigungen, einem Existenzminimumrechner, der Gerichtssuche, der RIS-Abfrage, kindschaftsrechtlichen Werten und dem Rechtssatz-Widget.\n\nFristenrechner: \nBerechnet den Ablauf von beliebigen, nach Tagen, Werktagen, Wochen, Monaten oder Jahren bestimmten Fristen nach den gesetzlichen Regelungen (nach Wunsch mit Ablaufhemmung am Wochenende, ZPO-Fristenhemmung für Rechtsmittel). Die Frist kann in den Kalender eingetragen sowie per SMS oder E-Mail verschickt werden. \n\nTarifrechner:\nBerechnet die Entlohnung für Leistungen nach dem Rechtsanwaltstarifgesetz für beliebige Streitwerte (einschließlich Einheitssatz, Streitgenossen, ERV-Zuschläge, Verbindungsgebühren und verschiedene Umsatzsteuersätze).  \nBerechnet Gerichtsgebühren für Zivilprozesse und Exekutionsverfahren für beliebige Bemessungsgrundlagen samt Streitgenossenzuschlägen. \nBerechnet die Beträge aus allen Tabellen des Normalkostentarifs, die Ansätze des Notariatstarifes und des Gerichtskommissionstarifs sowie die Entlohnung des Verwalters in Exekutionssachen und des Insolvenzverwalters.\nEnthält jeweils sowohl die aktuellen als auch die historischen Tarife seit 2002 (NKT seit 2004).\n\nExistenzminimumrechner:\nBerechnet den unpfändbaren Freibetrag (Existenzminimum) nach der Exekutionsordnung. Es können das monatliche, wöchentliche und tägliche Nettoeinkommen oder Abfertigungen eingegeben werden. \nZusätzlich wird ein Vorschlag für die Bemessung des Tagessatzes nach dem Strafgesetzbuch ausgegeben.\n\nGerichtssuche:\nEinfacher Zugriff auf die Dienststellenseiten der Gerichte und Staatsanwaltschaften auf www.justiz.gv.at. Die Suche nach den örtlich zuständigen Gerichten ist sowohl durch Eingabe von Postleitzahl oder Ort als auch für den aktuellen Standort möglich.\n\nRIS-Abfrage:\nBequeme Suchmasken für die Abfrage des Rechtsinformationssystems des Bundes. Enthält Suchmasken für alle Datenbanken (Rechtsnormen, Judikatur, etc.)\n\nKindschaftsrecht:\nBerechnung der empfängniskritischen Zeit (Vermutungsfrist), Anzeige von Regelbedarfssätzen und den Beträgen des Unterhaltsvorschussgesetzes. \n\nRechtssatz-Widget:\nIn der Mitteilungszentrale wird ein zufällig gewählter aktueller Rechtssatz des Obersten Gerichtshofes aus dem letzten Monat angezeigt.\n \n\nVorschläge für weitere Funktionen sind - ebenso wie Hinweise auf allfällige Programmfehler - jederzeit willkommen!\n\n\nWichtige Hinweise:\n\nLexTools basiert auf dem geltenden österreichischen Recht zum 1.8.2022. \nDie App wendet sich an ein juristisches Fachpublikum. Die Interpretation der Berechnungsergebnisse erfordert Kenntnisse der einschlägigen Rechtsvorschriften. Eine juristische Fachberatung kann dadurch nicht ersetzt werden.\nDie Implementierung der Berechnungsregeln und Tarifansätze erfolgte mit größtmöglicher Sorgfalt, Irrtümer können dennoch nicht vollständig ausgeschlossen werden. Die App eignet sich daher nur zur Kontrolle anderweitig ermittelter Ergebnisse, eine Haftung für falsche Ergebnisse kann nicht übernommen werden. \nDas Modul „Gerichtssuche“ nutzt den entsprechenden Dienst der Website des Justizministeriums. Das Modul „RIS-Abfrage“ und das Rechtssatz-Widget senden die Anfragen direkt an die Website des Rechtsinformationssystems des Bundes (RIS). Durch Änderungen dieses Dienstes ist es jederzeit möglich, dass die Abfrage nicht mehr (voll) funktioniert. Der Entwickler hat darauf keinen Einfluss."

      "label": "CalenGoo gives you a fast and easy way to access and modify your Google Calendar with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. It can also be used when you have no Internet connection, using the cached data. Changes are saved and uploaded the next time you are connected.\n\nThe calendar view is similar to the web view of Google Calendar. Events are displayed using the same calendar colors that you use in your Google Calendar, even Google's event colors are supported (please see http://www.calengoo.com/cc ). It also recognizes which calendars are visible and which are hidden. So the view should match the view of your Google Calendar as much as possible. \n\nCalenGoo also has a month view similar to that of Google Calendar. It can be zoomed and panned to quickly get an overview over the events of a month. Zooming the month is done by using the two-finger-zoom gesture that you know from Safari and the photo application. A double tap opens the tapped day.\n\nIt also supports the same kinds of recurrence rules as Google Calendar and displays recurring events correctly even when you are offline or scroll far into the future.\n\nYou can also use Google Calendar's feature to invite people to events and see their status (accepted, declined, maybe, no answer). They will get an invitation email with links to e.g. accept or decline the invitation.\n\nGoogle Calendar has an integrated task list, called Google Tasks. Tasks with a due date are displayed on the corresponding days of the calendar. CalenGoo can do the same, it can sync this list, display your tasks in the calendar views and in a list view and it even makes your tasks available offline. You can edit and add tasks and the changes will be synced with Google Tasks.\n\nYou either need a (free) Google Calendar account to use this app or you can use it with your iOS calendars. However using it with Google Calendar has a few advantages.\n\nTo get more information, screenshots and a tutorial, please go to http://www.calengoo.com\n\nIf you have any problems or suggestions, please send an email to calengoo@dgunia.de or take a look at CalenGoo's support website to get help.\n\nIf you think the font is too small and hard to read, you can increase the font size of all calendar views in the settings under \"Settings\", \"Display and Use\".\n\nFeatures ( http://www.calengoo.com ):\n\n- Drag&drop to quickly copy and move events\n- Templates to quickly create similar events again. They can even be combined, e.g. one template for the location of an event and another for the attendees\n- Print/PDF function to print the day, week, month or agenda view via AirPrint or to email it as a PDF file\n- Supports the same recurrence rules as Google Calendar\n- Supports Google Calendar's event colors when syncing via OAuth2\n- Icons can be assigned to Google Calendar events\n- Date/time can be entered using the iOS wheels or by using a keypad\n- Fast search function\n- Show/edit iOS calendars in addition to Google calendars (or instead of Google calendars)\n- Sync with Google Tasks and iOS Reminders\n- Reminders can be snoozed and they can be (optionally) repeated every minute\n- Birthdays and anniversaries of your contacts can be displayed\n- Zoomable month view, which can be configured to scroll horizontally (month by month) or vertically (week by week)\n- Events can be linked to contacts\n- Floating events and completable events\n- Photos and PDF files can be created and attached to events (via Google Drive)\n- Calendar selection bar to quickly show and hide single calendars\n- The location of an event can be opened with Apple Maps, Google Maps, Navigon, TomTom, Skobbler, Sygic, iGo or Waze\n- View/edit calendars that are shared with others via Google Calendar\n- Many configuration options to change the way the app looks and works"

      "label": "First released in 2009, GoodReader® is truly a veteran of the App Store.\n\nIn the modern app business, it's not easy to stay relevant that long. We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase."

Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

TaskTask works with Gmail directly, although in a limited fashion.\n\nKey Features:\n- Simple interface, quickly create new tasks and mark tasks completed\n- Set task attributes, such as category, importance, start/due/complete dates, and notes\n- Synchronize your task list with your e-mail account (no hidden fees or software to download)\n- Quickly swipe to complete or delete a task \n- Easy set up with automatic configuration of your server\n- Drag-to-order your tasks, see the same order in Outlook\n- Recurring tasks and reminders\n- View attachments on your tasks and attach files from other apps\n\nHow is TaskTask better than Reminders?\n- See your task list how you prefer: organize by start date, due date, category, importance, or reminder date.\n- Reorder your tasks just by dragging them around\n- Full category support, including downloading your list of categories and colors from your Exchange Server.\n- See tasks in the same order as Outlook's To Do Bar\n- Task filters: filter out tasks in the future or tasks you don't want to see on your mobile device\n- Flagged mail items: See the full list of items from your To Do Bar, not just tasks\n- Quick Task Entry: Type a list of task subjects quickly in one space, and TaskTask automatically creates the set of tasks\n- Mark tasks as private: Hide tasks from others who have visibility to your task list\n\nNote: To synchronize your tasks with Outlook, your email account must be on a compatible Microsoft Exchange Server or Office 365 Business account. Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 and newer versions are supported, although there may be additional factors that prevent TaskTask from working with your server. \n\nIf you are using Mail.app or Microsoft Outlook 2011 (Macintosh) with your email account in \"Exchange\" mode, TaskTask is compatible with your server. Because there are specific requirements for your server, please verify with your e-mail administrator that your server meets these requirements before purchasing this app."

      "label": "TimeStamps makes it easier to have a look at your working hours and overtime. No more guessing when you come to work or when you have gone on a business trip - from now on, your personal time sheet is always with you.\n\n+++ Staff Pick July/August 2011 and January/February 2012 in the German App Store +++\n\nONE-BUTTON OPERATION\nIn the frontend you always set a time stamp with the same big button. It remembers which time stamp you have used recently and suggests the next stamp type. That's why the next time stamp will be working time when you've had a break before.\n                                               \nKEEP YOUR WORKING TIMES ALWAYS IN SIGHT\nThe frontend display allows you to display different states: current time, working time, break time, etc. You can change the display type with a single tap. Also, the expected end of work is displayed and updated on the fly.\n\nFLEXTIME ACCOUNT\nTimeStamps offers a flextime account for overtimes. Including starting balance, correction factor for each week and Days of in Lieu to get rid of overtime. And in case you don't need a flextime account, it can be switched off in the settings.\n\nAUTOMATIC BREAK\nSpecified in TimeStamps' settings of the default work week, the default break can be automatically deducted as the minimum break at the end of a day. If the break time is exceeded, of course, the larger value is taken. Whether the automatic pause is applied is shown by a symbol within TimeStamps.\n\nEXTENSIVE BACKEND\nIn the backend all time stamps are listed in different views. New time stamps can be added, deleted or existing ones can be altered.\n\nTAGS\nEach time stamp can be assigned a tag from a self-created list. Each tag can of course be changed later, hidden, modified in order or deleted. Coming soon is also a new type of export, who has the ability to choose specific tags.\n\nWORK-FREE DAYS\nUsing the backend, you can set work-free days - holidays, leave days, days of in lieu and sick days are an integral part of TimeStamps. On these days, you do not have to work, so there will be no default work and break time. However, TimeStamps does not prevent that you still record times. So you can still work on holidays or leave days and keep track of it with TimeStamps.\n\nSTATISTICS\nIn the weekly and daily time stamp view, TimeStamps provides small statistics for a better overview. \"How much overtime I've done this week?\", \"How long have I been on a business trip?\" - The statistics provide the kind of information you want.\n\nREPORTS\nVarious reports can be created of all time stamps. You can specify any time period and send reports as HTML or CSV to one or more e-mail addresses. These report configurations can be reused later.\n\nSETTINGS\nNot everyone is working from nine to five, five days a week. So the work and break time for each day of a default work week is definable to the minute. Also working without a break is possible with a single click. The setting of default times can later be changed individually for each day.\n\n\nTHANKS FOR THE SUPPORT\nIf you like TimeStamps, please tell your colleagues, friends and relatives! And we are always thankful for a a positive rating in the App Store.\n\nQuestions, comments and suggestions are always welcome, too. Please use our support e-mail address: support@timestampsapp.com"

      "label": "Whether you’re working with teammates on a project or planning a weekend activity with loved ones, Microsoft Teams helps bring people together so that they can get things done. It’s the only app that has chats, meetings, files, tasks, and calendars in one place—so you can easily connect with people and bring plans to life. Get family and friends together to manage tasks at home or plan a surprise birthday party. Work with teammates via secure meetings, document collaboration, and built-in cloud storage. You can do it all in Microsoft Teams. \n\nEasily connect with anyone: \n• Meet securely with teammates, family, and friends. Set up a video meeting within seconds and invite anyone by sharing a link or calendar invite. \n• Chat 1-1 or in group chats with friends or colleagues. @mention people in chats to get their attention. \n• Dedicated channels help create a focused workspace for important projects. \n• Video call anyone directly in Teams or instantly convert a group chat to video call. \n• GIFs, emojis, and message animations make it easier to express yourself when words aren’t enough. \n\nAccomplish plans and projects together: \n• Task lists allow you to stay on top of work projects or plans with family and friends. Assign tasks, set due dates, and cross off completed tasks to keep everyone on the same page. \n• File sharing in chats makes it easier to coordinate on work assignments or personal projects.  \n• Cloud storage makes it easy to access shared documents and files on the go.  \n• Dashboard view neatly organizes all shared content—photos, files, tasks, links—so you don’t have to spend time looking for things*. \n• Screenshare, whiteboard, or breakout in virtual rooms to get most out of your work meetings. \n\nDesigned to give you peace of mind: \n• Securely collaborate with external partners for work assignments while maintaining control over your data. \n• Store important information such as subscription passwords in a digital Safe*. \n• Enterprise-level security and compliance you expect from Microsoft 365**. \n\n*Available when using Microsoft Teams with your personal account.  \n**Commercial features of this app require a paid Microsoft 365 commercial subscription or a trial subscription of Microsoft Teams for work.

Some functionality might be unavailable in certain countries. If you have questions about how this app is being used within your organization, your company’s IT administrator should have those answers for you. Microsoft, your network provider, and your device’s manufacturer do not know how Intune will be used by your organization."

No problem! You can easily split your trips and reports for different vehicles and workplaces.\n\n\n▶ 3. REPORT: Easily submit your tax compliant logbook\n\n - Your mileage documentation is ready when you are. You’re only one click away from detailed reports available on your phone or desktop.

We’ve got you covered. You decide how often you log your odometer and we do all the math between trips.

You will never forget to log a trip again.\n - When you sign up for the annual basic subscription we’ll send you an iBeacon for free. \n - Your phone connects to the iBeacon when you enter the vehicle, and starts recording as you begin your drive. \n - The app stops recording when you exit your vehicle, and you’ll get a notification that the trip was logged.\n\n\n▶ SUPPORT\n\n - If you have questions or feedback please contact us at tel. (+45) 71 99 37 54 or support@driversnote.com.\n - We do use the GPS in the background when logging a trip, and continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n\nHappy tracking!"

      "label": "Salesforce Authenticator adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts as a strong, out-of-band authentication provider. The app sends you a push notification, and you tap 'Approve' for logins and critical actions when it's you, or 'Deny' if it's not. For even more convenience, Salesforce Authenticator can use location services to automatically verify from locations you trust, like your office or home. Better yet, Einstein can save trusted requests for you! Then you need only respond to notifications when something out-of-the-ordinary happens.\n\nYou can also get a verification code when you need one. The codes also work as a backup authentication method if you're on a plane, or have poor connectivity. This means Salesforce Authenticator also works with third-party services that use OATH TOTP tokens. \nhttp://twofactorauth.org.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Rest assured, we go to great lengths to ensure minimal GPS use so that Salesforce Authenticator does not significantly impact your battery life."

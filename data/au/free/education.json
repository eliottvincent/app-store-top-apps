      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

      "label": "Backed by Occupational Therapists, Teachers, and Child Psychologists, Joon is the future of motivating kids and helping them focus. Using a kid-friendly game (for ages 8-12), Joon helps you motivate your child to focus and stay on top of their daily tasks & habits.\n\n\n**JOON’S GOAL**\n\nHelp you motivate your kids with ADHD, ADD, or OSD to focus and complete their daily tasks while learning basic responsibility and independence. Not only does Joon make it extremely easy to motivate your ADHD kids to do important tasks, but it also teaches them valuable life skills that they won’t be able to learn in school. We’ve helped thousands of families complete more than 100k tasks and teach their kids important life skills, so why can't we help you?\n\n\n**HOW IT WORKS**\n\nAssign tasks as \"Quests\", then the game does the rest.\n\n1) Start with age-appropriate tasks & habits to focus on: Choose a couple focus areas, and we'll provide you with a small list of recommended tasks (known as Quests) or create your own tasks to get your child started!\n\n2) Use gamification to keep your child on track: Your child chooses a virtual pet (called a Doter) to feed, wash, and grow. They stay motivated and focused on completing the tasks you assigned them, so they can take care of their pet and level it up!\n\n3) Your child stays focused and even develops life skills! As they progress in the game, your child will naturally start building their tasks as habits into their daily routine and even pick up on learning important life skills. All because they want to keep playing a fun game!\n\n\n**THE PARENTING TOOL YOU NEED**\n\n+ We make it easy to manage your child’s tasks and add to your existing routine.\n\n+ We'll do the reminding to help your child stick to their routine. No more nagging from your end.\n\n+ Your child will stay focused to do the activities assigned to them. In fact, 90% of kids on Joon complete all tasks assigned.\n\n+ Choose from a large list of research-backed activities to help your child build important life skills that teach independence.\n\nJoon is less than a year old and already has the attention of press, parenting publications, and parenting experts. To see the complete list, visit our website here: https://joonapp.io\n\n\n**HOW TO GET STARTED**\n\n1) Install Joon on your device, create your family, and select a few beginning tasks you’d like your child to initially focus on.\n\n2) Help your child set up their account so they can see the tasks that you’ve assigned them. You can have them download Joon on their own device or share you phone.\n\n3) Add a few more activities that are most important to your family (such as chores, learning, or exercising) and assign them to your child. Your child will be motivated to complete these activities in order to feed and take care of their virtual pet.\n\n4) Once your child completes their tasks, you can review and approve them to make sure they were completed correctly.\n\n5) Once approved, your children receive coins and experience points that let them feed, level up, buy things, and progress in the game with their virtual pet. As your child continues to progress in the game, they actually progress in real life too!\n\n6) Keep adding quests (and we’ll recommend you new ones too to help your children develop good habits! Your children cannot grow on their own. Make sure to stay involved in the process and keep assigning new quests as needed to allow your children to continue helping, learning, growing, and progressing in the game.\n\nTerms Of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

Seemed a little bit magical to both my son and I.” \n\n “My son really enjoyed the app. As a science kid he loved that it was sharing and telling him all about the solar system. We found out facts about different planets that we had no idea about. And he was just really loving the game, that’s great. It allowed him to feel immersed into this super science technical space right from home, right from our living room!”\n\n“Hi I’m Leandra, I work with teachers every day....One of the biggest complaints that they have about the different learning resources available to students is the lack of focus on student engagement...Magic Kids help kids learn in this really hands-on way where they can move around and access topics like space and dinosaurs and learn in a way where the environment actually responds to them!”\n\n“What Magic Kids is making with these augmented reality lessons, it really has student engagement and student participation at its core in a way that a lot of other tech products don’t.”"

      "label": "iNaturalist is a social network for sharing biodiversity information to help each other learn about nature. The primary goal is to connect people to nature, and the secondary goal is to generate scientifically valuable biodiversity data from these personal encounters. \n\niNaturalist helps you identify plants and animals with visually similar suggestions and verification by dedicated contributors. Get connected with a community of over a million scientists and naturalists who can help you learn more about nature! By recording and sharing your observations, you'll create research-quality data for scientists working to better understand and protect nature. \n\nKEY FEATURES\n• Identification suggestions: Take or import a photo and view the top 10 most visually similar species matches and tap through to get more information. You can view these suggestions even before creating an account.\n• Feedback from our community: Create an account to share your observations and start a conversation about what you saw. Can’t identify the organism? Start with a broad identification like “plants” or “fungi” so others with more expertise can find it and refine the identification. \n• Keep a record of all living things: Build your life list by posting to iNaturalist. Where, when, and what you saw is the basis of each observation you create.\n• Grounded in science: Every identification is connected to the tree of life, which means you can search for broad classifications like “Ferns” or “Fungi” as well as species-level identifications like “Humpback Whale” (and everything in between). \n• Advancing science & conservation: Millions of observations created and identified by the iNaturalist community are shared with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility where they are used to advance scientific understanding of biodiversity through open data and open science. \n• Enabling citizen science and community science: Join any of the tens of thousands of projects around the world on iNaturalist to draw attention to and collect data about particular species or places.\n• Not-for-profit: iNaturalist is a joint initiative of the California Academy of Sciences and the National Geographic Society, both 501(c)3 nonprofits in the United States. iNaturalist is free for anyone to use thanks to the generous support of many organizations and individuals. Thank you!\n• No hidden charges: This app is truly free because we believe nature is for everyone.\n• Best for wild plants and animals: The iNaturalist community is better at identifying wild plants and animals than those in gardens or horticulture. Get outside and find what’s wild!\n• Control how your location is shared: Set the privacy to obscured (only general location is shared) or private (no location is shared at all, but much harder for others to help identify). The locations of species at risk from disturbance are automatically obscured.\n• More than a mobile app: iNaturalist has even more extensive features and tools for learning and exploration. Get the full experience at inaturalist.org!\n• 35+ languages: iNaturalist has been translated into dozens of languages thanks to multilingual enthusiasts who want to see the community grow.\n• A global network: iNaturalist is used in every country on earth! In many countries, we have formal agreements with local organizations to promote iNaturalist. Use this app for contributing to all iNaturalist Network sites, including Naturalista (Mexico and Colombia), iNaturalist.NZ (New Zealand), iNaturalist.ca (Canada), Biodiversity4All (Portugal), iNaturalistAU (Australia), iNaturalistPa (Panama), iNaturalistEc (Ecuador), ArgentiNat (Argentina), iNaturalistil (Israel), and iNaturalistFi (Suomi/Finland)."

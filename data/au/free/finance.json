      "label": "Spriggy is an award-winning Pocket Money app that families use together to build awesome, practical financial habits in kids. With 500,000+ Aussie members already, we’ve become Australia’s most popular Pocket Money app.\n \nParents and kids each download and use the app together, allowing kids (aged 6-17) to have\nfull control in making their own pocket money decisions in a safe, practical way. Teaching them powerful money skills at a young age.\n \nWhat can Spriggy do for Parents? \n\n- Automated weekly or fortnightly pocket money payments.\n- Set and manage paid/unpaid jobs around the house as kids learn to earn.\n- Set visual savings goals, teaching kids how to save, not rely on debt.\n- Track spending as it happens with real time notifications.\n- Transfer emergency funds instantly when needed.\n- Lock or reorder a new card in app anytime.\n- Get the kids excited by our fun prepaid card designs.\n\nWhy do kids love Spriggy?\n- Pocket money on time, every time.\n- Learning to save for the future.\n- The opportunity to earn extra with Spriggy Jobs.\n- Spend money where they want to, online and in-store with payWave.\n- The independence to make their own choices, like an adult.\n- Fun prepaid cards with our original designs or a Super Hero design\n \nMost importantly, kids learn that money doesn’t grow on trees and the money of today, digital money, becomes tangible. Kids quickly start to understand that ATMs and tap & go aren’t endless sources of money – realising the real value of modern money.\n \nFamilies tell us that when they set up weekly or fortnightly pocket money payments, their kids learn quickly that when their pocket money runs out, they have to wait for the next payment before they can spend again. With this new independence, they will make mistakes, but that’s how they learn. Better at age 8 than age 28.\n \nSoon they will be putting their pocket money towards reaching savings goals, teaching them great habits, young. With Spriggy Jobs, they’ll also be learning to earn through hard work.\n\nWe asked our members and nearly 80% of parents have noticed a positive change in how their kids handle money already and over 60% of kids are finding it easier to save.\n \nWhat our Spriggy families have to say:\n \n\"Spriggy has taught my daughter the values of house chores to earn her pocket money. I have never had such cooperation from my daughter before I'm not having to repeat myself when asked to do something.\" – Melissa, Spriggy Mum.\n \n“Ella is enjoying the challenge of setting savings goals, and being able to watch her balance grow is a huge motivator. She feels so proud of herself when she can buy herself something special.” – Courtney, Spriggy Mum.\n \n“A Simply awesome way of teaching children about money in the Internet age.” Angie, Spriggy Mum.\n \n“Ollie was SO excited when his Super Hero card arrived. You should have seen his face when I told him he was one of the first kids to get one!” Jane, Spriggy Mum.\n \nGetting started is easy, sign up online or in our app in minutes and your kids personalised prepaid cards will be in the post in no time!\n \nAbout\nSpriggy:\n \nSpriggy is on a mission to help raise financial literacy in Australian kids. We are an Australian business, fully independent from the banks, with the goal of educating kids about money in an increasingly cashless society. We believe that life’s best financial lessons are taught, practically, as early as possible.\n \nThe reason Aussies families love Spriggy is because it’s not just a place to keep money like a bank, rather it’s a place for kids to experience money in a safe way that gives them the independence to learn - practically. Worth much more than a couple of bucks in interest.\n \nFull terms - https://www.spriggy.com.au/terms"

It’s a simple representation of your creditworthiness and is dynamic – meaning it may change from month to month.\n\nA score can be between 0 and 1000 and the higher the score, the better.

Your score can also determine how much they will lend you as well as the interest rate. Knowing your score can help you make smarter financial decisions.\r\n\nNeed help?\r\nYou can find instant answers to common questions in our Help Centre: https://www.creditsavvy.com.au/help or you can reach out to us directly via email: contact@creditsavvy.com.au \n\nAustralian Credit Licence Number 516487 | CBA New Digital Businesses Pty Ltd ABN 38 633 072 830"

Get started in minutes with as little as $5, invest your spare change into a diversified portfolio with automatic round-ups, and give your money a chance to grow in the background of life.\n\nFeatured in: Forbes, WIRED, Bloomberg BusinessWeek, Business Insider, CNBC, Channel 9 News, Channel 7.\n\n- EASY SAVING AND INVESTING -\nRaiz makes it easy to invest small amounts regularly, the Raiz philosophy, taking the hassle out of investing.\n\n+ Round-Ups\nOur flagship feature. Automatically round-up the spare change from your everyday purchases and invest it into a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. Invest in the background of life.\n\n+ Recurring Investments\nSet up automatic daily, weekly or monthly recurring investments – whatever schedule suits you.\n\n+ Lump Sum Investments\nMake one-off investments to boost your Raiz account as often as you’d like.\n\n- HOW WE INVEST -\n\n+ Diversification\nInstead of trying to pick individual stocks, Raiz diversifies your investment across hundreds of the most widely held Australian and international companies, corporate bonds, government bonds, and cash. You pick the portfolio that suits you, and we take care of the rest.\n\n+ Automatic Rebalancing\nRaiz automatically rebalances your portfolio to mitigate risk and optimise returns. This means we keep your account in a target mix of stocks and bonds by buying more when they are cheaper and less when they are more expensive. Buy low, sell high.\n\n- BANK LEVEL SECURITY -\nYour peace of mind is our highest priority.

      "label": "The free and easy solution to share your expenses with others. Create or check your tricount now to add your expenses.\n\nUsed by millions of people because short reckonings make long friends :-)!\n\nVery practical for holidays, housesharing, events, couples evenings, etc.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n\n• A clean and simple interface.\n• If you want, share accounts with a group: everyone will see them and can add their own expenses.\n• Divide expenses unevenly: good for travelling with couples or children, for example.\n• Works with the app and online: accounts are visible in the app, but also online!\n• Works offline to ensure perfect use in every part of the world... even on the beach!\n• You can turn on notifications to see if others are adding or editing expenses, and link your tricount list to your email address.\n\nWHAT USERS SAY:\n\n\"The best expenses app I've ever downloaded. The app is very intuitive\" - Michael P.\n\"Makes sharing bills with friends so much easier, many useful options, an absolute must have.\" - Tom C.\n\"Super useful - my flatmates and I can't live without it anymore!\" Sarah P.\n\nTHEY RECOMMEND TRICOUNT :\n\nFORBES:\n\"With Tricount, you can create a group expense report on your phone. It tracks spending by person, and then splits up how much each individual owes or is owed from the total balance. When you’re ready to share the final breakdown, the app sends each person a link to Tricount’s site to review the data.\"\n\nBUSINESS INSIDER:\n\"Next time you organize a group activity, Tricount will split up the expenses for you\".\n\nABOUT IN-APP PURCHASES\n\nAs of version 2.1, Tricount offers in-App purchase subscriptions valid for one year. \n\nThe price of the subscription is 6.99€ (Premium) and may depend on your territory and is clearly indicated on the subscription page. Payment will be directly charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. The subscription renewal costs the same price as the one of the original subscription. After purchase, you can disable auto-renewal in your user's Account Settings. Note that no cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during the active subscription period. Tricount's terms and conditions are available at https://tricount.com/en/terms\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\n\ncreate a tricount, share your link with friends ... et voilà!\n\nTricount makes sorting out and divvying your group expenses very easy when you organize activities (for example: ski trip, citytrip, holidays with a classroom, flatmates etc.)\n\nGone are the days of the old excel file: an easier and effective solution exists to breakdown the costs, sharing expense reports, list tickets and spending. Tricount does the accounting and balances the cost for your group expenses.\n\nIt lets you breakdown the budget of a group and track expenses during a trip or any occasion with friends. It can be used by couples, between colleagues, roommates & flatmates. It is a simple yet powerful tool to figure out who owes what to whom and balance spendings : I owe you, you owe me (IOU) ... so easy!\n\nCreate your group expenses on your mobile (even offline), during your group activity. Send everyone the link (a la Doodle), and your friends too can add their own expense or see your changes.\n\nTricount then tells you who should pay what to whom to balance the group.\n\nVery useful for any activity with friends and colleagues: holiday, city-trip, flat sharing & flatmates, week-ends, everyday lunch with colleagues, parties, etc. In your couple, you can create a tricount to know who has paid what this month, or on holiday.\nThe app exists for most mobile devices, and on the web! All currencies are accepted, even bitcoins if you want."

      "label": "Wouldn’t it be good not to have to worry about money? Well, it’s possible. We’ve built the simplest way to turn around your finances and help you get ahead. \n\nJust link your accounts to see the full picture, tweak a few things, score some smart savings and you’ll soon have more coming in than you have going out. That’s all it takes to shift the balance.\n\n\n-- Helping you feel good about money\n\nWhether you’re saving for a goal, paying down a debt or just looking to get on top of your finances, we’ll help you get there.\n* On average Frollo users increase their savings by $1,100 within the first three months\n* On average Frollo users reduce their credit card debt by $460 within the first six months\n\nWith over 130,000 users and an app store rating of 4.4* Frollo is one of the most popular and most effective money management apps in Australia. Try for yourself!\n\n\n-- How does Frollo work?\n\nIn just four simple steps we’ll help you turn around your finances.\n\n1. Link your accounts - Get started by linking all of your financial accounts (transaction, savings, credit card, loans, super, investment and more) with Frollo to see them all in one place. We use Open Banking (CDR) to safely and securely link your accounts and provide you with a real-time view of your finances. We’ll categorise all of your transactions in convenient groups like ‘salary’, ‘groceries’ and ‘gym & fitness’.\n\n2. See where your money is going - We’ll keep track of your regular payments and when they’re due, whether it’s your rent, Netflix or energy bill. Our easy to read, customisable graphs will show you exactly how much you’ve spent on each category and how that’s changed over time\n\n3. We’ll send you smart money tips and notifications - We’ll let you know when you have insufficient funds to cover upcoming bills, when you can save on subscriptions or have spent more on groceries than you usually do. These and many more insights will help you turn around your finances\n\n4. And we’ll help you stay on track - Set and track budgets for spend categories, or create goals to save for a holiday, house deposit or emergency fund. You can link your goals to an account to automatically keep track of your progress\n\n\n-- Frollo uses Open Banking (CDR) to link accounts\nFrollo is the only money management app in Australia that uses the Consumer Data Right (Open Banking) to link your accounts. This is a safe and secure way to share financial data, without sharing your account credentials.\nUsing Open Banking means you’re in control, you decide what data to share and for how long - and you can always tell us to delete your data.\n\nIt also means lightning fast account linking and real-time transaction updates.\n\nCurrently Open Banking is available for the Big Four banks, plus a number of other banks. We’ll keep adding new providers when they become available. When a provider isn’t available on Open Banking yet, we provide access using screen scraping."

And so is the money you’ll save, and the time you’ll save and the environment you’ll save too - because we deliver everything on e-bike. \n\nWHY MILKRUN?\n\nGet the freshest fruits and veggies from local Aussie farms. \n\nOur average delivery time is a speedy 12 minutes. \n\nEnjoy thousands of products from your favourite brands at supermarket prices (& heaps of weekly specials) \n\nWe’ve got the friendliest Riders in town who deliver via super-fast E-bike. That’s a win for you and the environment. \n\nWe’re not a part of the ‘gig economy’. That means all Milkos are employed on a full-time, part-time or casual contract and get benefits like insurance, holiday pay and super. \n\nRewards that’ll save you thousands of dollars a year. \n\nWe’re always expanding into new suburbs. \n\n\nTELL ME MORE, USING SELECT KEY WORDS TO HELP RAISE THE RANKING OF YOUR APP. \n\nWhy waste endless hours of your life traipsing the aisles of a supermarket when you could get freshest produce, local favourites and thousands of household items delivered to your door in minutes? \n\nOur ridiculously easy-to-use app lets you browse weekly specials, see what’s in season, get ready-to-eat meals, discover new items and add them all to your cart with a few quick taps. Then, our awesome pickers and packers, pick and pack it, before handing it off to a Rider who dashes over there in a few magical minutes. It’s so fast you’ll think we teleported over.\n\nWhen we say ‘thousands of household essentials’ what do we mean? Well we’re talking everything from nappies to birthday candles to cleaning products. If you need it, there’s a very high chance we have it. \n\nWe also have a soft spot for the environment, that’s why we started the MILKRUN bag recycling program. Customers just fold up their gently used bags and hand them over to their Rider on their next order. Then the bags get a once over and go back into rotation. It’s that easy to do your bit. \n\nMILKRUN makes convenience more convenient. To get started, just install the app, add your deets and you’re ready to start your new I’ve-got-all-the-time-in-the-world-because-MILKRUN-delivers-my-groceries-in-minutes life. \n\nI LOVED THOSE KEY WORDS CAN I HEAR MORE? \n\nYou only buy what you need, which means food doesn't go to waste. You don't have to plan meals weeks in advance. You can rest easy knowing that you're saving the environment by skipping the drive to the supermarket. The list goes on, so give it go and send an invite to your friends and family to join the grocery delivery party that is MILKRUN.\n\nInstall the MILKRUN app, save your valuable petrol and experience the most convenient way to shop for groceries, delivered by the best group of people, ever."

Using patented software algorithms, the MEATER® app will give you cook time estimates, and guide you towards the juiciest steak, chicken, turkey, fish or other cut of meat that you've ever cooked.\n\nIt’s time to break free from the kitchen or grill and let the MEATER® app monitor your food for you. When your food is ready, you'll receive audio and visual notifications on your smart device. This way, you can stop watching your food cook, giving you more time to focus on the things that matter the most to you.\n\n* Unlike other smart meat thermometers, MEATER® is completely wireless! All of the electronics are contained inside the MEATER® probe, eliminating the need for any external wires.\n\n* Easily connect up to four MEATER® probes at once to cook every steak exactly the way each person likes them.\n\n* The smart Guided Cook™ system lets you know how long to cook your food, when to remove it from heat, and how long to let it rest. Simply select the type of meat, cut, and cook you want in the MEATER® app, then sit back and relax as perfect results are achieved.\n\n* For veteran chefs, fully customizable cooking and alert options are available to give you total control over your cooking experience.\n\n* Access your complete cooking history with ‘Previous Cooks’ so you can repeat your favorites whenever you want.\n\nCook smarter with MEATER®!

Quickly search for a food (eggs, chicken, strawberries, anything!) and feel confident in exactly how to prepare it for baby.\n\nWith a paid subscription, you can record baby's progress with a digital food log, track baby's favorite foods, make a list of foods you'd like to try later, and track any foods baby has had a reaction to which you can share with doctors and caregivers.  \n\nThis app will be a crucial tool to help you to raise a healthy, happy eater, avoid picky eating, and enjoy family meals!"

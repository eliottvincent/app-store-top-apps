Amidst the chaos, a small group of survivors managed to escape into the barren wilderness. \nYou are the Commander of these survivors. While escaping the zombie horde that utterly destroyed your last sanctuary, you come across a strange building jutting out from the ground. Low on supplies and left with little options, you decide to take refuge in this building. So begins your campaign of survival in this zombie-infested world. \n\n【BUILD & CUSTOMIZE YOUR SHELTER】\nExpand your shelter with numerous facilities such as the Satellite Nexus, Power Generators, the Mission Control, etc. Design the shelter’s layout whichever way you like! \n\n【HEROES AND SURVIVORS】 \nEvery hero and survivor possesses special life skills that helped them survive in the apocalypse. From chefs, doctors, and engineers to scientists, miners, and soldiers, it’s up to you to effectively utilize their skills! \n\n【TEAM COMPOSITION AND SYNERGY】 \nAssemble a diverse team of heroes, each with their unique personalities and abilities. Formulate your favorite team combination to help you conquer even the most daunting of situations. \n\n【VENTURE INTO THE WILD】 \nJourney outside the shelter and scavenge for valuable resources in the wastelands. \nSet up camps to act as forward operating bases and resource points. But be on guard! Zombies could attack at any moment! \n\n【ESTABLISH ALLIANCES WITH FRIENDS】 \nFighting alone is hard, so why not fight alongside friends? Join or create an Alliance and exterminate those pesky zombies with allies! Assist allies by accelerating each other’s constructions and tech researches. \nIt’s a win-win situation either way! It's all or nothing now! Go forth, Commander, and embark on your adventure!"

Start from the ground up in this fun and fast-paced time-management game where the aim is to build an accommodation empire and demonstrate your dedication to hospitality. Show your skills as a hotel manager, invest wisely in staff and property improvements, and work your socks off to become a hospitality tycoon in this addictive and entertaining casual simulator.\n\n► FIRST-CLASS SERVICE\n\n• Climb to the top: Start the game as a simple bellhop single-handedly cleaning rooms, greeting guests at reception, collecting payments and tips, and keeping the bathroom stocked with toilet paper. As your bank balance expands, upgrade rooms and facilities, and employ new staff to help keep up with the growing demand at your hotel. Your guests may be sleeping comfortably, but there’s no time to rest for a determined hotel tycoon.\n\n• Build an empire: There are several hotels to explore and expand, each with dozens of different unique upgrades to make before you reach five-star perfection. Demonstrate your competence as a manager in each location, then get promoted to get a new and bigger property, and continue your path to becoming a true hotel tycoon. Each hotel has its own style and atmosphere too.\n\n• Keep going: If you want success in this high-stakes industry, you can’t just stroll around your property at a leisurely pace. Upgrade your and your employees’ movement speed to work faster and provide your guests with all the services they need ASAP — it’ll boost your revenue too.\n\n• Amenities are the answer: Maximise profits and get more funds to invest in this fun simulator by ensuring your hotels have all available amenities. Bathrooms are the first step, but work hard and you’ll soon have the opportunity to add vending machines, restaurants, parking lots, and swimming pools to your properties. Guests will pay extra for each facility, boosting your revenue. Though remember each facility also needs staffing, so get hiring or you’ll soon run off your feet with angry guests left standing in line for each amenity.\n\n• Grand designs: Upgrade accommodation to improve guests’ experience of your property and choose from a range of different room designs in each location. In this engaging simulator, you’re not just a manager, you’re an interior designer too!\n\n► FIVE-STAR FUN\n\nLooking for a time-management game that’s original and simple to play and provides endless hours of entertainment? Dive straight into the fast-paced world of hospitality provision and develop your skills as a manager, investor, and designer.

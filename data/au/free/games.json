While escaping the zombie horde that utterly destroyed your last sanctuary, you come across a strange building jutting out from the ground. Low on supplies and left with little options, you decide to take refuge in this building. So begins your campaign of survival in this zombie-infested world. \n\n【BUILD & CUSTOMIZE YOUR SHELTER】\nExpand your shelter with numerous facilities such as the Satellite Nexus, Power Generators, the Mission Control, etc. Design the shelter’s layout whichever way you like! \n\n【HEROES AND SURVIVORS】 \nEvery hero and survivor possesses special life skills that helped them survive in the apocalypse. From chefs, doctors, and engineers to scientists, miners, and soldiers, it’s up to you to effectively utilize their skills! \n\n【TEAM COMPOSITION AND SYNERGY】 \nAssemble a diverse team of heroes, each with their unique personalities and abilities. Formulate your favorite team combination to help you conquer even the most daunting of situations. \n\n【VENTURE INTO THE WILD】 \nJourney outside the shelter and scavenge for valuable resources in the wastelands. \nSet up camps to act as forward operating bases and resource points. But be on guard! Zombies could attack at any moment! \n\n【ESTABLISH ALLIANCES WITH FRIENDS】 \nFighting alone is hard, so why not fight alongside friends? Join or create an Alliance and exterminate those pesky zombies with allies! Assist allies by accelerating each other’s constructions and tech researches. \nIt’s a win-win situation either way! It's all or nothing now! Go forth, Commander, and embark on your adventure!"

Start from the ground up in this fun and fast-paced time-management game where the aim is to build an accommodation empire and demonstrate your dedication to hospitality. Show your skills as a hotel manager, invest wisely in staff and property improvements, and work your socks off to become a hospitality tycoon in this addictive and entertaining casual simulator.\n\n► FIRST-CLASS SERVICE\n\n• Climb to the top: Start the game as a simple bellhop single-handedly cleaning rooms, greeting guests at reception, collecting payments and tips, and keeping the bathroom stocked with toilet paper. As your bank balance expands, upgrade rooms and facilities, and employ new staff to help keep up with the growing demand at your hotel. Your guests may be sleeping comfortably, but there’s no time to rest for a determined hotel tycoon.\n\n• Build an empire: There are several hotels to explore and expand, each with dozens of different unique upgrades to make before you reach five-star perfection. Demonstrate your competence as a manager in each location, then get promoted to get a new and bigger property, and continue your path to becoming a true hotel tycoon. Each hotel has its own style and atmosphere too.\n\n• Keep going: If you want success in this high-stakes industry, you can’t just stroll around your property at a leisurely pace. Upgrade your and your employees’ movement speed to work faster and provide your guests with all the services they need ASAP — it’ll boost your revenue too.\n\n• Amenities are the answer: Maximise profits and get more funds to invest in this fun simulator by ensuring your hotels have all available amenities. Bathrooms are the first step, but work hard and you’ll soon have the opportunity to add vending machines, restaurants, parking lots, and swimming pools to your properties. Guests will pay extra for each facility, boosting your revenue. Though remember each facility also needs staffing, so get hiring or you’ll soon run off your feet with angry guests left standing in line for each amenity.\n\n• Grand designs: Upgrade accommodation to improve guests’ experience of your property and choose from a range of different room designs in each location. In this engaging simulator, you’re not just a manager, you’re an interior designer too!\n\n► FIVE-STAR FUN\n\nLooking for a time-management game that’s original and simple to play and provides endless hours of entertainment? Dive straight into the fast-paced world of hospitality provision and develop your skills as a manager, investor, and designer.

      "label": "► IT’S A SMASH HIT GAME!\n\nThe pixelated apocalypse is here, and all that stands between humanity and the forces of destruction is you and your truck. So climb up to the cab, put your foot to the floor, and race straight for the action in this wildly entertaining demolition game where the only way to win is to hit the giant monsters head-on with all you've got. Then do it again, and again, and again…\n\n◾Start the demolition derby: It's a one-way street headed straight for the monsters, pick your trajectory, hit the ramp and crash straight into the enemy, trying to cause maximum destruction.\n\n◾Keep chipping away: Even the perfect crash isn't going to bring these giant monsters down first time, so chip away at them with multiple attacks until they finally crumble.\n\n◾Study all angles: This is an all-action game, but it pays to use a little strategy if you want to destroy the monsters in the fewest number of moves. Judge the angle and velocity of your truck to maximize damage from each crash and try to bring your enemy tumbling down by hitting their support.\n\n◾They won't go down without a fight: Monsters aren't just going to stand there while you keep ramming into them. Get ready to dodge a whole arsenal of fireballs, spikes on the road, and tossed bombs.\n\n◾So hit them where it hurts: If you want to make your life easier, aim your first assaults at the monster's power source. That way you'll have less to deal with on the road to destruction.\n\n◾And you've got something up your sleeve too: Each time you deal damage to a monster, you gain cogs, which you can spend on augmentations – including rocket launchers, giant bombs, or a size increase for your vehicle – or boosters to increase your armor, power, or bonus for the next crash.\n\n◾Where did they come from and how did they get so big? The game has 52 different animated giant monsters to demolish, from dinosaurs to superheroes to horror legends to ancient myths. Each has their particular powers and weak points, so you'll have to adapt your smash tactics for every level to make progress in the game.\n\n◾Fight the monsters with monster trucks: As you advance in the game, you'll be able to upgrade your pickup for even greater demolition damage, and eventually move on to bigger and better vehicles, including a police car and a full-size semi-truck.\n\n◾Lovely views, shame about the weather: There are eight unique and beautiful locations in the game, from city high-rises to snowy mountain peaks and from abandoned parking lots to outer space, so be sure to enjoy the view while you're there. Unfortunately, you'll also have to deal with the local conditions, which include tornadoes, meteorites and lightning storms.\n\n► KEEP IN TRUCKING \n\nLooking for an original action adventure with simple but addictive gameplay and increasingly challenging opponents? Ready to demolish an awesome range of massive monsters block by block? Then download Monster Demolition now, set your GPS to Destroy and hit the highway!\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://say.games/privacy-policy\nTerms of Use: https://say.games/terms-of-use"

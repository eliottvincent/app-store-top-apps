Now you don't have to read several articles from different sources to build up the complete picture.\n\nNEVER MISS IMPORTANT DETAILS\nNo matter what news source(s) you prefer to read, The Daily Edit reveals important additional details found in other articles. \n\nBE CONFIDENT WITH EVERY NEWS SOURCE\nWe use a proprietary article scoring system to rate every article.  That way you can be sure you're getting the complete picture. \n\nGET STORIES FROM ALL SOURCES\nWe don’t filter or discriminate news sources in any way.

Join us in a new media revolution by checking out this app!\n\n\nCOMMITTED TO YOUR PRIVACY\nThe Daily Edit only uses on-device tracking to recommend stories and doesn’t access your information without your permission. We never share information with third parties or allow advertisers to track you.\n \nAlready a subscriber to The Daily Edit?

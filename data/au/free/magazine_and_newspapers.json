      "label": "The Daily Edit automatically analyzes news articles and presents you with the unbiased news story as told by all publishers. Now you don't have to read several articles from different sources to build up the complete picture.\n\nNEVER MISS IMPORTANT DETAILS\nNo matter what news source(s) you prefer to read, The Daily Edit reveals important additional details found in other articles. \n\nBE CONFIDENT WITH EVERY NEWS SOURCE\nWe use a proprietary article scoring system to rate every article.  That way you can be sure you're getting the complete picture. \n\nGET STORIES FROM ALL SOURCES\nWe don’t filter or discriminate news sources in any way. This ensures that you get the facts that matter for each story. \n\nAVOID MISLEADING TEXT\nOur app highlights potentially misleading text so you don't have to. \n\nALERTS THAT MATTER TO YOU\nEasily create custom alerts for stories and topics that interest you. \n\nHow it works: \n- We aggregate stories by topic like other news aggregators.\n- Our algorithm reads each article on a story and gathers all of the details it found using artificial intelligence.\n- We then assess each article in that story and identify which details it contained, and which it missed. \n- We also identify regions of potentially misleading text (e.g. missing data references, missing sources)\n- We combine these metrics to form an assessment of the article.\n\nThe world needs facts, but when news travels faster than the speed of reason, we need a news technology solution to help make sense of it all. Join us in a new media revolution by checking out this app!\n\n\nCOMMITTED TO YOUR PRIVACY\nThe Daily Edit only uses on-device tracking to recommend stories and doesn’t access your information without your permission. We never share information with third parties or allow advertisers to track you.\n \nAlready a subscriber to The Daily Edit? Simply install the app and sign in with your Daily Edit login details.\nThe Daily Edit uses an advanced algorithm to measure the news, making sure that you get the full story no matter which source you choose to read.\n\nHAVE MORE QUESTIONS? \nMore on how it works: https://dailyedit.com/how-it-works/\nFrequently asked questions: https://dailyedit.com/faq/\nGet in touch: hello@dailyedit.com\n\nPrivacy policy: https://dailyedit.com/privacy\nTerms of use: https://dailyedit.com/terms\nEULA: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\""

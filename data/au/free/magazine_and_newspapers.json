Now you don't have to read several articles from different sources to build up the complete picture.\n\nNEVER MISS IMPORTANT DETAILS\nNo matter what news source(s) you prefer to read, The Daily Edit reveals important additional details found in other articles. \n\nBE CONFIDENT WITH EVERY NEWS SOURCE\nWe use a proprietary article scoring system to rate every article.  That way you can be sure you're getting the complete picture. \n\nGET STORIES FROM ALL SOURCES\nWe don’t filter or discriminate news sources in any way. This ensures that you get the facts that matter for each story. \n\nAVOID MISLEADING TEXT\nOur app highlights potentially misleading text so you don't have to. \n\nALERTS THAT MATTER TO YOU\nEasily create custom alerts for stories and topics that interest you. \n\nHow it works: \n- We aggregate stories by topic like other news aggregators.\n- Our algorithm reads each article on a story and gathers all of the details it found using artificial intelligence.\n- We then assess each article in that story and identify which details it contained, and which it missed. \n- We also identify regions of potentially misleading text (e.g. missing data references, missing sources)\n- We combine these metrics to form an assessment of the article.\n\nThe world needs facts, but when news travels faster than the speed of reason, we need a news technology solution to help make sense of it all. Join us in a new media revolution by checking out this app!\n\n\nCOMMITTED TO YOUR PRIVACY\nThe Daily Edit only uses on-device tracking to recommend stories and doesn’t access your information without your permission. We never share information with third parties or allow advertisers to track you.\n \nAlready a subscriber to The Daily Edit? Simply install the app and sign in with your Daily Edit login details.\nThe Daily Edit uses an advanced algorithm to measure the news, making sure that you get the full story no matter which source you choose to read.\n\nHAVE MORE QUESTIONS? \nMore on how it works: https://dailyedit.com/how-it-works/\nFrequently asked questions: https://dailyedit.com/faq/\nGet in touch: hello@dailyedit.com\n\nPrivacy policy: https://dailyedit.com/privacy\nTerms of use: https://dailyedit.com/terms\nEULA: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\""

You may control aspects of speech, such as pronunciation, volume, pitch, speed rate, speaking mode, casual or formal, etc. \n \nTEXT WITH MUSIC: With neural AI narration, you can convert text to music. With this premium, high-fidelity voice, you may listen to news, stories, analyses, articles, reports, verses, quotes, poems, and much more. Select a different reading style. Discover a unique way to listen to text by combining several musical genres, including Lo-Fi, Summer, Movie, Natural, Atmospheric, and more.\n\nNARRATE OVER A VARIETY OF BACKGROUND MUSIC: Listen to the text while listening to popular music in the background. You can use your favourite music as a background and overlay it on the reader's screen. For your Instagram reel or Tiktok, create a popular voiceover.\n\nCONVERT TEXT INTO MP3 TO GET AUDIO FILES: With our advanced sound filters, you can tickle your musical senses, making it more fun! Pitch, music rollover time, pitch, and speaking mode can all be changed.Share your text-converted musical file with your friends and family. Listen to your creation in the history section. Export and share high-quality audio files. For Instagram reel voiceovers, use audio files.\n\nCHOOSE A VOICE AGE AND SPEAKING MODE:  Listen to voices that make you feel close to someone you know and read aloud like a toddler or a man reading in a baritone voice.\n\nUSEFUL FOR ALL TYPE OF DOCUMENTS: Make it a PDF reader by capturing a PDF, taking a screenshot, documenting, or importing a picture. Unlike most text-to-speech (TTS) voice aloud readers, this one is powered by powerful neural voices with great fidelity.\n\nSHARE YOUR CREATION AND LISTEN TO IT IN THE HISTORY SECTION: Musical Reader text-to-speech can read books, documents, and articles to you as you cook, work, commute, or do other things. All of this can be listened to by going to the history section where it is saved.\n\nWe're more than simply a text-to-speech app; we include original neural voices and music.

Using the app, you can list ideas and contacts to stay safe, including warning signs, coping strategies, reasons for living, and ways to make your environment safe.\n\nConvenient and confidential, Beyond Now puts your safety plan in your pocket so you can access and edit it at any time. You can also email a copy to trusted friends, family or your health professional to help them support you. \n\nBeyond Now is designed to be used as part of your overall mental wellbeing and safety strategy. It is not intended to be your only form of support. Ideally you should work with a health professional or support person to create your plan, at a time when you’re feeling calm and relaxed.\n\nIf you know anyone who would find this app useful, talk to them about your concerns and encourage them to download Beyond Now.\n\nIf you are in an emergency or at immediate risk of harm, please contact emergency services on triple zero (000).\n\nBackground to Beyond Now:\nBeyond Now was developed by Beyond Blue and Monash University in collaboration with people who have experience with suicidal thoughts or a suicidal crisis. \n\nBeyond Blue would like to acknowledge Professor Barbara Stanley and Professor Greg Brown for developing the concept of safety planning, Dr Glenn Melvin, the software development team at Two Bulls, and Marcus Lee Designs for their valuable contributions to this project. \n\nBeyond Blue is grateful for the generous input from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community members and representatives from Health Services and organisations which has helped shape the design and content of Beyond Now.\n\nA special thanks also to the members of our consultation group for sharing their experiences of suicide and providing ideas, feedback and wisdom during the project."

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

      "label": "POWER TO THE PATIENTS\n\nThis is the dental healthcare app that’s going to save you money, time, and potentially a lot of pain too, with all our general dental treatments only $99!\n\nDental 99 is a whole new way of looking at dentistry – one that is almost entirely from a patient’s point of view.\n\nWe have designed Dental 99 to deliver convenience, value, transparent pricing, and great dental care.\n\nUsing the app is simple:\n\n1. Select your treatment. We offer three general dental treatments:\n\n- Checkup & Clean\n- Filling\n- Toothache management (this is the one for you if one or more of your teeth is bothering you and the source of pain hasn't been diagnosed yet) \n\n2. Use the app to find a time that suits you and pay $99 per general dental treatment. \n\nFor parents booking in kids, we'll claim the Medicare allowance for eligible kids on your behalf. And at $99 per general dental treatment, it's unlikely there'll be a gap payment.\n\n3. Arrive for your appointment and be looked after by one of our qualified clinicians.\n\n4. Your before/after photos, X-Rays, clinical notes, prescribed treatments, and aftercare notes will all be available in your app within a few minutes of your appointment finishing.\n\n5. Depending on your appointment's treatments, we'll send you daily post appointment aftercare advice to help you understand the recovery process and recover more quickly.\n\nWe currently have several clinics in Sydney (NSW) and Mango Hill (near Brisbane, QLD). We’re constantly working to open new clinics so that we can make our affordable, high quality dental care available to more communities around Australia. If there isn’t a Dental 99 clinic in your area yet, please use the contact form on our website (https://dental99.com.au/) to let us know where you’d like us to open our next clinic!\n\nIt’s never too late to look after your teeth, so what are you waiting for? Download the app and your mouth will thank you. But in case you need more reasons to download Dental 99 now, read on…\n\n- 40% of Australians avoid the dentist because of the cost\n\n- 33% of Australians don’t go to the dentist at all (that’s not good; bad teeth can be linked to all sorts of serious health problems)\n\n- 90% of Australians have some form of tooth decay (ouch! - see the previous point)\n\nConvinced of the value of Dental 99? Good, we hoped you would be!"

Dexcom G6 is approved for children age 2 and older.\n\nThe Dexcom G6 System provides personalized trend alerts right on your smart device and lets you see when your glucose levels are going too low, or too high, so you can better manage your diabetes. The Alert Schedule feature lets you schedule and customize a second set of alerts.  Custom alert sounds are available, including a Vibrate-Only option on the phone for glucose alerts. The only exception is the Urgent Low Alarm, which you can’t turn off.\n\n\nThe Always Sound setting allows you to receive certain Dexcom CGM Alerts even if your phone sound is off, set to vibrate, or in Do Not Disturb mode. This will allow you to silence calls or texts but still receive audible CGM Urgent Low Alarm and alerts: Low and High Glucose alert, Urgent Low Soon, and Rise and Fall Rate.  Please note that when your phone is set to Silent or Do Not Disturb, you will not receive any audible alerts for Signal Loss.  Always Sound is on by default. A Home screen icon shows you if your Alerts will sound or not.  For safety, the Urgent Low alarm and these alerts can’t be silenced: Transmitter Failed, Sensor Failed, and App Stopped. \n\nIn addition to the accurate performance provided by the Dexcom Sensor, you’ll receive other valuable features:\n\n•\tShare your glucose data with your followers who can monitor your glucose data and trends on their compatible smart device with the Dexcom Follow app. Share and Follow functions require an internet connection\n•\tHealth app access so you can share retrospective glucose data with third party apps\n•\tToday View widget, which allows you to view your glucose data on the lock screen of your smart device\n•\tAsk Siri* to read your current glucose value, using a custom phrase\n•\tA Dexcom CLARITY link on the landscape trend graph lets you easily transition to the CLARITY App to view more information on your glucose trends\n\n*Siri may not be available in all regions.

You should always return to your doctor to discuss your results.\n\n \n\nOnce you have activated your account, a notification will be sent to view any future results via the app. This gives you the ability to keep a copy of your personal radiology results on file, which you can access anywhere, anytime.\n\nThe ‘Request an Appointment’ feature allows you to arrange a booking at one of our radiology clinics. Simply select the type of imaging service required, choose your preferred location, time and date, then upload a photo of the referral form provided to you by your doctor. Once submitted, a member of our staff will contact you to book and confirm the appointment.\n\nIf you require assistance with the Lake Images Patient App, please email images@lakeimging.com.au with a description of the matter."

We may need a rash identifier, a mole checker, a skin analyzer, or an acne scanner, depending on the problem. The AI-Dermatologist app combines all these functions. We have designed this modern skin analyzer so that by using it on a regular basis, if you suspect a problem, you can contact your healthcare providers in time and avoid complications.\n\nBased on today's most advanced Artificial intelligence technologies and professional knowledge and expertise in dermatology, our application enables you to check all your skin problems for risk assessment: spots, birthmarks, acne, moles or papillomas. In 1 minute AI-Dermatologist gives a result on the next step to be taken. Likewise, AI-Dermatologist gives you the opportunity to store photos to keep track of changes over time and monitor your skin health in the long run. By creating AI-Dermatologist, we supported the idea of making skin screening and monitoring accessible to everyone.\n\nWith AI-Dermatologist you can:\n- Snapshot your skin spots, birth-marks, mole or another skin diseases such as: angioma, warts, papillomas, mollusks and etc.\n- Take / upload photos and track results for changes\n- Get a reminder when it is time to take a new photo, take pills or build a skin care routine \n- Сreate your own scheme for the medicines or cosmetics’ use according to your schedule \n- Track dynamics of baseline and follow-up results\n- Easily log the tracked your skin conditions locations on your body\n\nPlease note that AI-Dermatologist is not a diagnostic tool and does not replace or cancel a visit to your doctor. This application aims to help you be more aware of your skin condition via self-exams, but it is not an online dermatology platform. If you ever feel uncomfortable or see that your skin spot is changing, irritated, itchy or bleeding, we strongly recommend that you contact a medical specialist without hesitation to avoid the risk of melanoma or other skin diseases.\n\nBy signing up for this subscription, you agree to our\nTerms of use http://ai-derm.com/terms/terms_of_use.html\nPrivacy Policy http://ai-derm.com/privacy/privacy.html"

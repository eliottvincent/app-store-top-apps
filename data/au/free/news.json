Emergency services use a range of other information channels including SKY TV, ABC local radio, some commercial and designated community radio stations, VicEmergency Hotline  on 1800 226 226, VicEmergency website on www.emergency.vic.gov.au and VicEmergency Twitter and Facebook.\n\nAre you getting a message asking you to turn on notifications? You need to ensure that push notifications are enabled specifically for the VicEmergency app, as follows:\n\nFor iOS10, iOS9, iOS8 and iOS6:\n1. Click on the Settings icon and then select Notifications. \n2. Scroll down, click the VicEmergency icon\n3. Ensure 'Allow Notifications\" or \"Notification Centre\" (iOS6) at top of the screen is set to On. \n4. We recommend that you set Alert Style as 'Banners' or Alerts' and ensure that Sounds and \"Show on Lock Screen\" or \"View in Lock Screen\" (iOS6) are set to On. \n\nFor iOS7: \n1. Open the device's Settings icon and then select 'Notification Center'.\n2. Under 'Access on Lock Screen', check that 'Notifications View' is On (showing as green).\n3. Scroll further down and ensure that VicEmergency is in the list under INCLUDE. Click it to open it.\n4. At the top, set Alert Style as 'Banners' or Alerts'\n5. Then ensure that everything in this section is turned On - ‘Badge App Icon’, ‘Sounds’, 'Show in Notification Center', 'Show on Lock Screen’, etc (all should be showing as green)."

It was easy to feel comfortable hiring my neighbor’s daughter to watch my son after school.” - Patrick, Mission East\n\n“This year for Spring Cleaning, we wanted to sell old appliances, tools, clothing and electronics on Nextdoor’s marketplace, For Sale & Free. In no time, our neighbors stopped by to make a deal and take things off our hands. It was easier than anything else, and it feels good knowing our old stuff has found a new home in the neighborhood.” - Dan, Hayes Valley\n\nOUR PURPOSE\n\nAt Nextdoor, our purpose is to cultivate a kinder world where everyone has a neighborhood they can rely on.\n\nYOUR PRIVACY\n\nNextdoor is built on trust — we ensure you’re connected to REAL PEOPLE in the neighborhoods that matter to you.

Good for any beginners who do not have the proper training and have trouble remembering what the codes mean.\n- Save your favorites to the front screen of the app for quick one-tap access.\n- This app will dynamically grab a new list of sources so that you will always be the first to get any new police feeds out there.\n- See the popularity of each feed. Each feed lists the number of listeners who are following the action along with you.\n- Choose new skins or make your own. Skins can be any photo you choose from your photos library.\n- New police feeds and others are added on an hourly basis, so keep checking if we added yours recently.\n\nUpgrade to 5-0 Radio Pro to remove ads, add even more feeds, and new features.\n\nLegality\n======\nIt is legal in most countries to listen to police feeds. However, it is illegal in some places to use this app to aid in the commission of a crime or to pose as a police officer when you are not. It may also be illegal to use it while driving. Please consult your local laws before using this app outside of your home.\n\nIs it fake?\n=======\nIt's very real. Each feed comes from a person in that region with an expensive police scanner sharing the signal with you via the internet.\n\nReal-time\n=======\nThe delay between the real radio feed and this app is only a few seconds depending on buffering and internet speeds.\n\nRecommendations\n==============\nCheck out our website SmartestApple.com for other great free apps from us"

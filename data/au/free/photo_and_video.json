Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n* The app only works with a Chromecast 1+2+Ultra by Google and on devices with Google Cast or Chromecast built-in.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* Please test your favorite videos with the free edition before upgrading!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. \n\n* If a specific video does not cast, please check our FAQ. If that does not help, please give us a chance to help you by dropping a mail to info@video-tv-cast.com instead of leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for your video as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> UPGRADE FEATURES (available as in-app purchases)\n\n* Premium Edition: Unlocks all of the features listed here. Also future features are included, so you do not have to pay for them when they are released in an updated app version. \n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Chromecast. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker: Blocks ads & popups on most websites and removes the sponsoring ads from the app. You can update and enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Subtitles: Display subtitles & closed captions on TV.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> USER FEEDBACKS\n\n\"You've brought the chromecast to life on iOS devices!! And you designed it work easily and quickly\"\nRyan, England\n\n“I looooove your app. It has taken my Chromecast to a whole new level.”\nRosalind Romero, USA\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nWe want to say thank you for all your great support and kindly invite you to honestly rate our app. This helps us to keep up our app development and support for you. Please do not trust other apps that ask you for 5-star ratings in exchange for premium upgrades. This is against good developer ethics and also against Apple guidelines.\n\nIf you have any feedback, feature requests or other request, please notify us at info@video-tv-cast.com\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here. Chromecast is a trademark of Google LLC."

      "label": "NOMO RAW, a professional mobile camera app from NOMO family, presents to you the capacity of ProRAW photography, 16-Bit image processing pipeline, and color calibration profiles of pro cameras.\n\n* If you have subscribed to NOMO PRO, you can access to all the features in NOMO RAW -- YES, TOTALLY FREE. Special thanks to all the supports from our NOMO PRO members.\n\n* If you are a new NOMO user, you have monthly and annual pass to choose. Your call to make.\n\nHere are some of the powerful features of NOMO RAW.\n\n* 16-Bit Image Processing Pipeline: On iOS we can only store 8-Bit colors into HEIF and JPEG files, however, before the final saving, NOMO RAW used end-to-end 16-Bit pipeline to maintain the color depth from ProRAW and improve the final result.\n\n* Image Refinement: With ProRAW as the starting point, NOMO RAW could further remove the artifacts on your mobile photos, including over sharpening, luminance noise, detail loss, etc.\n\n* Color Solutions: By calibrating the 12-Bit ProRAW images to some professional cameras, you can pick up your favorite visual style before you take the photo. The preview is real-time and the processing is lightning fast. Try them.\n\n* HDR Photo: The highlight of HDR Photos will be much brighter on Super Retina display, Super Retina XDR display and Liquid Retina XDR display, which means, on Apple devices with HDR playback capabilities, you will see incredible contrasts.\n\n* RAW + HEIF/JPEG: To make document management much easier, you can choose to save RAW and HEIF/JPEG images to the one file or two separated files, meanwhile, you can turn off the saving of RAW and compressed images seperately.\n\n* Compression Ratio: Low, Medium, or High. Now you can save larger compressed files compared to the iOS camera. Or smaller files to save your storage space.\n\n* Auto Assistants: NOMO RAW has all the visual assitants to help you taking better pictures -- Histogram, Horizon Indicators, Focus Peaking & Zoom, Zebra Stripes, Thirds, etc.\n\n* Intuitive Interface: The powerful image capacity is working beneath a familiar and intuitive user interface. You don't need to learn about it. Everything's natural.\n\nSubscription service conditions:\n\n* NOMO RAW Pass provides 1-month and 1-year memberships for you to purchase;  \n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase;\n* Your subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period;\n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period;\n* The renewal price for 1-month membership is USD 1.99 and 1-year membership is USD 9.99.\n* You can manage your subscription and switch off the auto-renewal by accessing your Account Settings after purchase;\n* Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited if you purchase a subscription to that publication;\n* All personal data is handled under the terms and conditions of NOMO RAW’s privacy policy.

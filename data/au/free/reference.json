      "label": "** The #1 Catholic App **\n\nWHAT IS HALLOW\nHallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio-guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith & spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 6,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.\n\nIn today’s world, we’re stressed, anxious, distracted, & can’t sleep. At the same time, we’re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, & relationships. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)\n\nWHAT YOU GET\n* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, & the Divine Mercy Chaplet\n* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts & minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, & recognize His presence with us\n* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible\n* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals\n* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day & discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, & the Holy Spirit\n* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture\n* Taizé & Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant & music\n* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas\n* Homilies & Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine & more!\n* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm\n* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena\n* Litanies & Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!\n* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!\n\nAdditional features to help customize your prayer experience:\n* Journal after every prayer\n* Choice of man or woman guide\n* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)\n* Ability to set prayer reminders\n* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant\n* Ability to download sessions for offline listening\n* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another\n\nAs Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD’s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths & religions.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS\nUsers can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.\nTo access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:\n$8.99 per month\n$59.99 per year\n\nThese prices are for United States customers.\n\nYour Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.\nTerms and conditions: https://hallow.com/terms-of-service\nPrivacy policy: https://hallow.com/privacy-policy"

      "label": "\"Incredible App - My sister shared this app with me a few weeks ago and it is truly incredible. The music that plays when you read the verses, the scrolling like flipping a page, and everything about it just makes my time with God feel very intimate when I am reading daily verses and able to go through some of the devotionals. Really grateful to have had this app shared with me, especially during everything going on right now, it couldn’t have been better timing. We have also shared it with our Dad who loves the app as well. I have used apps in the past such as the Bible app that is very well known and found that some of the devotionals included someone’s biased opinion instead of focusing on what God is saying to us in the Bible. This app and the Jesus Calling App are the only apps for Devotionals and Daily verses that I consistently use because I love them so much and deeply appreciate that they stick to what the Bible says and not someone’s own interpretation of it. Whoever designed this app did an incredible job! Thank you so much!\"\n\nReceive God's word daily through beautiful Holy Bible stories, verses, and music. Receive personal, relevant verses for inspiration and sharing with loved ones.  Each day a new verse is sent to your device - it's like receiving a message from a dear friend who loves you and wants you to be happy.  Join the #Bible movement, share the Word, and fill social media with grace.\n\nYou may use this app for free, but if you would be delighted to support our mission of delivering thousands of moments of grace, love, and wisdom each day, there are patronage subscriptions available. \n\nTerms of service: http://www.mindblownapp.com/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://www.mindblownapp.com/privacy"

In addition to the dominant features such as reading the Qur'an and listening to the Qur'an, there are many different details in the application. You can use translations in different languages, tafsir, book mode and dozens of other features.\n\nThe application, which contains all the features to increase your Quran reading experience, contains all the details you may want.\n\nQuran 360: Quran English, Quran Audio, Tafsir, Recitation\n\nReading \nListening \nFamous Reciters\nDifferent Reading Modes\nSearch Feature\nAyah Sharing\nTafsir\nTranslations in Different Languages\nDaily Ayahs\nBookmark\nTransliteration\nCustomizable Font Size\nIncrease Listening Speed\n\nRead Quran English\n\nThose who want to read our holy book on their phones may encounter many difficulties. The inability to adjust the font sizes, eye-catching designs and other details negatively affect the reading experience.\n\n360, on the other hand, is getting ready to take its place in the stores to eliminate all these difficulties. It promises a more fluid experience thanks to its features such as different reading modes, font size adjustment, and background changing.\n\nThe feature of bookmarking where you left off during the reading process is among the most requested features. In this way, even if you exit the application, you can see where you left off when you return.\n\nQuran Audio Mode\n\nThe most popular aspect of the Quran Audio listening feature is that it includes different reciters. As you know, recitation is practiced as an art in itself. Especially in Arabic-speaking countries, there are schools and courses on recetitation. You can listen to every ayah you want from the voices of famous reciters in 360. If you want, you can also listen to the whole book from beginning to end.\n\nThanks to the option to increase the speed of reading the Qur'an, you have the chance to quickly recite the entire book. You can also use this feature when you want to skip the ayahs you have memorized.\n\nFamous Reciters\n\nBesides reading our holy book, it is also a good deed to listen to it. Quran 360 brings this worship to your smartphones.\n\nIt provides all the conveniences you want for reading from start to finish, that is, hateem it by listening. In this way, you can listen and read the Qur'an at home, at work, on the road or wherever you want.\n\nThe application includes famous reciters from all over the world. You can listen to ayahs with recordings of well-known reciters such as Akram Al-Alaqmi, Abdul Rashid Sufi, Abdul Muhsin al Qasim, Abdullah Mahrood.\n\nThe recording of Akram Al-Alaqmi is prepared without a gap. Thus, you can listen to the whole قران كريم without interruption.\n\nQuran Tafsir\n\nUnderstanding the Qur'an is as important as reading it. For this reason, many Islamic scholars have published tafsir books. Tafsir means translation with explanation.\n\nIf you read the Qur'an together with the Tafsir books, you can see the real meanings and other details behind the ayahs. Moreover, you can see why that verse was revealed or after which event it was conveyed to the Hz. Muhammad (s.a.v.).\n\nThe application's search mode also makes it easy to find the verse details you want. Thus, without searching the internet, you can search by all verses and the words in the verses by just using the application.\n\nQuran Translations\n\nContaining more than 30 قران كريم translations, the app allows you to see transliteration, translation and tafsir in the language you want.\n\nThe application includes translations of many languages ​​such as English, Turkish, French, German, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, Malay, Indonesian, Hindi, Urdu, Persian, Bulgarian, Swedish, Italian.\n\nPrivacy & Terms : https://www.muslimassistant.com/privacy-terms.html"

      "label": "Unleash the power of your smartphone to take you on a guided tour of the night sky, even if you’ve never used a telescope before.\n\nSTARSENSE SKY RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY\n\nThis one-of-a-kind app uses patent-pending technology in combination with a Celestron StarSense Explorer telescope (sold separately) to analyze star patterns overhead to calculate the telescope’s position in real time with pinpoint accuracy.\nStarSense Explorer’s sky recognition technology has revolutionized the manual telescope by eliminating the confusion common among beginners and enhancing the user experience for even seasoned telescope users. Many would-be astronomers become frustrated or lose interest in their manual telescope because they don’t know where to point it to see planets, star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies—the good stuff! StarSense Explorer tells you exactly which celestial objects are currently visible in the night sky and where to move your telescope to place those objects in the telescope’s eyepiece. \n\nTHE NIGHT SKY AT YOUR FINGERTIPS\n\nThe user-friendly planetarium interface allows you to scan the skies for objects you wish to view. You can also search for objects in the extensive database. \nNot sure what to observe? StarSense Explorer automatically generates a list of all the best stars, planets, galaxies, nebulae and more currently visible from your location. Simply select one from the list and off you go! \nWhile you observe, you can access detailed information, images, and audio descriptions for the most popular objects. It’s a great way for the entire family to learn scientific facts, history, mythology, and more, deepening your understanding of the night sky.\n\nEASY AS 1-2-3: DOCK, LAUNCH, OBSERVE\n\nTo get started, assemble your StarSense Explorer telescope and download the app. Your telescope includes a unique unlock code to access the full features of the app. Connect your phone to the telescope by placing it into the StarSense dock and launch the app.\nAfter a simple 2-step procedure to align the smartphone’s camera with the telescope, the app displays a view of the night sky and shows a bullseye on the screen to represent the telescope’s current pointing position. From here, you can select an object to view by tapping it in the planetarium view or selecting it from the Tonight’s Best observing list. Objects will vary from night to night; you may see planets like Jupiter or Saturn, nebulae like Orion, the Andromeda Galaxy, or other object types.\nOnce you select an object, the app displays pointing arrows onscreen. These indicate where to move the telescope to find it. Follow the arrows until the bullseye appears centered on target. When the bullseye turns green, the object is visible in the telescope’s lower powered eyepiece. \n\nHOW STARSENSE EXPLORER WORKS\n\nStarSense Explorer uses image data captured by the smartphone’s camera to determine its pointing position. The app captures an image of the night sky and then matches the star patterns within the image to its internal database in a process like fingerprint matching or facial recognition. \nThe process of extracting star pattern data in images to determine a telescope’s current pointing position is called “plate solving.” It is the same method used by professional observatories and orbiting satellites. \nThe StarSense Explorer app is the first app ever developed that uses plate solving to determine the smartphone’s current pointing position. Other astronomy apps rely on the smartphone’s gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compass to estimate its pointing position. These methods are not accurate enough to place objects within the telescope’s field of view. \nStarSense Explorer technology is patent-pending. \n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nCompatible with iPhone 6 and higher.\n\nLOCALIZATION\n\nSupport for English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Japanese and Russian."

      "label": "SKY TONIGHT is a brand-new astronomical app for exploring the sky. It helps stargazers answer the three most common questions:\n\n⁕ What is that bright dot in the sky?\n⁕ What astronomical events can I see tonight?\n⁕ How can I find the object I'm interested in?\n\nMade by the developers of Star Walk apps, Sky Tonight is a customizable stargazing tool, that is designed for users with different needs and wants. You can adjust the constellation's appearance, set a reminder for any space body configuration, explore the unique relative to observer trajectory, set up a magnitude limit to filter out space objects, and much more.\n\nSKY TONIGHT FEATURES:\n\n► Point your device at the sky to see the real-time positions of space objects on the interactive sky map.\n► Activate the Time Machine and determine the position of celestial bodies at different time periods.\n► Use the augmented reality mode and see the sky map overlaid on the image from your device's camera.\n► Get extended information about any sky object by tapping on its name.\n► Stay updated on the latest news from the world of astronomy with the What's new section.\n► Turn on the night mode to make your sky observation in the nighttime more comfortable.\n► Filter the objects that appear on the sky map according to their visual brightness.\n► Regulate the brightness of objects on the sky map.\n► Spot dozens of asterisms along with the official constellations. \n► Adjust the visible constellations and customize their representation on the screen.\n\nUNIQUE FEATURES:\n\n◆ INTERACTIVE TRAJECTORIES RELATIVE TO AN OBSERVER\nInstead of the classic trajectory that shows the object’s trajectory in the celestial sphere relative to the Earth’s center, the app presents the object’s trajectory in the sky relative to an observer. A long touch on the trajectories relative to the observer will move the sky object to the selected point. While holding the touch, move your finger along the trajectory to change the time.\n\n◆ FLEXIBLE SEARCH\nMake use of the flexible search — quickly find space objects, easily navigate across different objects and events’ types. Look for \"stars\", \"mars moons\", \"mars conjunctions\", \"solar eclipse\", and the app will show you all related objects, events, and articles!\nThere are also Trending and Recent categories in the search section. The first one presents the currently most popular objects, events, or news; the second category contains objects you recently selected. \n\n◆ FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE EVENT REMINDERS\nSet event reminders on any time and date not to miss a solar eclipse, a Full Moon, or a star-planet configuration you're interested in.\n\n◆ ASTRONOMY CALENDAR WITH A STARGAZING INDEX AND WEATHER FORECAST\nCheck out the calendar of celestial events that includes lunar phases, meteor showers, eclipses, oppositions, conjunctions, and other exciting events. Learn what astronomy events will occur this month or see what happened in the sky a year ago!\nVerify the Stargazing Index calculated from a Moon phase, light pollution, cloudiness, and time when an object is visible. The higher this index is, the better the observation conditions are.\n\nYou don’t need several apps for your stargazing planning anymore; Sky Tonight contains all the info you need.\n\nPremium Access:\n\n* The app includes paid Premium Access. Get Premium Access to use Sky Tonight with no limits! Without the subscription, you can’t see most of the interface items in various sections such as Visible Tonight, Calendar, and Search. Therefore, you’re limited in planning and improving your observations. Premium Access will allow you to unlock all the interface items in any view and make the most of all the app’s features. Advertisements will also be removed not to interrupt your stargazing experience.\n\nPrivacy policy: https://vitotechnology.com/privacy-policy\nTerms of use: https://vitotechnology.com/terms-of-use"

      "label": "This Ngarinyin field guide and phrasebook allows anyone in the world to access this amazing part of Australia's cultural heritage for free. Download and explore today!\n\nNgarinyin or Ungarinyin is the traditional language of the Wilinggin Native Title Determined Area, in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Ngarinyin speaking people are linked to Worrorra and Wunambal people through their law and belief in the Wanjina creator being. These days only old people speak Ngarinyin well.\n\nThis app is designed for people of all ages, to enable and increase use of the Ngarinyin language. The hope is that younger people will use the Ngarinyin they have learnt from this app to better understand Ngarinyin country and keep the language alive. It provides a companion resource to the book 'Bunda Ngaala-gu di Wuran-gu Wurlawa Ngadi: We are Talking about Animals and Trees'. The content in this app is the same as that in the book but with extra features and a few extra photos.\n\nFeatures: \n\n* All the field guide and phrasebook entries from the book\n* Search for Ngarinyin or English words\n* Audio recordings from native speakers for many entries\n* Subject areas include kinship, plants, animals, material culture, the seasons, land and country and many more\n\nFor many of the words and phrases you can tap the orange audio icon on the right side of the screen to hear a recording of the word or phrase spoken by a Ngarinyin speaker. You can practice pronouncing words even when you are by yourself. If you want to find a word or phrases quickly and easily, pull down from the top of the screen and type a word into the white rectangle 'Search' that appears. You can use the App offline without internet access or mobile phone signal. All you need to do is keep your phone charged.\n\nThe language and information produced in this app is the traditional knowledge of the Wilinggin People. It has been provided to contribute to knowledge preservation, language maintenance and general education. Information should not be used for commercial purposes in any way without following the Indigenous cultural protocols of prior informed consent, appropriate attribution, cultural integrity and the sharing of benefits. Caution should be used when using and playing audio of this app as it contains the names and recorded voices of people who have passed away. Although some of the Ngarinyin speakers are deceased, their names and voices have been used with the permission of living elders so their language knowledge will be used and not forgotten.\n\nThe book that the material in this app is based on grew out of a week-long language workshop for the Wunggurr Rangers, held at Gibb River community in April 2015. Without the support and contributions from Traditional Owners and Ngarinyin Speakers the production of the book and app would not have been possible and the knowledge contained within it would eventually be lost. We are grateful and thankful for the work and input by all community members. The creation of this app has been funded and coordinated by Wilinggin Aboriginal Corporation."

      "label": "Pleco is the ultimate Chinese learning companion: an integrated dictionary / document reader / flashcard system with fullscreen handwriting input and live OCR, from a company that's been making the world's best mobile Chinese learning apps since 2001.\n\nMajor features: ($ = paid add-on)\n\n• Amazing dictionaries. We offer two free built-in dictionaries: the popular open-source CC-CEDICT, with over 110,000 frequently-updated entries, and our own PLC dictionary, with 125,000 entries, parts of speech, and over 25,000 example sentences (with Pinyin). More than two dozen other dictionaries are available as free and paid ($) add-ons, including licensed titles from well-known publishers like Oxford, Longman, FLTRP, Tuttle, SLPH, and Commercial Press.\n\n• Powerful merged search: look up words by Chinese characters, Pinyin (spaces / tones optional), or English, with support for wildcards and full-text search. And no need to tediously flip between all of those dictionaries to find a word - just type in your search term and instantly get a combined, frequency-sorted result list.\n\n• Links and cross-references: easily look up character components, break down words into individual characters, look up lists of words containing a particular character, and search across all dictionaries for example sentences containing a word.\n\n• Gorgeous typography: see it for yourself in our screenshots - we think we're one of the best-looking Chinese dictionaries around. Alternate Kai/Song/Xing-style Chinese fonts are also available ($).\n\n• PRC/HK/Taiwan-friendly: every part of Pleco supports both traditional and simplified, headword readings can be shown in Pinyin and Zhuyin, and some dictionaries even support Cantonese. (note: stroke order diagrams do support traditional characters, but use PRC order)\n\n• Audio: Hear Mandarin and Cantonese for words and example sentences using iOS' free built-in text-to-speech system. We also offer add-ons ($) with native-speaker Mandarin recordings and higher-quality Mandarin TTS.\n\n• Document Reader: bring in text from the clipboard and tap on words in it to instantly look them up. Upgrade ($) adds support for tap-lookups in text, HTML, DOC, DOCX, PDF, and EPUB files. We also offer graded readings ($).\n\n• OCR: look up words simply by pointing your device's camera at them, or by tapping on them in a still image. ($)\n\n• Fullscreen handwriting: use your device's whole screen instead of just a little box. Extremely accurate and highly tolerant of stroke order mistakes. (enhanced $)\n\n• Flashcards: create a card from any dictionary entry with a single button tap, import premade word lists, use advanced memorization techniques like SRS, and study in a variety of modes including fill-in-the-blanks handwriting and tone drills. ($)\n\n• Stroke Order Diagrams: animations showing you how to draw each character; 500 characters for free, 28,000 in paid ($) version.\n\n• User dictionaries: create new dictionary entries right on your device as you encounter new words. ($)\n\n• No ads.\n\nWe also offer famously excellent customer support and an active user community at http://www.plecoforums.com. And we're constantly working to make our products better; our sales and customer base have been growing for two decades across 4 different platforms. You can be confident that we'll still be fixing bugs and adding features for years to come.\n\nPaid add-ons can be transferred to other devices that link to your iTunes account just like any other paid iTunes content; simply install our free app, open up the \"Add-ons\" screen, and tap on the \"Restore Purchases\" button to activate your purchase on each device.\n\nPlease contact us at support@pleco.com, via the form at http://www.pleco.com/contact.html, or using the in-app \"Contact Support\" command with any questions - we'll be delighted to hear from you."

We are proudly Australian owned and operated, with offices in Darwin, Melbourne, and Brisbane.\n\nThe first thing you will notice when you download the Dabble app is that it feels different. It doesn’t feel like your other betting apps. \n\nYou will still find comprehensive coverage of local and international racing markets. You can still place a bet on the Flemington races, and soon you can have a 'dabble' on the NBA. \n\nIn addition, you will find a huge range of features that allow you to interact and engage with other punters:\n\nFOLLOW OTHER PUNTERS\nEach punter will set up a profile on the app by choosing a username and avatar. The profile can be private (nobody can see your betting activity unless you accept them) or publicly available to all users. You can choose to ‘Follow’ another user and have their content displayed in your home feed.\n\nCOPY BET\nClicking ‘Copy Bet’ on another user’s ticket will load the selection or selections (for Multi/Exotics) directly to your betslip. Choose your stake and place the bet for a seamless ‘Copy’ experience. \n\nBET DESCRIPTION \nEvery winning bet feels better if you told people about it beforehand. The ‘Bet Description’ is the punter’s opportunity to justify their bet and explain why they chose their selection. You can put your full analytical paper in here for why Lebron James will get more than 6.5 assists, or you can simply say that you like the colour of the jockey’s silk. \n\nBANTER \nUsers will be able to communicate directly through the Dabble app. No more ‘Screenshot a betslip and send to Whatsapp’ - simply send it to your mates using Dabble.\n\nDownload the betting app of today to see what everyone is talking about."

It shows the temperature of your current location. That does not mean that your phone becomes a thermometer and can read the temperature of the surrounding area, using a weather service. A lot of idiots download this app and complain that their phone can't read the temperature indoors. Of course it can't! It's a phone, and no matter what app or other software you install on it, it will never be able to read the temperature of its immediate surroundings unless you had some hardware already installed that can do so, and a touch-screen phone simply cannot take someone's temperature.\nby jefffafa123\n\n- Gets the temp for your current location, or for other saved locations. Works very well. I previously used another thermometer app, but it had banner ads that you couldn't close, and they covered the temperature if it dropped low enough. This one has a nice clean interface and easy to use!\nby AndyLPhoto\n\n- It is very accurate and is really easy to use and control. I recommend using this app!\nby AwesomeV01\n\n- Very nice. Very simple. I like the auto save feature and the ability to just flip through the pages to get where you want.\nby Tree on Hill"

      "label": "Land, Coast & Sea. Fish Ranger is Australia’s premier fishing weather app that provides true land and marine forecasts. Don't rely on shoreline forecasts when you're heading out in a boat, wind offshore is often much stronger than on land and you need forecasts tuned to the open water.\nReal Time overlays show actual wind speed and gust speed so you can see how weather is tracking to expected. 10 day forecasts, air pressure (aka barometer) forecasts, slack water times, moon phases - everything you need on a single page.\nFish Ranger also includes a Solunar Calendar which gives you the best times to fish and a Log Book so you can save your fishing trips and look back on the weather to see which conditions are most favorable. \n\nUsed and endorsed by industry experts and leading fishermen Australia wide, Fish Ranger offers many advantages and features over other weather apps. \n\nThe app is free to use with additional features available on subscription.  The free version offers more features that any other weather app with increased accuracy.\n\n\n Here are some of the endorsements we have received from our users:\n\n“Fish Ranger has become my ‘go-to’ source for all weather information and an essential factor in trip planning. I don’t pick up a rod without checking Fish Ranger first!” \r\n- Steve “Starlo” Starling, Fishotopia.com\r\n\r\n“This is by far – I believe, the No 1 weather forecasting tool.  I have found it’s accuracy to be the best out there, and it totally suits fishing for natives as well as salties”\r\n- Bill Dunn, Rod N Paddle\r\n\r\n\r“As a charter operator (2 boats) I use your site exclusively and was very relieved when I discovered this fantastic site as most weather sites are terrible”\n\n- Trevor Holmes, Victorian Inland Charters\r\n\r\n“This is a vital tool for the Fisherman and without it I wouldn’t be heading offshore to chase Kings so often as it is to the hour perfect”\r\n- Matt Cini, Captain Real Time Fishing Charters\r\n\r\n“You've got to get on it because seriously I reckon its better than all the others\"\r\n- David Kramer, host of Talking Fishing\r\n\r\n\n“It’s exceptional, as both an app and website”\r\n- Hooked Up magazine\r\n \r\n\r“I do a lot of fishing, crabbing and prawning. I got fed up with other sites’ inaccuracy. Ever since I’ve used the subscription service I’ve been amazed at the accuracy of the GFS model, while their BoM forecast is also better than many with on water wind forecasts for coastal regions. I strongly recommend this app to fishos and boaties”\n\n- Skip, Ontour Fishing Australia\r\n\r\n\n“We use and recommend this great product”\r\n- Relax Go Fishing Charters\r\n\r\n\n“It seems to be the most accurate for up here (Hervey Bay), it’s rarely wrong”\r\n- Luke Fitzpatrick, Fish That Snag\r\n\r\n“The best weather forecasting site, comprehensive & very accurate. I’ve been a sailor, surfer & fisherman for 35 years & rely on good weather forecasts, Fishranger is the first & last place I go for my coastal weather”\r\n- Steel Chadwick, User\r\n\n\nSo download it now and see why so many people are making the switch.\n\nJoe"

Just start the app; your location pops up with animated live radar, with radar loop lengths of up to two hours. This basic functionality provides the quickest way to get a snapshot of the weather on-the-go, and it's what has made MyRadar so successful over the years. Check your phone and get an instant assessment of the weather that will impact your day.\n\nOne of the most useful features in MyRadar is the ability to provide advanced rain alerts; our patent-pending process for predicting hyper-local rainfall is the most accurate in the industry. Instead of having to check the app all the time, MyRadar will send you an alert up to an hour in advance as to when the rain will arrive at your current location, down to the minute, including details on intensity and duration. These alerts can be a life saver when you're on-the-go and don't always have time to check the weather - our systems will proactively do the work for you and let you know in advance before the rain hits.\n\nIn addition to the live radar, MyRadar has an ever-increasing list of weather and environmentally-related data layers that you can overlay on top of the map;  our animated winds layer shows a breathtaking visual representation of both surface winds and winds at the jetstream level; the frontal boundaries layer shows high and low pressure systems as well as frontal boundaries themselves; the earthquakes layer is a great way to stay on top of the latest reports on seismic activity, completely customizable as to severity and time; our hurricane layer allows users to stay on top of the latest tropical storm and hurricane activity throughout the world; the aviation layer overlays AIRMETs, SIGMETs and other aviation-related data, including the ability to track flights and display their IFR flight plans and paths, and the \"wildfires\" layer allows users to stay abreast of the latest fire activity around the United States.\n\nMyRadar also has the ability to send weather and environmental alerts, including alerts from the National Weather Service, such as Tornado and Severe Weather alerts. A new feature introduced in this version of MyRadar includes the ability to receive alerts based off of Tropical  Storm and Hurricane activity;  you can configure the app to send you an alert any time a tropical storm or hurricane forms, or is upgraded or downgraded.\n\nIn addition to the free features of the app, additional upgrades are available, including real-time hurricane tracking - great for the start of hurricane season. The hurricane tracker provides additional data above and beyond the free version, including the cone of probability for tropical storm/hurricane forecast tracks, and it also includes a detailed synopsis from the National Hurricane Center. The premium upgrades also include the professional radar pack, which allows greater detail of radar from individual stations. Users can select individual radar stations around the US, select the radar tilt angle, and also change the radar product being displayed, including base reflectivity and wind velocity - great for experienced weather buffs looks to stay on top of possible tornado formation.\n\nDownload MyRadar today and try it out!\n* Aviation Charts subscription (not required in order to use MyRadar) ($24.99 USD per YEAR)\n* Payments will be charged to your iTunes account\n* Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\n* Auto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your settings in the iTunes Store after purchase.\n\nMyRadar's Privacy Policy, visit: https://myradar.com/privacy\nFull terms of service: https://myradar.com/terms"

      "label": "The app combines highly accurate weather forecast for your location with a 3D map showing development of weather in a broader area in a very interesting way. This allows you to see where precipitation is going to come from or where the wind is blowing from. The uniqueness of the app comes from the amount of data displayed. Forecast of weather, precipitation, wind, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, snow cover and other meteorological data for different altitudes is available for the whole world. \n\nWIND ANIMATION\nThe Ventusky application solves weather displaying in an interesting way. Wind is displayed using streamlines which clearly portray the continuous development of weather. Airflow on Earth is always in motion and the streamlines depict this motion in an amazing way. This makes the interconnection of all atmospheric phenomena obvious.\n\nWEATHER FORECAST\nWeather forecast for the first three days is available in the app in one-hour steps. For other days, it’s available in three-hour steps. Users can also look up sunrise and sunrise times in a given place or air quality.\n\nWEATHER MODELS\nThanks to the Ventusky application, visitors get data directly from the numerical models that, just a few years ago, were used solely by meteorologists. The app collects data from the most accurate numerical models. Besides the well-known data from the American GFS and HRRR models, it also displays data from the Canadian GEM model and the German ICON model, which is unique thanks to its high resolution for the whole world. Two models, EURAD and USRAD, are based on current radar and satellite readings. These models are able to show precisely current precipitation in US and Europe.\n\nWEATHER FRONTS\nYou can also display weather fronts. We have created a neural network that predicts the positions of cold, warm, occluded, and stationary fronts based on data from weather models. This algorithm is unique, and we are the first on the world who makes global fronts forecast available to users.\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS\n• Temperature (16 levels)\n• Temperature anomaly\n• Perceived temperature\n• Precipitation (1 hour, 3 hour, long time accumulation)\n• Radar\n• Satellite\n• Wind gusts (1 hour, long time maximum)\n• Air quality (AQI, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, O3, dust or CO)\n• Probability of aurora\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS (PREMIUM)\n• Wind (16 levels)\n• Cloud cover (high, middle, low, total)\n• Snow cover (total, new)\n• Humidity (4 layers)\n• Dew point\n• Air pressure\n• CAPE, CIN, LI, Helicity (SRH)\n• Freezing level\n• Wave forecast\n• Ocean currents\n\nLIST OF WEATHER WIDGETS\n• Forecast 4x2\n• Forecast 2x2\n• Forecast 4x4\n• Radar 4x2\n• Radar 2x2\n\nThe app is completely free of ads.

All you need is: your personal API key, which will be created in your personal account on Wunderground.com for you to retrieve.\n\nOnce you've configured access to Wunderground.com for myPWS by entering your API key, myPWS will let you view the latest readings from your weather station, as well as any other weather station registered on Wunderground.com. You can use an area map to search for near or far weather stations all over the world and have them displayed for detailed diagrams and current readings.\n\nmyPWS offers you extensive diagrams with the\n\n• measured values ​​of the current and the previous day\n• the last 7 days (per hour / per day)\n• any day in the past*\n• monthly data*\n• yearly data*\n• data of two PWS in one single comparison chart*\n• combined data of one PWS in a single chart*\n• wind direction chart*\n\nUp to two different types of data can be displayed together in a diagram, e.g. to look at temperature and air pressure together in one graph.\n\nFurthermore you can\n\n• cache and export data via iCloud our email to your other devices on which you also use myPWS*. This saves data API calls which are limited to 1,500 per day through Wunderground.com via your API key\n• add more than two stations to your station list*\n• export diagram data via CSV, PDF or as graphics*\n• email - export raw measurement data as provided by Underground\n\nPlease note: myPWS requires a Wunderground.com account and a PWS (Personal Weather Station) registered in your account. By registering a PWS you will receive an API key which is needed for the retrieval of data from the Wunderground network by myPWS. The access to PWS measurement data via the Wunderground data server depends on the availability of the WU infrastructure and the WU API services, which are not under the control of the manufacturers of the myPWS app.\n\n* Available via a one-time In App Purchase"

      "label": "Firesource’s features:\n◦ Live fire feed - both on map and in scrollable menu\n◦ Local and national fire incidents - news updates and reports\n◦ Fire perimeters - access all realtime fire perimeters at once with information about fire growth and progress, including acreage, containment, personnel, fire cause, and fire behavior\n◦ Report a fire - instantly inform other users of a nearby fire by pressing the + button, taking a picture of the fire, and submitting\n◦ Air quality - see the effects of recent fires by viewing realtime air quality measurements across the country\n◦ Satellite fire detections can indicate new fires and how current fires are spreading\n\nNational Fires (InciWeb, Cal Fire, IRWIN):\nInciWeb is an interagency incident management system run by the National Wildfire Coordinating Group. InciWeb collects wildfire incident data from several agencies across the United States and provides all of this data together in several feeds. Firesource presents wildfire incidents reported by InciWeb in real time, providing the fire’s location and detailed status. Learn more about InciWeb at their website: https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/. Learn more about Cal Fire, which also provides incident information, at their website: https://www.fire.ca.gov. Learn more about IRWIN, the data hub of fire reports, at https://www.forestsandrangelands.gov/WFIT/applications/IRWIN/.\n\nNational Fires (Perimeters):\nPerimeter data is provided by the Wildland Fire Interagency Geospatial Services (WFIGS) Group and hosted in the National Interagency Fire Center ArcGIS Online Organization (The NIFC Org). Firesource displays fire perimeters and descriptions of their progress in the ‘National Fires’ tab of the menu, with this information updated on a regular basis. Learn more about the NIFC at their website: https://www.nifc.gov\n\nUser-Reported Fires:\nAllowing app users to report a fire and immediately inform other users is an essential aspect of Firesource. To report a fire, press the yellow + button in the top right corner of the map, select the type of fire (vehicle fire, forest fire, terrain fire, structure fire), take a photo of the fire, and press submit. To ensure the validity of fire reports, the user must take a photo of the fire and cannot access Camera Roll to select a picture. Please note that submitting a fire report automatically creates the report at the user’s location, to further ensure that the fire is local and valid. When viewing user-reported fires in the feed, other users can ‘rate’ the fire report by confirming that it is active, contained, or a spam reporting.\n\nAir Quality:\nAir quality measurements from across the United States are collected from AirNow.gov, which provides national air quality data using the Air Quality Index (AQI). This data is color-coded to provide information about health concerns due to PM2.5 pollutants. \n\nSatellite-Detected Fires:\nThermal hotspot detections are displayed and collected from NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which is an instrument on the Terra and Aqua satellites. Information provided from MODIS about each detection includes brightness (brightness temperature in Kelvin of a fire pixel) and confidence (quality of fire pixel). These fire detections are extremely useful, as they can indicate new fires and fire spread. Learn more about MODIS at their website: https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov\n\nFiresource is not affiliated with any government agencies.\nFiresource is only available for iPhone and iPad in the United States, Canada, and Australia.\nPrivacy Policy: https://firesourceapp.weebly.com/privacy-policy.html\nLearn more and contact us at https://firesourceapp.weebly.com/"

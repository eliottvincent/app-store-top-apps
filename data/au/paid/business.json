      "label": "A quick and simple way to calculate a number of common grazing related equations used by dairy and beef farmers. This app is the brainchild of a dairy farmer, who wanted a fast and easy way for him and his workers to be able to do grazing related calculations, and was designed and developed in collaboration with his sister, with input from other farmers and farm advisors.  \n\nDesigned to be used out on the farm and on the go, this app makes it quick, easy and simple for anyone working on a dairy or beef farm - regardless of their level of experience and knowledge - to get the numbers they need, when they need them.\n\nAbout the calculators (visit our website for more detailed descriptions): \n● Days in Paddock - Work out the approximate number of days to leave a specific number of cows in a paddock using either:\n  ◦  kgDM/cow or lbDM/cow allocation, paddock size, cover and residual.\n  ◦ m2/cow/day or yd2/cow/day allocation and paddock size\n- These results can then be used to calculate approximately where to put the break fence in a paddock.\n\n●  DM/Cow/Day - Work out approximately how many kgDM/cow/day or lbDM/cow/day you will get from a paddock based on paddock size, cover, residual, number of cows and number of days.\n- This result can then be used to calculate approximately where to put the break fence in a paddock\n\n●  Crop Allocation - Work out the approximate area of crop to allocate and the approximate number of days you can leave the cows in a paddock based on yield, the number of cows, the kgDM/cow/day or lbDM/cow/day required and paddock area.\n - This result can then be used to calculate approximately where to put the break fence in a paddock\n\n●  Pre-Grazing Cover - Work out the approximate target pre-grazing cover or the paddock trigger level based on stocking rate, intake, round length or rotation and the optimum residual.\n\n●  Average Pasture Cover - Work out the approximate average pasture cover for your farm based the pre-grazing cover and optimum residual. Enter the values directly or use the result from the Pre-Grazing Cover calculator.\n\nOther Features: \n● Choose to do the calculations in Metric or US system of measurement. On first installing the app  will be promoted to choose from using either the Metric or US system of measurement. You can change the selected units at any time via the Settings.\n● Share the result of the calculation using any of the available options off your device.\n● Settings options for the shared content:\n- send answer only, or send the answer and variables\n- include or don't include units \n- always edit before sending, never edit or choose each time whether edit or not\n● Add a note after completing the calculation e.g. paddock or mob name. This note will be included in the shared content.\n\n————————————————————————\n\nThanks to everyone who has given feedback and suggestions! It has been very useful in helping us improve the app. We are always looking for ways to make the app better, so please contact us if you have any feedback or suggestions."

The date and start odometer are entered automatically.\n \nThere are no pretty graphs, fancy reports or a multitude of settings, just simple, quick entries.\n \nAll entries can be exported to a CSV file for manipulation (graphs and wiz-bang formulas) in a spreadsheet.\n\nFeatures details:\n- Add entries for each trip including distance, places, reasons and general notes.\n- 1 to 3 taps for a new entry\n- Include start and end times, if required\n- Export to CSV\n- PDF by month, last month, last 3 months, last year, or all\n- Email CSV and PDF\n- Popup monthly summaries"

In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

It will allow you to time across days, for example if you start a job at 8 p.m. and finish at 2 a.m., it will have a duration of 6 hours.\n\nExpenses can be setup for recurring fixed cost items, such as burning a CD, reimbursement of hardware items, or fluid things such as toll expenses, automobile mileage, etc.\n\nQuick reporting can be done on the iPhone / iPod Touch with the Reports function. The report can be emailed in an HTML and/or CSV format.\n\nAdding new Clients, Projects, Tasks and Expenditures is super easy.  You can create them on the fly without having to navigate to a separate maintenance screen. To edit them you can tap on Setup, do you edit and then return to where you left off in Time Entries or Expenses. By selecting a Project or Task first will automatically fill in the Client field for quick entry.\n\nWe’ve made everything as seamless as possible, as you would expect from a top class iOS application.

Press power button, you can see signal strength bar moving, then slide the thumb to set the threshold (0.00~1.00), the value will be saved for next time use. \n\n2.If the indicator start flashing, that means a real recording start. check the recorded files,some test files can be found  there . \n\n3.In each scenario, the threshold value could be different, set it according to the situation. For example,for snoring and dream talk recording at night, set the value to 0.05, but at daytime, you probably have to set it at 0.10. \n\n4.

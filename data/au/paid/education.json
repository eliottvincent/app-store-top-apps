      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "Tap images. Type words. Speak. Proloquo2Go is an easy to use communication app for people who cannot speak or need help being understood. Featuring natural sounding voices, including real children’s voices, Proloquo2Go is a simple yet powerful AAC (augmentative and alternative communication) tool. The app is fully customizable and can be utilized to build language skills and grow with a person’s communication, supporting both beginning and advanced communicators.\n\nParents, therapists, teachers and users around the world recognize Proloquo2Go as the gold standard in AAC solutions. The app is used by people with autism, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, Angelman syndrome, and others with speech difficulties. The app is available in English, Spanish, French, and Dutch and supports bilingual use, so you can switch languages on the fly.\n\nProloquo2Go in action:\n\nLearn and grow\n\nStudies show that just 200-400 words make up 80% of what we say. Known as core words, they act as the basis of Proloquo2Go’s research-based Crescendo™ vocabulary. Users can grow from single words to full sentences in the same app. Crescendo puts core words in consistent locations for easy access and motor-planning. The vocabulary works with AAC best practices like modeling (where you use an AAC system to talk with the user) to develop language skills. Crescendo offers no limit on language development with a 10,000+ fringe word vocabulary and customizable vocabulary levels. Finally, with Progressive Language, words are gradually revealed step-by-step, helping users learn words and their location as their communication expands.\n\nEasy editing\n\nCustomizing Proloquo2Go is a breeze! Quickly and easily add new words. Use the app’s built-in library of 25,000 symbols or use your own photos by taking pictures within the app or selecting them from your photo library. For users with fine-motor challenges and vision impairments, Proloquo2Go offers options like 23 pre-programmed grid sizes and accessibility settings which support switch scanning and Apple’s VoiceOver screen reader. Everything from appearance to access is customizable so you can make it your own. \n\nType and speak\n\nBesides tapping images, Proloquo2Go also lets you type what you want to say. The app includes a Grid Keyboard arranged alphabetically for people learning to type. For more experienced typists, Proloquo2Go includes a Typing View with a QWERTY keyboard and word prediction that offers suggestions based on what you are typing. \n\nHello! ¡Hola! Bonjour! Hallo!\n\nProloquo2Go lets you select a language and region for the Crescendo vocabulary. Two languages can be used at the same time, allowing seamless bilingual speech. Over 100 included downloadable natural-sounding adult and children’s voices rounds out your choices to use the app your way.\n\nA helping hand\n\nAssistiveWare is here for you every step of the way. Help articles in Proloquo2Go are there whenever you need them. New to AAC? Our website has easy to understand articles in the Learn AAC section, and the AssistiveWare Core Word Classroom includes activities for teaching communication effectively. You can also connect directly with our community of parents, professionals, and users on our Facebook groups. If you have any questions, our support team is available 7 days a week and is always happy to help. All of these online resources can be accessed by going to the AssistiveWare website. \n\nNote: Discounts are available through Apple’s Educational Volume Purchase Program – 50% off on 20 licenses or more.

Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen. \n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.

Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures.   \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen.\n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n•tap on a word to hear it being read \n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 1\n\n• Sam, Pip, Tim\n• I am Tim\n• My cat Tip\n• The map\n• Sam is it!\n\nChildren can read these books once they know the letters and sounds for m, s, f, a, p, t, c, i.   The books are decodable with some Heart words – the The My my I.  Heart words are words that children need to learn by heart as they cannot ‘decode or sound out” at this stage.

      "label": "The Decodable Readers Australia books support a systematic approach of learning to read. This approach ensures kids are given the “right-fit” book.  Decodable, or phonic readers, only contain words made up of the sounds a child has learnt. Within each level in the Decodable Readers Australia Series, a new group of sounds is introduced. As children move through each level the sounds progress from simple to complex.\n\nThe Decodable Readers Australia – Level 4 books introduce the sounds sh, ch, th (them) th (thin), qu, ng, wh, g (gent) and c (circle).  All the words in each of the 20 books in Level 4 are made up of these sounds and those introduced in Level 1, 2 and 3 along with minimal sight words. After having mastered the Level 1, 2 and 3 sounds and the reading skills of blending and tracking, children should have gained the confidence to read Australian stories with new words and more text on each page.\n\nEach story in Level 4 can be enjoyed by listening to the professional audio or read aloud with the support of tapping and hearing the word if required. The audio function can be controlled independently within each page. Both parents and teachers can continue to support children with vocab and comprehension development through using the post-reading activities provided within each story. An addition to the Level 4 readers are the wide range of pre-reading activities that can be used to help set the purpose for reading.\n\nKey Features:\n•\tlisten to each story being read to them using the audio function\n•\tuse each book to practice reading independently \n•\ttap each word to hear the sounds and the word if support is needed\n•\ttap to turn each page for individual reading pace\n•\tall Australian themes and characters\nbeautifully illustrated with detail for engagement and enjoyment"

The schedule is paired with an ‘all done’ column to check off steps toward a motivating reward. Timers can be added to any task or activity. The schedules are easy to edit and fully customizable. Once you have created a schedule, it will be saved automatically.\n\nWaiting Board \nThe Waiting Board teaches waiting skills like taking turns and not interrupting. The user can begin by reading the companion book, When Do I Have to Wait? Using the waiting board, the top picture indicates the reason why the child is waiting and a timer can be set to show how long the child will wait. The child can then choose an activity to do while waiting. \n\nFeelings Board \nThe Feelings Board provides a tool for helping children understand and express emotions. The user can begin by reading the companion book, When I Get Upset, to provide an example of how the child might recognize an emotion and choose a coping strategy. On the Feelings Board, the user can then help the child indicate how they are feeling from a range of options, select a coping strategy, and then request an activity to help them feel better or re-engage with others. \n\nFeelings Scale\nHelps users identify, manage and cope with feelings across environments throughout the day. By tracking their feelings on the board, users can analyze the data for trends to learn if tasks done at different times of day or in different environments affect outcome. Environments and schedules can then be altered to achieve better results.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.beevisual.com/mobile-app-eula.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.beevisual.com/mobile-app-privacy.html"

You can then see how you fare against your friends and other people around the world.\n\nGames included are as follows; arithmetic test, instrumental comprehension test, SDT tests, multitasking test, spatial awareness test, co-ordination tests, memory tests and a shadowing test.\nAll questions are always computer generated, therefore it is unlikely that the same problem will arise twice.\n\nEvery section comes with an instructions page, which includes a detailed explanation on how to solve each question. Furthermore, at the end of each game you can now review each incorrectly answered question; allowing you to see where you're going wrong.\n\nGood luck in the test!"

Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures.   \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen. \n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n• tap on a word to hear it being read \n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 2\n• Pip\n• Tim and the van\n• At the dam\n• My hat\n• Sam in the pit\n\nThe Stage 2 books include sounds introduced in Stage 1 - s m, s, f, a, p, t, c, i  plus new sounds b, h, n, o, d, g, l v.

The world of science just got a little bit weirder and a lot more fun with Toca Lab: Plants!\n\nJust like with the first app in the Toca Lab Series, Toca Lab: Elements, your curiosity will lead the way. Choose your plant, then visit five different locations in the lab:\n\n● Grow light: Shine the light on your plant and watch what happens! Does your plant bask and happily sigh in the light, or groan and wriggle away? What happens when you turn the light up a notch or two?\n\n● Watering tank: Put your plant in the tank and fill it up with water. Will your plant float? How does your plant behave when it’s soaking wet?\n\n● Nutrition station: What’s the optimal diet for your plant? Try the three different nutrition formulas and discover which ones your plant character likes!\n\n● Cloning machine: Spin the wheel on the cloning machine and before you know it, you’ll have five little versions of your plant. Wonder what the clones can do? Experiment and find out!\n\n● Crossbreeding apparatus: Here you can mix two plants to create something unexpected. Try it and see what happens!\n\nHave fun experimenting at each station to see how the plants evolve. Keep experimenting until you’ve collected all 35 plant characters in the app. Once you’ve collected a plant, keep experimenting to continue to evolve it! Who says kids can’t be scientists? Toca Lab: Plants brings out the budding botanist in everybody!\n\nFEATURES\n- Start with one plant and experiment your way to 35 different plant characters, each with its own unique personality!\n- Continue to evolve existing plants through experimentation!\n- Evolve plants with five lab tools: grow light, watering tank, nutrition station, cloning machine and the crossbreeding apparatus.\n- Discover plants from five groups: green algae, mosses, ferns, trees and flowering plants.\n- Learn the names and Latin names of real-life plants!\n\n--\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures.   \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen. \n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n• tap on a word to hear it being read \n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 4\n\n• At the fun run\n• Mud\n• In the log hut\n• On the bus\n• The big red box\n\nStage 4  sounds include the initial alphabetic code – a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p qu r s t u v w x y z\nNew Heart words : he to was we she\n\nThese five books use all the sounds of the initial alphabetic code.  There are NO tricks as children use their phonic skills to read.   \nThese books are audio enhanced – tap on a word to have it read aloud."

Fun for kids and adults alike and plenty of challenges at all levels.\n\n*Dinosaur Chess  by Mls968\nThis is a great program. The lessons are interesting, and play levels go from easy to difficult. My 4 and 6 year olds are learning the game, and it's helping novice players like my wife and I too. Highly recommended to anyone who wants to introduce their children to chess!\n\n*An excellent app   by Adg6\nA wonderful app. Ideal for anyone new to chess. It is even fun for experienced chess players.\n\n*Highly Recommended - by doled \n\"This is a fantastic chess teaching game. This game alone makes it worth buying an iPad. My three year old now knows the piece names and basic moves. My six year old is well on her way to playing a full game. Our family has had an iPad since the day the iPad was released and this is one of the best apps we have.\"\n\n*Great! - by TonySchleizer\n\"This game has gotten my 5 year old interested in chess. Great tutorials that get progressively harder as skills improve.\"\n\n\n* Great for getting started - by Milfordthelargebonedgorilla\n\"This has been fantastic for my five year old son...using this in addition to a real board and pieces has helped him immensely in understanding each of the pieces, how they move, their strengths and weaknesses...a terrific way to introduce young ones to the game without overwhelming them\"\n\n\n* Great learning tool - by Triplescoop \n\"I have an adopted 7 year old boy with fetal alcohol syndrome. It is very hard for him to learn to play games. Checkers was very hard for him to learn. I thought that chess would be something that he would have to wait to learn. I bought this app even though there were no reviews. So glad I did! What a great teaching tool! I love the mini games that teach the directions that each piece can move. We play slowly but my son can play chess! I recommend this for anyone who wants to learn the basics of the game. This app is for beginners. Great for kids! Thank you to the developers of this app!\"\n\n\n*Super! - by Chess player\n\"Hats off to the developers. A fun program for kids.\"\n\n\n*Ideal For kids - by Kingkot \n\"This game is ideal to teach the kids in the chess.\""

Using this app, you can let someone know what he’s working for, how much work he needs to do, and how close he is to earning a reward for that work. You can use this for lessons in school, chores at home, getting your children to eat their vegetables, and much more! Start the app by selecting the number of tokens (1-5) your student must earn. Then set up your student's reinforcer choice board by selecting 1-6 items from our pre-loaded symbol library or your own photo library. To delete a picture from the teacher choice screen just press down on an image for 5 seconds. Show the choice board to your student to select what to work for and then begin your lesson. Each time a student earns a token, slide a token to the empty dot. Once the student has earned all of his tokens, push the \"cash in\" button to show your student what he's earned! The token board resets to start the next deal or you can create a new choice board for your student to select a new reinforcer.\n\nThis app is now available in American English and Brazilian Portuguese. To enable Brazilian Portuguese please make sure your Apple device is set to use Portuguese as its main language via Settings->General->International.\n\nVisit www.pecs.com for more information on using visual reinforcement systems.\n\nFeature Summary\n•Select number of tokens for each deal (1-5)\n•Customize student choice board to include up to 6 images selected from preloaded images or images in your photo library\n•Bright token board to contrast with materials on student's desktop\n•Token board shows student what he's working for, how many tokens he needs, his progress in the deal.\n•Student \"cashes in\" at end of deal by pushing button.

      "label": "Wait4It\n\nFrom time to time, we all have to wait for something we want! Many learners who encounter situations during which they must wait have difficulty with this concept. Wait4It is a great visual tool if Phases I and II of PECS® have been mastered. The app is designed for use in any setting to help teach the concept of \"wait\" and encourage learners to wait successfully!  Wait4It includes a bright, oval \"wait\" card, digital sand timer and space for you to input a visual representation of the item your learner is waiting for.  This method provides the learner with a visual reminder to wait which will help him/her better tolerate the delay.  To obtain information on available services, trainings and consultations or to view our great selection of valuable resources in its entirety, please visit www.pecs.com.\n\nInstructions of Use\n\n    -Tap empty square (located on Wait card) to select image from library.\n\n    -Tap desired image. After selection, image will then display inside the square.\n\n    -To customize, import images from your own photo library by tapping the 'Photo Album' tab located in the upper right corner of your screen.\n\n    -Double tap digital timer, scroll to select desired time and tap the 'Done' button.\n\n    -Double tap 'play/pause' button (digital countdown and sand timer will commence). Note: When the countdown has ended, the timer will automatically reset to the previous time entered.\n\n    -To choose an alternate image and/or new time when in \"play\" mode, double tap the 'play/pause' button to pause digital countdown and sand timer. Tap the current image and reselect from library- image will then display inside the square of Wait card) and double tap 'play/pause' button to resume countdown.\n\nDelete Images:\n\nTo delete an image from the library, tap the picture and hold for 3-5 seconds until a miniature \"Delete ?\" screen appears. The pre-loaded Pics for PECS images may be temporarily deleted during a single session. However, after a session has ended and the application is closed the pre-loaded Pics for PECS images will reset to their original properties (reappear) when the application is opened and a new session has started. Custom images will not be restored and are permanently removed from the app once deleted.  \n\nSound/Notification Settings:\n\nWhen the application is minimized the timer will continue to countdown. Once the timer reaches zero a system notification will appear. The notification, \"WAIT is finished\" will display on the main screen of your device, accompanied with a sound."

Practice hearing phonemes, identifying missing phonemes and arranging them into words. What words?  Over 250 of them including surfing terms, social media lingo, school-yard epithets and, of course, a few terms worthy of Captain Underpants.\n\nControl which phonemes to focus on in the Phoneme Set Editor.  With the Editor feature, you can fine tune which phonemes the learner is asked to identify and differentiate. Want to train on word-initial consonants only? Short vowel sounds? Exclude consonant blends? Use single-syllable words only? It's all easy with the Editor.\n\nWith over 250 slang words from all over the globe, there are sure to be some words or usages that are new to you or your student. No worries! A tongue-in-cheek slang dictionary is built into the app with a handy text-to-speech function to read the definitions aloud. Any words you'd rather not use at all? Just add them to the app's blacklist."

It considers the aircraft being still on ground with engines running. Some aircraft systems (such as CDU, HYDRAULIC system auto logic ... etc) will respond as it would in a real pre-flight scenario. \n\nECL pages are not interactive (except for FUEL IMBALANCE page)\n\nAll COMM pages are also available  (not interactive)\n\nThere is only ONE route flight plan (from OMDB - OOMS). The intention is to simulate how all the waypoints respond with the ND and with the other pages of the CDU. It is not the intention of this app to fly them or do any kind of approach or landing\n\nThe performance calculations and predictions of the FMS such as (predicted Flight Level, time, fuel, ECON, EO SPD, weight ....etc) are estimate and may not represent accurate values. Graphs examples are provided to show how FMS generates these performance data. These graphs are based on a training model aircraft and may not represent actual model values\n\nFMS Navigation data (VOR, Fixes, AIRPORTS ...etc) that are allowed for entry are shown as a note next the relevant FMS page. \n\nEICAS messages in the upper display unit are currently unresponsive in this app version.\n\n\"B777 Flight Deck\" is a one time payment app (No annual subscription is required). With any improvement made, a new updated version will be released for free.\n\nThis app is mostly suitable for either new joiners to B777 or even experienced commercial pilots who currently grounded and would like to refresh their memory. It can be used alongside your Boeing FCOM / QRH to see how each system will actually respond. Nevertheless, it is important to note that each airline's FMS, ECL and other systems may differ due to upgrades/downgrades and airline's customization and different procedures. As such, this app is to be used as secondary in precedence to all operational references and it does not substitute for proper certified training."

      "label": "The Baby Sensory Signbook app teaches you all signs you need, so you and your baby can start communication and language development. Learn to communicate long before the development of speech, using our simple Babysigns.\n\n\nFEATURES \n- All official Baby Sensory baby signs right in your pocket.\n- Find a sign in 3 simple steps with the easy interface.\n- Make a list of favourites, for the signs you're learning.\n- Learn 'Say Hello' and 4 other songs' signs with music.\n- Looping videos, so you can easily see how it’s done.\n- Slow down the video, to better view the hand shapes.\n\n\nABOUT THE APP\nWith the Baby Sensory app, you can easily learn all official signs to make early communication possible. This creates a stronger parent-child bond and stimulates early language development.\nEven the youngest baby wants to tell you what they need and how they feel. But they’re unable to express themselves verbally and may cry if their needs are not met. Signing helps your baby to express his or her needs and takes the guesswork out of parenting.\n\n\nABOUT US\nBaby Sensory was the first baby programme to offer a complete approach to learning and development from birth to 13 months. Designed to stimulate, educate and provide precious memories during the all-important first years of life, the programme has won multiple awards both nationally and internationally since 2008. Everything we do is backed by over 35 years of expert research in childhood development. \n\n\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the app, please let us know. Send us a message or see www.babysensory.com for more info.\n\n\nCONTACT\nWebsite: www.babysensory.com\nMail: apps@babysensory.com\n\n\n\nWe are super excited to hear what you think of our little app!\nSend your thoughts and tips to: apps@babysensory.com\n\nLike and follow us to stay up to date on future updates:\nwww.facebook.com/BabySensoryUK\nwww.twitter.com/BabySensoryHQ"

      "label": "Team Shake provides a technological and environmentally friendly way to choose teams for board games, sporting events, tournaments, school projects or anytime groups are required. The newest release brings many new features including full iPad support, balancing teams based on skill or gender, importing users from a file, enabling video output, and sharing teams via facebook or email. \n\nTeam Shake is the premier iOS App for creating teams. Instead of a hat and scraps of paper, the user enters his friends' names in his iPhone and gives it a shake. The screen will then display a random set of color-coded teams. These teams can immediately be used for game play or shared via facebook or email.   The quick and easy selection of random (or balanced) teams eliminates fighting over who will be on which team. Innovative use of the iPhone shake gesture gives users the satisfying feeling of shaking a virtual hat without the trouble of carrying around an actual hat. Conventional buttons can also be used for those who would rather not shake their expensive hardware about.  \n\nThe app is designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind. Names can easily be entered with the onscreen keyboard, chosen from the user's contacts, or imported from a file. The email and facebook functions document the members of each individual team as well as preserving the team number and color assigned by the app. For repeated use of Team Shake, lists of friends can be easily saved and loaded later. The current list is also automatically saved so that if you exit the app, or even reboot the device, changes will not be lost. For teachers and others with large lists of people, Team Shake supports the ability to import teams from text or csv files.\n\nIf you have any problems, feature requests, or comments please send an email to support@rhine-o.com. \n\nFeatures:\n\n* Create 1 to 64 random teams\n* Create completely random or balanced teams\n* Full iPad support\n* Eliminates fighting over choosing teams\n* Share / Save teams via email or Facebook\n* Teams can be chosen by the number of teams or by the size of teams.\n* Save lists of friends for later games\n* Import lists from email or spreadsheet\n* Export lists and options for use on another device\n* Satisfying feeling of shaking a “virtual” hat to create teams\n* Animated shaking hat\n* Entry of names via onscreen keyboard\n* Entry of names via iPhone contacts\n* Temporarily disable people who are absent\n* Set groups of people to always be on the same team\n* Set groups of people to always be on different teams\n* Set user strength to make more even teams (now supports fully balanced teams)\n* 5 users strengths level\n* Pick a single random person from the list of players\n* User strength indicator on the main screen (can be disabled in options)\n* Number of active players and total players is now displayed on the main screen\n* Video Out Support\n* Option to Sort Teams by Name\n* Option to balance male / female team members\n* \"Equal Ability\" option to create teams where all players have the same strength\n* Option to create separate male and female teams\n* Configurable Team Colors\n* Configurable Team Names\n* Print Support\n* Export Teams in CSV or XLS Format\n* Team Shake now supports simultaneously assigning players to multiple subteams and / or oppose teams at the same time.\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now have customized names to make selection easier\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now be enabled or disabled globally so that teams can be made quickly without subteams / oppose teams.  In particular, Balance Teams Strengths will work when separate Male / Female teams are created.\n\nYappler-Tags: Teams, Groups, Random, Hat, Entertainment, Games, Utilities"

Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books \nwith real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures. \n\nStage 7 Unit 2  introduces and practises the vowel graphemes - ar or er ir ur air.\n\nIt also introduces a new recording feature that allows children to record and \nhear themselves read. This is an important step in developing fluency, as it gives \nchildren a reason to reread and record.  Fluency is an important literacy skill \nrequiring accuracy and comprehension. \n\nStages 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5 have professionally recorded and produced audio.  However, \nStages Plus 4, 6, & 7 allow children to read and record themselves.  Children are now more confident readers and will benefit from this new recording feature. They will enjoy checking their accuracy by following the words in the book and listening to themselves read.\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions. \nAll words, except the Heart words, can be decoded or ‘sounded out’. To do this, children point to each letter or grapheme, saying the sounds then blend the sounds together to read the word. \n\nThere are NO tricks in the Little Learner books.\n\nNote: Please make sure to enable the microphone on your device when asked or you will not be able to record anything. Also make sure your device is not set to mute to hear the audio back."

The app is designed to help children understand why they feel a certain feeling and behave in productive way.\n\nThe app has full sound and also text and ability to record responses rather than type if preferred.\n\nThere is a game mode just for some fun.\n\nThis resilience strategy is based on the idea that negative thoughts or the negative stories we tell ourselves are not wrong - but sometimes they are not true. Kids need to learn to catch the negative thinking that is stressful, challenge the thinking and if needed change their thinking to be more optimistic and less anxious. \n\nThis strategy is great for adults too.\n\nThe four positive penguins take you on an interactive journey to help you understand that feelings arise from your thinking and if you challenge your negative thoughts successfully you may be able to see things in a more realistic and even optimistic way.\n\nSee Positive Penguins on Facebook or our website for further information and resources"

The app includes a social story about anger, and audio/visual tools for calming down. \n\n**********\n\nThe app opens up to a “I need a break screen” that vocalizes  “I need a break” when it is tapped. The screen then transitions to a red screen with an angry face and the number ten. With each tap the screen transitions to a calmer face and color. In this way, the app prompts the user to count backwards from ten followed by a deep breath.\n \nThe app also includes a simple social story with line drawings about anger. The social story talks about feeling angry and things you can do, like counting to ten, breathing deeply and taking a break, to calm yourself down.  \n\nThe settings screen allows you to choose from male, female or no vocals for counting back from ten and for reading the social story out loud."

Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books \nwith real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures. \n\nStage 7 Unit 1 introduces the vowel graphemes ai, ay, ee, ea, igh, ie, oa.\n\nIt also introduces a new recording feature that allows children to record and \nhear themselves read. This is an important step in developing fluency, as it gives \nchildren a reason to reread and record.  Fluency is an important literacy skill \nrequiring accuracy and comprehension. \n\nStages 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5 have professionally recorded and produced audio.  However, \nStages Plus 4, 6, & 7 allow children to read and record themselves.  Children are now \nmore confident readers and will benefit from this new recording feature. They will \nenjoy checking their accuracy by following the words in the book. \n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions. \nAll words, except the Heart words, can be ‘sounded out’. To do this, children point to \neach letter or grapheme, saying the sounds then blending the sounds together to \nread the word. \n\n\nThere are NO tricks in the Little Learner books.\n\nNote: Please make sure to enable the microphone on your device when asked or you will not be able to record anything. Also make sure your device is not set to mute to hear the audio back."

      "label": "The Decodable Readers Australia books support a systematic approach of learning to read. This approach ensures kids are given the “right-fit” book.  Decodable, or phonic readers, only contain words made up of the sounds a child has learnt. Within each level in the Decodable Readers Australia Series, a new group of sounds is introduced. As children move through each level the sounds progress from simple to complex.\n\nThe Decodable Readers Australia – Level 3 books introduce the sounds b, h, f, l, j, v, w, x, y and z. All the words in each of the 20 books in Level 3 are made up of these sounds and those introduced in Level 1 and 2 along with minimal sight words. After having mastered the Level 1 and 2 sounds and the reading skills of blending and tracking, children should have gained the confidence to read Australian stories with new words and more text on each page.\n\nEach story in Level 3 can be enjoyed by listening to the professional audio or read aloud with the support of tapping and hearing the word if required. The audio function can be controlled independently within each page. Both parents and teachers can continue to support children with vocab and comprehension development through using the post-reading activities provided within each story. An addition to the Level 3 readers are the wide range of pre-reading activities that can be used to help set the purpose for reading.\n\nKey Features:\n•\tlisten to each story being read to them using the audio function\n•\tuse each book to practice reading independently \n•\ttap each word to hear the sounds and the word if support is needed\n•\ttap to turn each page for individual reading pace\n•\tall Australian themes and characters\nbeautifully illustrated with detail for engagement and enjoyment"

Answer as many questions as possible in minute-long games, or you can now practice without the pressure of a countdown timer - a feature which is new for 2019. Questions are randomly generated which means it is very replayable. The game has been carefully designed for children, with large, widely spaced buttons. We recommend that young children play on a tablet.\n\nSix main topics are covered: \n\n* Times tables - up to 10 or 12 \n* Division - up to 10 or 12\n* Square numbers\n* Number bonds\n* Doubling \n* Halving\n\nBetween these topics, the four standard arithmetic operations are covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nYou can create up to 30 player profiles per device to track an individual's high scores (increased from 15 in 2019). If you prefer there's also the option to play as a guest. All data is stored locally on your device so you don't have to worry about privacy issues. We've also made it very easy for children to quickly switch between profiles after playing a game, if they're sharing a device.\n\nAfter each game, the score achieved is displayed along with the child's high score. Bronze, silver or gold stars and trophies are awarded depending on the score achieved in each game."

It's our job to record those many things and use that information wisely to help guide our reading instruction. \n\nLet the Running Record Toolbox help you!  It has all the tools you'll need to assist you in making well-informed decisions about each of your students as individual readers.  \n\nAre they reading with appropriate accuracy?  Are they making too many errors?  Are they self-monitoring and making corrections?  Our running record calculator will help you take the guesswork out of these questions. Simply punch in how many total words, errors and self-corrections your student made and press CALCULATE.  An accuracy percent, error ratio and self-correction ratio will be instantly displayed!  Let the app do all the pesky math for you!  You've got enough on your mind already with all of those hard to remember recording conventions (symbols). Use our symbol cheat sheet to remind yourself how to record exactly what each of your readers is doing!  We've included the marking conventions for all of the most common reader behaviors that you may need to record. Using the correct symbols will help you and future teachers read the running record without any problems. \n\nWe've also included a WPM stopwatch and calculator for those of you that like to keep an eye on their fluency rate. It may be worth noting how long it's taking your students to read a certain sample. After timing your student just enter how many words they read and let our calculator tell you how many words they are reading per minute!  This information can be helpful to you as you continue pressing forward with your reading instruction. \n\nFinally, we've included an accuracy percentage table. This reference will help you decide if the chosen book was just right, too easy or too hard.  Compare the student's accuracy percentage with this table to help you decide what level book to choose next time. The last thing we want is to waste time trying to make progress on an inappropriate reading level.\n\nThe Running Record Toolbox can give you all of the information you need to take your reading instruction to the next level!"

It has an 'autopilot mode' that will demonstrate how to reverse into areas such as gateways and parking spaces and a 'guidance mode' to help you try it for yourself.\r\n\r\nYou can select from a range of towing vehicles and trailers, each of which have different turning characteristics.   A range of scenes are available which offer different manoeuvres, including a caravan site, a stable yard and the B+E reversing test.\r\n\r\nThere is also a recording feature that provides an analysis of how well you completed each manoeuvre.

      "label": "Key Verbs with Steffy and James is a simple, fun, interactive action app, designed to teach a range of verbs using a predictable format of present tense command, followed by descriptions in present, and then past tense. This language app in the Key Word Kids series, follows the Key Word Kids Steffy and James as they join family and friends to demonstrate these actions using either:  a ‘Learn’ mode where children choose a figure from a set of 3, watch the character perform a command and hear the action described in both the present continuous and past tense; or a ‘Test’ mode which shows the action and gives the present tense but stops the game to allow users to say the action completed, using their past tense form. As with all Language and Learning Steps apps, children are both engaged and learning, with delightful, colourful characters and sound effects, and a selection of short motivating mini games included as brain breaks. Customised options include turning text, voice or background noise on or off. \n\nFEATURES: \n\n○ No in-app purchases or links to social media \n○ Easy to use\n○ Interactive\n○ Motivating short mini games included\n ○ Two modes: Learn and Test\n○ Three sets of actions in each verb set and three verb sets in each cycle\n○ Pause button displayed on screen allows the user to change mode easily, skip a current verb set or return to the home screen\n○ Learn mode requires the user to choose one of three available actions and then runs through the verb states without the test screen\n○ Test mode requires the user to choose one of three available actions and pauses after the description in the present tense, to ask what the figure did, aiming to test past tense verbs\n○ Teaches and tests both regular and irregular past tense verbs\n○ Teaches personal pronouns ‘he’, ‘she’ and ‘it’ by using the correct pronoun to describe the past tense action\n○ Teaches concepts\n○ Customised for a range of ages (1year old learning concepts and vocabulary for actions, but suitable for older children learning past tense)\n○ Customisation includes:\n  -Sound effects: on or off\n  -Background noise/sound: on or off\n  -Transition blur between verb cycle: on or off\n  -Bubbles available for popping when choosing each verb set: on or off\n  -Voice only (no text)\n  -Text only (no voice)\n  -Games available after each cycle of three verb sets: on or off \n○ Contains clear speech in neutral English \n○ Created by Specialist Educator Play Therapist and Speech Language Pathologist\n○ Designed for all children including those learning English as a second language, and  excellent   for children with language learning difficulties who may find both the conceptual and grammatical aspects of verb learning difficult\n○ Made in Australia-scenes include Australian outback, African Safari, Farm, Beach and House\n○ Can be used with individuals and small groups\n○ Can be used independently or with Speech  Pathologist/ teacher/ assistant/ parent/ carer                                                                                             \n○ Excellent to establish joint attention with young children, children with autism and other communication needs\n○ Used by Speech Language Pathologists and others in conjunction with Key Word Kids as a way to teach verbs as a single action information carrying word (1 ICW) and two word person + action in past tense (2 ICW) eg She kicked, He ate, It flew\n\nJoin Steffy and James now in this fun learning app!"

Its going tibia ok, the Skelly app is just what you need! With the Skelly app you can literally pull the inspiration you need right out of your pocket anywhere, anytime!\n\nSkelly is a fully poseable, anatomically correct reference skeleton for artists. A simplified version of the skeleton is also included, named “Robo-Skelly”. These figures were created to make the study of anatomy easier and more enjoyable for students and professionals without leaving your wallets bone dry. They can also be used to inspire poses for drawing, painting, sculpting, illustration, animation, comics, manga, storyboarding, twerking, and to fully understand the anatomy of the human skeleton. No need for super gluteus, Skelly comes pre-assembled and ready to pose as soon as you launch the app! \n\nLearning the structure of the human body is the skeleton key to drawing the figure in an anatomically correct manner without having to clear your browser history to avoid awkward conversations with your loved ones. Whether you want to make works like Michelangelo or Miyazaki, Skelly will help you focus on your art and let you personalize his poses, rather than searching for reference material and hiring models. Learn to draw the skeleton from any angle without the inconvenient and morally questionable need to go grave robbing.\n\nFEATURES:\n \nAnatomically correct skeleton\nSimplified “Robo Skelly”\nProportions based on the teachings of Dr. Paul Richer\nSkull fits perfectly into a “Loomis Head” as taught by Andrew Loomis\nPoseable joints\nPose Library - choose from pre made poses and save your own\nMovable camera\nAdjustable light source\nChoose light or dark background\nReset to neutral “Anatomical Pose”\n\nPEOPLE LOVE IT:\n\nJames Gurney, author of ‘Color and Light’ and ‘Imaginative Realism’ Says:\n\n\"Bend him, twist him, contort him! The Skelly app lets you put a virtual human skeleton into any pose, and to see him from any angle, and in any lighting. It’s a great tool for art students or professionals wondering what the skeleton is really doing beneath a life pose, or for anyone wanting to visualize a pose from scratch. The interface is intuitive to learn and easy to use, without sacrificing any of the nuances of the human body’s complex range of movement. Skelly is a big improvement over the old wooden mannikin.\"\n\n- Chris Oatley, Director Of The Oatley Academy Of Visual Storytelling Says:\n\n\"Skelly is the fastest, most fluid anatomical reference I have ever seen. I was shocked at how easy it is to pose the figure and direct the light source. Finally! It’s the app visual artists have been waiting for.\"\n\nHave any questions? CONTACT US:\n\nskelly@proko.com"

      "label": "Based on the proven Montessori learning method, Montessori Crosswords helps kids develop their reading, writing, and spelling skills by building words from a set of 320 word-image-audio-phonics combinations using a phonics-enabled movable alphabet.\n\n•  Editor's Choice Award  ( 4.8 stars out of 5 ) \"It is an extremely powerful early reading experience.\" - Children's Technology Review \n• \"Best literacy app in my opinion\" - Sue, National Board Certified Teacher\n•  Featured by Apple in \"Apps for Learning to Read\" &  \"Apps for Learning to Write\"\n•  Commonsensemedia.org  - “Montessori Crosswords is a great way for kids to develop literacy in an engaging way that feels like play.\" \n\n•  More than 280,000 units sold!\n•  Used in schools to learn phonics and spelling (65,000 units sold to schools)\n\n____\n\nMontessori Crosswords helps kids learn and understand two fundamental concepts:\n\n•  First, the app helps kids understand that words are made up of sounds or phonemes (phonemic awareness). For each word, your kids can touch the empty rectangles where letters must be dragged to complete the word, and hear the sound the corresponding letter produces.\n\n• Secondly, the app helps kids memorize the phonics associated with letters by providing a phonics-enabled alphabet where kids can touch each letter and hear the associated phonic.\n\n____\n\nMontessori Crosswords allows you to select words according to their difficulty or sound categories:\n\n•  Level 1 displays a three-letter word with no difficulty for beginning readers (CVC words)\n•  Levels 2, 3 & 4 offer more complex words that contain more complex phonics (as long vowels sounds or blends), and also offer the option to automatically create multi-word crosswords in tens of thousands of different combinations\n•  Alternately, you can choose from 44 sound categories (i.e. choose words that contain a specific sound (for example, long a, “k” sound, and so on).\n• You can also create custom word lists based on letter clusters\n__\n\nTo create an enjoyable experience, the app also includes sounds, animations, and interactive visual effects that are displayed after a word is completed. \n__\n\nMore Features:\n\n• Digraph Support : \"oo\", \"th\",... are displayed as a whole unit\n• R-Controlled vowels support (\"car\",\"horn\",...)\n• Capital, lower-case, or cursive letter display \n• Setting to show only letters are in the word to spell (great for beginners!)\n• Setting to force spelling from left to right\n__\n\nUsers & Reports \n\n•  Create any number of users\n•  Check and export activity for each user in the Reports section\n__\n\nCommon Core State Standard (CCSS):\nCCSS.ELA-Literacy.RF.K.1b Recognize that spoken words are represented in written language by specific sequences of letters.\nCCSS.ELA-Literacy.RF.K.2 & CCSS.ELA-Literacy.RF.1.2  Demonstrate understanding of spoken words, syllables, and sounds (phonemes).\nCCSS.ELA-Literacy.RF.K.3 Know and apply grade-level phonics and word analysis skills in decoding words.\n__\n\nMore reviews:\n\n• Wired's GeekDad - \"5 Favorite Apps for Elementary School iPads\" - \"An excellent tool for learning spelling and early literacy (...) It can build from simple to more complex words making it usable by students from prep through to grade 3 or 4\" \n\n•  Teachers' Reviews:\n-Sue on Iear.org - \"I just have to say I love Montessori Crosswords both as a parent (to 2, 7, and 8 year olds) and K teacher. I like that the app is appropriate for the developmental levels of my students and all three of my kids\"\n-Cindy - \"This is one of my favorite educational apps. I highly recommend it for the children who are learning to read and spell. The kids also love the interactive artwork.\" \n __\n\nEmail questions or suggestions to support@lescapadou.com."

Little Learners 5 teaches children to read words with -ck. \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen. \n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n• tap on a word to hear it being read \n\n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nThese five books use all the sounds of the initial alphabetic code.  There are NO tricks as children use their phonic skills to read.   \nThese books are audio enhanced – tap on a word to have it read aloud. \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 5 introduces –ck consonant digraph.   These fun stories about Pip and Tim provide practice in reading words with ‘ck’.  There are new Heart words in each story as shown on the last page of each book.   Children love the quirky stories and they are confident that there are NO tricks in the books.  Great way to build reading confidence. \n\n• The Fan-tas-tic Snack\n• The Pip and Tim Zoo\n• The Best Stuff\n• A Bag of Junk\n• Splat!"

Would you like to have all the scripts, language patterns and NLP techniques at your fingertips on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch?\n\nAre you looking at attending an NLP certification course and want to get ahead and master the scripts, content and understanding of NLP?\n\nWell, here is the best of the best…  from the NLP Practitioner and NLP Master Practitioner programs as presented and taught by The Tad James Co. With over 30 years of experience in teaching and using NLP techniques to empower and assist you to make positive changes.\n \nThis app is THE SAME HIGH QUALITY you have come to expect from the industry leaders – Dr. Tad James and Dr. Adriana James and over the last 30 years, many have purchased the printed cue cards version of this app.\n\nThe features include:\n• Full native iPad high resolution and Retina HD display on iPhone 4 support:\nEverybody knows all apps run on the iPad. However, many of them run in 1x native iPhone resolution – a small portion of the iPad screen only. Our app has been specifically designed to take full advantage of iPad’s higher resolution 1024 x 768 pixels and of the iPhone 4’s Retina HD display. Which translates in crisp and clear picture, whether you zoom in or out.\n\n• Zoom in or out:\nFor clarity or perhaps to see the bigger picture on  some pages, this feature has been implemented specifically for this app.\n\n• Favorites list or Bookmarks: \nHere you add put the pages you are going to use for an intervention or session so it’s all in one place. No flicking through pages and easy to find content.\n\n• Screen auto-rotate:\nNot all apps take full advantage of iOS 3.x and 4.x screen auto rotate feature. We made sure that, however you are looking at your iDevice’s screen, you will always find it easy to read in portrait or landscape. Whichever way you hold your iDevice, it will accommodate that.\n\n• Advanced search capabilities:\nSearch via key words for ANY word for quick easy access. The desired content is instantly displayed wherever it appears. You can then tap and view the desired topic.\n\n• Bonus content:\nIn addition to the NLP, you will also receive the latest scripts for Time Line Therapy® TECHNIQUES. THIS IS the most advanced AND easy to use modality to remove negative emotions and limiting decisions from your past so you can move freely in the future. \n\nWith over 80 scripts and outlines you can now easily follow the scripts and make all the techniques work in a business context, or education and general coaching.\n\nIn order to get the best results with this application, it is a good idea to attend a live training or an nlp internet training in the near future, or to have attended a Tad James Co. NLP training already. \n\nFor more info, please visit www.NLPcoaching.com, www.easyNLP.com or tap Visit us online at the bottom of the screen inside the app.\n\nIf you like this app and the content, please give us a 5 star review. This will allow us to reinvest the proceeds into developing other much needed NLP applications. Dr. Tad James’ vision over the last 30+ years is to empower people and deliver highest quality trainings and product. With your help, we can do this. Please email any suggestions, questions or bugs to bb@nlpcoaching.com and we will endeavor to incorporate them ASAP."

It introduces the graphemes ll, ss, ff  as well as \nwords with ‘s’ for example, dogs and runs. \n\nStage Plus 4 introduces a new recording feature that allows children to record and \nhear themselves read. This is an important step in developing fluency, as it gives \nchildren a reason to reread and record.  Fluency is an important literacy skill \nrequiring accuracy and comprehension. \n\nStages 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5 have professionally recorded and produced audio.  However, \nStages Plus 4, 6, & 7 allow children to read and record themselves.  Children are now \nmore confident readers and will benefit from this new recording feature. They will \nenjoy checking their accuracy by following the words in the book. \n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions. \nAll words, except the Heart words, can be ‘sounded out’. To do this, children point to \neach letter or grapheme, saying the sounds then blending the sounds together to \nread the word. \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage Plus 4:\n\nThe Little Vet\n\nSad Tip\n\n No Ned\n\n A Mud Picnic\n\nThe Big Wind Day\n\nThere are NO tricks in the Little Learner books.\n\nNote: Please make sure to enable the microphone on your device when asked or you will not be able to record anything.

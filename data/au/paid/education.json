      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

The app includes the full identification key to 1140 species, fact sheets for all species and features used in the key, introductory and reference sections and over 8,000 images.\n\nPlease note this is a large download (around 400 MB) and depending on your connection, it may take several minutes to download and install the app. An internet connection is not required once installed.\n\nRainforest Plants of Australia has been developed to identify trees, shrubs and climbing plants that occur naturally or have become naturalized (including exotic weeds) in rainforest from Rockhampton to Victoria. It is a fantastic resource, a thorough and comprehensive source of information for all those concerned about rainforests, their biodiversity, distribution and conservation. The app will be vital for researchers and teachers at universities, TAFEs and schools, environmental consultants and government agencies, community groups and landowners, bushwalkers, gardeners and anyone with an interest in rainforests or rainforest plants. Both plain English and botanical terms (explained in an illustrated glossary) are used throughout the app to make it applicable to as wide an audience as possible.\n\nDespite its Australian focus, this key provides a resource for users in other countries. It shows what type of information is useful and what features can be used in separating rainforest species. It demonstrates how powerful the Lucid Mobile platform is and that such an app can be prepared using this program.\n\nAt the core of this app is an interactive identification key powered by Lucid. The key includes 1140 plant species that grow in rainforest of eastern Australia, from Rockhampton to Victoria. To help confirm identification the app provides line drawings, over 8,000 photos and extensive information on each species, including previously unavailable botanical details. A customised image gallery walk-through tutorial assists the user in working the key and accessing the content. The introductory sections include information and images on rainforest and the types of rainforest used in this app. Hints are provided on how to identify rainforest plants as well as an outline of the special features and terms used to separate the many species that on first sight appear to be inseparable!\n\nDue to app size constraints, the 12,000 images in the original USB version of Rainforest Plants of Australia – Rockhampton to Victoria have been reduced to around 8,000 images, retaining the most useful for identifying plants in the rainforest."

      "label": "Little Learners Love Literacy® is a sequenced phonics reading program to give children confidence and success.  Letters and sounds are introduced in stages.  Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen. \n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.

      "label": "Little Learners Love Literacy® is a sequenced phonics reading program to give children confidence and success.  Letters and sounds are introduced in stages.  Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures.   \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen. \n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n• tap on a word to hear it being read \n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 2\n• Pip\n• Tim and the van\n• At the dam\n• My hat\n• Sam in the pit\n\nThe Stage 2 books include sounds introduced in Stage 1 - s m, s, f, a, p, t, c, i  plus new sounds b, h, n, o, d, g, l v.   There are NO tricks in Stage 2 books.  Revises Heart words from Stage 1. \nThese books are enhanced with audio – tap on a word to have it read aloud."

      "label": "Little Learners Love Literacy is a sequenced phonics reading program designed to give children success and confidence.  The Stage 7 Unit 4 Tim and Pip chapter books focus on split digraphs such as a-e (tale), I-e (shine), o-e (hope), u-e (huge). A Strange Tale also introduces the change in sound when c and g are followed by an e, i and y , for example, in  cage, nice etc.  Homophones are practised in a game at the end of A Strange Tale. In the story Rise and Shine events are shown in a story mapping format, introducing children to another genre. The teaching notes are detailed giving lots of information about how to introduce new phonemes and graphemes. These engaging stories provide reading practice for children who are mastering split digraphs. \n\n  A Strange Tale\n  Rise and Shine\n  High Hopes\n  A Huge Day\n  Things to Amaze you\n\nWe know how much children love chapter books so we have created 5 mini chapter books with engaging stories by Berys Dixon and beautiful illustrations by Danielle McDonald.  They are books children will LOVE to read with words they CAN read. \n\nUnit 4 books have a recording feature that allows children to record and listen to themselves read. This is an important step in developing fluency, as it gives children a reason to reread and record. \n\nFluency is an important literacy skill requiring accuracy and comprehension. Children need to read with expression to show the understanding of the text. \n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions. \n\nAll words, except the Heart words, can be decoded or ‘sounded out’. To do this, children point to each letter or grapheme, saying the sounds then blending the sounds together to read the word. \n\nThere are NO tricks in the Little Learner books.\n\nNote: Please make sure to enable the microphone on your device when asked or you will not be able to record. Also check that your device is not set to mute when you wish to hear the recording."

Your goal is to help Munchy catch each note as quickly as possible. \n\nThe game combines learning and fun into a single gratifying experience. The app is both educational and entertaining, with an intuitive and visually appealing interface. \n\nNoteWorks was created for: \n• iPhone, iPod touch and iPad users.\n• Players of all ages. \n• Beginners to advanced music students. \n• Families with multiple players. \n• Music teachers with multiple students. \n\nGame design features include: \n• A funny animated character. \n• User-friendly menus. \n• Superb graphics. \n• Engaging sound effects. \n\nNote reading options: \n• On-screen piano keyboard input.\n• On-screen guitar fretboard input.\n• MIDI keyboard input.  \n• \"A, B, C\" note naming:\n. . . CDEFGAB\n. . . CDEFGAH\n. . . ABCDEFG\n. . . AHCDEFG \n• \"Do, Re, Mi\" (Fixed Do) note naming. \n• Treble clef. \n• Bass clef. \n• Tenor clef. \n• Alto clef. \n• Custom note range in all four clefs.\n\nEducational features: \n• Students learn by playing and having fun. \n• Multiple game settings allow players to stay in control. \n• Students can choose to play with hints. \n• Students play without hints to earn points and stars. \n• Players learn to recognize notes instantly, on sight. \n• For beginners, the game starts by teaching a limited range of notes. \n• Note range can be easily customized as students advance. \n• After mastering accidentals, students learn key signatures. \n• Game speed is controlled to increase or decrease difficulty, or students may choose to play without any time limit.\n• Sharing of game progress: ability to share game results with teachers.\n\nWhile music teachers persistently stress the importance of sight reading, most teachers prefer not to spend valuable lesson time on basic note recognition skills. Thus, NoteWorks helps music teachers concentrate on more interesting aspects of their art, such as technique and musicality. \n\nSerious music students can take advantage of the game to learn clefs outside of their own instruments, as well as prepare for music theory exams. In addition, non-musicians could use NoteWorks as an interesting memory game, to help keep their minds sharp and quick. \n\nNoteWorks was created for people who like to learn by playing and having fun. It was designed with the objective of neither being too easy nor too hard, and never boring. We hope you'll find NoteWorks both useful and entertaining, and we would greatly appreciate it if you could share your thoughts and opinions about the game by rating it."

      "label": "Little Learners Love Literacy® is a sequenced phonics reading program designed to \ngive children confidence and success.  Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures. The stories are engaging and are presented in different genres. Pip and Tim write emails in Hullabazoo to Mrs Mack and even set up FriendBook to share their adventures and photos. \n\nStage 7 Unit 3 introduces the vowel graphemes oo (representing two sounds - Hullabaloo, Oops), ow, ou, oi, oy. \n\nThese books also have a recording feature that allows children to record and listen to themselves read. This is an important step in developing fluency, as it gives children a reason to reread and record.  \n\nFluency is an important literacy skill requiring accuracy and comprehension. Children need to read with expression to show the understanding of the text. \n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions. \n\nAll words, except the Heart words, can be decoded or ‘sounded out’. To do this, children point to each letter or grapheme, saying the sounds then blending the sounds together to read the word. \n\nThere are NO tricks in the Little Learner books.\n\nNote: Please make sure to enable the microphone on your device when asked or you will not be able to record. Also check that your device is not set to mute when you wish to hear the recording."

Once your cat has mastered a trick, check the complete box, and watch your progress grow in the Progress Tab.   When your cat has qualified for a title (coming 1st quarter 2022), record a video of your cat performing the trick,  post your video on social media, and send us the link so we can review and if you qualify, award you your titles (See catbosstv.com for more information on how to qualify for trick titles)\n\nNot only does Trish teach you how to train your cat, Trish and her team show you all the lifestyle hacks in our CBTV Guides (also available on our website) that are a must for getting your cat in condition - mentally, physicially, and emotionally - if you want to get the very best out of them while training. And... as an extra added bonus - we offer  \"CatTV\" videos created by the CatBoss herself that are sure to keep your cat entertained.   Let's get going, future CatBoss!   We can wait to see what you and your cat can do!"

An offline dictionary has also been included when internet connectivity is not available.\n\nAs well as English meanings, it has example sentences with translations for many entries. It even has photographs and audio clips for Aotearoa/New Zealand native fauna and photographs of flora, important people and other items where a photograph will aid understanding.\n\nIn addition to the words one would expect in a traditional dictionary, it also has encyclopaedic entries designed to provide key information about plants, animals, stars, planets, heavenly bodies, important Māori people, key ancestors of traditional narratives, tribal groups, ancestral canoes, song types, musical instruments, Māori names for institutions, country names, place names and other proper names. There are also detailed explanations of key concepts central to Māori culture. Comprehensive explanations for grammatical items are included, with examples of usage, as are idioms and colloquialisms with their meanings and examples.\n\nThe Te Aka Maori app is the companion to the popular www.maoridictionary.co.nz website and forms part of the Te Whanake Māori Language learning series."

Included in this app is 8 mind challenging sections, designed to test multiple different areas of your brain, inspired by some of the games used in genuine aptitude tests.\n\nThis application can be connected to the iOS Game Center, which allows a comparison of global scores. You can then see how you fare against your friends and other people around the world.\n\nGames included are as follows; arithmetic test, instrumental comprehension test, SDT tests, multitasking test, spatial awareness test, co-ordination tests, memory tests and a shadowing test.\nAll questions are always computer generated, therefore it is unlikely that the same problem will arise twice.\n\nEvery section comes with an instructions page, which includes a detailed explanation on how to solve each question. Furthermore, at the end of each game you can now review each incorrectly answered question; allowing you to see where you're going wrong.\n\nGood luck in the test!"

Gain an understanding of what the \"vortex of creation\" means and how you can use meditation to enter the vortex in order to allow the Law of Attraction to work for you. Also gain valuable insights about what happens to your affirmations and manifestation efforts when you are out of the vortex.  Five guided meditation audio sessions with music are included in this app.  \n\nListeners will be led by Abraham through four guided meditation sessions on these topics: General Well-Being, Financial Abundance, Physical Well-Being and Relationships.   Each guided meditation experience is 15 minutes long.   \n\nThis Vortex of Attraction Guided Meditation iPhone App is an exact duplicate of the physical product and includes the complete written text, and the complete audio recording along with an extra bonus track of guided meditation music which was not included with the original product.\n\nMany people exert manifestation and Law of Attraction efforts outside of the Vortex, and then conclude that the Law of Attraction \"doesn't work.\" Find out how to stop efforting and start allowing the Vortex of Creation to align you with the life you desire.  These are the first guided meditation recordings ever produced containing the Teachings of Abraham."

Crazy Gears is a new-aged digital puzzle game, designed with a real mechanical engine and with children's critical thinking skills in mind! Hours of fun guaranteed for everyone who is up for the challenge, yes, even you Mom & Dad!\n\n*** Children's Technology Review Awards 2015 ***\n*** Parent's Choice Gold Winner Fall 2015***\n*** App of the week by Fun2Tap ***\n*** Best of the Best by Best Apps For Kids ***\n*** Featured worldwide by App Store as a Best New App ***\n\n\nABOUT CRAZY GEARS\nExplore a captivating digital playground in this tantalizing puzzle game! Children manipulate gears, chains, rods, and pulleys, to pull themselves through each level, which teaches them how different mechanisms affect one another when constructing a machine. Each reasoning challenge was carefully designed to adhere to the theories of educational technology pioneer, mathematician, computer scientist, and designer of the first programming language for children, Seymour Papert.\n\n“The best use of games is to leverage their tendency to enhance learning”- Papert\nRecommended Ages 5-9 \n\nAs a child, Papert fell in love with gears. Their movement fascinated him in every way and inspired his career. Crazy Gears was conceived not only as a tribute to him, but with the hope of providing a child with the inspiration to discover and understand the physical properties of mechanisms found in their everyday lives. Such complex notions include tension, motion, and gravity. We achieve this by encouraging the child to manipulate the objects in each level to determine how they work together to accomplish a goal.  Interactions with technology give kids the power to construct their understanding of STEM/STEAM subjects in meaningful ways. Here we engage them in play that does just that!\n\n\nFEATURES\n• No rules\n• No explicit instructions \n• Kid-Friendly​ Design\n• Powerful Artificial Intelligence\n• Seamless Interaction\n• Multiple Language Support\n• Crash Resistant Design\n• Bold, bright colors\n• Automatic Memory\n• Special mode for children with CVI\n\nSTEM/STEAM TOPICS EXPLORED\n• Gears \n• Mechanical Systems (simple and complex) \n• Action and Reaction \n• Motion (circular, rotary, and reciprocating) \n• Ratios\n• Tension\n• Torque and Speed\n• Mechanical Advantage \n\nABOUT US\nEdoki Academy’s mission is to provide children with enjoyable early-learning activities using the latest technologies. Our team members, many of whom are young parents or teachers, strive to produce tools that motivate and inspire children to learn, play, and progress. \n\nPRIVACY\nWe take your child’s privacy very seriously, for this reason, we are proud to offer a product that is certified COPPA compliant by PRIVO. \n\nCONNECT WITH US!\nIf you have any support requests, comments, or questions do not hesitate to contact us at support@edokiacademy.com.

Collecting stickers has turned using a potty activity to joy instead of the usual tears and screams.\"\n\nWHY DO TODDLERS AND PARENTS LOVE THIS APP?\n• Fun stickers\n• No Ads\n• Reminders\n• Easy and convenient\n• Automatic backup\n\nABOUT POTTY TRAINING TIME:\nSometimes toddlers need a little motivation for taking the leap from diapers to the big-kid potty chair. Potty Training Time contains some creative ideas for fun and effective potty training.\nAfter each successful trip to the bathroom, toddlers can log their potty activity and discover a new colorful sticker on their own chart.\n\nPlease send an email to ios.appfrancois@gmail.com for any bug report or feature request."

      "label": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

      "label": "Welcome to The Spalding Method ™ Phonograms app!\nNOTICE: Upon installing this mobile application, you are agreeing to the terms and conditions.\nThis Spalding Phonograms app is designed for helping students learn the phonics connection between speech sounds and written symbols that represent those sounds (phonograms). Learning the phonograms is essential for accurate and automatic reading, writing, and spelling. Teaching all the sounds of the phonemes represented by an alphabet letter or combination of two, three, or four letters (phonograms) enables students to read, spell, and write high-frequency words quickly. Students who learn the phonograms well expand their vocabulary and are able to use effective and creative communication skills in writing. Critical thinking is involved in learning the appropriate phonogram placement within words for accurate spelling and for applying information learned during phonogram reviews to pronounce unfamiliar words. \nThe Spalding Phonograms app is for students that need additional practice, including home schooling, ESL (English as a Second Language), ELL (English Language Learners), ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) students, and those with dyslexia or other learning disabilities. The school and home connection is encouraged through collaboration and communication with the teacher, parent, and student for practicing the phonograms appropriately and adequately. The Spalding  Phonograms app aligns with the core reading foundational skills required by state and national standards that are most crucial to the development of early reading success and reading comprehension, including:\n•\tPhonemic awareness\n•\tFeature recognition\n•\tLetter recognition\n•\tSound-symbol relationships (decoding)\nThe Spalding Phonograms app provides the following options for all 87 phonograms.\n•\tPhonogram Introduction by selected group – The student sees the phonograms in order of instruction in The Writing Road to Reading, listens to the teacher say the sound(s), and then says the sound(s).\n•\tOral Phonogram Review – A random phonogram card is show, followed by a pause. The student says the sound(s) and then listens to check accuracy. \n•\tWritten Phonogram Review –The student hears the phonogram sounds, followed by a pause; the student repeats the sound(s), listens for a cue, if needed, and then writes the phonogram on lined paper. The card is immediately shown so the student can check for accuracy.\n•\tDifferentiated Practice – Specific phonograms (from all 87) can be selected that need more practice. These phonograms can then be practiced in Phonogram Introduction, Oral Phonogram Review, or Written Phonogram Review."

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

The milestones covered in the app start at age 18 months and now go up to age 5! \n\n\r\nThese milestones are the notorious “stages” or “phases” that children go through. These are those times when children “act up,” but it’s because new skills are emerging. This work documents both what the irritating behavior is and what the new skills are. Simply enter your child’s due date into the app, and a calendar is generated with their expected developmental milestones. Simply click on any colored date and get instant information about your child! Add as many children as you want. \r\n\nThe app currently offers the milestones, whereas the Observant Mom website and book series, Misbehavior is Growth, offers parenting tips and tricks for the milestones. Current work for older milestones (age 5+) can also be found at the website, The Observant Mom. \n\n\nAbout the App:\n\n\nØ  Click on any colored date and instantly find out what developmental milestone your child is (or will be) in!\n\n\nØ  The milestones in the app currently go from eighteen months through age four, ending at four.\n\n\nØ  Older milestones will be added to the app as they are finalized.\n\n\nØ  Older milestones can still be found on the website.\n\n\nØ  You may add as many children as you want!\n\n\nCountless have said that this work helps them stay patient as a parent or caregiver. Be sure to share this information with family and friends. It’s not misbehavior: it’s growth!"

The list is comprised of 220 words grouped by level, and includes pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions and verbs.  There are also 95 nouns on a separate list.\n\nSight Word BINGO includes four different games!\n\nWord BINGO \n\nListen to the word the BINGO Bug speaks and tap on the corresponding word on the screen.  Get four words correct vertically, horizontally or diagonally to get BINGO and win!  The quicker you get BINGO the better your score.  Your score is based on time and the lower the score, the better.  Earn a BINGO Bug when you beat your best score.\n\nSpelling Practice\n \nTap and drag the letters to spell the word the BINGO bug speaks.  Spell ten words to play a bonus game!  You can choose to show or hide the spelling of each word in game settings.\n\nWord Fling \n\nYou have one hundred seconds to find as many BINGO Bugs as possible and fling them into the warp zone!  To find the bug, tap the word the BINGO bug speaks.  If you tap the correct word, a BINGO Bug and a bungee cord will appear.  Pull downward and left or right to aim the BINGO Bug toward the warp zone hole.  Let go to fling the BINGO Bug! Bounce the bug off of the wall before going into the warp zone for more points. The game will end once you incorrectly recognize three words.\n\nWord It Up \n\nStop the word blocks from stacking up to the top of the screen!  Tap on the word the BINGO bug speaks to get rid of the block.  Tilt the device to change where the block lands.  Try not to click on the wrong word or you’ll lose points and the block will stay forever.\n\n---------------------\n\nWord BINGO features:\n\nUniversal App - Only $.99 for iPad, iPod & iPhone\n\n4 Games in 1: Word BINGO  |  Spelling Practice  |  Word It Up  |  Fling it\n\n5 player profiles & guest profile\n\nCreate your own character\n\nOver 300 Dolch Sight Words\n\nSelect a word list: Pre-Primer, Primer, First Grade, Second Grade, Third Grade, Nouns or All Words\n\nScore Board: the three best scores are displayed by word list and player displays top three best scores by word list and by player.\n\nEasily track and view what words that you got wrong by using the “My Report” Card feature.\n\nMy Report Card: A powerful feature that displays word accuracy and best scores by player profile.  Word accuracy feature displays the percentage of sight words correctly identified by word list or individual words.

      "label": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training.

Spend more time concentrating on people and less time in front of a computer screen. \n \nDevice Frames \nUse Reflector Director to select new device frames to display on mirrored screens, or choose to hide frames entirely. Displaying a frame around devices adds a polished and professional feel. \n \nSecure Pairing \nPairing Reflector Director to Reflector 4 is easy and secure. Reflector Director even helps you easily connect to a computer’s Reflector software on limited and restricted networks. The apps are paired directly together with no in-between connections. Use a Quick Connect Code (TM), QR Code or Bluetooth to easily pair. \n \nHow It Works \nSimply open the Reflector Director app on your iOS device and connect to the Reflector 4 software on your computer to begin managing the devices that are connected to the Reflector software. \n \nReflector Director allows you to step away from your computer while still controlling how your audience views the devices that are connected to Reflector 4. Easily show and hide devices, emphasize screens, enable full-screen mode or change device frames all while away from your computer. \n \nReflector Director is compatible with Reflector 4. It REQUIRES this application running on your computer: https://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector/download/ \n \nNOTE: Reflector Director does NOT allow you to mirror a device to your iPhone or iPad. Reflector Director DOES allow you to manage the devices that are connected to Reflector 4 software."

      "label": "Little Learners Love Literacy® is a sequenced phonics reading program to give children confidence and success.  Letters and sounds are introduced in stages.  Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures.   \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen. \n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n• tap on a word to hear it being read \n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 4\n\n• At the fun run\n• Mud\n• In the log hut\n• On the bus\n• The big red box\n\nStage 4  sounds include the initial alphabetic code – a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p qu r s t u v w x y z\nNew Heart words : he to was we she\n\nThese five books use all the sounds of the initial alphabetic code.  There are NO tricks as children use their phonic skills to read.   \nThese books are audio enhanced – tap on a word to have it read aloud."

      "label": "The Decodable Readers Australia books support a systematic approach of learning to read. This approach ensures kids are given the “right-fit” book.  Decodable, or phonic readers, only contain words made up of the sounds a child has learnt. Within each level in the Decodable Readers Australia Series, a new group of sounds is introduced. As children move through each level the sounds progress from simple to complex.\n\nThe Decodable Readers Australia – Level 4 books introduce the sounds sh, ch, th (them) th (thin), qu, ng, wh, g (gent) and c (circle).  All the words in each of the 20 books in Level 4 are made up of these sounds and those introduced in Level 1, 2 and 3 along with minimal sight words. After having mastered the Level 1, 2 and 3 sounds and the reading skills of blending and tracking, children should have gained the confidence to read Australian stories with new words and more text on each page.\n\nEach story in Level 4 can be enjoyed by listening to the professional audio or read aloud with the support of tapping and hearing the word if required. The audio function can be controlled independently within each page. Both parents and teachers can continue to support children with vocab and comprehension development through using the post-reading activities provided within each story. An addition to the Level 4 readers are the wide range of pre-reading activities that can be used to help set the purpose for reading.\n\nKey Features:\n•\tlisten to each story being read to them using the audio function\n•\tuse each book to practice reading independently \n•\ttap each word to hear the sounds and the word if support is needed\n•\ttap to turn each page for individual reading pace\n•\tall Australian themes and characters\nbeautifully illustrated with detail for engagement and enjoyment"

      "label": "The Decodable Readers Australia books support a systematic approach of learning to read. This approach ensures kids are given the “right-fit” book. Decodable, or phonic readers, only contain words made up of the sounds a child has learnt. Within each level in the Decodable Readers Australia Series, a new group of sounds is introduced. As children move through each level the sounds progress from simple to complex.\n\nThe Decodable Readers Australia – Level 5 books introduce the sounds ai (trail), ay (play), ea (beach), ee (tree), ie (pie), igh (sight), oa (boat), ow (slow), ew (few), ue (cue).  \n\nOur Level 6 books introduce the sounds oi (soil), oy (boy), oo (book), oo (moon), ou (loud), ow (cow), er (term), ir (stir), ur (turn), ar (star), or (for). All the words in each of the 20 books in Level 5/6 are made up of these sounds and those introduced in Level 1, 2, 3 and 4 along with minimal sight words. After having mastered the Level 1, 2, 3 and 4 sounds and the reading skills of blending and tracking, children should have gained the confidence to read Australian stories with new words and more text on each page.\n\nEach story in Level 5/6 can be enjoyed by listening to the professional audio or read aloud with the support of tapping and hearing the word if required. The audio function can be controlled independently within each page. Both parents and teachers can continue to support children with vocab and comprehension development through using the post-reading activities provided within each story. An addition to the Level 5/6 readers are the wide range of pre-reading activities that can be used to help set the purpose for reading."

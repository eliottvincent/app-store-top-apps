      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures.   \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen.\n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n•tap on a word to hear it being read \n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 1\n\n• Sam, Pip, Tim\n• I am Tim\n• My cat Tip\n• The map\n• Sam is it!\n\nChildren can read these books once they know the letters and sounds for m, s, f, a, p, t, c, i.   The books are decodable with some Heart words – the The My my I.  Heart words are words that children need to learn by heart as they cannot ‘decode or sound out” at this stage. There are NO tricks in our Little Learner books.  The books are enhanced with audio – tap on a word to have it read aloud."

An offline dictionary has also been included when internet connectivity is not available.\n\nAs well as English meanings, it has example sentences with translations for many entries. It even has photographs and audio clips for Aotearoa/New Zealand native fauna and photographs of flora, important people and other items where a photograph will aid understanding.\n\nIn addition to the words one would expect in a traditional dictionary, it also has encyclopaedic entries designed to provide key information about plants, animals, stars, planets, heavenly bodies, important Māori people, key ancestors of traditional narratives, tribal groups, ancestral canoes, song types, musical instruments, Māori names for institutions, country names, place names and other proper names. There are also detailed explanations of key concepts central to Māori culture. Comprehensive explanations for grammatical items are included, with examples of usage, as are idioms and colloquialisms with their meanings and examples.\n\nThe Te Aka Maori app is the companion to the popular www.maoridictionary.co.nz website and forms part of the Te Whanake Māori Language learning series."

(Light or Dark)\n- All Hymn from 1 - 663.\n- Add a favorite Hymn. (Unlimited)\n- Search by \"title\" or by \"number\" or by any phrase(s). [ only Tongan phrase(s) allowed :)]\n- 100% offline. (no need to connect to the internet in order to start singing)\n\n\nJust a tip for the users when searching for a hymn, you can search using numbers or if unsure of the hymn number you can search by Title or a phrase from any verse. Searching with or without special characters(eg: Sisu or Sīsū), Uppercase or Lowercase(eg: FAKAFETA'I or fakafetai) will work either way\n\n\n\nI hope you will all enjoy using this app and hopefully find it useful.\n\nMālō 'aupito."

You can then see how you fare against your friends and other people around the world.\n\nGames included are as follows; arithmetic test, instrumental comprehension test, SDT tests, multitasking test, spatial awareness test, co-ordination tests, memory tests and a shadowing test.\nAll questions are always computer generated, therefore it is unlikely that the same problem will arise twice.\n\nEvery section comes with an instructions page, which includes a detailed explanation on how to solve each question. Furthermore, at the end of each game you can now review each incorrectly answered question; allowing you to see where you're going wrong.\n\nGood luck in the test!"

There are 166 different game modes of varying difficulty so it is useful throughout grades K-5. Answer as many questions as possible in minute-long games, or you can now practice without the pressure of a countdown timer - a feature which is new for 2019. Questions are randomly generated which means it is very replayable. The game has been carefully designed for children, with large, widely spaced buttons. We recommend that young children play on a tablet.\n\nSix main topics are covered: \n\n* Times tables - up to 10 or 12 \n* Division - up to 10 or 12\n* Square numbers\n* Number bonds\n* Doubling \n* Halving\n\nBetween these topics, the four standard arithmetic operations are covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nYou can create up to 30 player profiles per device to track an individual's high scores (increased from 15 in 2019). If you prefer there's also the option to play as a guest. All data is stored locally on your device so you don't have to worry about privacy issues. We've also made it very easy for children to quickly switch between profiles after playing a game, if they're sharing a device.\n\nAfter each game, the score achieved is displayed along with the child's high score. Bronze, silver or gold stars and trophies are awarded depending on the score achieved in each game."

Hints explain how the diagram changes within the sequence. You can also retry a question if you do not answer it correctly. Once you find all correct answers you have the option to redo the test with the same questions at which point answers are reshuffled."

The schedule is paired with an ‘all done’ column to check off steps toward a motivating reward. Timers can be added to any task or activity. The schedules are easy to edit and fully customizable. Once you have created a schedule, it will be saved automatically.\n\nWaiting Board \nThe Waiting Board teaches waiting skills like taking turns and not interrupting. The user can begin by reading the companion book, When Do I Have to Wait? Using the waiting board, the top picture indicates the reason why the child is waiting and a timer can be set to show how long the child will wait. The child can then choose an activity to do while waiting. \n\nFeelings Board \nThe Feelings Board provides a tool for helping children understand and express emotions. The user can begin by reading the companion book, When I Get Upset, to provide an example of how the child might recognize an emotion and choose a coping strategy. On the Feelings Board, the user can then help the child indicate how they are feeling from a range of options, select a coping strategy, and then request an activity to help them feel better or re-engage with others. \n\nFeelings Scale\nHelps users identify, manage and cope with feelings across environments throughout the day. By tracking their feelings on the board, users can analyze the data for trends to learn if tasks done at different times of day or in different environments affect outcome. Environments and schedules can then be altered to achieve better results.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.beevisual.com/mobile-app-eula.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.beevisual.com/mobile-app-privacy.html"

      "label": "Team Shake provides a technological and environmentally friendly way to choose teams for board games, sporting events, tournaments, school projects or anytime groups are required. The newest release brings many new features including full iPad support, balancing teams based on skill or gender, importing users from a file, enabling video output, and sharing teams via facebook or email. \n\nTeam Shake is the premier iOS App for creating teams. Instead of a hat and scraps of paper, the user enters his friends' names in his iPhone and gives it a shake. The screen will then display a random set of color-coded teams. These teams can immediately be used for game play or shared via facebook or email.   The quick and easy selection of random (or balanced) teams eliminates fighting over who will be on which team. Innovative use of the iPhone shake gesture gives users the satisfying feeling of shaking a virtual hat without the trouble of carrying around an actual hat. Conventional buttons can also be used for those who would rather not shake their expensive hardware about.  \n\nThe app is designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind. Names can easily be entered with the onscreen keyboard, chosen from the user's contacts, or imported from a file. The email and facebook functions document the members of each individual team as well as preserving the team number and color assigned by the app. For repeated use of Team Shake, lists of friends can be easily saved and loaded later. The current list is also automatically saved so that if you exit the app, or even reboot the device, changes will not be lost. For teachers and others with large lists of people, Team Shake supports the ability to import teams from text or csv files.\n\nIf you have any problems, feature requests, or comments please send an email to support@rhine-o.com. \n\nFeatures:\n\n* Create 1 to 64 random teams\n* Create completely random or balanced teams\n* Full iPad support\n* Eliminates fighting over choosing teams\n* Share / Save teams via email or Facebook\n* Teams can be chosen by the number of teams or by the size of teams.\n* Save lists of friends for later games\n* Import lists from email or spreadsheet\n* Export lists and options for use on another device\n* Satisfying feeling of shaking a “virtual” hat to create teams\n* Animated shaking hat\n* Entry of names via onscreen keyboard\n* Entry of names via iPhone contacts\n* Temporarily disable people who are absent\n* Set groups of people to always be on the same team\n* Set groups of people to always be on different teams\n* Set user strength to make more even teams (now supports fully balanced teams)\n* 5 users strengths level\n* Pick a single random person from the list of players\n* User strength indicator on the main screen (can be disabled in options)\n* Number of active players and total players is now displayed on the main screen\n* Video Out Support\n* Option to Sort Teams by Name\n* Option to balance male / female team members\n* \"Equal Ability\" option to create teams where all players have the same strength\n* Option to create separate male and female teams\n* Configurable Team Colors\n* Configurable Team Names\n* Print Support\n* Export Teams in CSV or XLS Format\n* Team Shake now supports simultaneously assigning players to multiple subteams and / or oppose teams at the same time.\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now have customized names to make selection easier\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now be enabled or disabled globally so that teams can be made quickly without subteams / oppose teams.  In particular, Balance Teams Strengths will work when separate Male / Female teams are created.\n\nYappler-Tags: Teams, Groups, Random, Hat, Entertainment, Games, Utilities"

The activities (one activity is included with this free version of the app, and the other two are available via in-app purchase) are specially designed for kids age 2-6.  Happy characters, sprite animations, music, and sound effects all add up to a fun and engaging experience for toddlers and preschool-aged children.\n\nDexteria Jr.'s  unique hand and finger activities take full advantage of the iPad's multi-touch interface to help build strength, control, and dexterity. \n\nFor best results the exercises should be done on a regular basis in short sessions. The exercises are designed to be repeatable and engaging.\n\nThe automatic tracking and reporting feature makes it easy for parents, teachers and occupational therapists to identify time on task and progress. You can email the progress reports right from the app itself. We do not receive or collect the tracking data.\n\nMulti-user tracking is available as an in-app purchase. (Note to Volume Purchase Program customers: Consider buying Dexteria Jr. VPP instead. It includes multi-user tracking and you will pay a lower net cost than if you buy Dexteria Jr. and upgrade each copy via the in-app purchase. Just search \"Dexteria Jr. VPP\" in the app store.) \n\n• Increases coordination and motor control in the hands and fingers \n\n• Easy to use\n\n• Great way to get kids ready for kindergarten\n\n• Fun graphics, music, and sound effects\n\n• \"Quiet time\" mode turns off music and/or sound effects\n\n• Automatically creates performance and usage reports that can be emailed \n\n• Designed in consultation with Occupational Therapists \n\n• Less expensive and more reusable than workbooks\n\n• Multi-user reporting available via in-app purchase (iPad version only)\n\nWe're serious about your privacy.

Included in this app are a visual E6B Calculator, interactive Weather Reports with METAR and TAF decoders, a NavLog Calculator, and many other tools to assist you with aviation calculations.\n\nE6B Calculator\n\nThis is the world’s most popular E6B aviation calculator, already used online by hundreds of thousands of pilots. The calculations are visually illustrated to aid in understanding, showing wind speed and direction, wind correction angle, course, heading, ground speed, and true air speed.\n\nWeather Reports\n\nSearch for any airport using the Weather Reports tool, and find the relevant METAR and TAF reports, taken live from aviationweather.gov. Need help understanding METAR or TAF? Tap on any segment to instantly see what it means, or tap the Decode button to reveal the entire report at once.\n\nWeather Reports can also display airport data for US airports, including runway directions and lengths, heliports, radio frequencies, and charts.\n\nNavLog Calculator\n\nUse the NavLog Calculator for either VFR or IFR flight planning. Enter numbers into the table to perform instant calculations. You can add as many lines as you need, and the table can be easily cleared with a single button.\n\nHolding Pattern Calculator\n\nThe Holding Pattern Calculator uses a detailed and informative graphic to help you determine your entry into a holding pattern, and then to maintain that pattern with wind corrections. Simply enter a few basic values to see them instantly reflected in the graphic, then follow the detailed entry and hold instructions.\n\nMetar and Taf Decoder\n\nWith E6BX Metar Decoder, almost everything in any given Metar or Taf is decodable, including elevation, wind direction and speed, wind components, pressure altitude, density altitude, air pressure, dew point, and all sorts of weather conditions.\n\nSnowtam & Motne Decoder\n\nPaste any Snowtam or Motne report into this tool to decode it.

      "label": "Welcome to The Spalding Method ™ Phonograms app!\nNOTICE: Upon installing this mobile application, you are agreeing to the terms and conditions.\nThis Spalding Phonograms app is designed for helping students learn the phonics connection between speech sounds and written symbols that represent those sounds (phonograms). Learning the phonograms is essential for accurate and automatic reading, writing, and spelling. Teaching all the sounds of the phonemes represented by an alphabet letter or combination of two, three, or four letters (phonograms) enables students to read, spell, and write high-frequency words quickly. Students who learn the phonograms well expand their vocabulary and are able to use effective and creative communication skills in writing. Critical thinking is involved in learning the appropriate phonogram placement within words for accurate spelling and for applying information learned during phonogram reviews to pronounce unfamiliar words. \nThe Spalding Phonograms app is for students that need additional practice, including home schooling, ESL (English as a Second Language), ELL (English Language Learners), ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) students, and those with dyslexia or other learning disabilities. The school and home connection is encouraged through collaboration and communication with the teacher, parent, and student for practicing the phonograms appropriately and adequately. The Spalding  Phonograms app aligns with the core reading foundational skills required by state and national standards that are most crucial to the development of early reading success and reading comprehension, including:\n•\tPhonemic awareness\n•\tFeature recognition\n•\tLetter recognition\n•\tSound-symbol relationships (decoding)\nThe Spalding Phonograms app provides the following options for all 87 phonograms.\n•\tPhonogram Introduction by selected group – The student sees the phonograms in order of instruction in The Writing Road to Reading, listens to the teacher say the sound(s), and then says the sound(s).\n•\tOral Phonogram Review – A random phonogram card is show, followed by a pause. The student says the sound(s) and then listens to check accuracy. \n•\tWritten Phonogram Review –The student hears the phonogram sounds, followed by a pause; the student repeats the sound(s), listens for a cue, if needed, and then writes the phonogram on lined paper. The card is immediately shown so the student can check for accuracy.\n•\tDifferentiated Practice – Specific phonograms (from all 87) can be selected that need more practice. These phonograms can then be practiced in Phonogram Introduction, Oral Phonogram Review, or Written Phonogram Review."

Teachers love \"Touch and Write\" because children delight in writing when they can use shaving cream, paint, and jello. Create your own, individualized word and name lists, or practice one of the many included word lists, such as high frequency words, and word families (-AT family, -AN family, and more.) Using the included word lists, children can listen to the SOUND of each letter as they write, or toggle to hear the NAME of each letter. Developed by classroom teachers – builds on best education practices!\n\nThis is from a review of our Victorian \"Australian Touch and Write\" app:\n\"Brilliant - fun way to learn Victorian cursive. I have been waiting for an app like this - a fun way teach Victorian Modern Cursive, an app my special needs son enjoys playing with and learns as he goes.  He can even use a stylus to draw the letters and build the muscle memory in his hand, that can later be transferred to writing with a pencil or pen.  All children will benefit from this app, presenting learning writing in an exciting format, great guides to help learn where to start and stop letters, and great celebration pages to keep them interested and rewarded.  I like that you can use the word lists or make your own so then the app grows with the child into writing full words, not just letters.  I think I will be trying it out with my son's spelling lists too and double benefit - writing and spelling.  It is also great to be able to teach Aussie formats such as Victorian Modern Cursive.... Almost all the apps I have tried have been US based.  Thanks FizzBrain!

The Scratch name and Scratch cat are trademarks of MIT.\n\n***NOW A TOP TEN EDUCATIONAL APP IN 50 COUNTRIES****\n\n***Ranked #1 educational app in 14 countries***\n\n\"Tutorials for Scratch\" brings you a whole bunch of video tutorials to get you going making your own games in the new version of Scratch 2.0. This are not the sort of standard tutorials that you find on the web. During the videos you will be set tasks to do in scratch and hopefully you will be able to complete them on your own. However don't worry the next video in each project will show you how to complete the task!!\n\nThese videos are really targeted at primary/elementary students although the content will go on to stretch and challenge even the most able of them with variables, cloning, broadcasting and many other features of Scratch. \n\nThere's even a quiz in the app so you can test your scratch knowledge too!!\n\nScratch really is a fantastic way into learning programming and coding and this app hopefully will be a great asset to get you going with it.\n\nThis is a big app of just under 300Mb, because there is so much material in it. You will need to be hooked into your WiFi connection!!  \n\n*TEACHERS* the point of this app is that kids can use the iPad alongside the pc to build their games in Scratch. You can just sit back and relax without having to plan anything. Oh and there is enough material to keep your students busy for around 6 hours, even if they don't manage to have a go at the extension tasks that are identified for all 4 games!!"

Add students to those groups. The App will then randomly select students from the highlighted group. All names will be displayed before a name is displayed for a second time. \n\n Features: \n• Call on your students in a different order every time. \n\n• If you want to exclude a Student/s from the selection, simply turn them off in the settings screen. This can be particularly useful for any absentees.\n\n• You can delete and edit Groups / Group member names easily inside the app.\n\n• The number of Students / Groups is limited only by the amount of free space on your device. \n\n• Use a FREE Dropbox account to backup and “Sync” your Groups/Group members with your other devices. You can even use the same Groups/Group members in our “Random Team Selector Pro” app (separate purchase).\n\n• If you have a lot of Groups/Group Members to define you can even import them from a text or CSV file. \n\n• The teacher can determine how many times any single name can be displayed. This avoids the problem of students “switching off” once their name has been selected once.\n\n• This is a Universal App for iPhone and iPad. \n\n• The Animated Graphics and multiple themes make the whole experience a pleasure and keep things fresh for the students. You can even create your own backgrounds. \n\n• Sound effects and background music help make the app more engaging but can also be switched ON/OFF individually as required.\n\n• You can apply a “Passcode” to access the settings screen.\n\n• Need to know where you are in the selection process. We have added a display option that shows the number of names drawn and the number of names remaining in the particular selection process.\n• Provide Feedback to the Developers directly from within the App….let us know how we can make it better.  \n\n• Share with your friends on Facebook or Twitter from within the App. \n\nWe value your feedback. Many of the features above are the direct result of Teacher feedback. If you have any ideas of ways the app can be improved we would love to hear them. Also, if you want to report a bug please use the “Email Support” button inside the app, or email us directly at support@edtechmonster.com We will always get back to you."

      "label": "Tap images. Type words. Speak. Proloquo2Go is an easy to use communication app for people who cannot speak or need help being understood. Featuring natural sounding voices, including real children’s voices, Proloquo2Go is a simple yet powerful AAC (augmentative and alternative communication) tool. The app is fully customizable and can be utilized to build language skills and grow with a person’s communication, supporting both beginning and advanced communicators.\n\nParents, therapists, teachers and users around the world recognize Proloquo2Go as the gold standard in AAC solutions. The app is used by people with autism, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, Angelman syndrome, and others with speech difficulties. The app is available in English, Spanish, French, and Dutch and supports bilingual use, so you can switch languages on the fly.\n\nProloquo2Go in action:\n\nLearn and grow\n\nStudies show that just 200-400 words make up 80% of what we say. Known as core words, they act as the basis of Proloquo2Go’s research-based Crescendo™ vocabulary. Users can grow from single words to full sentences in the same app. Crescendo puts core words in consistent locations for easy access and motor-planning. The vocabulary works with AAC best practices like modeling (where you use an AAC system to talk with the user) to develop language skills. Crescendo offers no limit on language development with a 10,000+ fringe word vocabulary and customizable vocabulary levels. Finally, with Progressive Language, words are gradually revealed step-by-step, helping users learn words and their location as their communication expands.\n\nEasy editing\n\nCustomizing Proloquo2Go is a breeze! Quickly and easily add new words. Use the app’s built-in library of 25,000 symbols or use your own photos by taking pictures within the app or selecting them from your photo library. For users with fine-motor challenges and vision impairments, Proloquo2Go offers options like 23 pre-programmed grid sizes and accessibility settings which support switch scanning and Apple’s VoiceOver screen reader. Everything from appearance to access is customizable so you can make it your own. \n\nType and speak\n\nBesides tapping images, Proloquo2Go also lets you type what you want to say. The app includes a Grid Keyboard arranged alphabetically for people learning to type. For more experienced typists, Proloquo2Go includes a Typing View with a QWERTY keyboard and word prediction that offers suggestions based on what you are typing. \n\nHello! ¡Hola! Bonjour! Hallo!\n\nProloquo2Go lets you select a language and region for the Crescendo vocabulary. Two languages can be used at the same time, allowing seamless bilingual speech. Over 100 included downloadable natural-sounding adult and children’s voices rounds out your choices to use the app your way.\n\nA helping hand\n\nAssistiveWare is here for you every step of the way. Help articles in Proloquo2Go are there whenever you need them. New to AAC? Our website has easy to understand articles in the Learn AAC section, and the AssistiveWare Core Word Classroom includes activities for teaching communication effectively. You can also connect directly with our community of parents, professionals, and users on our Facebook groups. If you have any questions, our support team is available 7 days a week and is always happy to help. All of these online resources can be accessed by going to the AssistiveWare website. \n\nNote: Discounts are available through Apple’s Educational Volume Purchase Program – 50% off on 20 licenses or more. Joan Bruno’s Gateway to Language & Learning© vocabulary is available as an in-app purchase (English only)."

      "label": "Little Learners Love Literacy® is a sequenced phonics reading program to give children confidence and success.  Letters and sounds are introduced in stages.  Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen. \n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n• tap on a word to hear it being read \n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 3 \n\n• Ned\n• Big Ted and Meg\n• Tim’s quiz\n• Dad and his hot dog\n• The rat\n\nStage 3 sounds include m, s, f, a, p, t, c, I, b, h, n, o, d, g, l, v plus new sounds y r e qu z\n\nNew Heart words: of are too for her \n\nThere are NO tricks in reading these stories as children are practising their knowledge of the sounds and letters. \nThese books are enhanced with audio – tap on a word to have it read aloud."

The world of science just got a little bit weirder and a lot more fun with Toca Lab: Plants!\n\nJust like with the first app in the Toca Lab Series, Toca Lab: Elements, your curiosity will lead the way. Choose your plant, then visit five different locations in the lab:\n\n● Grow light: Shine the light on your plant and watch what happens! Does your plant bask and happily sigh in the light, or groan and wriggle away? What happens when you turn the light up a notch or two?\n\n● Watering tank: Put your plant in the tank and fill it up with water. Will your plant float? How does your plant behave when it’s soaking wet?\n\n● Nutrition station: What’s the optimal diet for your plant? Try the three different nutrition formulas and discover which ones your plant character likes!\n\n● Cloning machine: Spin the wheel on the cloning machine and before you know it, you’ll have five little versions of your plant. Wonder what the clones can do? Experiment and find out!\n\n● Crossbreeding apparatus: Here you can mix two plants to create something unexpected. Try it and see what happens!\n\nHave fun experimenting at each station to see how the plants evolve. Keep experimenting until you’ve collected all 35 plant characters in the app. Once you’ve collected a plant, keep experimenting to continue to evolve it! Who says kids can’t be scientists? Toca Lab: Plants brings out the budding botanist in everybody!\n\nFEATURES\n- Start with one plant and experiment your way to 35 different plant characters, each with its own unique personality!\n- Continue to evolve existing plants through experimentation!\n- Evolve plants with five lab tools: grow light, watering tank, nutrition station, cloning machine and the crossbreeding apparatus.\n- Discover plants from five groups: green algae, mosses, ferns, trees and flowering plants.\n- Learn the names and Latin names of real-life plants!\n\n--\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

      "label": "The Decodable Readers Australia books support a systematic approach of learning to read. This approach ensures kids are given the “right-fit” book.  Decodable, or phonic readers, only contain words made up of the sounds a child has learnt. Within each level in the Decodable Readers Australia Series, a new group of sounds is introduced. As children move through each level the sounds progress from simple to complex.\n\nThe Decodable Readers Australia – Level 4 books introduce the sounds sh, ch, th (them) th (thin), qu, ng, wh, g (gent) and c (circle).  All the words in each of the 20 books in Level 4 are made up of these sounds and those introduced in Level 1, 2 and 3 along with minimal sight words. After having mastered the Level 1, 2 and 3 sounds and the reading skills of blending and tracking, children should have gained the confidence to read Australian stories with new words and more text on each page.\n\nEach story in Level 4 can be enjoyed by listening to the professional audio or read aloud with the support of tapping and hearing the word if required. The audio function can be controlled independently within each page. Both parents and teachers can continue to support children with vocab and comprehension development through using the post-reading activities provided within each story. An addition to the Level 4 readers are the wide range of pre-reading activities that can be used to help set the purpose for reading.\n\nKey Features:\n•\tlisten to each story being read to them using the audio function\n•\tuse each book to practice reading independently \n•\ttap each word to hear the sounds and the word if support is needed\n•\ttap to turn each page for individual reading pace\n•\tall Australian themes and characters\nbeautifully illustrated with detail for engagement and enjoyment"

Little Learners 5 teaches children to read words with -ck. \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen. \n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n• tap on a word to hear it being read \n\n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nThese five books use all the sounds of the initial alphabetic code.  There are NO tricks as children use their phonic skills to read.   \nThese books are audio enhanced – tap on a word to have it read aloud. \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 5 introduces –ck consonant digraph.   These fun stories about Pip and Tim provide practice in reading words with ‘ck’.  There are new Heart words in each story as shown on the last page of each book.   Children love the quirky stories and they are confident that there are NO tricks in the books.  Great way to build reading confidence. \n\n• The Fan-tas-tic Snack\n• The Pip and Tim Zoo\n• The Best Stuff\n• A Bag of Junk\n• Splat!"

Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures.   \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen. \n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n• tap on a word to hear it being read \n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 2\n• Pip\n• Tim and the van\n• At the dam\n• My hat\n• Sam in the pit\n\nThe Stage 2 books include sounds introduced in Stage 1 - s m, s, f, a, p, t, c, i  plus new sounds b, h, n, o, d, g, l v.

      "label": "**The Zones of Regulation is a recipient of the prestigious Mom’s Choice Award\n**Seen on The History Channel & Bio Network\n\nThe Zones of Regulation (www.zonesofregulation.com) is a framework for thinking as well as a curriculum geared toward helping students gain skills in consciously regulating their behaviors, including the management of their emotions and level of alertness. This, in turn, leads to increased self-control and problem solving abilities.  \n\nIntroducing the new Zones Picture Studio!  Team up and learn emotional awareness by taking pictures with your device. Scenarios are presented to students providing them the opportunity to reflect on how the scenario would make their body feel. Thinking about the cues from their body and brain, students use the app to capture what the feeling looks like on them, gaining insights on the physiological cues that accompany emotions. All pictures will be taken with your device's camera, stored on your device, and displayed directly in the app for easy review. Students can even create their own scenarios. The new Zones Picture Studio offers hours upon hours of fun and education. \n\nLeah Kuypers is the author of the book, The Zones of Regulation (2011, Social Thinking Publishing).  The Zones of Regulation was featured as a promising practice in Attention Magazine and is being implemented school wide in districts across the United States and Canada.\n\nThe Zones assists students in conceptualizing how they are feeling by creating a system to categorize their emotions and levels of alertness into one of four zones.  Using a cognitive behavior approach, the App's learning activities are designed to help students recognize when they are in different zones, with each of the four zones represented by a different color.  \n\nThe Zones is designed to be used with elementary students, secondary students, and adults.  \n\nThroughout the App, students learn how to use strategies or tools to manage their feelings and behaviors in each zone.  Given each student's needs and preferences are unique, students explore various calming techniques, cognitive strategies, and sensory supports, building a toolbox of methods to use to regulate and move between zones.  \n\nHowever, self-regulation takes a lot more than knowing about tools.  To deepen students' understanding of how to self-regulate, the App also explores how triggers or different events can impact how they are feeling.  \n\nThe App highlights how to read others' facial expressions and recognize a broader range of emotions and perspectives about how others see and react to their behavior, insight into events that trigger their different zones, and when and how to use tools and problem solving skills to change the way they are thinking and feeling.\n\nThe App provides a fun, and engaging experience while learning and gaining valuable knowledge to assist in developing real-life skills.  Students will be taken on an adventure throughout a town filled with excitement, rewards, and mini games.  \n\nTo enhance learning, it is recommended that an adult closely monitor the student's progression through the App, asking probing questions and facilitating discussions about how the App's content can be generalized to the student's real life.  The content of the App can be further explored using the lessons and learning activities featured in the curriculum book, The Zones of Regulation.\n\nDownload The Zones of Regulation today!"

      "label": "Little Learners Love Literacy® is a sequenced phonics reading program to give children confidence and success.  Letters and sounds are introduced in stages.  Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures.   \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen. \n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n• tap on a word to hear it being read \n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 4\n\n• At the fun run\n• Mud\n• In the log hut\n• On the bus\n• The big red box\n\nStage 4  sounds include the initial alphabetic code – a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p qu r s t u v w x y z\nNew Heart words : he to was we she\n\nThese five books use all the sounds of the initial alphabetic code.  There are NO tricks as children use their phonic skills to read.   \nThese books are audio enhanced – tap on a word to have it read aloud."

The milestones covered in the app start at age 18 months and now go up to age 5! \n\n\r\nThese milestones are the notorious “stages” or “phases” that children go through. These are those times when children “act up,” but it’s because new skills are emerging. This work documents both what the irritating behavior is and what the new skills are. Simply enter your child’s due date into the app, and a calendar is generated with their expected developmental milestones. Simply click on any colored date and get instant information about your child! Add as many children as you want. \r\n\nThe app currently offers the milestones, whereas the Observant Mom website and book series, Misbehavior is Growth, offers parenting tips and tricks for the milestones. Current work for older milestones (age 5+) can also be found at the website, The Observant Mom. \n\n\nAbout the App:\n\n\nØ  Click on any colored date and instantly find out what developmental milestone your child is (or will be) in!\n\n\nØ  The milestones in the app currently go from eighteen months through age four, ending at four.\n\n\nØ  Older milestones will be added to the app as they are finalized.\n\n\nØ  Older milestones can still be found on the website.\n\n\nØ  You may add as many children as you want!\n\n\nCountless have said that this work helps them stay patient as a parent or caregiver. Be sure to share this information with family and friends. It’s not misbehavior: it’s growth!"

YOU can do it and it WILL be rewarding!\n\nIt can be difficult to learn signs accurately by looking at pictures or a diagram. With Baby's First Signs you will learn the first essential 29 signs using high quality, moving images demonstrating how to perform each sign. \n\nWe do not include \"filler\" signs that you are not likely to use (such as \"donkey\" or \"fireworks\"), that would just be noise and get in the way. Instead we focus on the signs that are practical and likely to be used most frequently!\n\nThis is at your finger tips in seconds, making it ideal to easily:\n- pull up a quick sign in the middle of a teachable moment\n    - (feeding, changing diaper, etc)\n- teach and share with grandparents so they can experience the joy of signing with baby\n- review and learn signs during quiet times in your favorite glider chair\n\nIt can be difficult to understand your  baby when they are frustrated  but can't yet vocalize what they want. Baby signing could help you to understand what your baby wants without them having the ability to speak. A less frustrated baby means a happier baby (and parent).\n\nBaby signing also supplements language development as it helps to naturally build richer understanding of concepts and language.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- High quality videos gifs demonstrating how to perform signs (with two different angles)\n- Save signs you want to teach baby in your favorites list so they are easy to pull up when you need them\n- Challenge yourself with our mini quiz!\n- Great tips and and suggestions to help you get the most out of signing with baby.\n- All signs are ASL variants, making it easy to scale up and learn more sign language in the future!\n\nJoin the army of parents that are already communicating with their babies and expanding their brain development!"

      "label": "\"This has gone from a great app to an awesome app with the new update. Thanks for listening to our feedback and doing these changes.\" - Customer review\n\"Brilliant - fun way to learn Victorian cursive. I have been waiting for an app like this - a fun way teach Victorian Modern Cursive, an app my special needs son enjoys playing with and learns as he goes.  He can even use a stylus to draw the letters and build the muscle memory in his hand, that can later be transferred to writing with a pencil or pen.  All children will benefit from this app, presenting learning writing in an exciting format, great guides to help learn where to start and stop letters, and great celebration pages to keep them interested and rewarded.  I like that you can use the word lists or make your own so then the app grows with the child into writing full words, not just letters.  I think I will be trying it out with my son's spelling lists too and double benefit - writing and spelling.  It is also great to be able to teach Aussie formats such as Victorian Modern Cursive....

This makes it easy for small children to start reading without delay.\n\nThe first five Readers each teach one basic vowel sound: a, e, i, o and u.  Repeated often, these vowels and many consonants become completely memorable.\n\nWithin Readers 1-10, special words like I, have, to, go, for…  are introduced – one  or two with each Reader.  Children quickly learn to read simple-sounding words wherever they see them.\n\nReader 9 teaches the first digraph, oo as in roof.  Digraphs enable children, without further teaching, to sound out whole families of words – including many they have never seen before.\n\nBy Reader 10, children are already reading simple sentences with fluency.\n\nThere are several sounding-out options available. All speech is high-quality recording. The interface is designed for young fingers and can be used by the student alone or with a tutor."

Fun for kids and adults alike and plenty of challenges at all levels.\n\n*Dinosaur Chess  by Mls968\nThis is a great program. The lessons are interesting, and play levels go from easy to difficult. My 4 and 6 year olds are learning the game, and it's helping novice players like my wife and I too. Highly recommended to anyone who wants to introduce their children to chess!\n\n*An excellent app   by Adg6\nA wonderful app. Ideal for anyone new to chess. It is even fun for experienced chess players.\n\n*Highly Recommended - by doled \n\"This is a fantastic chess teaching game. This game alone makes it worth buying an iPad. My three year old now knows the piece names and basic moves. My six year old is well on her way to playing a full game. Our family has had an iPad since the day the iPad was released and this is one of the best apps we have.\"\n\n*Great! - by TonySchleizer\n\"This game has gotten my 5 year old interested in chess. Great tutorials that get progressively harder as skills improve.\"\n\n\n* Great for getting started - by Milfordthelargebonedgorilla\n\"This has been fantastic for my five year old son...using this in addition to a real board and pieces has helped him immensely in understanding each of the pieces, how they move, their strengths and weaknesses...a terrific way to introduce young ones to the game without overwhelming them\"\n\n\n* Great learning tool - by Triplescoop \n\"I have an adopted 7 year old boy with fetal alcohol syndrome. It is very hard for him to learn to play games. Checkers was very hard for him to learn. I thought that chess would be something that he would have to wait to learn. I bought this app even though there were no reviews. So glad I did! What a great teaching tool! I love the mini games that teach the directions that each piece can move. We play slowly but my son can play chess! I recommend this for anyone who wants to learn the basics of the game. This app is for beginners. Great for kids! Thank you to the developers of this app!\"\n\n\n*Super! - by Chess player\n\"Hats off to the developers. A fun program for kids.\"\n\n\n*Ideal For kids - by Kingkot \n\"This game is ideal to teach the kids in the chess.\""

      "label": "This colorful, educational social skills App for the iPhone®, iPad®, and iPod touch® has all 56 illustrated picture flash cards (plus audio of each card text) from the How Would You Feel If ... Fun Deck® by Super Duper® Publications. Select the cards you want students to see, and have them discuss their feelings about a variety of situations. The prompts include questions like, “How would you feel if … you forgot to study for your spelling test?” and “How would you feel if … your favorite football team lost?”\n\nThis App is simple to use — each student looks at an illustration, and either reads the prompt or touches the screen to listen to the prompt. The student then gives a verbal response. After each answer, tap the green (correct) or red (incorrect) button to score the student’s verbal response. Move to the next card by sliding the card currently on the display screen to the side. To move to the next player, tap the bar at the top of the screen and select a name. You can also advance cards and players automatically by selecting the Auto-Advance option in the Game Options menu. You can leave a game temporarily and return to it later by selecting Pause Game from the menu. To return to the game, select Continue Game from the main menu. When you finish, view the results in a graph, and print or email your data.\n\nHow Would You Feel If ... Fun Deck® App lets you: \n• Use the app in portrait or landscape orientation. \n• Select all 56 cards or just the ones you want students to see. \n• Track correct and incorrect responses for an unlimited number of players. \n• Advance players and cards manually or automatically.\n• Receive feedback for incorrect and/or correct responses\n• Discontinue game play and continue at any time.\n• View results in a graph and see which questions a player missed during a session.\n• Print, E-mail and share your results."

      "label": "Everybody likes a visual reinforcement system. Using this app, you can let someone know what he’s working for, how much work he needs to do, and how close he is to earning a reward for that work. You can use this for lessons in school, chores at home, getting your children to eat their vegetables, and much more! Start the app by selecting the number of tokens (1-5) your student must earn. Then set up your student's reinforcer choice board by selecting 1-6 items from our pre-loaded symbol library or your own photo library. To delete a picture from the teacher choice screen just press down on an image for 5 seconds. Show the choice board to your student to select what to work for and then begin your lesson. Each time a student earns a token, slide a token to the empty dot. Once the student has earned all of his tokens, push the \"cash in\" button to show your student what he's earned! The token board resets to start the next deal or you can create a new choice board for your student to select a new reinforcer.\n\nThis app is now available in American English and Brazilian Portuguese. To enable Brazilian Portuguese please make sure your Apple device is set to use Portuguese as its main language via Settings->General->International.\n\nVisit www.pecs.com for more information on using visual reinforcement systems.\n\nFeature Summary\n•Select number of tokens for each deal (1-5)\n•Customize student choice board to include up to 6 images selected from preloaded images or images in your photo library\n•Bright token board to contrast with materials on student's desktop\n•Token board shows student what he's working for, how many tokens he needs, his progress in the deal.\n•Student \"cashes in\" at end of deal by pushing button.

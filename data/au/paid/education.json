      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures.   \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen.\n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n•tap on a word to hear it being read \n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 1\n\n• Sam, Pip, Tim\n• I am Tim\n• My cat Tip\n• The map\n• Sam is it!\n\nChildren can read these books once they know the letters and sounds for m, s, f, a, p, t, c, i.   The books are decodable with some Heart words – the The My my I.  Heart words are words that children need to learn by heart as they cannot ‘decode or sound out” at this stage. There are NO tricks in our Little Learner books.  The books are enhanced with audio – tap on a word to have it read aloud."

      "label": "The Baby Sensory Signbook app teaches you all signs you need, so you and your baby can start communication and language development. Learn to communicate long before the development of speech, using our simple Babysigns.\n\n\nFEATURES \n- All official Baby Sensory baby signs right in your pocket.\n- Find a sign in 3 simple steps with the easy interface.\n- Make a list of favourites, for the signs you're learning.\n- Learn 'Say Hello' and 4 other songs' signs with music.\n- Looping videos, so you can easily see how it’s done.\n- Slow down the video, to better view the hand shapes.\n\n\nABOUT THE APP\nWith the Baby Sensory app, you can easily learn all official signs to make early communication possible. This creates a stronger parent-child bond and stimulates early language development.\nEven the youngest baby wants to tell you what they need and how they feel. But they’re unable to express themselves verbally and may cry if their needs are not met. Signing helps your baby to express his or her needs and takes the guesswork out of parenting.\n\n\nABOUT US\nBaby Sensory was the first baby programme to offer a complete approach to learning and development from birth to 13 months. Designed to stimulate, educate and provide precious memories during the all-important first years of life, the programme has won multiple awards both nationally and internationally since 2008. Everything we do is backed by over 35 years of expert research in childhood development. \n\n\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the app, please let us know. Send us a message or see www.babysensory.com for more info.\n\n\nCONTACT\nWebsite: www.babysensory.com\nMail: apps@babysensory.com\n\n\n\nWe are super excited to hear what you think of our little app!\nSend your thoughts and tips to: apps@babysensory.com\n\nLike and follow us to stay up to date on future updates:\nwww.facebook.com/BabySensoryUK\nwww.twitter.com/BabySensoryHQ"

      "label": "Little Learners Love Literacy® is a sequenced phonics reading program designed to \ngive children confidence and success.  Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books \nwith real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures. \n\nStage 6 focuses on the graphemes - ck, sh, ch, th, ng. \n\nIt also introduces a new recording feature that allows children to record and \nhear themselves read. This is an important step in developing fluency, as it gives \nchildren a reason to reread and record.  Fluency is an important literacy skill \nrequiring accuracy and comprehension. \n\nStages 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5 have professionally recorded and produced audio.  However, \nStages Plus 4, 6, & 7 allow children to read and record themselves.  Children are now \nmore confident readers and will benefit from this new recording feature. They will \nenjoy checking their accuracy by following the words in the book. \n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions. \nAll words, except the Heart words, can be ‘sounded out’. To do this, children point to \neach letter or grapheme, saying the sounds then blending the sounds together to \nread the word. \n\n\nThere are NO tricks in the Little Learner books.\n\nNote: Please make sure to enable the microphone on your device when asked or you will not be able to record anything. Also make sure your device is not set to mute to hear the audio back."

      "label": "Designed by an Occupational Therapist.\nFirst & Then is a very simple app that uses a board with photos to show that one activity must happen before the next can occur. A fantastic tool for visual learners! \n\nThe idea behind a First & Then board is to encourage a child to complete an activity that they don’t particularly enjoy. The board motivates the child to engage in a less preferred activity, knowing that a preferred activity (or a reward) will follow. For example, the ‘first’ activity may be something such as handwriting, homework, eating vegetables, using the toilet or visiting the dentist. The ‘then’ activity may be playing outside, computer time or a chocolate treat. \n\nThe App is extremely simple to use, the board is set up from one page, with clear prompts to help along the way. \n\nThe app allows the user to quickly and simply insert photos from the device’s camera or photo library, meaning that ‘First & Then’ boards can be made on-the-go and with little fuss.  Photos taken are saved within the App to use again and again.\n\nThe app includes a coloured visual timer, that the user can choose to use, to show the child how long they need to spend on an activity. As well as a digital display, the time is also represented by a coloured pie chart. When the pie is green, the child needs to keep going. When the pie turns amber, the child needs to get ready to finish. The pie turns red when it is time to stop the activity.\n\nThe app also includes a ‘Finished box’. The child can drag the photo into this box when the activity is completed. \n\nThe App is complete with the option to use exciting tones to reward the child for completing the activity."

      "label": "The Choiceworks Calendar is a powerful picture-based learning tool that helps children learn what is happening day-to-day, week-to-week, and month-to-month throughout each year. Choiceworks Calendar teaches the abstract concept of time in a structured visual format which helps children organize their lives as well as understand sequence and time. Choiceworks Calendar is the first app of its kind to provide a full-featured calendar designed with both the child and caregiver in mind.\n\nKey Features \n\n■ Easily create a visual calendar of upcoming events in a few minutes (examples: holidays, when visitors are coming, doctor appointments, vacations, sleepovers, parent returning from a trip or military duty)\n■ Image Library preloaded with over 275 images and audio\n■ Attach video to any image\n■ Add your own images using your photo library, camera or use the preloaded image library to record your own audio, video and edit captions for limitless customizability \n■ Create multiple personalized calendars for use with multiple children or in a classroom setting\n■ Count Days Until: animated counter for the number of days until an upcoming event (example: How many days until my birthday?)\n■ Speaks the daily schedule with child or adult voice \n■ Built-in visual timer\n■ Automatically adds holidays\n■ Easily add reoccurring events\n■ Notifications and alarms with visual and audio alerts\n■ Search and auto-save features\n■ Share boards by Email, AirDrop, Files app or iTunes with other Choiceworks Calendar app users \n■ Ability to print month, week or day for offline viewing or save as PDF\n\nMethodology\n\nVisual supports are highly effective, proven tools for improving communication between children and caregivers.  Calendars are challenging for children to grasp initially due to the abstract concept of time, months, weeks and days.  They are also time consuming for caregivers to setup and maintain.  Choiceworks Calendar addresses all of these challenges.  For caregivers, it provides a streamlined interface for creating, customizing, sharing and maintaining a calendar of upcoming events.  For the child, it provides visual, audio and video supports that make using the calendar an enjoyable learning experience.\n\nChildren gain independence and personal responsibility by seeing helpful information such as which days are school days and which days are not.  They also benefit by being informed of upcoming events such as a doctor’s appointment or celebrating a birthday. This clear, simple support provided ahead of time can help a child predict what is going to happen, thereby reducing anxiety.  It helps children understand when there is a change in the routine so they can learn to adapt, become more flexible and better behaved. The information is always visible on the calendar and the child can refer to it as often as needed. \n\nHelpful Tips\n\nSimple:  When first implementing Choiceworks Calendar, the calendar should be kept simple and be geared toward the child. By reviewing the calendar each day, the child will learn the days of the week, rote counting, number identification and components of the daily, weekly, and monthly schedule.\nVisuals:  Put images or videos on the calendar that describe the most important activities of the day. Again, keep it simple. Only include what is important for the child on the calendar.  Start small and gradually increase the amount of information presented as the child begins to understand the passage of time.\nAdvance: As success with Choiceworks Calendar increases, visually plan out big projects and indicate deadlines for science projects, writing assignments, etc.  Chunk larger projects into smaller, manageable steps that the child can complete each day.  This will focus attention to the current task and lessen anxiety and distraction to other portions of project. \nHave your own tips or ideas?  Visit our Facebook page and share with the Choiceworks community: https://www.facebook.com/ChoiceworksAndChoiceworksCalendarApps/"

      "label": "Даже если ваш ребенок только начинает учиться читать и первый раз видит буквы. Или если ваш ребенок знает буквы и перед вами стоит задача объяснить ему, как их превратить в слова. Или у вас уже почти читающий дошкольник, которому надо подтянуть и закрепить навык. Во всех этих случаях вам подойдет ЧИТАНИЯ.\n\nПотому что это увлекательное путешествие героев по волшебной стране, с приключениями и миссией – спасти ее от злого волшебника. А справится с ним сможет тот, кто умеет читать!Ребенку интересно играть и проживать эту историю. Вместе с вовлекающим сюжетом в приложение встроен весь необходимый для освоения чтения материал. Начиная от букв до чтения фраз – все есть в ЧИТАНИИ.\n \nЗа время игры ребенок увидит, услышит и напишет:\n● более 500 иллюстрированных и озвученных слов \n● прочитает и отгадает 65 загадок\n● прочитает 68 поговорок\n● сыграет в 35 игр, развивающих различные навыки чтения \n● пройдет 30 тематических экранов долины Слов с разными уровнями сложности\n● начертит буквы 330 и более раз (печатный и прописной вариант)\n\nВы уже пробовали учить ребенка читать? Если да, тогда вы знаете, как это трудно. Ребенок путает буквы и звуки. Не может прочитать слово, хотя знает буквы, не может прочитать фразу, не понимает смысла.Теряет интерес...\nДля усвоения нужна тренировка. Именно этим занимается ваш ребенок в ЧИТАНИИ. Каждая из 35 мини-игр доводит нужный навык до автоматизма, а интересный сюжет способствует тому, что ребенок снова и снова возвращается в ЧИТАНИЮ и играет на новых, более сложных уровнях.\n\nВ ЧИТАНИИ 5 локаций – буквы, письмо, склады и «автоматизация чтения» – беглое чтение слов, фраз. Информация подана всеми возможными для восприятия способами – визуальным, аудиальным, игровым. Ребенок запоминает увиденное, развивает внимательность и наблюдательность. Улучшает речь за счет развития фонематического слуха и складового написания слов.\n\nОдна из трудностей у детей, когда они учатся читать – слияние букв в слова. Это объяснено в приложении анимацией и игрой. \n\nВ ЧИТАНИИ используется складовая методика обучения чтению (кубики Зайцева). Ее особенность в том, что ребенок быстро начинает читать, запоминая структурные единицы слов – склады. Чтение по складам отрабатывается в ЧИТАНИИ в локации «город Складов»\n\nПосле того, как ребенок освоил буквы и склады, важно как можно больше читать. Практика важна каждый день. В ЧИТАНИИ ребенок читает постоянно, начиная с простых слов. Постепенно сложность увеличивается, но ребенок прочтет все 500 слов, распределенных по темам и заданиям. Кроме обязательного материала, для прочтения в игре доступно более 3000 слов.\n\nЧИТАНИЯ – игра длительного прохождения. Обычно путь ребенка к вершине чтения и победе над злым волшебником занимает от месяца до года. У каждого ребенка свой путь и время. Не торопите события, лучше понаблюдайте, как он проходит игру. Порадуйтесь его успехам!\n\nУникальный обучающий алгоритм ЧИТАНИИ анализирует успехи ребенка, подбирает подходящий уровень заданий и игр. Поэтому, хотя оптимальный возраст для игры 4-6 лет, многие задания будут по силам даже трехлетнему малышу, который только начинает учиться читать, и заинтересуют семилетнего, кому надо подтянуть чтение перед школой. Для продвинутого уровня в настройках можно открыть сразу все разделы игры.\n \nПриложение без встроенных покупок, рекламы и не требует постоянного подключения к Интернету.\n \n● ЧИТАНИЯ - победитель Всероссийского конкурса «Позитивный контент» 2018 г. в номинации «лучшее мобильное приложение»,\n● По заключению Роскачества, ЧИТАНИЯ — лучшая образовательная игра, которая учит чтению, среди всех исследованных приложений на платформе iOS\n● №1 в обзоре SE7EN «5 лучших приложений из App Store для обучения дошкольника чтению»,\n● вошла в топ лучших iOS приложений, публикуемый журналом Лайфхакер.\n\nПрошла пора, когда ребенка надо было заставлять учиться читать. Когда вы придумывали, как же заинтересовать его. \nЧИТАНИЯ увлечет вашего ребенка сказочным сюжетом и научит его читать так, что он полюбит чтение. Попробуйте!"

There are 166 different game modes of varying difficulty so it is useful throughout grades K-5. Answer as many questions as possible in minute-long games, or you can now practice without the pressure of a countdown timer - a feature which is new for 2019. Questions are randomly generated which means it is very replayable. The game has been carefully designed for children, with large, widely spaced buttons. We recommend that young children play on a tablet.\n\nSix main topics are covered: \n\n* Times tables - up to 10 or 12 \n* Division - up to 10 or 12\n* Square numbers\n* Number bonds\n* Doubling \n* Halving\n\nBetween these topics, the four standard arithmetic operations are covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nYou can create up to 30 player profiles per device to track an individual's high scores (increased from 15 in 2019). If you prefer there's also the option to play as a guest. All data is stored locally on your device so you don't have to worry about privacy issues. We've also made it very easy for children to quickly switch between profiles after playing a game, if they're sharing a device.\n\nAfter each game, the score achieved is displayed along with the child's high score. Bronze, silver or gold stars and trophies are awarded depending on the score achieved in each game."

Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books \nwith real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures. \n\nStage 7 Unit 2  introduces and practises the vowel graphemes - ar or er ir ur air.\n\nIt also introduces a new recording feature that allows children to record and \nhear themselves read. This is an important step in developing fluency, as it gives \nchildren a reason to reread and record.  Fluency is an important literacy skill \nrequiring accuracy and comprehension. \n\nStages 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5 have professionally recorded and produced audio.  However, \nStages Plus 4, 6, & 7 allow children to read and record themselves.  Children are now more confident readers and will benefit from this new recording feature. They will enjoy checking their accuracy by following the words in the book and listening to themselves read.\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions. \nAll words, except the Heart words, can be decoded or ‘sounded out’. To do this, children point to each letter or grapheme, saying the sounds then blend the sounds together to read the word. \n\nThere are NO tricks in the Little Learner books.\n\nNote: Please make sure to enable the microphone on your device when asked or you will not be able to record anything. Also make sure your device is not set to mute to hear the audio back."

      "label": "The Choiceworks app is an essential learning tool that helps children complete daily routines (morning, day, & night), understand & manage feelings and improve waiting skills (taking turns and not interrupting).  Choiceworks is designed for caregivers to provide clear and consistent support to foster a child’s independence, positive behavior, and emotional regulation at home and in the community. It can also be customized for teachers in a school setting. \n \nKey features included with Choiceworks:\n■ Full, unlimited access to all four board types: Schedule, Waiting, Feelings and Feelings Scale\n■ Image Library preloaded with over 180 images and audio \n■ Add your own images and record your own audio for limitless customizability \n■ Attach video to any board image\n■ Easily create profiles to personalize and manage multiple users\n■ Save an unlimited number of boards for multiple children or different routines \n■ Speaks boards out loud with child or adult voice\n■ Share boards by Email, Files app or iTunes with other Choiceworks app users \n■ Ability to print boards or save as PDF\n\nAdditional features included with Choiceworks+ (Early Access):\n■ Synchronize across all your devices\n■ Advanced sharing options\n■ Custom themes\n■ Library Assistant\n■ Custom timer sounds\n\nWhat do you get with Choiceworks and Choiceworks+?\nWith your Choiceworks purchase you get access to all the features that have made it an award winning support app used in classrooms and homes around the globe for over a decade. No additional in-app purchase or subscriptions are required and there are no limits to how many boards or images you can create and share.\n\nIf you subscribe to Choiceworks+, you will get additional time saving data management features and customization options that further enhance your experience.

If you are in a school or business setting, check with your IT administrator for any restrictions before you subscribe.\n\nSchedule Board \nThe Schedule Board makes task completion easier and more fun! The schedule is paired with an ‘all done’ column to check off steps toward a motivating reward. Timers can be added to any task or activity. The schedules are easy to edit and fully customizable. Once you have created a schedule, it will be saved automatically.\n\nWaiting Board \nThe Waiting Board teaches waiting skills like taking turns and not interrupting. The user can begin by reading the companion book, When Do I Have to Wait? Using the waiting board, the top picture indicates the reason why the child is waiting and a timer can be set to show how long the child will wait. The child can then choose an activity to do while waiting. \n\nFeelings Board \nThe Feelings Board provides a tool for helping children understand and express emotions. The user can begin by reading the companion book, When I Get Upset, to provide an example of how the child might recognize an emotion and choose a coping strategy. On the Feelings Board, the user can then help the child indicate how they are feeling from a range of options, select a coping strategy, and then request an activity to help them feel better or re-engage with others. \n\nFeelings Scale\nHelps users identify, manage and cope with feelings across environments throughout the day. By tracking their feelings on the board, users can analyze the data for trends to learn if tasks done at different times of day or in different environments affect outcome. Environments and schedules can then be altered to achieve better results.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.beevisual.com/mobile-app-eula.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.beevisual.com/mobile-app-privacy.html"

      "label": "Little Learners Love Literacy® is a sequenced phonics reading program to give children confidence and success.  Letters and sounds are introduced in stages.  Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures.   \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen. \n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n• tap on a word to hear it being read \n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 2\n• Pip\n• Tim and the van\n• At the dam\n• My hat\n• Sam in the pit\n\nThe Stage 2 books include sounds introduced in Stage 1 - s m, s, f, a, p, t, c, i  plus new sounds b, h, n, o, d, g, l v.   There are NO tricks in Stage 2 books.  Revises Heart words from Stage 1. \nThese books are enhanced with audio – tap on a word to have it read aloud."

      "label": "The Fitzroy Readers is a set of graded books which employ the Fitzroy Method - a phonic approach to reading developed over the last 3 decades.\n\nThe first Reader, A Fat Cat, uses only 13 letters. This makes it easy for small children to start reading without delay.\n\nThe first five Readers each teach one basic vowel sound: a, e, i, o and u.  Repeated often, these vowels and many consonants become completely memorable.\n\nWithin Readers 1-10, special words like I, have, to, go, for…  are introduced – one  or two with each Reader.  Children quickly learn to read simple-sounding words wherever they see them.\n\nReader 9 teaches the first digraph, oo as in roof.  Digraphs enable children, without further teaching, to sound out whole families of words – including many they have never seen before.\n\nBy Reader 10, children are already reading simple sentences with fluency.\n\nThere are several sounding-out options available. All speech is high-quality recording. The interface is designed for young fingers and can be used by the student alone or with a tutor."

      "label": "Welcome aboard your rocket ship to the next level of Japanese.\n\nHuman Japanese Intermediate is packed with content and features that will take your Japanese language skills to the next level. If you liked the first HJ, you'll love Intermediate. (And if you're new to Human Japanese, welcome aboard! Find a full list of content by chapter at www.humanjapanese.com/intermediate.)\n\nIn Human Japanese Intermediate, you'll find:\n\n- More than 40 illuminating chapters\n- Over 2600 example sentences and dialogs with crystal-clear recordings of male and female speech\n- Kanji animations, tips, illustrations, and more\n- Photos and cultural notes to keep you engaged and energized\n- Intelligent quizzes that track your history and help you focus on trouble spots\n- INGREDIENTS™ example sentence breakdowns for total clarity in every example\n\nLike its predecessor, Human Japanese Intermediate is built on the idea that the best way to learn and truly comprehend Japanese is to have it explained by someone who speaks your language. Core concepts are explained in a friendly, down-to-earth tone, with frequent comparisons to similar aspects of English. With humor and warmth, it demystifies and illuminates the real nuts-and-bolts of the language--not just vocabulary and canned phrases like many other products.\n\nExplanations come alive with deeply interwoven interactive example sentences--more than 2600 in total--so that you can immediately see and hear exactly what you're learning.\n\nStay on track with an exciting new patent-pending feature called INGREDIENTS™ example sentence breakdowns. Next to every sentence is an icon that provides an instantaneous, simultaneous lookup of every word in the sentence, even conjugated forms! That means you'll never lose your flow in the middle of an interesting discussion just because you've momentarily forgotten the meaning of a word.\n\nKANJI\nHuman Japanese Intermediate also gets into kanji in a big way. At the end of most chapters, a new batch of kanji is introduced, with animations of each character, plus example sentences, illustrations, writing tips, and more. Our goal is not to simply throw a bag of characters in your lap, but to carefully explain how everything works.\n\nTo this end, Human Japanese Intermediate keeps track of which kanji you've learned at what point in the text and automatically adjusts the \"spelling\" of words in example sentences as appropriate to your current knowledge. So early on, you might encounter the following sentence:\n\nそのひとの　なまえを　しらない。\n\nBut later, after you've met several of kanji used in these words, the version you would see is:\n\nその人の　名前を　知らない。\n\nThis approach removes the most overwhelming aspect of learning kanji--the fact that most sentences contain many characters you don't yet know--and that helps you to stay focused and energized.\n\nQUIZZES\nStay sharp with five different kinds of quizzes: chapter reviews, vocab, conjugation, kanji stroke order, and kanji flashcard.\n\nQuizzes keep track of which questions you get right and wrong, to help you concentrate on your trouble spots.\n\nAnd when you get a question wrong, it's not simply \"Try again.\" Wherever possible, the quiz provides a hint that is specific to that question, to help you remember and learn.\n\nPHOTOS AND CULTURAL NOTES\nWe've packed Human Japanese with hundreds of photos, illustrations, and cultural asides to keep you interested and energized. You'll find tours of hotels, train stations, convenience stores, supermarkets, kissaten (coffee shops), temples, and more.\n\nLEARN JAPANESE WITH US\nWe care deeply about helping you to grow in your understanding of Japanese. Whether you've worked through the original Human Japanese app or have come from a different background, it will be our pleasure and privilege to be your guide on the next stage of your journey. Hajimemashou!"

Instead of a hat and scraps of paper, the user enters his friends' names in his iPhone and gives it a shake. The screen will then display a random set of color-coded teams. These teams can immediately be used for game play or shared via facebook or email.   The quick and easy selection of random (or balanced) teams eliminates fighting over who will be on which team. Innovative use of the iPhone shake gesture gives users the satisfying feeling of shaking a virtual hat without the trouble of carrying around an actual hat. Conventional buttons can also be used for those who would rather not shake their expensive hardware about.  \n\nThe app is designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind. Names can easily be entered with the onscreen keyboard, chosen from the user's contacts, or imported from a file. The email and facebook functions document the members of each individual team as well as preserving the team number and color assigned by the app. For repeated use of Team Shake, lists of friends can be easily saved and loaded later. The current list is also automatically saved so that if you exit the app, or even reboot the device, changes will not be lost. For teachers and others with large lists of people, Team Shake supports the ability to import teams from text or csv files.\n\nIf you have any problems, feature requests, or comments please send an email to support@rhine-o.com. \n\nFeatures:\n\n* Create 1 to 64 random teams\n* Create completely random or balanced teams\n* Full iPad support\n* Eliminates fighting over choosing teams\n* Share / Save teams via email or Facebook\n* Teams can be chosen by the number of teams or by the size of teams.\n* Save lists of friends for later games\n* Import lists from email or spreadsheet\n* Export lists and options for use on another device\n* Satisfying feeling of shaking a “virtual” hat to create teams\n* Animated shaking hat\n* Entry of names via onscreen keyboard\n* Entry of names via iPhone contacts\n* Temporarily disable people who are absent\n* Set groups of people to always be on the same team\n* Set groups of people to always be on different teams\n* Set user strength to make more even teams (now supports fully balanced teams)\n* 5 users strengths level\n* Pick a single random person from the list of players\n* User strength indicator on the main screen (can be disabled in options)\n* Number of active players and total players is now displayed on the main screen\n* Video Out Support\n* Option to Sort Teams by Name\n* Option to balance male / female team members\n* \"Equal Ability\" option to create teams where all players have the same strength\n* Option to create separate male and female teams\n* Configurable Team Colors\n* Configurable Team Names\n* Print Support\n* Export Teams in CSV or XLS Format\n* Team Shake now supports simultaneously assigning players to multiple subteams and / or oppose teams at the same time.\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now have customized names to make selection easier\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now be enabled or disabled globally so that teams can be made quickly without subteams / oppose teams.  In particular, Balance Teams Strengths will work when separate Male / Female teams are created.\n\nYappler-Tags: Teams, Groups, Random, Hat, Entertainment, Games, Utilities"

      "label": "Little Learners Love Literacy® is a sequenced phonics reading program designed to \ngive children confidence and success.  Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books \nwith real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures. \n\nStage 7 Unit 1 introduces the vowel graphemes ai, ay, ee, ea, igh, ie, oa.\n\nIt also introduces a new recording feature that allows children to record and \nhear themselves read. This is an important step in developing fluency, as it gives \nchildren a reason to reread and record.  Fluency is an important literacy skill \nrequiring accuracy and comprehension. \n\nStages 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5 have professionally recorded and produced audio.  However, \nStages Plus 4, 6, & 7 allow children to read and record themselves.  Children are now \nmore confident readers and will benefit from this new recording feature. They will \nenjoy checking their accuracy by following the words in the book. \n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions. \nAll words, except the Heart words, can be ‘sounded out’. To do this, children point to \neach letter or grapheme, saying the sounds then blending the sounds together to \nread the word. \n\n\nThere are NO tricks in the Little Learner books.\n\nNote: Please make sure to enable the microphone on your device when asked or you will not be able to record anything. Also make sure your device is not set to mute to hear the audio back."

Its going tibia ok, the Skelly app is just what you need! With the Skelly app you can literally pull the inspiration you need right out of your pocket anywhere, anytime!\n\nSkelly is a fully poseable, anatomically correct reference skeleton for artists. A simplified version of the skeleton is also included, named “Robo-Skelly”. These figures were created to make the study of anatomy easier and more enjoyable for students and professionals without leaving your wallets bone dry. They can also be used to inspire poses for drawing, painting, sculpting, illustration, animation, comics, manga, storyboarding, twerking, and to fully understand the anatomy of the human skeleton. No need for super gluteus, Skelly comes pre-assembled and ready to pose as soon as you launch the app! \n\nLearning the structure of the human body is the skeleton key to drawing the figure in an anatomically correct manner without having to clear your browser history to avoid awkward conversations with your loved ones. Whether you want to make works like Michelangelo or Miyazaki, Skelly will help you focus on your art and let you personalize his poses, rather than searching for reference material and hiring models. Learn to draw the skeleton from any angle without the inconvenient and morally questionable need to go grave robbing.\n\nFEATURES:\n \nAnatomically correct skeleton\nSimplified “Robo Skelly”\nProportions based on the teachings of Dr. Paul Richer\nSkull fits perfectly into a “Loomis Head” as taught by Andrew Loomis\nPoseable joints\nPose Library - choose from pre made poses and save your own\nMovable camera\nAdjustable light source\nChoose light or dark background\nReset to neutral “Anatomical Pose”\n\nPEOPLE LOVE IT:\n\nJames Gurney, author of ‘Color and Light’ and ‘Imaginative Realism’ Says:\n\n\"Bend him, twist him, contort him! The Skelly app lets you put a virtual human skeleton into any pose, and to see him from any angle, and in any lighting. It’s a great tool for art students or professionals wondering what the skeleton is really doing beneath a life pose, or for anyone wanting to visualize a pose from scratch. The interface is intuitive to learn and easy to use, without sacrificing any of the nuances of the human body’s complex range of movement. Skelly is a big improvement over the old wooden mannikin.\"\n\n- Chris Oatley, Director Of The Oatley Academy Of Visual Storytelling Says:\n\n\"Skelly is the fastest, most fluid anatomical reference I have ever seen. I was shocked at how easy it is to pose the figure and direct the light source. Finally! It’s the app visual artists have been waiting for.\"\n\nHave any questions? CONTACT US:\n\nskelly@proko.com"

This is an important step in developing fluency, as it gives \nchildren a reason to reread and record.  Fluency is an important literacy skill \nrequiring accuracy and comprehension. \n\nStages 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5 have professionally recorded and produced audio.  However, \nStages Plus 4, 6, & 7 allow children to read and record themselves.  Children are now \nmore confident readers and will benefit from this new recording feature. They will \nenjoy checking their accuracy by following the words in the book. \n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions. \nAll words, except the Heart words, can be ‘sounded out’. To do this, children point to \neach letter or grapheme, saying the sounds then blending the sounds together to \nread the word. \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage Plus 4:\n\nThe Little Vet\n\nSad Tip\n\n No Ned\n\n A Mud Picnic\n\nThe Big Wind Day\n\nThere are NO tricks in the Little Learner books.\n\nNote: Please make sure to enable the microphone on your device when asked or you will not be able to record anything.

The effectiveness of GraphoGame was studied in an efficacy trial funded by the Education Endowment Foundation and Wellcome Trust. To learn more about the study, visit our website!\n\nFEATURES:\n\n• Synthetic phonics training app utilising onset-rime analogy\n• In-game literacy analytics for tracking student progress & difficulties\n• Suitable for ages 6-9\n• Two game interfaces: Stars (for school use) and Adventure Map (for home use)\n• Engaging 3D graphics\n• Avatar creation & customisation\n• Works offline\n• NO ADVERTISEMENTS\n\nTESTIMONIALS:\n\n“I would definitely recommend the game . . . It's what's been lacking - a stretching programme for English and it does motivate them” – Primary school teacher \n\n“it's not reliant on adult support, it's easy to use as an intervention tool and you can monitor progress easily through it” – Primary school teacher\n\n“If there is a tricky word. . . we can chop it up into pieces and answer it” – Primary school student\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame icon © Grapho Group Oy, Ville Mönkkönen & Mika Halttunen"

Can you tell the difference between excitement and fear, or between aggression and the need to play?\r\n\r\nDog language can be confusing, but with the help of Dog Decoder, you’ll understand your dog’s signals like a pro.\r\n\r\nDog Decoder will teach you everything you need to know about how your dog communicates, so you can not only avoid bites, but share in a more satisfying, healthy, and loving relationship.\r\n\r\n=== MEET “DIAMOND” === \r\n\r\nDiamond is your tour guide and trainer. He will show you how he looks when he’s afraid, when he’s stressed, when he’s just about to bite, and when he wants to play. \r\n\r\n=== DOG POSTURES ===\r\n\r\nThere are about SIXTY different poses on display in Dog Decoder. Each pose is beautifully and expressively illustrated by one of the world’s top dog artists.\r\n\r\nEach pose comes with a diagram, pointing out where on Diamond’s body he’s indicating how he’s feeling. For example, in the poses for “fear,” the diagram will point out Diamond’s tucked tail, his ears pulled back, etc. We won’t just show you a picture of a scared dog — we’ll teach you what to look for, the signs of fear.\r\n\r\nEach pose also comes with a helpful description of the context. This is where you will learn about some common misconceptions, or what kinds of situations will cause your dog to assume each posture.\r\n\r\n=== TEST YOURSELF! ===\r\n\r\nThe best way to see how much you’ve learned is to take the quiz! Some of the quiz questions are pretty challenging. Diamond wants to make sure you don’t get fooled next time he’s hiding under the coffee table or drooling – will you recognize the early warning signs of stress? Will you be able to warn your children when your dog is clearly done playing?"

Crazy Gears is a new-aged digital puzzle game, designed with a real mechanical engine and with children's critical thinking skills in mind! Hours of fun guaranteed for everyone who is up for the challenge, yes, even you Mom & Dad!\n\n*** Children's Technology Review Awards 2015 ***\n*** Parent's Choice Gold Winner Fall 2015***\n*** App of the week by Fun2Tap ***\n*** Best of the Best by Best Apps For Kids ***\n*** Featured worldwide by App Store as a Best New App ***\n\n\nABOUT CRAZY GEARS\nExplore a captivating digital playground in this tantalizing puzzle game! Children manipulate gears, chains, rods, and pulleys, to pull themselves through each level, which teaches them how different mechanisms affect one another when constructing a machine. Each reasoning challenge was carefully designed to adhere to the theories of educational technology pioneer, mathematician, computer scientist, and designer of the first programming language for children, Seymour Papert.\n\n“The best use of games is to leverage their tendency to enhance learning”- Papert\nRecommended Ages 5-9 \n\nAs a child, Papert fell in love with gears. Their movement fascinated him in every way and inspired his career. Crazy Gears was conceived not only as a tribute to him, but with the hope of providing a child with the inspiration to discover and understand the physical properties of mechanisms found in their everyday lives. Such complex notions include tension, motion, and gravity. We achieve this by encouraging the child to manipulate the objects in each level to determine how they work together to accomplish a goal.  Interactions with technology give kids the power to construct their understanding of STEM/STEAM subjects in meaningful ways. Here we engage them in play that does just that!\n\n\nFEATURES\n• No rules\n• No explicit instructions \n• Kid-Friendly​ Design\n• Powerful Artificial Intelligence\n• Seamless Interaction\n• Multiple Language Support\n• Crash Resistant Design\n• Bold, bright colors\n• Automatic Memory\n• Special mode for children with CVI\n\nSTEM/STEAM TOPICS EXPLORED\n• Gears \n• Mechanical Systems (simple and complex) \n• Action and Reaction \n• Motion (circular, rotary, and reciprocating) \n• Ratios\n• Tension\n• Torque and Speed\n• Mechanical Advantage \n\nABOUT US\nEdoki Academy’s mission is to provide children with enjoyable early-learning activities using the latest technologies. Our team members, many of whom are young parents or teachers, strive to produce tools that motivate and inspire children to learn, play, and progress. \n\nPRIVACY\nWe take your child’s privacy very seriously, for this reason, we are proud to offer a product that is certified COPPA compliant by PRIVO. \n\nCONNECT WITH US!\nIf you have any support requests, comments, or questions do not hesitate to contact us at support@edokiacademy.com.

      "label": "\"I am going to start right off and tell you that I LOVE this app.\" (From the 5-star review by TheiPhonemom.com)\n\n#1 Recommended Motor Skill App Now Available for Preschoolers & Toddlers!\n\n^ Featured by Apple in Best New App/Education\n^ Featured by Apple in Best For Ages 5 & Under \n^ 2013 Editor's Choice Award Winner - Children's Technology Review\n^ Featured in the App Store: Sensory & Visual Perception Apps\n^ Rated 5 stars by TheiMum.com\n^ BestAppsForKids Editor's Choice Award Winner\n^ Editor's Favorite Award Winner - AppySmarts.com\n^ A Top Pick from FunEducationalApps.com\n^ Top 5 App of the Week - Childrens Technology Review\n^ App of the Month - A4CWSN.com\n^ Best 30 Apps of the Week - theguardian\n\nFrom the makers of award-winning Dexteria, Dexteria Jr. Lite is a set of hand and finger exercises to develop fine motor skills and handwriting readiness.  The activities (one activity is included with this free version of the app, and the other two are available via in-app purchase) are specially designed for kids age 2-6.  Happy characters, sprite animations, music, and sound effects all add up to a fun and engaging experience for toddlers and preschool-aged children.\n\nDexteria Jr.'s  unique hand and finger activities take full advantage of the iPad's multi-touch interface to help build strength, control, and dexterity. \n\nFor best results the exercises should be done on a regular basis in short sessions. The exercises are designed to be repeatable and engaging.\n\nThe automatic tracking and reporting feature makes it easy for parents, teachers and occupational therapists to identify time on task and progress. You can email the progress reports right from the app itself. We do not receive or collect the tracking data.\n\nMulti-user tracking is available as an in-app purchase. (Note to Volume Purchase Program customers: Consider buying Dexteria Jr. VPP instead. It includes multi-user tracking and you will pay a lower net cost than if you buy Dexteria Jr. and upgrade each copy via the in-app purchase. Just search \"Dexteria Jr. VPP\" in the app store.) \n\n• Increases coordination and motor control in the hands and fingers \n\n• Easy to use\n\n• Great way to get kids ready for kindergarten\n\n• Fun graphics, music, and sound effects\n\n• \"Quiet time\" mode turns off music and/or sound effects\n\n• Automatically creates performance and usage reports that can be emailed \n\n• Designed in consultation with Occupational Therapists \n\n• Less expensive and more reusable than workbooks\n\n• Multi-user reporting available via in-app purchase (iPad version only)\n\nWe're serious about your privacy. This app does not track or share your personal information with us or anyone else. There is no user id tracking software, and no advertisements.  \n\nATTENTION LICENSED OTs: Thank you for all the great feedback and suggestions!  This app was developed in response to your requests for a version of Dexteria designed specifically for the preschool audience.  Please let us know how we did, and as always, we will be guided by your comments.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nCheck out more fun developmental apps from BinaryLabs:\n\nLetterReflex - Prevents and improves letter reversals and backwards writing\n\nP.O.V. - Improve spatial reasoning skills, which in turn improve mathematics, navigation, and logic skills\n\nDexteria - Improve fine motor skills for ages K-Adult\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVisit us: www.dexteria.net\nView privacy policy: www.http://dexteria.net/privacy.php"

Say the word in the conjugated form indicated.\n(2) Tap the sound icon to check whether you said the conjugated form correctly.\n(3) Tap the ＊ icon to check the conjugated form in writing.\n(4) Study the use of the conjugated form by referring to the example sentence and illustration on the back side of the card.\n(5) Tap the Rule icon to see the conjugation rule.\n\nCheck: Test your retention of each conjugated form by typing in your answers.*\n(1) Type in the conjugated form as instructed.\n(2) If you entered the correct form, the card will be removed from MyDeck. Cards answered incorrectly or skipped will remain in the deck for further practice.\n*To study with the Check method, you will need to add a Japanese keyboard to your iPhone settings before starting.\n\nHandy features\n•Menu\nThe study selections are grouped together in a single menu to allow you to practice more efficiently. \n\n•List\nAll conjugation forms of each word are listed in this feature, with the words arranged in a-i-u-e-o order. A check mark is displayed next to each conjugation form that has been mastered and the MyDeck card for each entry can be opened, allowing you to review the conjugations via the list.\n\n•Rule\nThis feature lists the rules for all 28 conjugation types covered by the app, enabling you to quickly look up the way to form conjugations such as the passive, the causative, the causative passive, and the tricky te-form.\n\n•MyDeck Shuffle Mode\nActivating this mode will cause the app to display the MyDeck cards in random order, rather than the default order. Shuffling the deck will help you to more firmly master the material.\n\n•Tutorials\nThe tutorials provide helpful lessons on how to add a Japanese keyboard and operate each function. \n\n—This app is based on the second edition of GENKI.\n—Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

      "label": "Welcome to The Spalding Method ™ Phonograms app!\nNOTICE: Upon installing this mobile application, you are agreeing to the terms and conditions.\nThis Spalding Phonograms app is designed for helping students learn the phonics connection between speech sounds and written symbols that represent those sounds (phonograms). Learning the phonograms is essential for accurate and automatic reading, writing, and spelling. Teaching all the sounds of the phonemes represented by an alphabet letter or combination of two, three, or four letters (phonograms) enables students to read, spell, and write high-frequency words quickly. Students who learn the phonograms well expand their vocabulary and are able to use effective and creative communication skills in writing. Critical thinking is involved in learning the appropriate phonogram placement within words for accurate spelling and for applying information learned during phonogram reviews to pronounce unfamiliar words. \nThe Spalding Phonograms app is for students that need additional practice, including home schooling, ESL (English as a Second Language), ELL (English Language Learners), ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) students, and those with dyslexia or other learning disabilities. The school and home connection is encouraged through collaboration and communication with the teacher, parent, and student for practicing the phonograms appropriately and adequately. The Spalding  Phonograms app aligns with the core reading foundational skills required by state and national standards that are most crucial to the development of early reading success and reading comprehension, including:\n•\tPhonemic awareness\n•\tFeature recognition\n•\tLetter recognition\n•\tSound-symbol relationships (decoding)\nThe Spalding Phonograms app provides the following options for all 87 phonograms.\n•\tPhonogram Introduction by selected group – The student sees the phonograms in order of instruction in The Writing Road to Reading, listens to the teacher say the sound(s), and then says the sound(s).\n•\tOral Phonogram Review – A random phonogram card is show, followed by a pause. The student says the sound(s) and then listens to check accuracy. \n•\tWritten Phonogram Review –The student hears the phonogram sounds, followed by a pause; the student repeats the sound(s), listens for a cue, if needed, and then writes the phonogram on lined paper. The card is immediately shown so the student can check for accuracy.\n•\tDifferentiated Practice – Specific phonograms (from all 87) can be selected that need more practice. These phonograms can then be practiced in Phonogram Introduction, Oral Phonogram Review, or Written Phonogram Review."

Teachers love \"Touch and Write\" because children delight in writing when they can use shaving cream, paint, and jello. Create your own, individualized word and name lists, or practice one of the many included word lists, such as high frequency words, and word families (-AT family, -AN family, and more.) Using the included word lists, children can listen to the SOUND of each letter as they write, or toggle to hear the NAME of each letter.

I have been waiting for an app like this - a fun way teach Victorian Modern Cursive, an app my special needs son enjoys playing with and learns as he goes.  He can even use a stylus to draw the letters and build the muscle memory in his hand, that can later be transferred to writing with a pencil or pen.  All children will benefit from this app, presenting learning writing in an exciting format, great guides to help learn where to start and stop letters, and great celebration pages to keep them interested and rewarded.  I like that you can use the word lists or make your own so then the app grows with the child into writing full words, not just letters.  I think I will be trying it out with my son's spelling lists too and double benefit - writing and spelling.  It is also great to be able to teach Aussie formats such as Victorian Modern Cursive.... Almost all the apps I have tried have been US based.  Thanks FizzBrain!

This are not the sort of standard tutorials that you find on the web. During the videos you will be set tasks to do in scratch and hopefully you will be able to complete them on your own. However don't worry the next video in each project will show you how to complete the task!!\n\nThese videos are really targeted at primary/elementary students although the content will go on to stretch and challenge even the most able of them with variables, cloning, broadcasting and many other features of Scratch. \n\nThere's even a quiz in the app so you can test your scratch knowledge too!!\n\nScratch really is a fantastic way into learning programming and coding and this app hopefully will be a great asset to get you going with it.\n\nThis is a big app of just under 300Mb, because there is so much material in it. You will need to be hooked into your WiFi connection!!  \n\n*TEACHERS* the point of this app is that kids can use the iPad alongside the pc to build their games in Scratch. You can just sit back and relax without having to plan anything. Oh and there is enough material to keep your students busy for around 6 hours, even if they don't manage to have a go at the extension tasks that are identified for all 4 games!!"

      "label": "A Fun, classroom management tool, designed for Teachers, that will engage and entertain students. \n\nSimply create one or more groups (a Class or Group of Students). Add students to those groups. The App will then randomly select students from the highlighted group. All names will be displayed before a name is displayed for a second time. \n\n Features: \n• Call on your students in a different order every time. \n\n• If you want to exclude a Student/s from the selection, simply turn them off in the settings screen. This can be particularly useful for any absentees.\n\n• You can delete and edit Groups / Group member names easily inside the app.\n\n• The number of Students / Groups is limited only by the amount of free space on your device. \n\n• Use a FREE Dropbox account to backup and “Sync” your Groups/Group members with your other devices. You can even use the same Groups/Group members in our “Random Team Selector Pro” app (separate purchase).\n\n• If you have a lot of Groups/Group Members to define you can even import them from a text or CSV file. \n\n• The teacher can determine how many times any single name can be displayed. This avoids the problem of students “switching off” once their name has been selected once.\n\n• This is a Universal App for iPhone and iPad. \n\n• The Animated Graphics and multiple themes make the whole experience a pleasure and keep things fresh for the students. You can even create your own backgrounds. \n\n• Sound effects and background music help make the app more engaging but can also be switched ON/OFF individually as required.\n\n• You can apply a “Passcode” to access the settings screen.\n\n• Need to know where you are in the selection process. We have added a display option that shows the number of names drawn and the number of names remaining in the particular selection process.\n• Provide Feedback to the Developers directly from within the App….let us know how we can make it better.  \n\n• Share with your friends on Facebook or Twitter from within the App. \n\nWe value your feedback. Many of the features above are the direct result of Teacher feedback. If you have any ideas of ways the app can be improved we would love to hear them. Also, if you want to report a bug please use the “Email Support” button inside the app, or email us directly at support@edtechmonster.com We will always get back to you."

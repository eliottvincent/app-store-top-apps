      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "Te Aka is a Māori language dictionary that is easy to use by searching for Māori or English words. It includes the ability to filter search results, and to save definitions to a Favourites list. There are currently over 24,000 Māori headword entries in the database, which is being added to over time. An offline dictionary has also been included when internet connectivity is not available.\n\nAs well as English meanings, it has example sentences with translations for many entries. It even has photographs and audio clips for Aotearoa/New Zealand native fauna and photographs of flora, important people and other items where a photograph will aid understanding.\n\nIn addition to the words one would expect in a traditional dictionary, it also has encyclopaedic entries designed to provide key information about plants, animals, stars, planets, heavenly bodies, important Māori people, key ancestors of traditional narratives, tribal groups, ancestral canoes, song types, musical instruments, Māori names for institutions, country names, place names and other proper names. There are also detailed explanations of key concepts central to Māori culture. Comprehensive explanations for grammatical items are included, with examples of usage, as are idioms and colloquialisms with their meanings and examples.\n\nThe Te Aka Maori app is the companion to the popular www.maoridictionary.co.nz website and forms part of the Te Whanake Māori Language learning series."

      "label": "-- This is Boo! --\n\nBoo helps children practice speech sounds that they need to improve. He is designed to entice spontaneous repetition of individual speech sounds and simple syllables. At the same time, he enforces helpful phonological awareness, by showing what actions happen in the mouth during articulation. \n\nThe app is developed by a certified Speech-Language Pathologist. The children can use the app all by themselves or together with an adult. When the child simultaneously uses multiple senses (vision and hearing) to imitate and repeat it becomes easier to overcome obstacles and improve its articulation skills.\n\n-- Who is Boo for? --\n\nThe app is developed for children aged approximately 3 to 6 years old being in, or need to be in contact with a speech-language pathologist or therapist due to speech difficulties. It provides a motivating way to:\n• practice single speech sounds;\n• practice voiced versus voiceless consonants;\n• practice joining speech sounds together to create simple words\n\nBoo may be a stepping stone to better pronunciation!\n\nBoo can also be a helpful pronouncing learning tool for those - young or old - who are currently learning the English language.\n\nThe app is also great for practicing the link between letters and sounds in early reading practice.\n\n-- What can you do? --\n\nSounds in the paid app version are consonants P B T D K G S Z SH CH F V M N L W, essential to speech development. There are also five monophthong vowels, depending on what English dialect (American or British) you have chosen in the settings.\n\nIn the app, you put one or two sound cards in corresponding fields, building a sound or a simple two-letter syllable. Then, Boo articulates the sound or syllable, clearly showing mouth, tongue and vocal folds movements during articulation. This may be enticing for the child to imitate and recognize how the sound syllables are made by tongue and lips. \n\nYou can record and playback your own sound production for comparison. You can also make Boo go slow, repeat successively, or articulate sound noiselessly. Behind a parental gate you can disable or enable sounds as well as read instructions and tips from the SLT.\n\nThere is also a minigame in which you can practice identifying different speech sounds as Boo articulates them, either with sound or muted using only visual cues.\n\n(The images themselves on the sound cards, not necessarily the image's first letter, represent the actual speech sound that Boo makes. For example, the hi-hat represents the sound T because it sounds like a T.)\n\n-- Said about Boo: --\n\n\"They were extremely pleased with Boo and the boy is perceived by the parents as more intelligible than before. His training motivation as also improved.\"\n- David, Speech-Language Pathologist\n\n\"It works really great! We are so pleasantly surprised by how encouraged the kids get to try the different sounds as soon as they see Boo.\"\n- Elin, Speech-Language Pathologist\n\n---\n\nNOTE: There is a free, lite try-before-you-buy version with a few speech sounds and limited functionality. If you are uncertain if this version is useful, try the lite version first. If the child then interacts and spontaneously imitates Boo, then it could be worthwhile to purchase the paid version.\n\n---\n\nBoo Articulation Helper is developed by a speech and language therapist/pathologist with therapeutic experience with developmental verbal dyspraxia or articulation/phonological impairments. The app is tested by eight children in their homes, aged 3-6 years, seeing a SLP on a regular basis. The try-outs have shown an improvement of training motivation and spontaneous repetition of speech sounds in a way that proved more difficult with other training material and methods (undocumented).\n\nThe app is developed to be used on an iPad or tablet as it is easier to handle with little children's fingers - although it also compatible with smaller screens.\n\nPlease rate the app! That helps others to determine a purchase!"

(Please set your iPhone to Ring mode to hear the audio playback.)\n・Fun illustrations help users to better retain the words studied. \n・Users can bookmark the words they like. The bookmarked words are compiled in the Bookmark list in \"List.\"\n\n◇ “Check” helps learners to track their mastery.\n・Users check their understanding of the vocabulary studied and sort the words into those mastered and those not yet retained.\n・The words already mastered are taken out of the study set, leaving behind just those that still need to be worked on.\n\n◇ “List” displays a list of all words covered by the app so that users can see their progress and review the vocabulary.\n・The list can be arranged in any of three orderings: lesson order, a-i-u-e-o order, and alphabetical order. The words bookmarked in the Study mode are also listed in the Bookmark list.\n・Checkmarks are automatically placed next to words that have been mastered.\n・The Study view of words can be displayed from the list entries, enabling quick review.\n\n\n○This app is based on the vocabulary from the third edition of GENKI.\n○Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

      "label": "See Me Go Potty \nThe unique, distinctively useful, and exceptionally fun potty trainer. \n\nHow it works\n1. Use a simple menu to create a cartoon avatar that physically resembles your child/children.\n2. Let your child repeatedly play the Go Potty narrative showing him/herself successfully complete the whole process of using the potty step by step.\n3. Show your child the Accident Scene narrative to teach what an “accident” is. \n\nYou’ll be hearing “I did it!” in no time. \n\nImportant features\nFifteen actionable potty training tips included: The app includes concrete advice about preparation, behavioral reinforcement, behavioral shaping, when to continue vs. take a break, and more.   \nTeaching with positive reinforcement and fun: The Go Potty scene ends with your child’s avatar happily celebrating a successful “I did it!” potty experience.  In contrast, the Accident Scene ends with your child’s avatar being disappointed by the “uh-oh”.\nPersonalization and connection to kinesthetic learning: Children immediately joyfully recognize their cartoon selves, closing the gap between watching someone else do something and visualizing oneself doing something.  The supplemental motor area (SMA) of the brain is responsible for learning and planning motor behaviors (actions). Quite amazingly, neuroscientists have shown that imagining oneself doing something involves similar activity patterns in the SMA as actually doing it.  \nVisual learning is powerful: This app is a great teaching tool for typically developing children as well as children with developmental delays and communication disabilities. The layout is intentionally simple and free of distractions.  Your child’s attention will be focused on him/herself using the potty. Parents who have a “neuro-diverse” family know that the teaching techniques we rely on to teach our children with developmental delays also work like a charm with our typical kids.  Many kids on the autism spectrum, in particular, are very visual learners, but the power of visual learning is certainly not restricted to them. \nAuditory learning and read(/write) learning via simple narrative accompaniment: The animations are accompanied by a simple step-by-step script that your child can readily adopt and transfer to real life. Most children of potty training age cannot read yet; they will simply hear and then mimic the verbal labels for each step.  However, many children on the autism spectrum, who are relatively late to potty train, may be able to recognize sight words surprisingly early. A 3–5 year-old child may be able to “read along”, further reinforcing the behavioral sequence. \n \nBackground\nThe See Me Go Potty app came about based on the developers’ experience potty training their three children and is grounded in Ann’s (mom’s) expertise in neuroscience (she holds a PhD in the neurobiology of learning and memory from UC Irvine). They overcame potty training difficulties with a child who has a communication/autism spectrum disorder by creating a step-by-step animated slide show narrative of her going to the bathroom. She readily transferred the process and the vocabulary to real-life toileting and was finally fully and successfully potty trained within a few weeks. When the Smiths’ youngest (typically developing) daughter was ready to potty train, they were preparing to adapt the narrative to look like her, and thought how nice it would have been to have done this for their eldest (typically developing) son, who had been outright defiant to the process. Moreover, they realized how all potty training parents and preschool teachers could appreciate this teaching tool and commenced development of this app."

      "label": "The Baby Sensory Signbook app teaches you all signs you need, so you and your baby can start communication and language development. Learn to communicate long before the development of speech, using our simple Babysigns.\n\n\nFEATURES \n- All official Baby Sensory baby signs right in your pocket.\n- Find a sign in 3 simple steps with the easy interface.\n- Make a list of favourites, for the signs you're learning.\n- Learn 'Say Hello' and 4 other songs' signs with music.\n- Looping videos, so you can easily see how it’s done.\n- Slow down the video, to better view the hand shapes.\n\n\nABOUT THE APP\nWith the Baby Sensory app, you can easily learn all official signs to make early communication possible. This creates a stronger parent-child bond and stimulates early language development.\nEven the youngest baby wants to tell you what they need and how they feel. But they’re unable to express themselves verbally and may cry if their needs are not met. Signing helps your baby to express his or her needs and takes the guesswork out of parenting.\n\n\nABOUT US\nBaby Sensory was the first baby programme to offer a complete approach to learning and development from birth to 13 months. Designed to stimulate, educate and provide precious memories during the all-important first years of life, the programme has won multiple awards both nationally and internationally since 2008. Everything we do is backed by over 35 years of expert research in childhood development. \n\n\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the app, please let us know. Send us a message or see www.babysensory.com for more info.\n\n\nCONTACT\nWebsite: www.babysensory.com\nMail: apps@babysensory.com\n\n\n\nWe are super excited to hear what you think of our little app!\nSend your thoughts and tips to: apps@babysensory.com\n\nLike and follow us to stay up to date on future updates:\nwww.facebook.com/BabySensoryUK\nwww.twitter.com/BabySensoryHQ"

      "label": "Experiment with plant characters, evolve them into new species and discover their unique personalities. Keep collecting plants until you’ve collected them all! The world of science just got a little bit weirder and a lot more fun with Toca Lab: Plants!\n\nJust like with the first app in the Toca Lab Series, Toca Lab: Elements, your curiosity will lead the way. Choose your plant, then visit five different locations in the lab:\n\n● Grow light: Shine the light on your plant and watch what happens! Does your plant bask and happily sigh in the light, or groan and wriggle away? What happens when you turn the light up a notch or two?\n\n● Watering tank: Put your plant in the tank and fill it up with water. Will your plant float? How does your plant behave when it’s soaking wet?\n\n● Nutrition station: What’s the optimal diet for your plant? Try the three different nutrition formulas and discover which ones your plant character likes!\n\n● Cloning machine: Spin the wheel on the cloning machine and before you know it, you’ll have five little versions of your plant. Wonder what the clones can do? Experiment and find out!\n\n● Crossbreeding apparatus: Here you can mix two plants to create something unexpected. Try it and see what happens!\n\nHave fun experimenting at each station to see how the plants evolve. Keep experimenting until you’ve collected all 35 plant characters in the app. Once you’ve collected a plant, keep experimenting to continue to evolve it! Who says kids can’t be scientists? Toca Lab: Plants brings out the budding botanist in everybody!\n\nFEATURES\n- Start with one plant and experiment your way to 35 different plant characters, each with its own unique personality!\n- Continue to evolve existing plants through experimentation!\n- Evolve plants with five lab tools: grow light, watering tank, nutrition station, cloning machine and the crossbreeding apparatus.\n- Discover plants from five groups: green algae, mosses, ferns, trees and flowering plants.\n- Learn the names and Latin names of real-life plants!\n\n--\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

Most people are scared of it, but I want to sneak inside.\n\nThere are so many rumors, I don’t know what to believe\n\nSome kids say the top floor glows at night and that crazy aliens live up there. Some say that strange experiments are going on in the living room. One kid I know absolutely swears they heard weird music coming from the basement. Can a house sing? I’ve also talked to kids who say the entire kitchen is covered in slime. Even my best friend, who never believes anything, told me the house is alive!\n\nI had to see for myself\n\nI did, I swear. I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside. I could really use a partner, though. Seriously, will you come with me?\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nPrivacy is an issue that we take very seriously.

Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures.   \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen. \n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n• tap on a word to hear it being read \n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 2\n• Pip\n• Tim and the van\n• At the dam\n• My hat\n• Sam in the pit\n\nThe Stage 2 books include sounds introduced in Stage 1 - s m, s, f, a, p, t, c, i  plus new sounds b, h, n, o, d, g, l v.

      "label": "Little Learners Love Literacy® is a sequenced phonics reading program to give children confidence and success.  Letters and sounds are introduced in stages.  Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen. \n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n• tap on a word to hear it being read \n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 3 \n\n• Ned\n• Big Ted and Meg\n• Tim’s quiz\n• Dad and his hot dog\n• The rat\n\nStage 3 sounds include m, s, f, a, p, t, c, I, b, h, n, o, d, g, l, v plus new sounds y r e qu z\n\nNew Heart words: of are too for her \n\nThere are NO tricks in reading these stories as children are practising their knowledge of the sounds and letters. \nThese books are enhanced with audio – tap on a word to have it read aloud."

It has two audio walking tours and numerous words and phrases to listen to and learn.\n\nThis app is first and foremost created for the next generation of Arrernte people. It has been created to promote Arrernte language and knowledge in Mparntwe, Alice Springs. \n\nWe do language work ampe ingkernerenye mape-ke - for those children who come after us.\nIt’s for the kids first, and for all Arrernte people, so they can be proud of who they are.\nThat’s the most important thing for us.\n\nAnd then secondly, for non-Aboriginal people. So they can akaltye-irremele - learn - and itelaretyeke - understand. So they might understand more about being here on our country - Apmere Mparntwe, and the neighbouring areas.\n\nThe app gives people in Mparntwe another way to access the sound of Central/Eastern Arrernte language alongside the written words, and to see this place through the eyes of a group of Mparntwe’s custodians. It is just one resource in an incredible legacy of enduring knowledge work carried out by Arrernte custodians working today, and those who have come before.\n\nAwemele Itelaretyeke has emerged out of the language project Apmere Angkentye-kenhe (2017-2020). Apmere Angkentye-kenhe was produced and contributed to by many Arrernte people, artists and supporters.\n\nThe app was created through Akeyluerre Healing Centre with financial support from Centrecorp. \nFor any questions, feedback or concerns please contact Akeyluerre Healing Centre.\n\nPEOPLE SPEAKING ON THIS APP\nAlison Ferber, Amelia Kngwarraye Turner, Benedict Stevens, Edward (Arranye) Johnson (d), Felicity Hayes, Gabriel Kngwarraye Turner, Julie Hayes, Lorrayne Gorey, Magdalene Marshall, Margaret Kemarre Turner, Mervyn Rubuntja, Michael Gorey, Peter Coco Wallace, Shirley Kngwarraye Turner, Stephen Kernan, Veronica Kngwarraye Turner, William (Nookie) Lowah, Wyonna Palmer\n\nSOUND ARTISTS\nBryan Phillips, William Lowah, Beth Sometimes, Vito Lucarelli\n\nGRAPHIC DESIGN & ILLUSTRATION\nAmelia Kngwarraye Turner, Beth Sometimes, Magdalene Marshall, Shirley Kngwarraye Turner\n\nAPP DEVELOPMENT\nEdan Baxter - Spinifex Valley"

      "label": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

It can also be customized for teachers in a school setting. \n \nKey features included with Choiceworks:\n■ Full, unlimited access to all four board types: Schedule, Waiting, Feelings and Feelings Scale\n■ Image Library preloaded with over 180 images and audio \n■ Add your own images and record your own audio for limitless customizability \n■ Attach video to any board image\n■ Easily create profiles to personalize and manage multiple users\n■ Save an unlimited number of boards for multiple children or different routines \n■ Speaks boards out loud with child or adult voice\n■ Share boards by Email, Files app or iTunes with other Choiceworks app users \n■ Ability to print boards or save as PDF\n\nAdditional features included with Choiceworks+ (Early Access):\n■ Synchronize across all your devices\n■ Advanced sharing options\n■ Custom themes\n■ Library Assistant\n■ Custom timer sounds\n\nWhat do you get with Choiceworks and Choiceworks+?\nWith your Choiceworks purchase you get access to all the features that have made it an award winning support app used in classrooms and homes around the globe for over a decade. No additional in-app purchase or subscriptions are required and there are no limits to how many boards or images you can create and share.\n\nIf you subscribe to Choiceworks+, you will get additional time saving data management features and customization options that further enhance your experience.  You will also receive additional premium features as they are released in future updates.  Note: Choiceworks+ features require an Apple ID to function properly.  If you are in a school or business setting, check with your IT administrator for any restrictions before you subscribe.\n\nSchedule Board \nThe Schedule Board makes task completion easier and more fun! The schedule is paired with an ‘all done’ column to check off steps toward a motivating reward. Timers can be added to any task or activity. The schedules are easy to edit and fully customizable. Once you have created a schedule, it will be saved automatically.\n\nWaiting Board \nThe Waiting Board teaches waiting skills like taking turns and not interrupting. The user can begin by reading the companion book, When Do I Have to Wait? Using the waiting board, the top picture indicates the reason why the child is waiting and a timer can be set to show how long the child will wait. The child can then choose an activity to do while waiting. \n\nFeelings Board \nThe Feelings Board provides a tool for helping children understand and express emotions. The user can begin by reading the companion book, When I Get Upset, to provide an example of how the child might recognize an emotion and choose a coping strategy. On the Feelings Board, the user can then help the child indicate how they are feeling from a range of options, select a coping strategy, and then request an activity to help them feel better or re-engage with others. \n\nFeelings Scale\nHelps users identify, manage and cope with feelings across environments throughout the day. By tracking their feelings on the board, users can analyze the data for trends to learn if tasks done at different times of day or in different environments affect outcome. Environments and schedules can then be altered to achieve better results.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.beevisual.com/mobile-app-eula.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.beevisual.com/mobile-app-privacy.html"

      "label": "This app will bring you into the cockpit of your dreams...and help you to stay there...\n\nFrom version 3.1 with the new number arithmetics test !\n\nHow are your mathematics skills ? How fast can you perform easy calculations without paper and pencil, or make quick estimations of difficult calculations ? \n\nThese skills you need to have when you are a pilot...in the cockpit, but also at the pilot screening, to get into a cockpit in the first place....\n\nLuckily, everyone can improve these skills, and this app is the best tool for your math training. And you can do this wherever you are, sousing your iPhone or iPad.\n\nThe app is completely easy and intuitive to use. It has 6 sections where different mathematic skills can be trained and improved. Each test comprises 20 questions and you have a limited time to answer each question. The average time to answer the questions is computed and shown after the test is completed. The highscore and the result of the last try is shown on the menu screen, so the app works a bit like a game...yes, studying and learning can also be fun...\n\nThe tests:\n\n- The estimation test lets you estimate the result of a difficult calculation which is impossible so solve within the limited time available.\n- The fraction test asks for solutions of easy calculations which include fractions under time pressure\n- The word problems are exactly what you would expect...word problems...\n- The number series tests your ability continue a sequence of numbers by logical reasoning. You have to find the logic of the number sequence and find the next number.\n- The arithmetics test will train your ability to perform simple calculations quickly.\n- The cube test is a bit tricky. You have to take the sum of the points on the front sides of the cubes and the sums of the points of the back sides of the cubes and subtract the smaller values from the larger. If one of the cubes shows this number of points, klick on this cube. If not, click on the cube which shows the questionmark. And this under time pressure ! Got it ? Have fun, captain :-)\n\nAll of these tests are part of most pilot screenings one way or another. So the more you train these skills with this app, the higher the chances are, that you end up in the cockpit of your dreams. And if you are already in the cockpit of your dreams, you should train anyway, because exactly these skills you need as pilot to deliver optimal performance.\n\nEven if you are not a pilot, it makes sense to train your mathematics skills with this app. It is fun, and being able to perform quick calculations can help you in many professions and in many areas of life.\n\nThis app will be constantly improved in future. I add new questions at regular updates and I am working on additional modules which will be available in near future.\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact me via email: thomas.oswald@aeroware.at or check my youtube channel for tutorial videos regarding this app. Also check my other pilot apps in the App Store."

      "label": "Open up the world-famous Peekaboo Barn, perfect for toddlers. \n\nInside the little bouncing barn, friendly farm animals are waiting to pop out and surprise your little one. Try and guess who they are; tap the doors to find out! More animals, animations, and sounds than ever.\n\nWork with your child to learn the names of animals and hear the sounds they make. Younger children will love opening the barn doors to find new animal animations, as they learn about cause and effect and become familiar with animal names and sounds. Older children will enjoy guessing animals by sound, then seeing the animal names, which helps develop early literacy skills.  \n\nMultiple Language Features:\n\nWe started with a child's voice in English. It's her real voice, which some kids really enjoy, but she does say \"wabbit\" and \"wooster.\" If this is a concern for you, you can switch to any of 12 adult voices; our adult narrators say everything clearly and perfectly, just like the teachers they are. You can try many languages from around the world—or record your own language, or grandma's voice. There are tons of ways to explore the languages of Peekaboo Barn!\n\nPress the Language button on the Options screen to try them out.\n\n—Choose from the built-in narrators: child's voice in young English; adult's voice in American English or Spanish.\n—World languages also included: Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, German, French, Australian, and UK English. \n—Record your own voice: We added this feature so parents, children, and visiting relatives and friends can capture their own voices and star in Peekaboo Barn.  Now you can record the animal names in your native language--or grandma's voice, or grandpa's--and, if you're recording a new language, you can save the appropriate written version too, and both will show up the next time you play. (Please note, we can only support the writing systems that are supported by your device.)\n\nFEATURED BY APPLE \nOne of the first apps to be released for toddlers, since 2008 Peekaboo Barn has been downloaded over a million times, and played over 100 million times worldwide.  It has been a top 20 educational game on the iTunes store nearly every day since its launch, and has been featured by Apple often.  It won The Best Toddler App Ever award in 2009, and was named one of the top 50 iPhone apps for kids by Babble.com in 2010 and 2011.  It is recommended by The New York Times, MSNBC, USA Today, Wired, Telegraph UK, Ireland’s The Independent, Parents Magazine, and the Washington Post.\n\nPeekaboo Barn was made for you and your toddler by artists and educators, not marketers, robots, or companies repackaging clip art. Our team has backgrounds in cognitive science and child development, and we’ve worked in educational media everywhere from Penguin USA to the Smithsonian Institution. When you could really use a safe distraction--in airports, restaurants, and waiting rooms--or you'd like to try something new with your little genius, Peekaboo Barn is the educational, artful solution. Enjoy! \n\nIf you are looking for more Peekaboo, check out our awesome cousins: Peekaboo Fridge, Peekaboo Forest, and Peekaboo Wild.\n\nIf your kids are ready for a more complex game with the same great characters, please try Peekaboo Barn Farm Day! Many activities to try: for example, you can milk the cow, shear the sheep and llama, and pet the animals to help them fall sleep.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/nightanddaystudios. \nTwitter: @nightdaystudios \nYour privacy is important to us!

      "label": "The Decodable Readers Australia books support a systematic approach of learning to read. This approach ensures kids are given the “right-fit” book.  Decodable, or phonic readers, only contain words made up of the sounds a child has learnt. Within each level in the Decodable Readers Australia Series, a new group of sounds is introduced. As children move through each level the sounds progress from simple to complex.\n\nThe Decodable Readers Australia – Level 3 books introduce the sounds b, h, f, l, j, v, w, x, y and z. All the words in each of the 20 books in Level 3 are made up of these sounds and those introduced in Level 1 and 2 along with minimal sight words. After having mastered the Level 1 and 2 sounds and the reading skills of blending and tracking, children should have gained the confidence to read Australian stories with new words and more text on each page.\n\nEach story in Level 3 can be enjoyed by listening to the professional audio or read aloud with the support of tapping and hearing the word if required. The audio function can be controlled independently within each page. Both parents and teachers can continue to support children with vocab and comprehension development through using the post-reading activities provided within each story. An addition to the Level 3 readers are the wide range of pre-reading activities that can be used to help set the purpose for reading.\n\nKey Features:\n•\tlisten to each story being read to them using the audio function\n•\tuse each book to practice reading independently \n•\ttap each word to hear the sounds and the word if support is needed\n•\ttap to turn each page for individual reading pace\n•\tall Australian themes and characters\nbeautifully illustrated with detail for engagement and enjoyment"

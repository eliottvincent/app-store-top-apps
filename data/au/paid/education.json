      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "The Baby Sensory Signbook app teaches you all signs you need, so you and your baby can start communication and language development. Learn to communicate long before the development of speech, using our simple Babysigns.\n\n\nFEATURES \n- All official Baby Sensory baby signs right in your pocket.\n- Find a sign in 3 simple steps with the easy interface.\n- Make a list of favourites, for the signs you're learning.\n- Learn 'Say Hello' and 4 other songs' signs with music.\n- Looping videos, so you can easily see how it’s done.\n- Slow down the video, to better view the hand shapes.\n\n\nABOUT THE APP\nWith the Baby Sensory app, you can easily learn all official signs to make early communication possible. This creates a stronger parent-child bond and stimulates early language development.\nEven the youngest baby wants to tell you what they need and how they feel. But they’re unable to express themselves verbally and may cry if their needs are not met. Signing helps your baby to express his or her needs and takes the guesswork out of parenting.\n\n\nABOUT US\nBaby Sensory was the first baby programme to offer a complete approach to learning and development from birth to 13 months. Designed to stimulate, educate and provide precious memories during the all-important first years of life, the programme has won multiple awards both nationally and internationally since 2008. Everything we do is backed by over 35 years of expert research in childhood development. \n\n\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the app, please let us know. Send us a message or see www.babysensory.com for more info.\n\n\nCONTACT\nWebsite: www.babysensory.com\nMail: apps@babysensory.com\n\n\n\nWe are super excited to hear what you think of our little app!\nSend your thoughts and tips to: apps@babysensory.com\n\nLike and follow us to stay up to date on future updates:\nwww.facebook.com/BabySensoryUK\nwww.twitter.com/BabySensoryHQ"

      "label": "Little Learners Love Literacy® is a sequenced phonics reading program to give children confidence and success.  Letters and sounds are introduced in stages.  Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen. \n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n• tap on a word to hear it being read \n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 3 \n\n• Ned\n• Big Ted and Meg\n• Tim’s quiz\n• Dad and his hot dog\n• The rat\n\nStage 3 sounds include m, s, f, a, p, t, c, I, b, h, n, o, d, g, l, v plus new sounds y r e qu z\n\nNew Heart words: of are too for her \n\nThere are NO tricks in reading these stories as children are practising their knowledge of the sounds and letters. \nThese books are enhanced with audio – tap on a word to have it read aloud."

Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books \nwith real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures. \n\nStage Plus 4 fits between Stage 4 & 5. It introduces the graphemes ll, ss, ff  as well as \nwords with ‘s’ for example, dogs and runs. \n\nStage Plus 4 introduces a new recording feature that allows children to record and \nhear themselves read. This is an important step in developing fluency, as it gives \nchildren a reason to reread and record.  Fluency is an important literacy skill \nrequiring accuracy and comprehension. \n\nStages 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5 have professionally recorded and produced audio.  However, \nStages Plus 4, 6, & 7 allow children to read and record themselves.  Children are now \nmore confident readers and will benefit from this new recording feature. They will \nenjoy checking their accuracy by following the words in the book. \n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions. \nAll words, except the Heart words, can be ‘sounded out’. To do this, children point to \neach letter or grapheme, saying the sounds then blending the sounds together to \nread the word. \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage Plus 4:\n\nThe Little Vet\n\nSad Tip\n\n No Ned\n\n A Mud Picnic\n\nThe Big Wind Day\n\nThere are NO tricks in the Little Learner books.\n\nNote: Please make sure to enable the microphone on your device when asked or you will not be able to record anything.

      "label": "** Featured on FunEducationalApps.com & theAppyLadies.com **\n\nInference Clues helps build strong reading comprehension skills in a fun, game-like environment. \n\nAs well as generating inferences, players identify the clue words that lead to an inference -- a vital comprehension skill and part of the Common Core standards.  \n\n***** 5 Stars! This is another great app from Happy Frog. I really like how your apps target a specific skill.\n\n***** 5 Stars  Just what my son needed. Thanks for your great apps. We are working our way through all of them!\n\nInference Ace 2 is targeted to children in Grades 2-5 who can read the words (decode), but who need help with understanding what they read. \n\n\nKey Features: \n\n-   Builds inference skills step-by-step until mastery. \n\n-   Incremental learning. New levels are unlocked only when your child is ready. \n\n-   Can be used independently (just hand it over, your child will know what to do) or with a therapist for reading intervention.\n\n-   Guided learning for less frustration. Your child will always arrive at the correct answer. \n\n-   Fun and engaging Reward Center to increase motivation. \n\n-   Advanced levels include timers to ensure fluency. Research shows fluency in the foundation skills is critical to reading comprehension. \n\n-   Detailed reporting for up to 10 students to meet the needs of teachers, therapists and parents.\n\nInference Clues can be used at the same time as Inference Ace (our other inferencing app), or it can be used after Inference Ace has been completed. \n\nYou can try this app by downloading the free version.  The free version has 4 free levels for one player. You can purchase levels and players separately through in-app purchases.\n\nIf you prefer no in-app purchases, please purchase the 'School Edition' of this app.\n\nWe are a member of the 'Moms with Apps program.  We collect NO private information in our app, and our apps do not allow unrestricted web access.\n\nOur apps are designed for and tested by typical and special needs children. Testers include children with Autism and other special needs. Our apps work for them! \n\nWe take customer service very seriously! If you ever have a problem or find that we've missed something, contact us at our website and we will do our best to fix the problem."

      "label": "The Choiceworks app is an essential learning tool that helps children complete daily routines (morning, day, & night), understand & manage feelings and improve waiting skills (taking turns and not interrupting).  Choiceworks is designed for caregivers to provide clear and consistent support to foster a child’s independence, positive behavior, and emotional regulation at home and in the community. It can also be customized for teachers in a school setting. \n \nKey features included with Choiceworks:\n■ Full, unlimited access to all four board types: Schedule, Waiting, Feelings and Feelings Scale\n■ Image Library preloaded with over 180 images and audio \n■ Add your own images and record your own audio for limitless customizability \n■ Attach video to any board image\n■ Easily create profiles to personalize and manage multiple users\n■ Save an unlimited number of boards for multiple children or different routines \n■ Speaks boards out loud with child or adult voice\n■ Share boards by Email, Files app or iTunes with other Choiceworks app users \n■ Ability to print boards or save as PDF\n\nAdditional features included with Choiceworks+ (Early Access):\n■ Synchronize across all your devices\n■ Advanced sharing options\n■ Custom themes\n■ Library Assistant\n■ Custom timer sounds\n\nWhat do you get with Choiceworks and Choiceworks+?\nWith your Choiceworks purchase you get access to all the features that have made it an award winning support app used in classrooms and homes around the globe for over a decade. No additional in-app purchase or subscriptions are required and there are no limits to how many boards or images you can create and share.\n\nIf you subscribe to Choiceworks+, you will get additional time saving data management features and customization options that further enhance your experience.  You will also receive additional premium features as they are released in future updates.  Note: Choiceworks+ features require an Apple ID to function properly.  If you are in a school or business setting, check with your IT administrator for any restrictions before you subscribe.\n\nSchedule Board \nThe Schedule Board makes task completion easier and more fun! The schedule is paired with an ‘all done’ column to check off steps toward a motivating reward. Timers can be added to any task or activity. The schedules are easy to edit and fully customizable. Once you have created a schedule, it will be saved automatically.\n\nWaiting Board \nThe Waiting Board teaches waiting skills like taking turns and not interrupting. The user can begin by reading the companion book, When Do I Have to Wait? Using the waiting board, the top picture indicates the reason why the child is waiting and a timer can be set to show how long the child will wait. The child can then choose an activity to do while waiting. \n\nFeelings Board \nThe Feelings Board provides a tool for helping children understand and express emotions. The user can begin by reading the companion book, When I Get Upset, to provide an example of how the child might recognize an emotion and choose a coping strategy. On the Feelings Board, the user can then help the child indicate how they are feeling from a range of options, select a coping strategy, and then request an activity to help them feel better or re-engage with others. \n\nFeelings Scale\nHelps users identify, manage and cope with feelings across environments throughout the day. By tracking their feelings on the board, users can analyze the data for trends to learn if tasks done at different times of day or in different environments affect outcome. Environments and schedules can then be altered to achieve better results.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.beevisual.com/mobile-app-eula.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.beevisual.com/mobile-app-privacy.html"

Your goal is to quiet your mind and become aware of that picture.\n\nYou select one of the two choices by pressing the answer which best matches your awareness of that image. When you do that, a second question\nwill appear. You then repeat the process. The Property Matches indicator at the bottom shows the number of correct answers to 24 questions.\n\nFour pictures will then appear. Tap the picture that best matches your mental image. The correct picture will fill the screen. After 12 pictures you may begin a new game.\n\nThis program offers feedback and reinforcement to meets the requirements for learning this skill. The Stargate ESP Trainer presents meaningful and emotional images to your subconscious mind. This ability is often called clairvoyance, and can enhance your life in many surprising ways."

It's our job to record those many things and use that information wisely to help guide our reading instruction. \n\nLet the Running Record Toolbox help you!  It has all the tools you'll need to assist you in making well-informed decisions about each of your students as individual readers.  \n\nAre they reading with appropriate accuracy?  Are they making too many errors?  Are they self-monitoring and making corrections?  Our running record calculator will help you take the guesswork out of these questions. Simply punch in how many total words, errors and self-corrections your student made and press CALCULATE.  An accuracy percent, error ratio and self-correction ratio will be instantly displayed!  Let the app do all the pesky math for you!  You've got enough on your mind already with all of those hard to remember recording conventions (symbols). Use our symbol cheat sheet to remind yourself how to record exactly what each of your readers is doing!  We've included the marking conventions for all of the most common reader behaviors that you may need to record. Using the correct symbols will help you and future teachers read the running record without any problems. \n\nWe've also included a WPM stopwatch and calculator for those of you that like to keep an eye on their fluency rate. It may be worth noting how long it's taking your students to read a certain sample. After timing your student just enter how many words they read and let our calculator tell you how many words they are reading per minute!  This information can be helpful to you as you continue pressing forward with your reading instruction. \n\nFinally, we've included an accuracy percentage table. This reference will help you decide if the chosen book was just right, too easy or too hard.  Compare the student's accuracy percentage with this table to help you decide what level book to choose next time. The last thing we want is to waste time trying to make progress on an inappropriate reading level.\n\nThe Running Record Toolbox can give you all of the information you need to take your reading instruction to the next level!"

It includes the ability to filter search results, and to save definitions to a Favourites list. There are currently over 24,000 Māori headword entries in the database, which is being added to over time. An offline dictionary has also been included when internet connectivity is not available.\n\nAs well as English meanings, it has example sentences with translations for many entries. It even has photographs and audio clips for Aotearoa/New Zealand native fauna and photographs of flora, important people and other items where a photograph will aid understanding.\n\nIn addition to the words one would expect in a traditional dictionary, it also has encyclopaedic entries designed to provide key information about plants, animals, stars, planets, heavenly bodies, important Māori people, key ancestors of traditional narratives, tribal groups, ancestral canoes, song types, musical instruments, Māori names for institutions, country names, place names and other proper names. There are also detailed explanations of key concepts central to Māori culture. Comprehensive explanations for grammatical items are included, with examples of usage, as are idioms and colloquialisms with their meanings and examples.\n\nThe Te Aka Maori app is the companion to the popular www.maoridictionary.co.nz website and forms part of the Te Whanake Māori Language learning series."

Little Learners 5 teaches children to read words with -ck. \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen. \n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n• tap on a word to hear it being read \n\n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nThese five books use all the sounds of the initial alphabetic code.  There are NO tricks as children use their phonic skills to read.   \nThese books are audio enhanced – tap on a word to have it read aloud. \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 5 introduces –ck consonant digraph.   These fun stories about Pip and Tim provide practice in reading words with ‘ck’.  There are new Heart words in each story as shown on the last page of each book.   Children love the quirky stories and they are confident that there are NO tricks in the books.  Great way to build reading confidence. \n\n• The Fan-tas-tic Snack\n• The Pip and Tim Zoo\n• The Best Stuff\n• A Bag of Junk\n• Splat!"

Most people are scared of it, but I want to sneak inside.\n\nThere are so many rumors, I don’t know what to believe\n\nSome kids say the top floor glows at night and that crazy aliens live up there. Some say that strange experiments are going on in the living room. One kid I know absolutely swears they heard weird music coming from the basement. Can a house sing? I’ve also talked to kids who say the entire kitchen is covered in slime. Even my best friend, who never believes anything, told me the house is alive!\n\nI had to see for myself\n\nI did, I swear. I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside. I could really use a partner, though. Seriously, will you come with me?\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nPrivacy is an issue that we take very seriously.

      "label": "See Me Go Potty \nThe unique, distinctively useful, and exceptionally fun potty trainer. \n\nHow it works\n1. Use a simple menu to create a cartoon avatar that physically resembles your child/children.\n2. Let your child repeatedly play the Go Potty narrative showing him/herself successfully complete the whole process of using the potty step by step.\n3. Show your child the Accident Scene narrative to teach what an “accident” is. \n\nYou’ll be hearing “I did it!” in no time. \n\nImportant features\nFifteen actionable potty training tips included: The app includes concrete advice about preparation, behavioral reinforcement, behavioral shaping, when to continue vs. take a break, and more.   \nTeaching with positive reinforcement and fun: The Go Potty scene ends with your child’s avatar happily celebrating a successful “I did it!” potty experience.  In contrast, the Accident Scene ends with your child’s avatar being disappointed by the “uh-oh”.\nPersonalization and connection to kinesthetic learning: Children immediately joyfully recognize their cartoon selves, closing the gap between watching someone else do something and visualizing oneself doing something.  The supplemental motor area (SMA) of the brain is responsible for learning and planning motor behaviors (actions). Quite amazingly, neuroscientists have shown that imagining oneself doing something involves similar activity patterns in the SMA as actually doing it.  \nVisual learning is powerful: This app is a great teaching tool for typically developing children as well as children with developmental delays and communication disabilities. The layout is intentionally simple and free of distractions.  Your child’s attention will be focused on him/herself using the potty. Parents who have a “neuro-diverse” family know that the teaching techniques we rely on to teach our children with developmental delays also work like a charm with our typical kids.  Many kids on the autism spectrum, in particular, are very visual learners, but the power of visual learning is certainly not restricted to them. \nAuditory learning and read(/write) learning via simple narrative accompaniment: The animations are accompanied by a simple step-by-step script that your child can readily adopt and transfer to real life. Most children of potty training age cannot read yet; they will simply hear and then mimic the verbal labels for each step.  However, many children on the autism spectrum, who are relatively late to potty train, may be able to recognize sight words surprisingly early. A 3–5 year-old child may be able to “read along”, further reinforcing the behavioral sequence. \n \nBackground\nThe See Me Go Potty app came about based on the developers’ experience potty training their three children and is grounded in Ann’s (mom’s) expertise in neuroscience (she holds a PhD in the neurobiology of learning and memory from UC Irvine). They overcame potty training difficulties with a child who has a communication/autism spectrum disorder by creating a step-by-step animated slide show narrative of her going to the bathroom. She readily transferred the process and the vocabulary to real-life toileting and was finally fully and successfully potty trained within a few weeks. When the Smiths’ youngest (typically developing) daughter was ready to potty train, they were preparing to adapt the narrative to look like her, and thought how nice it would have been to have done this for their eldest (typically developing) son, who had been outright defiant to the process. Moreover, they realized how all potty training parents and preschool teachers could appreciate this teaching tool and commenced development of this app."

Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books \nwith real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures. \n\nStage 7 Unit 2  introduces and practises the vowel graphemes - ar or er ir ur air.\n\nIt also introduces a new recording feature that allows children to record and \nhear themselves read. This is an important step in developing fluency, as it gives \nchildren a reason to reread and record.  Fluency is an important literacy skill \nrequiring accuracy and comprehension. \n\nStages 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5 have professionally recorded and produced audio.  However, \nStages Plus 4, 6, & 7 allow children to read and record themselves.  Children are now more confident readers and will benefit from this new recording feature. They will enjoy checking their accuracy by following the words in the book and listening to themselves read.\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions. \nAll words, except the Heart words, can be decoded or ‘sounded out’. To do this, children point to each letter or grapheme, saying the sounds then blend the sounds together to read the word. \n\nThere are NO tricks in the Little Learner books.\n\nNote: Please make sure to enable the microphone on your device when asked or you will not be able to record anything. Also make sure your device is not set to mute to hear the audio back."

Children will love learning their letter sounds by singing along to the Jolly Songs and doing the actions. Being able to identify the letter sounds in words will help them with both their reading and writing. This app will entertain the whole family or school classroom.\n\n• Easily switch between British or American English and Precursive or Print letter fonts.\n\n• There's a highlighter option to track each word as it is sung, helping the child to read. This can also be switched off.\n\n• Autoplay option available from the info page\n\n• Includes the vowels song.\n\n• Includes a description and an image for each of the Jolly Phonics actions.\n\n• Easy to use navigation to quickly find the song you want to play.\n\n• With beautiful illustrations from our Jolly Songs book.\n\n• Includes an index of all the songs.\n\n\nFor customers experiencing problems with sound first check that the side switch is not activated (you should not see a red dot on the switch). Then ensure the volume is turned up. Now open the app. If you still hear no sound at this point, swipe up from the very bottom of your screen and when you see the arrow swipe up again to pull up the on-screen menu pages. Ensure you are on the first menu page and if you see a red button with a bell and a line through it this is means your ringer is set to mute and is why you cannot hear any sound in our app. Simply touch the button to turn the sound back on. Now swipe down on the menu to return to the app and you should now hear sound when you play a song.

You can switch off the timer easing the pressure to determine the right answer. To answer the question you just need to tap the answer and then tap on the submit button. You can also choose study mode which provides special features to help you better practise find the right answers. This version includes a package of 180 questions categorised in three difficulty levels. Answer images are shuffled every time you start a test therefore providing for 720 possible questions. This is one of the advantages of using this application as compared to paper tests where you are most likely to remember the solution from the last time you saw the question.

Hints explain how the diagram changes within the sequence. You can also retry a question if you do not answer it correctly. Once you find all correct answers you have the option to redo the test with the same questions at which point answers are reshuffled."

      "label": "Designed by an Occupational Therapist.\nFirst & Then is a very simple app that uses a board with photos to show that one activity must happen before the next can occur. A fantastic tool for visual learners! \n\nThe idea behind a First & Then board is to encourage a child to complete an activity that they don’t particularly enjoy. The board motivates the child to engage in a less preferred activity, knowing that a preferred activity (or a reward) will follow. For example, the ‘first’ activity may be something such as handwriting, homework, eating vegetables, using the toilet or visiting the dentist. The ‘then’ activity may be playing outside, computer time or a chocolate treat. \n\nThe App is extremely simple to use, the board is set up from one page, with clear prompts to help along the way. \n\nThe app allows the user to quickly and simply insert photos from the device’s camera or photo library, meaning that ‘First & Then’ boards can be made on-the-go and with little fuss.  Photos taken are saved within the App to use again and again.\n\nThe app includes a coloured visual timer, that the user can choose to use, to show the child how long they need to spend on an activity. As well as a digital display, the time is also represented by a coloured pie chart. When the pie is green, the child needs to keep going. When the pie turns amber, the child needs to get ready to finish. The pie turns red when it is time to stop the activity.\n\nThe app also includes a ‘Finished box’. The child can drag the photo into this box when the activity is completed. \n\nThe App is complete with the option to use exciting tones to reward the child for completing the activity."

      "label": "Team Shake provides a technological and environmentally friendly way to choose teams for board games, sporting events, tournaments, school projects or anytime groups are required. The newest release brings many new features including full iPad support, balancing teams based on skill or gender, importing users from a file, enabling video output, and sharing teams via facebook or email. \n\nTeam Shake is the premier iOS App for creating teams. Instead of a hat and scraps of paper, the user enters his friends' names in his iPhone and gives it a shake. The screen will then display a random set of color-coded teams. These teams can immediately be used for game play or shared via facebook or email.   The quick and easy selection of random (or balanced) teams eliminates fighting over who will be on which team. Innovative use of the iPhone shake gesture gives users the satisfying feeling of shaking a virtual hat without the trouble of carrying around an actual hat. Conventional buttons can also be used for those who would rather not shake their expensive hardware about.  \n\nThe app is designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind. Names can easily be entered with the onscreen keyboard, chosen from the user's contacts, or imported from a file. The email and facebook functions document the members of each individual team as well as preserving the team number and color assigned by the app. For repeated use of Team Shake, lists of friends can be easily saved and loaded later. The current list is also automatically saved so that if you exit the app, or even reboot the device, changes will not be lost. For teachers and others with large lists of people, Team Shake supports the ability to import teams from text or csv files.\n\nIf you have any problems, feature requests, or comments please send an email to support@rhine-o.com. \n\nFeatures:\n\n* Create 1 to 64 random teams\n* Create completely random or balanced teams\n* Full iPad support\n* Eliminates fighting over choosing teams\n* Share / Save teams via email or Facebook\n* Teams can be chosen by the number of teams or by the size of teams.\n* Save lists of friends for later games\n* Import lists from email or spreadsheet\n* Export lists and options for use on another device\n* Satisfying feeling of shaking a “virtual” hat to create teams\n* Animated shaking hat\n* Entry of names via onscreen keyboard\n* Entry of names via iPhone contacts\n* Temporarily disable people who are absent\n* Set groups of people to always be on the same team\n* Set groups of people to always be on different teams\n* Set user strength to make more even teams (now supports fully balanced teams)\n* 5 users strengths level\n* Pick a single random person from the list of players\n* User strength indicator on the main screen (can be disabled in options)\n* Number of active players and total players is now displayed on the main screen\n* Video Out Support\n* Option to Sort Teams by Name\n* Option to balance male / female team members\n* \"Equal Ability\" option to create teams where all players have the same strength\n* Option to create separate male and female teams\n* Configurable Team Colors\n* Configurable Team Names\n* Print Support\n* Export Teams in CSV or XLS Format\n* Team Shake now supports simultaneously assigning players to multiple subteams and / or oppose teams at the same time.\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now have customized names to make selection easier\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now be enabled or disabled globally so that teams can be made quickly without subteams / oppose teams.  In particular, Balance Teams Strengths will work when separate Male / Female teams are created.\n\nYappler-Tags: Teams, Groups, Random, Hat, Entertainment, Games, Utilities"

      "label": "\"This has gone from a great app to an awesome app with the new update. Thanks for listening to our feedback and doing these changes.\" - Customer review\n\"Brilliant - fun way to learn Victorian cursive. I have been waiting for an app like this - a fun way teach Victorian Modern Cursive, an app my special needs son enjoys playing with and learns as he goes.  He can even use a stylus to draw the letters and build the muscle memory in his hand, that can later be transferred to writing with a pencil or pen.  All children will benefit from this app, presenting learning writing in an exciting format, great guides to help learn where to start and stop letters, and great celebration pages to keep them interested and rewarded.  I like that you can use the word lists or make your own so then the app grows with the child into writing full words, not just letters.  I think I will be trying it out with my son's spelling lists too and double benefit - writing and spelling.  It is also great to be able to teach Aussie formats such as Victorian Modern Cursive.... Almost all the apps I have tried have been US based.  Thanks FizzBrain!

Its going tibia ok, the Skelly app is just what you need! With the Skelly app you can literally pull the inspiration you need right out of your pocket anywhere, anytime!\n\nSkelly is a fully poseable, anatomically correct reference skeleton for artists. A simplified version of the skeleton is also included, named “Robo-Skelly”. These figures were created to make the study of anatomy easier and more enjoyable for students and professionals without leaving your wallets bone dry. They can also be used to inspire poses for drawing, painting, sculpting, illustration, animation, comics, manga, storyboarding, twerking, and to fully understand the anatomy of the human skeleton. No need for super gluteus, Skelly comes pre-assembled and ready to pose as soon as you launch the app! \n\nLearning the structure of the human body is the skeleton key to drawing the figure in an anatomically correct manner without having to clear your browser history to avoid awkward conversations with your loved ones. Whether you want to make works like Michelangelo or Miyazaki, Skelly will help you focus on your art and let you personalize his poses, rather than searching for reference material and hiring models. Learn to draw the skeleton from any angle without the inconvenient and morally questionable need to go grave robbing.\n\nFEATURES:\n \nAnatomically correct skeleton\nSimplified “Robo Skelly”\nProportions based on the teachings of Dr. Paul Richer\nSkull fits perfectly into a “Loomis Head” as taught by Andrew Loomis\nPoseable joints\nPose Library - choose from pre made poses and save your own\nMovable camera\nAdjustable light source\nChoose light or dark background\nReset to neutral “Anatomical Pose”\n\nPEOPLE LOVE IT:\n\nJames Gurney, author of ‘Color and Light’ and ‘Imaginative Realism’ Says:\n\n\"Bend him, twist him, contort him! The Skelly app lets you put a virtual human skeleton into any pose, and to see him from any angle, and in any lighting. It’s a great tool for art students or professionals wondering what the skeleton is really doing beneath a life pose, or for anyone wanting to visualize a pose from scratch. The interface is intuitive to learn and easy to use, without sacrificing any of the nuances of the human body’s complex range of movement. Skelly is a big improvement over the old wooden mannikin.\"\n\n- Chris Oatley, Director Of The Oatley Academy Of Visual Storytelling Says:\n\n\"Skelly is the fastest, most fluid anatomical reference I have ever seen. I was shocked at how easy it is to pose the figure and direct the light source. Finally! It’s the app visual artists have been waiting for.\"\n\nHave any questions? CONTACT US:\n\nskelly@proko.com"

      "label": "Little Learners Love Literacy is a sequenced phonics reading program designed to give children success and confidence.  The Stage 7 Unit 4 Tim and Pip chapter books focus on split digraphs such as a-e (tale), I-e (shine), o-e (hope), u-e (huge). A Strange Tale also introduces the change in sound when c and g are followed by an e, i and y , for example, in  cage, nice etc.  Homophones are practised in a game at the end of A Strange Tale. In the story Rise and Shine events are shown in a story mapping format, introducing children to another genre. The teaching notes are detailed giving lots of information about how to introduce new phonemes and graphemes. These engaging stories provide reading practice for children who are mastering split digraphs. \n\n  A Strange Tale\n  Rise and Shine\n  High Hopes\n  A Huge Day\n  Things to Amaze you\n\nWe know how much children love chapter books so we have created 5 mini chapter books with engaging stories by Berys Dixon and beautiful illustrations by Danielle McDonald.  They are books children will LOVE to read with words they CAN read. \n\nUnit 4 books have a recording feature that allows children to record and listen to themselves read. This is an important step in developing fluency, as it gives children a reason to reread and record. \n\nFluency is an important literacy skill requiring accuracy and comprehension. Children need to read with expression to show the understanding of the text. \n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions. \n\nAll words, except the Heart words, can be decoded or ‘sounded out’. To do this, children point to each letter or grapheme, saying the sounds then blending the sounds together to read the word. \n\nThere are NO tricks in the Little Learner books.\n\nNote: Please make sure to enable the microphone on your device when asked or you will not be able to record. Also check that your device is not set to mute when you wish to hear the recording."

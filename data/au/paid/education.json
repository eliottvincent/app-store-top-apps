      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "From the multi award-winning animators and producers of BAFTA nominated pre-school learning favourites Alphablocks and Numberblocks, we bring you Numberblocks Hide and Seek.\n\nAs seen on Cbeebies.\n\nThis app helps your child get to grips with addition, number bonds and other key number skills. Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

Choose your most trusted horse and head off for an adventure in the woods, where you can sleep under the stars in your sleeping bag, then wake up for a swim in the waterfall.\n\nTHE SHOP: When you need more horse tack, head over to the shop — you'll find everything you need.\n\nTRAVEL BETWEEN LOCATIONS\nEach location gives you access to the horse transport, so you can get your horses, equipment, bikes and even characters from here to there. Put what you want to move into the transport, close the door and select the new location by tapping an icon. Everything will arrive in the selected location so you can begin your next adventure!\n\nCREATE AN ORIGINAL VIDEO OF YOUR STORY\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice as you’re telling the story, along with your characters’ movements. Create videos up two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share later!\n\nFEATURES:\n- Explore four locations: stable, arena, forest and shop.\n- Create stories for 24 new characters plus horses and other animals!\n- Care for your horses: feed them, lather them up till they're nice and clean, brush them. \n- Choose outfits from your favorite themes: medieval, western, everyday stable life and fantasy!\n- Hop on to ride bikes in the forest and race motorcycles in the arena!\n- Set up obstacles and show off your horse's jumping skills!\n- Eat at the food court and use the portable potties!\n- Have a campout! \n- Snuggle into your sleeping bag to stay warm under the stars! \n- Take a canoe ride or swim by a waterfall.\n- Make music with magical lily pads!\n- Move horses, characters and objects from here to there in the horse transport! \n- Record your stories in the app and share with your friends!\n- No time limit or high scores — play for as long as you like!\n- No third-party advertising\n\nWE LISTEN\nOne of our top requests for the Toca Life series has been horses!

      "label": "Hit the Button Math is an app designed to help develop mental math and calculation skills.\n\nThe app is aimed at 5-11 year olds. There are 166 different game modes of varying difficulty so it is useful throughout grades K-5. Answer as many questions as possible in minute-long games, or you can now practice without the pressure of a countdown timer - a feature which is new for 2019. Questions are randomly generated which means it is very replayable. The game has been carefully designed for children, with large, widely spaced buttons. We recommend that young children play on a tablet.\n\nSix main topics are covered: \n\n* Times tables - up to 10 or 12 \n* Division - up to 10 or 12\n* Square numbers\n* Number bonds\n* Doubling \n* Halving\n\nBetween these topics, the four standard arithmetic operations are covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nYou can create up to 30 player profiles per device to track an individual's high scores (increased from 15 in 2019). If you prefer there's also the option to play as a guest. All data is stored locally on your device so you don't have to worry about privacy issues. We've also made it very easy for children to quickly switch between profiles after playing a game, if they're sharing a device.\n\nAfter each game, the score achieved is displayed along with the child's high score. Bronze, silver or gold stars and trophies are awarded depending on the score achieved in each game."

      "label": "This guided meditation digital recording and book from New York Times best-selling authors Esther and Jerry Hicks explains  how \"getting into the vortex\" is essential for manifestation using the Law of Attraction. Gain an understanding of what the \"vortex of creation\" means and how you can use meditation to enter the vortex in order to allow the Law of Attraction to work for you. Also gain valuable insights about what happens to your affirmations and manifestation efforts when you are out of the vortex.  Five guided meditation audio sessions with music are included in this app.  \n\nListeners will be led by Abraham through four guided meditation sessions on these topics: General Well-Being, Financial Abundance, Physical Well-Being and Relationships.   Each guided meditation experience is 15 minutes long.   \n\nThis Vortex of Attraction Guided Meditation iPhone App is an exact duplicate of the physical product and includes the complete written text, and the complete audio recording along with an extra bonus track of guided meditation music which was not included with the original product.\n\nMany people exert manifestation and Law of Attraction efforts outside of the Vortex, and then conclude that the Law of Attraction \"doesn't work.\" Find out how to stop efforting and start allowing the Vortex of Creation to align you with the life you desire.  These are the first guided meditation recordings ever produced containing the Teachings of Abraham."

You thought of everything and put it in simple form...\"\n\n• \"As a teacher & parent, I think this is the Best Math Fact App yet. It has all 4 operations and allows you to choose exactly which #'s to drill\"\n\n• “I have purchased many math apps for my 3rd grader and this is the one!!! It has everything I have been looking for. \"\n\n• \"...This is well worth the $0.99 which is cheaper than a single pack of flashcards...\"\n\n\nThis app's core concept was to create a flexible solution that a grade school child can easily navigate and that is robust enough to grow with your child as they grow their math knowledge. \n\nOverview –\n• FLASHCARD mode (practice) – Allows children to practice specific number sets and operators in the proven learning style of flashcards. Watch the flashcards flip like real flashcards!\n\n• CHALLENGE mode (exam) – Lets children test what they have learned by having to type in the answer\n\n• SIMPLE and FLEXIBLE –\n    › Simple enough for your child to set and use\n    › Flexible - Choose ANY combination of operators and number sets \n\n• PROFILES - Add unlimited number of profiles to monitor each child's progress\n\n• PROGRESS REPORTS! - Flexible reporting allows you to filter on numerous items to see your child's progress. \n    › EMAIL Progress Reports - Ability to send your results to teachers, parents, or whoever! (Note: An active email account must be setup on the device to use this feature.)\n\n• ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, MULTIPLICATION, DIVISION\n\n• NUMBER SETS - We designed the app to start at a beginner’s level, but the difficulty can be increased by changing the settings. When working on the number sets with the default settings you will only be adding 0-9 to the selected number set or multiplying each number set by 0-9. (with corresponding subtraction and division problems) In settings, you can change the range from 0-9, to 0-12, 0-15, or 0-20. \n    \n• SETTINGS menu - \n    › Settings are customizable for each profile.\n    › Ability to change the range of numbers from 0-9, to 0-12, 0-15, or 0-20.\n    › Ability to select the number of problems to work in Challenge mode\n    › Ability to set whether missed problems are repeated\n    › Ability to display a timer in Challenge mode\n\n\n• RESULTS menu – Results screen displays after completing a set:\n       › Summary by operator and number set shows the number of items answered right and wrong \n       › Detailed listing of any actual problems missed - Note: When the problems missed are listed, they are shown with what the correct answer should be, not with the incorrect answer typed by the user. This way the user can study the solutions and try to do better next time. \n       › Timed results – Gauge your child's aptitude by reviewing the time to complete a number set. Encourage your child to “beat their time\".\n\n**If you like \"Math Fact Master\", check out our fun math facts games:\n     › Star Math \n     › Mathopolis: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division"

Focus on shorter words, longer words, or words with particular letter combinations. Hide words that a child finds particularly distracting and include words you'd like the child to focus on.\n\n* Category management lets you control which lists of words are visible to children using the app. You can focus on younger vocabulary, older vocabulary, or provide the full range of words.\n\nFirst Sight Words Professional uses uses the same intuitive interface that has made FirstWords so popular with preschoolers, kindergartners, and kids with special needs.

Very easy to use these apps will help support your little ones learning with great illustrations and bright colors. Each app supports kids learning and encourages kids to explore and discover by revealing, rewarding and teaching.”\n-- Fun Educational Apps\n\n“Excellent - As a teacher, I love this game! Just what technology was meant to do!”\n-- iTunes Review\n\n“This app has great settings that let you control the level of difficulty for the child – either with lots of hints or almost none at all. The letters slide nicely into each word and when completed the child is rewarded by having the pictured animal enlarge and animate briefly.”\n--Carisa Kluver at Digital Stortyime\n\n“FirstWords:Deluxe is a very straightforward word-building game. Words are either said letter by letter as they are dragged into the appropriate gray boxes or, if chosen in the settings, a smaller set of words can be sounded out with phonics. This makes this game a treat for both pre-readers and early spellers.”\n--Common Sense Media\n\n\"FirstWords is a great app -- as I said at the time, 'Leo loves First Words because it's fun and easy. I love it because he's learning to spell words, and the interface makes that learning error-free.'\"\n---Shannon Des Roches Rosa at Squidalicious"

Use this app to study for your US Amateur Radio License -- our question pools are always up to date and always have the current question pools because the app can download updates from the website whenever you are connected to the internet.\n\nDesigned and written by hams with volunteer examiner experience and Sponsored by Icom, this is not your typical study app -- most study apps will focus on practice exams, which is somewhat like studying for your math test by throwing darts at your textbook. Though HamStudy is not a full instructional tool our app is focussed on providing you with the tools you need to study the parts of the question pool that you most need to see.\n\nOur intelligent Study Mode tracks your progress as you move through the pool, providing you with full statistics on what you've seen and giving you the visibility into where you need to study. It will automatically repeat questions as needed. When you don't understand something you can tap the \"explain\" button to view an explanation of the question. Practice Exams make it easy to see how close you are to passing and see what areas to focus on in Study Mode.\n\nShare your progress with your friends or instructor and study together!\n\n* Study *all* current US Amateur Radio question pools (Technician, General, Amateur Extra) -- updates can be downloaded for free when they become available. Additional pools, such as the FCC commercial pools and the Canadian pools, are also available for download in the app. \n\n* This app is not a study guide, it is a directed study tool centered around the questions; there are explanations contributed by users for most pools which do help in learning, but some users may want to pair the app with a study manual to get the most out of both.\n\n* HamStudy's revolutionary Study Modes work with you to ensure you learn the questions; they automatically track your progress and adjust the pace to keep you challenged but not frustrated. User-submitted explanations help you avoid the pitfall of just memorizing answers. Synchronize with your online HamStudy.org account to prevent data loss and be able to switch devices easily.\n\n* Share your progress with other HamStudy.org users and help each other keep progressing towards that next license exam!"

It has two audio walking tours and numerous words and phrases to listen to and learn.\n\nThis app is first and foremost created for the next generation of Arrernte people. It has been created to promote Arrernte language and knowledge in Mparntwe, Alice Springs. \n\nWe do language work ampe ingkernerenye mape-ke - for those children who come after us.\nIt’s for the kids first, and for all Arrernte people, so they can be proud of who they are.\nThat’s the most important thing for us.\n\nAnd then secondly, for non-Aboriginal people. So they can akaltye-irremele - learn - and itelaretyeke - understand. So they might understand more about being here on our country - Apmere Mparntwe, and the neighbouring areas.\n\nThe app gives people in Mparntwe another way to access the sound of Central/Eastern Arrernte language alongside the written words, and to see this place through the eyes of a group of Mparntwe’s custodians. It is just one resource in an incredible legacy of enduring knowledge work carried out by Arrernte custodians working today, and those who have come before.\n\nAwemele Itelaretyeke has emerged out of the language project Apmere Angkentye-kenhe (2017-2020). Apmere Angkentye-kenhe was produced and contributed to by many Arrernte people, artists and supporters.\n\nThe app was created through Akeyluerre Healing Centre with financial support from Centrecorp. \nFor any questions, feedback or concerns please contact Akeyluerre Healing Centre.\n\nPEOPLE SPEAKING ON THIS APP\nAlison Ferber, Amelia Kngwarraye Turner, Benedict Stevens, Edward (Arranye) Johnson (d), Felicity Hayes, Gabriel Kngwarraye Turner, Julie Hayes, Lorrayne Gorey, Magdalene Marshall, Margaret Kemarre Turner, Mervyn Rubuntja, Michael Gorey, Peter Coco Wallace, Shirley Kngwarraye Turner, Stephen Kernan, Veronica Kngwarraye Turner, William (Nookie) Lowah, Wyonna Palmer\n\nSOUND ARTISTS\nBryan Phillips, William Lowah, Beth Sometimes, Vito Lucarelli\n\nGRAPHIC DESIGN & ILLUSTRATION\nAmelia Kngwarraye Turner, Beth Sometimes, Magdalene Marshall, Shirley Kngwarraye Turner\n\nAPP DEVELOPMENT\nEdan Baxter - Spinifex Valley"

Included in this app is 8 mind challenging sections, designed to test multiple different areas of your brain, inspired by some of the games used in genuine aptitude tests.\n\nThis application can be connected to the iOS Game Center, which allows a comparison of global scores. You can then see how you fare against your friends and other people around the world.\n\nGames included are as follows; arithmetic test, instrumental comprehension test, SDT tests, multitasking test, spatial awareness test, co-ordination tests, memory tests and a shadowing test.\nAll questions are always computer generated, therefore it is unlikely that the same problem will arise twice.\n\nEvery section comes with an instructions page, which includes a detailed explanation on how to solve each question. Furthermore, at the end of each game you can now review each incorrectly answered question; allowing you to see where you're going wrong.\n\nGood luck in the test!"

Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures.   \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen.\n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n•tap on a word to hear it being read \n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 1\n\n• Sam, Pip, Tim\n• I am Tim\n• My cat Tip\n• The map\n• Sam is it!\n\nChildren can read these books once they know the letters and sounds for m, s, f, a, p, t, c, i.   The books are decodable with some Heart words – the The My my I.  Heart words are words that children need to learn by heart as they cannot ‘decode or sound out” at this stage. There are NO tricks in our Little Learner books.  The books are enhanced with audio – tap on a word to have it read aloud."

      "label": "Winner of the 2018 Children's BAFTA for best Interactive\n\n* As seen on Nick Jr.*\n\nNumbers made fun, with Hey Duggee’s first educational app: The Counting Badge. \n\nSafe ad-free content for your little ones. \n\nThe Counting Badge has been designed with Early Years Foundation Stage learning outcomes at its core. Featuring a diverse mix of engaging counting tasks, with automatically adjusting difficulty levels, the game caters for Duggee fans of all ages. \n\nStart by remembering which day of the week it is and picking what the weather looks like outside -   then move swiftly on to some Early Years brain training! There are nine counting tasks to practice, each with four variations. That's 36 different activities to keep content fresh, while three levels of difficulty ensure that little minds will stay entertained and engaged for longer.\n\n• Tap tadpoles one-by-one, counting up as you go. Keep practising with bubbles, apples and ducks. \n• Pick which of the two groups of spiders matches the number shown on screen. Have another go with the frogs, worms or snails.\n• Count bees as you catch them and place them back in their hive. You'll also need to round up the cows, the chickens and the crows. \n• Put the snakes in order, from smallest to biggest. Practice makes perfect, so keep trying with some socks, totem poles and test tubes.\n• Sort the toucans from the flamingos by placing them in the correct paddling pool. There's plenty more sorting to do with bugs, pizza toppings and clubhouse toys. \n• Count the alligators every time they raise their heads above the water. See if you can perfect your reaction times with rabbits, monkeys and mice. \n• Decide whether there are more tulips or daisies in the field of flowers. Keep working out ‘which is more,’ with bugs, balloons and Jazz Fish.\n• Identify the number that shows how many ants are holding up the hotdog. You'll also need to choose the correct number of penguins, rabbits and birds.\n• And finally, as an early introduction to adding up, work out how many penguins are missing from the iceberg. You’ll need to do some more sums by deciding on the missing number of sandwiches, bananas and birds.\n\nPlaying through five activities will earn the player a Gold Star and every fourth star will see Duggee award them their Counting Badge. Profiles for up to three players can be saved, allowing your little ones to pick up exactly where they left off each time they return to the app. \n\nSo what are you waiting for? Let’s get counting!\n\nKey Features: \n• Counting tasks chosen based on Early Years numeracy learning objectives\n• Designed to cover the varying abilities of the 2 to 6 year old range. \n• Encourages player recognition of days of the week, dates in the month and the weather outside. \n• 36 counting screens keep content fresh and maximise the duration of engagement (9x mechanics each with 4x variations) \n• Stored player profiles regulate difficulty progression for each counting mechanic (3x difficulty levels)\n• Gold star collection mechanic plus daily award of the Counting Badge encourages repeat plays\n\nCustomer Care:\nIf you experience any technical issues with this app please get in touch.

      "label": "Open up the world-famous Peekaboo Barn, perfect for toddlers. \n\nInside the little bouncing barn, friendly farm animals are waiting to pop out and surprise your little one. Try and guess who they are; tap the doors to find out! More animals, animations, and sounds than ever.\n\nWork with your child to learn the names of animals and hear the sounds they make. Younger children will love opening the barn doors to find new animal animations, as they learn about cause and effect and become familiar with animal names and sounds. Older children will enjoy guessing animals by sound, then seeing the animal names, which helps develop early literacy skills.  \n\nMultiple Language Features:\n\nWe started with a child's voice in English. It's her real voice, which some kids really enjoy, but she does say \"wabbit\" and \"wooster.\" If this is a concern for you, you can switch to any of 12 adult voices; our adult narrators say everything clearly and perfectly, just like the teachers they are. You can try many languages from around the world—or record your own language, or grandma's voice. There are tons of ways to explore the languages of Peekaboo Barn!\n\nPress the Language button on the Options screen to try them out.\n\n—Choose from the built-in narrators: child's voice in young English; adult's voice in American English or Spanish.\n—World languages also included: Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, German, French, Australian, and UK English. \n—Record your own voice: We added this feature so parents, children, and visiting relatives and friends can capture their own voices and star in Peekaboo Barn.  Now you can record the animal names in your native language--or grandma's voice, or grandpa's--and, if you're recording a new language, you can save the appropriate written version too, and both will show up the next time you play. (Please note, we can only support the writing systems that are supported by your device.)\n\nFEATURED BY APPLE \nOne of the first apps to be released for toddlers, since 2008 Peekaboo Barn has been downloaded over a million times, and played over 100 million times worldwide.  It has been a top 20 educational game on the iTunes store nearly every day since its launch, and has been featured by Apple often.  It won The Best Toddler App Ever award in 2009, and was named one of the top 50 iPhone apps for kids by Babble.com in 2010 and 2011.  It is recommended by The New York Times, MSNBC, USA Today, Wired, Telegraph UK, Ireland’s The Independent, Parents Magazine, and the Washington Post.\n\nPeekaboo Barn was made for you and your toddler by artists and educators, not marketers, robots, or companies repackaging clip art. Our team has backgrounds in cognitive science and child development, and we’ve worked in educational media everywhere from Penguin USA to the Smithsonian Institution. When you could really use a safe distraction--in airports, restaurants, and waiting rooms--or you'd like to try something new with your little genius, Peekaboo Barn is the educational, artful solution. Enjoy! \n\nIf you are looking for more Peekaboo, check out our awesome cousins: Peekaboo Fridge, Peekaboo Forest, and Peekaboo Wild.\n\nIf your kids are ready for a more complex game with the same great characters, please try Peekaboo Barn Farm Day! Many activities to try: for example, you can milk the cow, shear the sheep and llama, and pet the animals to help them fall sleep.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/nightanddaystudios. \nTwitter: @nightdaystudios \nYour privacy is important to us!

The user can begin by reading the companion book, When Do I Have to Wait? Using the waiting board, the top picture indicates the reason why the child is waiting and a timer can be set to show how long the child will wait. The child can then choose an activity to do while waiting. \n\nFeelings Board \nThe Feelings Board provides a tool for helping children understand and express emotions. The user can begin by reading the companion book, When I Get Upset, to provide an example of how the child might recognize an emotion and choose a coping strategy. On the Feelings Board, the user can then help the child indicate how they are feeling from a range of options, select a coping strategy, and then request an activity to help them feel better or re-engage with others. \n\nFeelings Scale\nHelps users identify, manage and cope with feelings across environments throughout the day. By tracking their feelings on the board, users can analyze the data for trends to learn if tasks done at different times of day or in different environments affect outcome. Environments and schedules can then be altered to achieve better results.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.beevisual.com/mobile-app-eula.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.beevisual.com/mobile-app-privacy.html"

      "label": "From the creator of Flashnote Derby comes a fun and educational app that helps kids learn about rhythm and how it is written with music notation.\n\nStudents will love outwitting the nasty crocodile by tapping rhythms correctly. A variety of levels take students from simply keeping a steady beat up through all different types of notes and rests. The humorous gameplay will keep them motivated to master each new concept. \n\nEach level of Rhythm Swing has a brief instructional video which explains the new rhythm concept. Students can view and listen to short musical phrases and hear exactly how they sound. In practice mode, you can attempt hundreds of rhythms until they are mastered. Helpful feedback will guide you in fixing any mistakes. When the student is ready, they can progress to the game, which requires precise accuracy. \n\nTypes of Rhythms Covered:\nQuarter Notes and Quarter Rests\nHalf Notes and Half Rests\nWhole Notes and Whole Rests\nDotted Half Notes\nEighth Notes and Eighth Rests\n4/4, 3/4, and 2/4 Time Signatures\n\nMore levels featuring more complex rhythms are coming soon!\n\nHere's what some of our early reviewers are saying...\n\n\"My students and I LOVED Rhythm Swing. It was a real eye opener as to which of my students could instinctively keep a steady beat.\"\n- K. W., piano teacher\n\n\"This is a great app. I am using it with beginners. It helps to maintain the steady beat ...at different tempos. What makes it different from other rhythm apps is that it requires holding half notes for two full counts, it progresses slowly enough to use with beginners and it uses different tempi in each level. Thank you!\"\n- J. Z., piano teacher\n\n\"After playing with Rhythm Swing for awhile my students and I have grown to enjoy it.  Most of them like the practice section better than the game because they feel less pressure but eventually they all get around to playing the game.  I have all positive things to say about it so far... Keep up the great work!\"\n- S. C., piano teacher"

YOU can do it and it WILL be rewarding!\n\nIt can be difficult to learn signs accurately by looking at pictures or a diagram. With Baby's First Signs you will learn the first essential 29 signs using high quality, moving images demonstrating how to perform each sign. \n\nWe do not include \"filler\" signs that you are not likely to use (such as \"donkey\" or \"fireworks\"), that would just be noise and get in the way. Instead we focus on the signs that are practical and likely to be used most frequently!\n\nThis is at your finger tips in seconds, making it ideal to easily:\n- pull up a quick sign in the middle of a teachable moment\n    - (feeding, changing diaper, etc)\n- teach and share with grandparents so they can experience the joy of signing with baby\n- review and learn signs during quiet times in your favorite glider chair\n\nIt can be difficult to understand your  baby when they are frustrated  but can't yet vocalize what they want. Baby signing could help you to understand what your baby wants without them having the ability to speak. A less frustrated baby means a happier baby (and parent).\n\nBaby signing also supplements language development as it helps to naturally build richer understanding of concepts and language.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- High quality videos gifs demonstrating how to perform signs (with two different angles)\n- Save signs you want to teach baby in your favorites list so they are easy to pull up when you need them\n- Challenge yourself with our mini quiz!\n- Great tips and and suggestions to help you get the most out of signing with baby.\n- All signs are ASL variants, making it easy to scale up and learn more sign language in the future!\n\nJoin the army of parents that are already communicating with their babies and expanding their brain development!"

The dictionary also contains the Horus, Birth, and Throne names of all the known Pharaohs and Queens of Egypt. Our dictionary has more than twice the content of any other smartphone translation apps.\n\nHieroglyphics Pro has several modes: \n    Beginner, Student and Pro. \nBeginner mode uses a minimal set of 200 glyphs and an easy pronunciation guide. \nStudent mode allows choice of over 700 glyphs, organized by shape, and standard transliteration. \nThe Pro mode uses all 1,071 glyphs in Gardiner's classic categories with over 1200 additional New Kingdom and later signs.  \n\nA unique feature of Hieroglyphics Pro is the ability to find glyphs by how often they are used in inscriptions. Adding the common signs to a phrase or word is a snap! Egyptian words and phrases are drawn graphically in groups, in the artistic style of the ancient inscriptions.\n\nThe App now offers 4 ways to enter Hieroglyphs for translation:  \n    •Graphically from Gardiner groupings, or in Beginner Mode, Manley's Groupings\n      - A unique feature allows finding glyphs sorted by their frequency of use!\n    •Direct keyboard text entry of Gardiner codes (i.e., A1, D21, Aa2) and phonetic shortcuts as defined by the MdC (i.e., Htp, nTr,  r, etc.)\n    •By transliteration symbol from the MdC table\n    •Searching for keywords in a glyph's description or determinative words\n\n    Text entries of Gardiner Codes and MdC can now be edited with a cursor and finger swiping, just like other text editing apps!\n\nVery quick and convenient! \n\nHieroglyph Pro is the first and only mobile App to introduce Hieratic glyphs, and how they evolved over the centuries.\n\nHieroglyphics Pro is a modern iOS 16 App, back compatible to iOS 13, Dark Mode and all. It contains help files and links to both on-line references and to printed books for advanced study.\n\nHieroglyphics Pro has been developed and evolved in consultation with professional Egyptologists."

      "label": "The Decodable Readers Australia books support a systematic approach of learning to read. This approach ensures kids are given the “right-fit” book.  Decodable, or phonic readers, only contain words made up of the sounds a child has learnt. Within each level in the Decodable Readers Australia Series, a new group of sounds is introduced. As children move through each level the sounds progress from simple to complex.\n\nThe Decodable Readers Australia – Level 1 books introduce the sounds s, a, t, p, i, n. All the words in each of the 20 books in Level 1 are made up of only these sounds and minimal sight words. This small number of sounds and the opportunity to practice using 20 different fun and engaging stories about Nat and her bush friends, allows children to master the beginnings of the basic code as well as blending and tracking.\n\nEach story in Level 1 can be enjoyed by listening to the professional audio or read aloud with the support of tapping and hearing the word if required. The audio function can be controlled independently within each page. Both parents and teachers can support children with phonemic awareness, vocab, comprehension and development through the use of the pre-reading and post-reading activities provided within each story. \n\nKey Features:\n•\tlisten to each story being read to them using the audio function\n•\tuse each book to practice reading independently \n•\ttap each word to hear the sounds and the word if support is needed\n•\ttap to turn each page for individual reading pace\n•\tall Australian themes and characters\n•\tbeautifully illustrated with detail for engagement and enjoyment"

      "label": "Designed by an Occupational Therapist.\nFirst & Then is a very simple app that uses a board with photos to show that one activity must happen before the next can occur. A fantastic tool for visual learners! \n\nThe idea behind a First & Then board is to encourage a child to complete an activity that they don’t particularly enjoy. The board motivates the child to engage in a less preferred activity, knowing that a preferred activity (or a reward) will follow. For example, the ‘first’ activity may be something such as handwriting, homework, eating vegetables, using the toilet or visiting the dentist. The ‘then’ activity may be playing outside, computer time or a chocolate treat. \n\nThe App is extremely simple to use, the board is set up from one page, with clear prompts to help along the way. \n\nThe app allows the user to quickly and simply insert photos from the device’s camera or photo library, meaning that ‘First & Then’ boards can be made on-the-go and with little fuss.  Photos taken are saved within the App to use again and again.\n\nThe app includes a coloured visual timer, that the user can choose to use, to show the child how long they need to spend on an activity. As well as a digital display, the time is also represented by a coloured pie chart. When the pie is green, the child needs to keep going. When the pie turns amber, the child needs to get ready to finish. The pie turns red when it is time to stop the activity.\n\nThe app also includes a ‘Finished box’. The child can drag the photo into this box when the activity is completed. \n\nThe App is complete with the option to use exciting tones to reward the child for completing the activity."

      "label": "Squeebles Punctuation is the latest addition to the chart-topping Squeebles series, designed in association with school teachers. Suitable for ages 5 - 11, the app allows children to practice all aspects of punctuation. \n\nHelp rescue the Squeebles from the clutches of the nasty Grammar Ghost and Punctuation Pest, the latest mean villains to cause havoc on Squeeble Island. By answering punctuation questions across four different game modes, children will have fun earning rewards and rescuing 24 Squeeble characters.\n\nThe four game modes are:\n\n> Punctuation Placement - move punctuation into the correct places, across a wide variety of sentences. Children can choose from 5 categories of punctuation:\n\n- Full stops and capital letters\n- Question marks and exclamation marks\n- Commas\n- Colons, commas and semi-colons\n- Speech marks\n\n> It's or Its - muddling up the possessive \"its\" and the contraction \"it's\" is easily done and leads to frequent confusion. This game mode allows children to assess context within a sentence and fill in any blanks with the appropriate its/it’s.\n\n> Possessive Apostrophes - drag apostrophes into the correct places, being mindful of whether the subject matter is singular or plural (i.e. the boy’s apples or the boys’ apples). Beginners are given pictorial clues, while those using advanced levels are shown text-based pointers. \n\n> Contraction Capers - give the correct contraction for the given phrase (i.e. you have = you’ve). Features all common contractions in US English.\n\nMost game modes offer various difficulty levels and the app is set up to allow younger children to start with the very basics of punctuation, such as full stops and capital letters, before moving on to more complex ideas and concepts.\n\nFrequent rewards are given for answering questions correctly, which incentivises children to continue practicing. Rewards include: earning turns on a fun mini-game, where children race a hot air balloon across the ocean; winning 24 new Squeebles characters (including those designed by our latest competition winners); and earning stars, which can be traded for balloons to use in the balloon racing game.\n\nA password-protected Parent/Teacher Zone includes a stats section, which allows you to see progress by all children using the app. This includes 28 days of detailed stats, showing scores, any questions that have been answered and any incorrect answers, so that you can identify if the same types of mistakes are consistently being made.\n\nUnlimited children can be registered with the app and, as with all our apps, there are no in-app purchases, no advertising and no internet links of any kind.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions for features you'd like to see added, please e-mail info@keystagefun.co.uk"

      "label": "Every musician should work on Ear Training (or Aural Training) and Interval Ear Training is a very important element of ear training. To put it very simply, you will learn to recognise the relationship between two notes (by distance), when they are played together or apart!\n\nThere are two types of interval listening, harmonic and melodic. In harmonic intervals the notes are played at the same time and in melodic the notes are played one after the other. Easy to remember: Melodic Intervals make melody, Harmonic Intervals make harmony!\n\nMany of you will probably want to understand how the names are found and how to work out the interval note names in every key. For this info you probably want to check out my ebook Practical Music Theory (available from justinguitar.com) which will explain all the theory related to this.\n\nThis app deals specifically with Interval Ear Training, both melodic and harmonic. It will start very easy and gradually get harder as you get more correct and can pass each stage. You can choose from Piano or Guitar Input for your answers, and you can chose to hear the notes and guitar or piano. Personally, I'd recommend getting used to both. In \"Training Mode\" you can select specific intervals to work on if you are struggling with just specific intervals or types of interval.\n\nI'm sure you'll find this app very helpful, all you need to add is practice time! \n\nBest wishes, Justin"

      "label": "Thousands of schools use First Words to help their students develop pre-reading, early reading, and language skills.  Now there’s a version of First Words specifically for educators and speech language pathologists. Of course, it's great for kids at home, too!\n \nFirst Words Professional has the same child-friendly design and uncluttered interface that made First Words one of the all-time best selling lines of educational apps for iOS.  The new additional features make it the ideal choice for individual, institutional and professional use:\n\n* More Words --- Over 350 words in 12 categories, including shapes, numbers, food, feelings, clothes, animals, and more.\n* Six Languages --- Options include American English, British English, Spanish, French, German, and Japanese.\n* Phonics -- English word lists includes options for spelling with phonics or letter names.\n* Category Management --- Choose which categories of words are shown to students.  Hide word lists that you don't want them to see.\n* Word Management --- Choose which words to include in each category.  Focus on shorter words, longer words, or words with particular letter combinations. Hide words that your child finds particularly distracting.\n\nFirst Words Professional uses the same intuitive interface that is so easy for preschoolers, kindergartners, and kids with special needs to use. They'll giggle with delight at the beautifully drawn pictures and entertaining sounds, all the while learning how letters correspond to sounds and how letters sounds form words.\n\nFirst Words Professional helps kids develop:\n \n* Fine Motor Control\n* Letter Recognition\n* Phonemic Awareness\n* Word Recognition\n \nFirst Words Professional includes a large number options:\n \n* Phonics or Letter Names\n* Uppercase, Lowercase, or Capitalized Words\n* Spell Words Slowly or Quickly\n* Serif or Sans-Serif font\n \nHere's what educators and reviewers have said about earlier versions First Words:\n \n“First Words is an app that teaches letters and words in fun and interactive way.  Very easy to use these apps will help support your little ones learning with great illustrations and bright colors. Each app supports kids learning and encourages kids to explore and discover by revealing, rewarding and teaching.”\n-- Fun Educational Apps\n\n“Excellent - As a teacher, I love this game! Just what technology was meant to do!”\n-- iTunes Review\n \n“This app has great settings that let you control the level of difficulty for the child – either with lots of hints or almost none at all. The letters slide nicely into each word and when completed the child is rewarded by having the pictured animal enlarge and animate briefly.”\n--Carisa Kluver at Digital Stortyime\n \n“First Words Deluxe is a very straightforward word-building game. Words are either said letter by letter as they are dragged into the appropriate gray boxes or, if chosen in the settings, a smaller set of words can be sounded out with phonics. This makes this game a treat for both pre-readers and early spellers.”\n--Common Sense Media\n \n“Looking to guide your toddler towards recognizing letters and how to spell words up to eight letters long?  Then First Words Deluxe might be just what you are looking for. This pre-reader and spelling application encourages vocabulary development in a wide range of categories such as: vehicles, animals, at home, colors, and shapes.”\n--Andrea Gardner at Applicable2u\n \n\"First Words is a great app -- as I said at the time, 'Leo loves First Words because it's fun and easy. I love it because he's learning to spell words, and the interface makes that learning error-free.'\"\n---Shannon Des Roches Rosa at Squidalicious"

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "The Decodable Readers Australia books support a systematic approach of learning to read. This approach ensures kids are given the “right-fit” book. Decodable, or phonic readers, only contain words made up of the sounds a child has learnt. Within each level in the Decodable Readers Australia Series, a new group of sounds is introduced. As children move through each level the sounds progress from simple to complex.  The Decodable Readers Australia – Level 7 books introduce the sounds a_e, e_e, i_e, o_e, u_e, a (baby), e (we), y (funny), i (find), y(sky), o (go)\nOur Level 8 books introduce the sounds aw (draw), ew (drew), ou (touch), air (chair), are (dare), ear (pear), eer (cheer), ore (more), dge (edge), tch (match).  All the words in each of the 20 books in Level 7/8 are made up of these sounds and those introduced in Level 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5/6 along with minimal sight words. After having mastered the Level 1, 2, 3, 4, 5/6 sounds and the reading skills of blending and tracking, children should have gained the confidence to read Australian stories with new words and more text on each page.  Each story in Level 7/8 can be enjoyed by listening to the professional audio or read aloud with the support of tapping and hearing the word if required. The audio function can be controlled independently within each page. Both parents and teachers can continue to support children with vocab and comprehension development through using the post-reading activities provided within each story. An addition to the Level 5/6 readers are the wide range of pre-reading activities that can be used to help set the purpose for reading.  Key Features:  • listen to each story being read to them using the audio function  • use each book to practice reading independently  • tap each word to hear the sounds and the word if support is needed  • tap to turn each page for individual reading pace  • all Australian themes and characters  • beautifully illustrated with detail for engagement and enjoyment"

The app is designed to help children understand why they feel a certain feeling and behave in productive way.\n\nThe app has full sound and also text and ability to record responses rather than type if preferred.\n\nThere is a game mode just for some fun.\n\nThis resilience strategy is based on the idea that negative thoughts or the negative stories we tell ourselves are not wrong - but sometimes they are not true. Kids need to learn to catch the negative thinking that is stressful, challenge the thinking and if needed change their thinking to be more optimistic and less anxious. \n\nThis strategy is great for adults too.\n\nThe four positive penguins take you on an interactive journey to help you understand that feelings arise from your thinking and if you challenge your negative thoughts successfully you may be able to see things in a more realistic and even optimistic way.\n\nSee Positive Penguins on Facebook or our website for further information and resources"

      "label": "There's never been a better time to get into Astronomy! Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

Can you tell the difference between excitement and fear, or between aggression and the need to play?\r\n\r\nDog language can be confusing, but with the help of Dog Decoder, you’ll understand your dog’s signals like a pro.\r\n\r\nDog Decoder will teach you everything you need to know about how your dog communicates, so you can not only avoid bites, but share in a more satisfying, healthy, and loving relationship.\r\n\r\n=== MEET “DIAMOND” === \r\n\r\nDiamond is your tour guide and trainer. He will show you how he looks when he’s afraid, when he’s stressed, when he’s just about to bite, and when he wants to play. \r\n\r\n=== DOG POSTURES ===\r\n\r\nThere are about SIXTY different poses on display in Dog Decoder. Each pose is beautifully and expressively illustrated by one of the world’s top dog artists.\r\n\r\nEach pose comes with a diagram, pointing out where on Diamond’s body he’s indicating how he’s feeling. For example, in the poses for “fear,” the diagram will point out Diamond’s tucked tail, his ears pulled back, etc. We won’t just show you a picture of a scared dog — we’ll teach you what to look for, the signs of fear.\r\n\r\nEach pose also comes with a helpful description of the context. This is where you will learn about some common misconceptions, or what kinds of situations will cause your dog to assume each posture.\r\n\r\n=== TEST YOURSELF! ===\r\n\r\nThe best way to see how much you’ve learned is to take the quiz! Some of the quiz questions are pretty challenging. Diamond wants to make sure you don’t get fooled next time he’s hiding under the coffee table or drooling – will you recognize the early warning signs of stress? Will you be able to warn your children when your dog is clearly done playing?"

      "label": "Welcome to The Spalding Method ™ Phonograms app!\nNOTICE: Upon installing this mobile application, you are agreeing to the terms and conditions.\nThis Spalding Phonograms app is designed for helping students learn the phonics connection between speech sounds and written symbols that represent those sounds (phonograms). Learning the phonograms is essential for accurate and automatic reading, writing, and spelling. Teaching all the sounds of the phonemes represented by an alphabet letter or combination of two, three, or four letters (phonograms) enables students to read, spell, and write high-frequency words quickly. Students who learn the phonograms well expand their vocabulary and are able to use effective and creative communication skills in writing. Critical thinking is involved in learning the appropriate phonogram placement within words for accurate spelling and for applying information learned during phonogram reviews to pronounce unfamiliar words. \nThe Spalding Phonograms app is for students that need additional practice, including home schooling, ESL (English as a Second Language), ELL (English Language Learners), ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) students, and those with dyslexia or other learning disabilities. The school and home connection is encouraged through collaboration and communication with the teacher, parent, and student for practicing the phonograms appropriately and adequately. The Spalding  Phonograms app aligns with the core reading foundational skills required by state and national standards that are most crucial to the development of early reading success and reading comprehension, including:\n•\tPhonemic awareness\n•\tFeature recognition\n•\tLetter recognition\n•\tSound-symbol relationships (decoding)\nThe Spalding Phonograms app provides the following options for all 87 phonograms.\n•\tPhonogram Introduction by selected group – The student sees the phonograms in order of instruction in The Writing Road to Reading, listens to the teacher say the sound(s), and then says the sound(s).\n•\tOral Phonogram Review – A random phonogram card is show, followed by a pause. The student says the sound(s) and then listens to check accuracy. \n•\tWritten Phonogram Review –The student hears the phonogram sounds, followed by a pause; the student repeats the sound(s), listens for a cue, if needed, and then writes the phonogram on lined paper. The card is immediately shown so the student can check for accuracy.\n•\tDifferentiated Practice – Specific phonograms (from all 87) can be selected that need more practice. These phonograms can then be practiced in Phonogram Introduction, Oral Phonogram Review, or Written Phonogram Review."

Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures.   \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen. \n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n• tap on a word to hear it being read \n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 4\n\n• At the fun run\n• Mud\n• In the log hut\n• On the bus\n• The big red box\n\nStage 4  sounds include the initial alphabetic code – a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p qu r s t u v w x y z\nNew Heart words : he to was we she\n\nThese five books use all the sounds of the initial alphabetic code.

You can travel around the world with numerous flying objects, cars and ships.\nYou can disguise yourself as a Viking, pirate or pilot. \n\nWith its numerous objects, this \"\"digital doll's house\"\" is perfect for creative role-playing.\nYour children will learn about the special features of different countries (Mexico, USA, India, France, the Caribbean and Germany) and discover differences but also numerous similarities.\nTo ensure that no child feels excluded, Fiete World contains a variety of people with different skin colours.\n\nNEW in this version: \nMEXICO\nWith horses, jeep, or pick-up truck through the jungle, walking through the city with a huge mechanical skeleton or with a hot air balloon over the cactus-covered desert. \nFeeding jungle animals, making chocolate, painting murals, making tacos or fighting with wrestlers. Mexico offers a lot of extreme variety.\n\nUSA\nChildren can ride a Ferris wheel in the colourful theme park and re-enact the moon landing or Jurassic Park in the film studio. They play with Kong the giant ape, visit the school and the record shop and when they are hungry they visit the burger shop or eat something at the hot dog stand. Then they can go to work at the harbour, play with the crane and unload ships.\n\nFRANCE\nIn venerable France, for example, children can sit in the evening in a chic café on the Seine under the Eiffel Tower, or they can play robber and gendarme with the police. Of course there is also a police helicopter, a police boat and a police car.\n\nINDIA\nIn densely populated India, the children can harvest tropical fruits and squeeze juices, change tires in the Auto Werkstadt, ride an elephant or work on the latest robot technology. What is particularly exciting here are the clear contrasts between tradition and technology.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS OF THE APP\n- Discover a huge world\n- Switch between day and night mode\n- Go on a treasure hunt, sail the pirate ship\n- Ride an elephant, dinosaur \n- Play with a robot or with a huge skeleton\n- Fell trees and use the wood to make a fire\n- Disguise yourself\n- plant flowers and vegetables\n- Change the wheels of all cars\n- Bake a cake\n- Fly a helicopter, a jet, a historic aircraft, a hot air balloon or a U.F.O.\n- have a picnic on the beach - deliver packages\n- Send postcards around the world\n- Discover souvenirs from all over the world in Fiete's room\n\nIMPROVE CHILDREN\n- Fantasy role playing games\n- Telling your own stories\n- Experiment\n- Interaction with others\n- Understanding the world\n- Open-mindedness\n\nABOUT US\nWe are Ahoiii, a small app development studio from Cologne.

      "label": "The Baby Sensory Signbook app teaches you all signs you need, so you and your baby can start communication and language development. Learn to communicate long before the development of speech, using our simple Babysigns.\n\n\nFEATURES \n- All official Baby Sensory baby signs right in your pocket.\n- Find a sign in 3 simple steps with the easy interface.\n- Make a list of favourites, for the signs you're learning.\n- Learn 'Say Hello' and 4 other songs' signs with music.\n- Looping videos, so you can easily see how it’s done.\n- Slow down the video, to better view the hand shapes.\n\n\nABOUT THE APP\nWith the Baby Sensory app, you can easily learn all official signs to make early communication possible. This creates a stronger parent-child bond and stimulates early language development.\nEven the youngest baby wants to tell you what they need and how they feel. But they’re unable to express themselves verbally and may cry if their needs are not met. Signing helps your baby to express his or her needs and takes the guesswork out of parenting.\n\n\nABOUT US\nBaby Sensory was the first baby programme to offer a complete approach to learning and development from birth to 13 months. Designed to stimulate, educate and provide precious memories during the all-important first years of life, the programme has won multiple awards both nationally and internationally since 2008. Everything we do is backed by over 35 years of expert research in childhood development. \n\n\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the app, please let us know. Send us a message or see www.babysensory.com for more info.\n\n\nCONTACT\nWebsite: www.babysensory.com\nMail: apps@babysensory.com\n\n\n\nWe are super excited to hear what you think of our little app!\nSend your thoughts and tips to: apps@babysensory.com\n\nLike and follow us to stay up to date on future updates:\nwww.facebook.com/BabySensoryUK\nwww.twitter.com/BabySensoryHQ"

The goal is to solve the puzzles and roll through the end of the maze where a new Thinkroll waits to be unlocked and lead the next quest! \n\nHOW TO PLAY\n\nThe app offers 207 clever puzzle levels filled with fun science concepts. Seven playful elements with unique physical properties are gradually introduced.

The puzzles gradually build upon successive science lessons to strengthen observation, creative thinking, logic, problem solving, spatial cognition and memory.\n\nThere are unlimited tries and no penalties. Thinkrolls not only challenges the brain but also develops and rewards patience and perseverance. As kids try different combinations to achieve their goal, they intuitively learn through trial and error what works. They must think ahead, use precise timing and rely on their memory to reunite their Thinkroll buddies. \n________________________________\n\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n\n• 207 levels with mind-sharpening puzzles\n• Easy mode for ages 3-5, hard mode for ages 5-8\n• Hands-on physics lessons\n• Experiment with gravity, heat, buoyancy, speed, elasticity, friction and other science concepts\n• Enhance logic, spatial cognition, problem solving, memory, perseverance \n• 26 hilarious, super smart characters to play with\n• Fun brain training for the whole family\n• Track progress for up to 9 player profiles\n• Supreme design and beautiful artwork\n• Original soundtrack and sound design\n• Language neutral game-play\n• COPPA compliant, no 3rd party ads, no in-app purchases\n\nMore info: avokiddo.com\n________________________________\n\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\nWe respect your privacy!

For each letter you will be able to:\n\n• See it in great detail.\n• Hear the proper pronunciation of its phonemes.\n• Hear the proper pronunciation of its name.\n• See and hear a common Arabic word which begins with that letter.\n\nArabic Alphabet is not only fun, but it's also accurate because it was developed by a native Arabic speaker, and all audio samples were recorded by a college professor of Arabic.\n\n\"I was born and raised in Morocco with Arabic as my language of origin. When I moved to America, I wanted to be sure that I didn't lose my identity and my culture. After my first son was born, this became even more important to me as I want him to understand the importance of his heritage. I developed Arabic Alphabet so that adults and children alike could have a fun way to accurately learn the foundations of the language. I hope you enjoy it!\" —from the developer\n\nWe have finally added two in-app upgrades, so that you can expand your learning:\n\n• The Write feature which allows you to “finger-write” on the screen so that you can memorize and perfect the strokes for each character.\n• The Quiz feature which will help you put everything you’ve learned to the test.    With a little practice, you’ll learn to recognize and write the Arabic Alphabet in no time!"

      "label": "Tap images. Type words. Speak. Proloquo2Go is an easy to use communication app for people who cannot speak or need help being understood. Featuring natural sounding voices, including real children’s voices, Proloquo2Go is a simple yet powerful AAC (augmentative and alternative communication) tool. The app is fully customizable and can be utilized to build language skills and grow with a person’s communication, supporting both beginning and advanced communicators.\n\nParents, therapists, teachers and users around the world recognize Proloquo2Go as the gold standard in AAC solutions. The app is used by people with autism, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, Angelman syndrome, and others with speech difficulties. The app is available in English, Spanish, French, and Dutch and supports bilingual use, so you can switch languages on the fly.\n\nProloquo2Go in action:\n\nLearn and grow\n\nStudies show that just 200-400 words make up 80% of what we say. Known as core words, they act as the basis of Proloquo2Go’s research-based Crescendo™ vocabulary. Users can grow from single words to full sentences in the same app. Crescendo puts core words in consistent locations for easy access and motor-planning. The vocabulary works with AAC best practices like modeling (where you use an AAC system to talk with the user) to develop language skills. Crescendo offers no limit on language development with a 10,000+ fringe word vocabulary and customizable vocabulary levels. Finally, with Progressive Language, words are gradually revealed step-by-step, helping users learn words and their location as their communication expands.\n\nEasy editing\n\nCustomizing Proloquo2Go is a breeze! Quickly and easily add new words. Use the app’s built-in library of 25,000 symbols or use your own photos by taking pictures within the app or selecting them from your photo library. For users with fine-motor challenges and vision impairments, Proloquo2Go offers options like 23 pre-programmed grid sizes and accessibility settings which support switch scanning and Apple’s VoiceOver screen reader. Everything from appearance to access is customizable so you can make it your own. \n\nType and speak\n\nBesides tapping images, Proloquo2Go also lets you type what you want to say. The app includes a Grid Keyboard arranged alphabetically for people learning to type. For more experienced typists, Proloquo2Go includes a Typing View with a QWERTY keyboard and word prediction that offers suggestions based on what you are typing. \n\nHello! ¡Hola! Bonjour! Hallo!\n\nProloquo2Go lets you select a language and region for the Crescendo vocabulary. Two languages can be used at the same time, allowing seamless bilingual speech. Over 100 included downloadable natural-sounding adult and children’s voices rounds out your choices to use the app your way.\n\nA helping hand\n\nAssistiveWare is here for you every step of the way. Help articles in Proloquo2Go are there whenever you need them. New to AAC? Our website has easy to understand articles in the Learn AAC section, and the AssistiveWare Core Word Classroom includes activities for teaching communication effectively. You can also connect directly with our community of parents, professionals, and users on our Facebook groups. If you have any questions, our support team is available 7 days a week and is always happy to help. All of these online resources can be accessed by going to the AssistiveWare website. \n\nNote: Discounts are available through Apple’s Educational Volume Purchase Program – 50% off on 20 licenses or more. Joan Bruno’s Gateway to Language & Learning© vocabulary is available as an in-app purchase (English only)."

Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books \nwith real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures. \n\nStage 7 Unit 2  introduces and practises the vowel graphemes - ar or er ir ur air.\n\nIt also introduces a new recording feature that allows children to record and \nhear themselves read. This is an important step in developing fluency, as it gives \nchildren a reason to reread and record.  Fluency is an important literacy skill \nrequiring accuracy and comprehension. \n\nStages 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5 have professionally recorded and produced audio.  However, \nStages Plus 4, 6, & 7 allow children to read and record themselves.  Children are now more confident readers and will benefit from this new recording feature. They will enjoy checking their accuracy by following the words in the book and listening to themselves read.\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions. \nAll words, except the Heart words, can be decoded or ‘sounded out’. To do this, children point to each letter or grapheme, saying the sounds then blend the sounds together to read the word. \n\nThere are NO tricks in the Little Learner books.\n\nNote: Please make sure to enable the microphone on your device when asked or you will not be able to record anything. Also make sure your device is not set to mute to hear the audio back."

It has two audio walking tours and numerous words and phrases to listen to and learn.\n\nThis app is first and foremost created for the next generation of Arrernte people. It has been created to promote Arrernte language and knowledge in Mparntwe, Alice Springs. \n\nWe do language work ampe ingkernerenye mape-ke - for those children who come after us.\nIt’s for the kids first, and for all Arrernte people, so they can be proud of who they are.\nThat’s the most important thing for us.\n\nAnd then secondly, for non-Aboriginal people. So they can akaltye-irremele - learn - and itelaretyeke - understand. So they might understand more about being here on our country - Apmere Mparntwe, and the neighbouring areas.\n\nThe app gives people in Mparntwe another way to access the sound of Central/Eastern Arrernte language alongside the written words, and to see this place through the eyes of a group of Mparntwe’s custodians. It is just one resource in an incredible legacy of enduring knowledge work carried out by Arrernte custodians working today, and those who have come before.\n\nAwemele Itelaretyeke has emerged out of the language project Apmere Angkentye-kenhe (2017-2020). Apmere Angkentye-kenhe was produced and contributed to by many Arrernte people, artists and supporters.\n\nThe app was created through Akeyluerre Healing Centre with financial support from Centrecorp. \nFor any questions, feedback or concerns please contact Akeyluerre Healing Centre.\n\nPEOPLE SPEAKING ON THIS APP\nAlison Ferber, Amelia Kngwarraye Turner, Benedict Stevens, Edward (Arranye) Johnson (d), Felicity Hayes, Gabriel Kngwarraye Turner, Julie Hayes, Lorrayne Gorey, Magdalene Marshall, Margaret Kemarre Turner, Mervyn Rubuntja, Michael Gorey, Peter Coco Wallace, Shirley Kngwarraye Turner, Stephen Kernan, Veronica Kngwarraye Turner, William (Nookie) Lowah, Wyonna Palmer\n\nSOUND ARTISTS\nBryan Phillips, William Lowah, Beth Sometimes, Vito Lucarelli\n\nGRAPHIC DESIGN & ILLUSTRATION\nAmelia Kngwarraye Turner, Beth Sometimes, Magdalene Marshall, Shirley Kngwarraye Turner\n\nAPP DEVELOPMENT\nEdan Baxter - Spinifex Valley"

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "Team Shake provides a technological and environmentally friendly way to choose teams for board games, sporting events, tournaments, school projects or anytime groups are required. The newest release brings many new features including full iPad support, balancing teams based on skill or gender, importing users from a file, enabling video output, and sharing teams via facebook or email. \n\nTeam Shake is the premier iOS App for creating teams. Instead of a hat and scraps of paper, the user enters his friends' names in his iPhone and gives it a shake. The screen will then display a random set of color-coded teams. These teams can immediately be used for game play or shared via facebook or email.   The quick and easy selection of random (or balanced) teams eliminates fighting over who will be on which team. Innovative use of the iPhone shake gesture gives users the satisfying feeling of shaking a virtual hat without the trouble of carrying around an actual hat. Conventional buttons can also be used for those who would rather not shake their expensive hardware about.  \n\nThe app is designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind. Names can easily be entered with the onscreen keyboard, chosen from the user's contacts, or imported from a file. The email and facebook functions document the members of each individual team as well as preserving the team number and color assigned by the app. For repeated use of Team Shake, lists of friends can be easily saved and loaded later. The current list is also automatically saved so that if you exit the app, or even reboot the device, changes will not be lost. For teachers and others with large lists of people, Team Shake supports the ability to import teams from text or csv files.\n\nIf you have any problems, feature requests, or comments please send an email to support@rhine-o.com. \n\nFeatures:\n\n* Create 1 to 64 random teams\n* Create completely random or balanced teams\n* Full iPad support\n* Eliminates fighting over choosing teams\n* Share / Save teams via email or Facebook\n* Teams can be chosen by the number of teams or by the size of teams.\n* Save lists of friends for later games\n* Import lists from email or spreadsheet\n* Export lists and options for use on another device\n* Satisfying feeling of shaking a “virtual” hat to create teams\n* Animated shaking hat\n* Entry of names via onscreen keyboard\n* Entry of names via iPhone contacts\n* Temporarily disable people who are absent\n* Set groups of people to always be on the same team\n* Set groups of people to always be on different teams\n* Set user strength to make more even teams (now supports fully balanced teams)\n* 5 users strengths level\n* Pick a single random person from the list of players\n* User strength indicator on the main screen (can be disabled in options)\n* Number of active players and total players is now displayed on the main screen\n* Video Out Support\n* Option to Sort Teams by Name\n* Option to balance male / female team members\n* \"Equal Ability\" option to create teams where all players have the same strength\n* Option to create separate male and female teams\n* Configurable Team Colors\n* Configurable Team Names\n* Print Support\n* Export Teams in CSV or XLS Format\n* Team Shake now supports simultaneously assigning players to multiple subteams and / or oppose teams at the same time.\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now have customized names to make selection easier\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now be enabled or disabled globally so that teams can be made quickly without subteams / oppose teams.  In particular, Balance Teams Strengths will work when separate Male / Female teams are created.\n\nYappler-Tags: Teams, Groups, Random, Hat, Entertainment, Games, Utilities"

Say the word in the conjugated form indicated.\n(2) Tap the sound icon to check whether you said the conjugated form correctly.\n(3) Tap the ＊ icon to check the conjugated form in writing.\n(4) Study the use of the conjugated form by referring to the example sentence and illustration on the back side of the card.\n(5) Tap the Rule icon to see the conjugation rule.\n\nCheck: Test your retention of each conjugated form by typing in your answers.*\n(1) Type in the conjugated form as instructed.\n(2) If you entered the correct form, the card will be removed from MyDeck. Cards answered incorrectly or skipped will remain in the deck for further practice.\n*To study with the Check method, you will need to add a Japanese keyboard to your iPhone settings before starting.\n\nHandy features\n•Menu\nThe study selections are grouped together in a single menu to allow you to practice more efficiently. \n\n•List\nAll conjugation forms of each word are listed in this feature, with the words arranged in a-i-u-e-o order. A check mark is displayed next to each conjugation form that has been mastered and the MyDeck card for each entry can be opened, allowing you to review the conjugations via the list.\n\n•Rule\nThis feature lists the rules for all 28 conjugation types covered by the app, enabling you to quickly look up the way to form conjugations such as the passive, the causative, the causative passive, and the tricky te-form.\n\n•MyDeck Shuffle Mode\nActivating this mode will cause the app to display the MyDeck cards in random order, rather than the default order. Shuffling the deck will help you to more firmly master the material.\n\n•Tutorials\nThe tutorials provide helpful lessons on how to add a Japanese keyboard and operate each function. \n\n—This app is based on the second edition of GENKI.\n—Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

Thanks for listening to our feedback and doing these changes.\" - Customer review\n\"Brilliant - fun way to learn Victorian cursive. I have been waiting for an app like this - a fun way teach Victorian Modern Cursive, an app my special needs son enjoys playing with and learns as he goes.  He can even use a stylus to draw the letters and build the muscle memory in his hand, that can later be transferred to writing with a pencil or pen.  All children will benefit from this app, presenting learning writing in an exciting format, great guides to help learn where to start and stop letters, and great celebration pages to keep them interested and rewarded.  I like that you can use the word lists or make your own so then the app grows with the child into writing full words, not just letters.  I think I will be trying it out with my son's spelling lists too and double benefit - writing and spelling.  It is also great to be able to teach Aussie formats such as Victorian Modern Cursive....

The app is designed to help children understand why they feel a certain feeling and behave in productive way.\n\nThe app has full sound and also text and ability to record responses rather than type if preferred.\n\nThere is a game mode just for some fun.\n\nThis resilience strategy is based on the idea that negative thoughts or the negative stories we tell ourselves are not wrong - but sometimes they are not true. Kids need to learn to catch the negative thinking that is stressful, challenge the thinking and if needed change their thinking to be more optimistic and less anxious. \n\nThis strategy is great for adults too.\n\nThe four positive penguins take you on an interactive journey to help you understand that feelings arise from your thinking and if you challenge your negative thoughts successfully you may be able to see things in a more realistic and even optimistic way.\n\nSee Positive Penguins on Facebook or our website for further information and resources"

      "label": "Little Learners Love Literacy® is a sequenced phonics reading program to give children confidence and success.  Letters and sounds are introduced in stages.  Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures.   \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen.\n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n•tap on a word to hear it being read \n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 1\n\n• Sam, Pip, Tim\n• I am Tim\n• My cat Tip\n• The map\n• Sam is it!\n\nChildren can read these books once they know the letters and sounds for m, s, f, a, p, t, c, i.   The books are decodable with some Heart words – the The My my I.  Heart words are words that children need to learn by heart as they cannot ‘decode or sound out” at this stage. There are NO tricks in our Little Learner books.  The books are enhanced with audio – tap on a word to have it read aloud."

Can you tell the difference between excitement and fear, or between aggression and the need to play?\r\n\r\nDog language can be confusing, but with the help of Dog Decoder, you’ll understand your dog’s signals like a pro.\r\n\r\nDog Decoder will teach you everything you need to know about how your dog communicates, so you can not only avoid bites, but share in a more satisfying, healthy, and loving relationship.\r\n\r\n=== MEET “DIAMOND” === \r\n\r\nDiamond is your tour guide and trainer. He will show you how he looks when he’s afraid, when he’s stressed, when he’s just about to bite, and when he wants to play. \r\n\r\n=== DOG POSTURES ===\r\n\r\nThere are about SIXTY different poses on display in Dog Decoder. Each pose is beautifully and expressively illustrated by one of the world’s top dog artists.\r\n\r\nEach pose comes with a diagram, pointing out where on Diamond’s body he’s indicating how he’s feeling. For example, in the poses for “fear,” the diagram will point out Diamond’s tucked tail, his ears pulled back, etc. We won’t just show you a picture of a scared dog — we’ll teach you what to look for, the signs of fear.\r\n\r\nEach pose also comes with a helpful description of the context. This is where you will learn about some common misconceptions, or what kinds of situations will cause your dog to assume each posture.\r\n\r\n=== TEST YOURSELF! ===\r\n\r\nThe best way to see how much you’ve learned is to take the quiz! Some of the quiz questions are pretty challenging. Diamond wants to make sure you don’t get fooled next time he’s hiding under the coffee table or drooling – will you recognize the early warning signs of stress? Will you be able to warn your children when your dog is clearly done playing?"

Finally, the method of building blocks is combined into a program to make the characters in their hearts move.\n\nCoding (or computer programming) is a must-have for the new generation, just as writing can help you organize ideas and express opinions, as well as programming. In the past, programming was difficult to popularize, but we believe that everyone should have this ability, just like writing.\n\nWhen young children use ScratchJr, they don't just interact with the computer, they can also learn how to create and express what they want through the computer. From this process, the children also learned the ability to solve problems, creative design, and logical thinking, which are the foundations to help them succeed in the future. At the same time, they use mathematics and language in a meaningful and motivated situation, and their development will become faster. ScratchJr hopes that young children or children can learn more from coding than to learn programming code."

Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books \nwith real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures. \n\nStage 6 focuses on the graphemes - ck, sh, ch, th, ng. \n\nIt also introduces a new recording feature that allows children to record and \nhear themselves read. This is an important step in developing fluency, as it gives \nchildren a reason to reread and record.  Fluency is an important literacy skill \nrequiring accuracy and comprehension. \n\nStages 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5 have professionally recorded and produced audio.  However, \nStages Plus 4, 6, & 7 allow children to read and record themselves.  Children are now \nmore confident readers and will benefit from this new recording feature. They will \nenjoy checking their accuracy by following the words in the book. \n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions. \nAll words, except the Heart words, can be ‘sounded out’. To do this, children point to \neach letter or grapheme, saying the sounds then blending the sounds together to \nread the word. \n\n\nThere are NO tricks in the Little Learner books.\n\nNote: Please make sure to enable the microphone on your device when asked or you will not be able to record anything. Also make sure your device is not set to mute to hear the audio back."

      "label": "Hit the Button Math is an app designed to help develop mental math and calculation skills.\n\nThe app is aimed at 5-11 year olds. There are 166 different game modes of varying difficulty so it is useful throughout grades K-5. Answer as many questions as possible in minute-long games, or you can now practice without the pressure of a countdown timer - a feature which is new for 2019. Questions are randomly generated which means it is very replayable. The game has been carefully designed for children, with large, widely spaced buttons. We recommend that young children play on a tablet.\n\nSix main topics are covered: \n\n* Times tables - up to 10 or 12 \n* Division - up to 10 or 12\n* Square numbers\n* Number bonds\n* Doubling \n* Halving\n\nBetween these topics, the four standard arithmetic operations are covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nYou can create up to 30 player profiles per device to track an individual's high scores (increased from 15 in 2019). If you prefer there's also the option to play as a guest. All data is stored locally on your device so you don't have to worry about privacy issues. We've also made it very easy for children to quickly switch between profiles after playing a game, if they're sharing a device.\n\nAfter each game, the score achieved is displayed along with the child's high score. Bronze, silver or gold stars and trophies are awarded depending on the score achieved in each game."

      "label": "Little Learners Love Literacy® is a sequenced phonics reading program to give children confidence and success.  Letters and sounds are introduced in stages.  Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures.   \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen. \n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n• tap on a word to hear it being read \n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 2\n• Pip\n• Tim and the van\n• At the dam\n• My hat\n• Sam in the pit\n\nThe Stage 2 books include sounds introduced in Stage 1 - s m, s, f, a, p, t, c, i  plus new sounds b, h, n, o, d, g, l v.   There are NO tricks in Stage 2 books.  Revises Heart words from Stage 1. \nThese books are enhanced with audio – tap on a word to have it read aloud."

Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen. \n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n• tap on a word to hear it being read \n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 3 \n\n• Ned\n• Big Ted and Meg\n• Tim’s quiz\n• Dad and his hot dog\n• The rat\n\nStage 3 sounds include m, s, f, a, p, t, c, I, b, h, n, o, d, g, l, v plus new sounds y r e qu z\n\nNew Heart words: of are too for her \n\nThere are NO tricks in reading these stories as children are practising their knowledge of the sounds and letters. \nThese books are enhanced with audio – tap on a word to have it read aloud."

Tend to the animals in the barn — feed them and clean up their poop! Once you've taken care of the animals, head to the house, where you can have a meal then grab your banjo for an impromptu jam session.

Tinker with your tractor to see what it can do! The food machine magically turns your raw ingredients into food: Use milk to make cheese, then use the cheese and corn to make cheese puffs! Use berries to make jam, wheat to make bread, and then use those ingredients to make donuts! Discover all the foods you can make and how you can make them!\n\nCREATE AN ORIGINAL VIDEO OF YOUR STORY\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice as you’re telling the story, along with your characters’ movements. Create farm videos up two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share later!\n\nFEATURES:\n- Explore four locations: barn, house, field and store.\n- Create stories for 29 new characters plus all the animals!\n- Feed the animals, milk the cow and gather eggs from your hens.\n- Bottle the milk from the milk tank.\n- Help the vet check the animals.\n- Let the pigs (or people!) wallow in the mud.\n- Clean up different types of animal poop!\n- Grab the banjo, fiddle, guitar or washbucket bass and jam into the night!\n- Pick fruit in your orchard.\n- Farm your crops from planting to harvest.\n- Use your tractor's different functions to farm faster!.\n- Fire up the food machine to turn your harvest into food.\n- Record your stories in the app and share with your friends!\n- No time limit or high scores — play for as long as you like!\n- No third-party advertising\n\nWE LISTEN\nSo many of you asked for a farm in the Toca Life series, and we're excited to give you what you want!

YOU can do it and it WILL be rewarding!\n\nIt can be difficult to learn signs accurately by looking at pictures or a diagram. With Baby's First Signs you will learn the first essential 29 signs using high quality, moving images demonstrating how to perform each sign. \n\nWe do not include \"filler\" signs that you are not likely to use (such as \"donkey\" or \"fireworks\"), that would just be noise and get in the way. Instead we focus on the signs that are practical and likely to be used most frequently!\n\nThis is at your finger tips in seconds, making it ideal to easily:\n- pull up a quick sign in the middle of a teachable moment\n    - (feeding, changing diaper, etc)\n- teach and share with grandparents so they can experience the joy of signing with baby\n- review and learn signs during quiet times in your favorite glider chair\n\nIt can be difficult to understand your  baby when they are frustrated  but can't yet vocalize what they want. Baby signing could help you to understand what your baby wants without them having the ability to speak. A less frustrated baby means a happier baby (and parent).\n\nBaby signing also supplements language development as it helps to naturally build richer understanding of concepts and language.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- High quality videos gifs demonstrating how to perform signs (with two different angles)\n- Save signs you want to teach baby in your favorites list so they are easy to pull up when you need them\n- Challenge yourself with our mini quiz!\n- Great tips and and suggestions to help you get the most out of signing with baby.\n- All signs are ASL variants, making it easy to scale up and learn more sign language in the future!\n\nJoin the army of parents that are already communicating with their babies and expanding their brain development!"

      "label": "The Baby Sensory Signbook app teaches you all signs you need, so you and your baby can start communication and language development. Learn to communicate long before the development of speech, using our simple Babysigns.\n\n\nFEATURES \n- All official Baby Sensory baby signs right in your pocket.\n- Find a sign in 3 simple steps with the easy interface.\n- Make a list of favourites, for the signs you're learning.\n- Learn 'Say Hello' and 4 other songs' signs with music.\n- Looping videos, so you can easily see how it’s done.\n- Slow down the video, to better view the hand shapes.\n\n\nABOUT THE APP\nWith the Baby Sensory app, you can easily learn all official signs to make early communication possible. This creates a stronger parent-child bond and stimulates early language development.\nEven the youngest baby wants to tell you what they need and how they feel. But they’re unable to express themselves verbally and may cry if their needs are not met. Signing helps your baby to express his or her needs and takes the guesswork out of parenting.\n\n\nABOUT US\nBaby Sensory was the first baby programme to offer a complete approach to learning and development from birth to 13 months. Designed to stimulate, educate and provide precious memories during the all-important first years of life, the programme has won multiple awards both nationally and internationally since 2008. Everything we do is backed by over 35 years of expert research in childhood development. \n\n\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the app, please let us know. Send us a message or see www.babysensory.com for more info.\n\n\nCONTACT\nWebsite: www.babysensory.com\nMail: apps@babysensory.com\n\n\n\nWe are super excited to hear what you think of our little app!\nSend your thoughts and tips to: apps@babysensory.com\n\nLike and follow us to stay up to date on future updates:\nwww.facebook.com/BabySensoryUK\nwww.twitter.com/BabySensoryHQ"

For each word, your kids can touch the empty rectangles where letters must be dragged to complete the word, and hear the sound the corresponding letter produces.\n\n• Secondly, the app helps kids memorize the phonics associated with letters by providing a phonics-enabled alphabet where kids can touch each letter and hear the associated phonic.\n\n____\n\nMontessori Crosswords allows you to select words according to their difficulty or sound categories:\n\n•  Level 1 displays a three-letter word with no difficulty for beginning readers (CVC words)\n•  Levels 2, 3 & 4 offer more complex words that contain more complex phonics (as long vowels sounds or blends), and also offer the option to automatically create multi-word crosswords in tens of thousands of different combinations\n•  Alternately, you can choose from 44 sound categories (i.e. choose words that contain a specific sound (for example, long a, “k” sound, and so on).\n• You can also create custom word lists based on letter clusters\n__\n\nTo create an enjoyable experience, the app also includes sounds, animations, and interactive visual effects that are displayed after a word is completed. \n__\n\nMore Features:\n\n• Digraph Support : \"oo\", \"th\",... are displayed as a whole unit\n• R-Controlled vowels support (\"car\",\"horn\",...)\n• Capital, lower-case, or cursive letter display \n• Setting to show only letters are in the word to spell (great for beginners!)\n• Setting to force spelling from left to right\n__\n\nUsers & Reports \n\n•  Create any number of users\n•  Check and export activity for each user in the Reports section\n__\n\nCommon Core State Standard (CCSS):\nCCSS.ELA-Literacy.RF.K.1b Recognize that spoken words are represented in written language by specific sequences of letters.\nCCSS.ELA-Literacy.RF.K.2 & CCSS.ELA-Literacy.RF.1.2  Demonstrate understanding of spoken words, syllables, and sounds (phonemes).\nCCSS.ELA-Literacy.RF.K.3 Know and apply grade-level phonics and word analysis skills in decoding words.\n__\n\nMore reviews:\n\n• Wired's GeekDad - \"5 Favorite Apps for Elementary School iPads\" - \"An excellent tool for learning spelling and early literacy (...) It can build from simple to more complex words making it usable by students from prep through to grade 3 or 4\" \n\n•  Teachers' Reviews:\n-Sue on Iear.org - \"I just have to say I love Montessori Crosswords both as a parent (to 2, 7, and 8 year olds) and K teacher. I like that the app is appropriate for the developmental levels of my students and all three of my kids\"\n-Cindy - \"This is one of my favorite educational apps. I highly recommend it for the children who are learning to read and spell. The kids also love the interactive artwork.\" \n __\n\nEmail questions or suggestions to support@lescapadou.com."

      "label": "Open up the world-famous Peekaboo Barn, perfect for toddlers. \n\nInside the little bouncing barn, friendly farm animals are waiting to pop out and surprise your little one. Try and guess who they are; tap the doors to find out! More animals, animations, and sounds than ever.\n\nWork with your child to learn the names of animals and hear the sounds they make. Younger children will love opening the barn doors to find new animal animations, as they learn about cause and effect and become familiar with animal names and sounds. Older children will enjoy guessing animals by sound, then seeing the animal names, which helps develop early literacy skills.  \n\nMultiple Language Features:\n\nWe started with a child's voice in English. It's her real voice, which some kids really enjoy, but she does say \"wabbit\" and \"wooster.\" If this is a concern for you, you can switch to any of 12 adult voices; our adult narrators say everything clearly and perfectly, just like the teachers they are. You can try many languages from around the world—or record your own language, or grandma's voice. There are tons of ways to explore the languages of Peekaboo Barn!\n\nPress the Language button on the Options screen to try them out.\n\n—Choose from the built-in narrators: child's voice in young English; adult's voice in American English or Spanish.\n—World languages also included: Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, German, French, Australian, and UK English. \n—Record your own voice: We added this feature so parents, children, and visiting relatives and friends can capture their own voices and star in Peekaboo Barn.  Now you can record the animal names in your native language--or grandma's voice, or grandpa's--and, if you're recording a new language, you can save the appropriate written version too, and both will show up the next time you play. (Please note, we can only support the writing systems that are supported by your device.)\n\nFEATURED BY APPLE \nOne of the first apps to be released for toddlers, since 2008 Peekaboo Barn has been downloaded over a million times, and played over 100 million times worldwide.  It has been a top 20 educational game on the iTunes store nearly every day since its launch, and has been featured by Apple often.  It won The Best Toddler App Ever award in 2009, and was named one of the top 50 iPhone apps for kids by Babble.com in 2010 and 2011.  It is recommended by The New York Times, MSNBC, USA Today, Wired, Telegraph UK, Ireland’s The Independent, Parents Magazine, and the Washington Post.\n\nPeekaboo Barn was made for you and your toddler by artists and educators, not marketers, robots, or companies repackaging clip art. Our team has backgrounds in cognitive science and child development, and we’ve worked in educational media everywhere from Penguin USA to the Smithsonian Institution. When you could really use a safe distraction--in airports, restaurants, and waiting rooms--or you'd like to try something new with your little genius, Peekaboo Barn is the educational, artful solution. Enjoy! \n\nIf you are looking for more Peekaboo, check out our awesome cousins: Peekaboo Fridge, Peekaboo Forest, and Peekaboo Wild.\n\nIf your kids are ready for a more complex game with the same great characters, please try Peekaboo Barn Farm Day! Many activities to try: for example, you can milk the cow, shear the sheep and llama, and pet the animals to help them fall sleep.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/nightanddaystudios. \nTwitter: @nightdaystudios \nYour privacy is important to us!

      "label": "Designed by an Occupational Therapist.\nFirst & Then is a very simple app that uses a board with photos to show that one activity must happen before the next can occur. A fantastic tool for visual learners! \n\nThe idea behind a First & Then board is to encourage a child to complete an activity that they don’t particularly enjoy. The board motivates the child to engage in a less preferred activity, knowing that a preferred activity (or a reward) will follow. For example, the ‘first’ activity may be something such as handwriting, homework, eating vegetables, using the toilet or visiting the dentist. The ‘then’ activity may be playing outside, computer time or a chocolate treat. \n\nThe App is extremely simple to use, the board is set up from one page, with clear prompts to help along the way. \n\nThe app allows the user to quickly and simply insert photos from the device’s camera or photo library, meaning that ‘First & Then’ boards can be made on-the-go and with little fuss.  Photos taken are saved within the App to use again and again.\n\nThe app includes a coloured visual timer, that the user can choose to use, to show the child how long they need to spend on an activity. As well as a digital display, the time is also represented by a coloured pie chart. When the pie is green, the child needs to keep going. When the pie turns amber, the child needs to get ready to finish. The pie turns red when it is time to stop the activity.\n\nThe app also includes a ‘Finished box’. The child can drag the photo into this box when the activity is completed. \n\nThe App is complete with the option to use exciting tones to reward the child for completing the activity."

The bookmarked words are compiled in the Bookmark list in \"List.\"\r\n\r\n◇ “Check” helps learners to track their mastery.\r\n・Users check their understanding of the kanji words studied and sort them into those mastered and those not yet retained.\r\n・The kanji words already mastered are taken out of the study set, leaving behind just those that still need to be worked on.\r\n\r\n◇ “List” displays various lists of all the words and kanji covered by the app so that users can see their progress and review them.\r\n・In the lists arranged in lesson order, a-i-u-e-o order, or alphabetical order, checkmarks are automatically placed next to words that have been mastered.\r\n・Kanji information on the cards can be displayed from the entries in the On/Kun list.\r\n・Users can search kanji words from their target kanji in the Serial # list.\r\n・The words bookmarked in the Study mode are also listed in the Bookmark list.\r\n・The Study view of kanji words or the target kanji can be displayed from the list entries, enabling quick review.\r\n\r\n○This app is based on the kanji list from the third edition of GENKI.\r\n○Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

(Please set your iPhone to Ring mode to hear the audio playback.)\n・Fun illustrations help users to better retain the words studied. \n・Users can bookmark the words they like. The bookmarked words are compiled in the Bookmark list in \"List.\"\n\n◇ “Check” helps learners to track their mastery.\n・Users check their understanding of the vocabulary studied and sort the words into those mastered and those not yet retained.\n・The words already mastered are taken out of the study set, leaving behind just those that still need to be worked on.\n\n◇ “List” displays a list of all words covered by the app so that users can see their progress and review the vocabulary.\n・The list can be arranged in any of three orderings: lesson order, a-i-u-e-o order, and alphabetical order. The words bookmarked in the Study mode are also listed in the Bookmark list.\n・Checkmarks are automatically placed next to words that have been mastered.\n・The Study view of words can be displayed from the list entries, enabling quick review.\n\n\n○This app is based on the vocabulary from the third edition of GENKI.\n○Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

      "label": "Letter Quiz is the best way to learn the English Alphabet with over 10,000 copies being purchased by schools. Four different games for every stage of learning; flashcards, identification, matching and handwriting. Designed for kids but great for all ages.\n\n- What People Are Saying:\n\"I think this Letter Quiz is an awesome app.  I downloaded the free version and my son was begging for the full version. That's when you know its a good one.  So I downloaded the full version and he worked on his letters for an hour.  As a parent, I am so happy that he loves it and he is learning.\"\n\n\"My 2 year old daughter loves this app. Initially the app had only recognizing the alphabets now it also features writing. My daughter didn't have any interest to write alphabets on paper but when she saw the app, she learned to write in a few days. On the whole excellent app recommend the full version to all parents with little children.\"\n\n\nFour great games to develop your skills:\n\n- ABC Flashcards to get started recognizing letters\nThe uppercase and lowercase versions of each letter is shown on a card. Tapping on the card flips it over to reveal an object starting with the letter while a voice announces the letter and the objects. Use app settings to play in random order for a change of pace.\n\n- Letter Identification to test knowledge\nMultiple letters are shown on the screen and a voice requests you to touch a specific letter. If you touch the right letter, an object is shown starting with that letter, then it moves to the next letter. Get through all 26 letters and you win! Use app settings to play in random order or hide the hints to make the game more difficult.\n\n- Matching uppercase and lowercase letters\nThe top shows letters in uppercase. The bottom shows letters in lowercase. Draw a line between the two letters matching uppercase and lowercase to get to the next level. Enable random order in app settings for even more challenge.\n\n- Alphabet Tracing to practice handwriting\nEach letter is presented full screen with dotted lines shown to guide you through writing the letter. As you trace with your finger, fun sounds play along the line. After each letter is finished they are combined on a blackboard with your full alphabet. You can choose between uppercase and lowercase letters or play in random order by enabling them in the app settings. Complete all 26 letters to unlock the fireworks celebration with exploding letters and music! \n\nSpecial Features:\n- Universal app plays natively on iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch\n- Kid protected section for adjusting settings, no external links without a parent\n- Includes both Uppercase and Lowercase letters, enabled in settings\n- Localized for US and non US pronunciation for the letter Z (\"zed\" vs \"zee\")\n- Teacher mode allows parents to pick individual letters to trace, enabled in settings\n- Disable swiping to advance Flashcards for younger players\n\nConnect with us for feature suggestions or bug reports:\nOn the web: http://TantrumApps.com/contact\nOn Facebook: http://facebook.com/TantrumApps\nOn Twitter: http://twitter.com/TantrumApps"

This app will turn your English text into its phonetic transcription using International Phonetic Alphabet.\n \nFeatures:\n \n- See phonetic transcription of the whole text, not just the dictionary forms of separate words.\n- Choose between British and American* pronunciation. When British dialect is selected the [r] sound at the end of the word is only voiced if followed by a vowel, which follows British phonetic convention.\n- International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) symbols used.\n- The structure of the text and sentences in it (line breaks, punctuation marks, etc.) is preserved in phonetic transcription output making it easier to read.\n- You can output the text and its phonetic transcription along each other line-by-line to make back-reference to the original text easier.\n- An option to vary pronunciation depending on whether words are in stressed or weak position in the sentence, as in connected speech.\n- In addition to commonly used vocabulary the database contains a very substantial amount of place names (including names of countries, their capitals, US states, UK counties), nationalities and popular names.\n- Where a word has a number of possible pronunciations (highlighted in blue in the output) you can select the one that agrees with the context by tapping on it.\n- Print out the output results, share via email or copy to pasteboard.\n- Let the built-in speech synthesiser read your text out loud. Control the playback and follow IPA transcription of the current word with a highlight.\n- Custom URL scheme to open toPhonetics from 3rd-party apps.\n\nGestures (IPA transcription screen):\n1. Single tap\n    - Tap a word to set the cursor to it and speak it (you can mute/un-mute it with the button at your bottom-right).\n    - Tap in a blank space to stop speech and hide the cursor.\n2. Double-tap\n    - Double-tap a word to open it in the built-in dictionary; if the word has multiple pronunciations you'll see the list of them first.\n    - Double-tap in a blank space to reset the font to the size set in iOS preferences.\n3. Pinch in or out to make the text smaller or larger.\n4. Start to slide horizontally to select a part of your text. The Speak button respects current selection.\n\n\n*) American transcriptions are based on the open Carnegie Mellon University Pronouncing Dictionary."

      "label": "DRIVING BY RAIL\nIn \"Little Fox Train Adventures\", children can travel by train through enchanting landscapes and visit various places. At farms and factories, they help to load and unload the wagons, produce goods and deliver them to the next city. Lovely illustrations, fun animations and simple controls make the app suitable even for little children.\n\nBRING IN THE HARVEST AND LOAD THE TRAIN\nKids can bring in the harvest and load the train at over 10 different farms. They help to harvest fruit trees and vegetable fields, collect eggs from the chicken farm or milk the cows.\n\nTAKE YOUR HARVEST TO THE FACTORY\nThe harvest must now be taken to factories to process it. Whether it's carrot cupcakes, peach ice cream or socks made of alpaca wool - in over 20 factories, children can playfully learn about production processes, play an active part in them and trigger fun animations.\n\nSELL THE GOODS IN THE CITY\nAs soon as juice, cake or cheese have been loaded at the factory, the next stop will be the big city. The citizens are already waiting for new supply, so bring your goods to the supermarket quickly. But watch out for the gangster sheep, it wants to steal your goods!\n\nPERFECT FOR SMALL CHILDREN\nThe controls are very easy: By tapping you can harvest, load or accelerate the train. So even the younger ones can easily navigate through the app.\n\"Little Fox Train Adventures\" was illustrated by Karoline Pietrowski. With great attention to detail and the use of handmade textures and brushes, the scenes look like a picture book.\n\nCHARACTERISTICS:\n- Easy control, optimized for children between 2 and 5 years\n- Picturesque landscapes\n- Over 30 different stations\n- Funny characters and funny animations\n- Loving graphics and music\n- No internet or WiFi required - play wherever you want!\n\nAbout Fox & Sheep:\nWe are a Studio in Berlin and develop high quality apps for kids at the age of 2-8 years. We are parents ourselves and work passionately and with a lot of commitment on our products. We work with the best illustrators and animators around the world to create and present the best apps possible – to enrich the lives of our and your kids."

The quarters are not tight, but the swarms of enemy saucers make maneuvering difficult at best. \n\nLevel 3.- The player exits the cavern and is assaulted by a storm of fireballsl. The fireballs are fast and indestructible and must be manically dodged. \n\nLevel 4.- Flies the player over a large metropolis. Missiles fired at the player from the tops of buildings again become a threat. \n\nLevel 5.- Sends the player into obnoxiously tight machine tunnels. Pilot error is the only though formidable enemy. \n\nThe final level has the player make an attack run on the Base, defended only by its position in a deep valley.

      "label": "In the modern age, paranormal investigators use many tools to communicate with spirits. Ouija Boards, Spirit Boxes, radios and apps are just a few of the many tools they use but cultures have been using tools to communicate with spirits for ages. \n\nCleromancy, the practice of contacting divine truth via random castings of dice (or bones) stretches back before recorded history. Astragalomancy, is a form of divination that uses dice marked with letters. In fact, many ancient cultures have various forms of dice divination.\n\nNecro Dice is a modern version of this ancient practice. This app means to combine the ancient and modern forms of communication in a completely new and unique way. Users seeking answers or messages can roll the dice with a simple tap of the screen. Once the user’s intention has been cast through the rolling of the dice, it is up to the spirits to communicate by influencing the randomization of letters to form words. This phenomenon of spirit communication through the manipulation of electronic devices has been well documented for several decades.\n\nNecro Dice functions by generating a handful of dice with random letters assigned to each of the six faces of each dice. These dice are then simulated with an advanced physics engine that handles dice to table and dice to dice collisions. When the physics simulation completes and the dice settle the result is a jumble of letters shown on the top face of the dice. Normally when using dice, the user is then required to inspect the dice to try and find words in this jumble of letters. This app uses a proprietary algorithm to inspect the top faces of the dice and try to match words and names to a dictionary. A word is chosen from the jumble of letters based on many factors including distance, length, location and relevance. Once a word is detected in the dice,  the app will highlight the individual letters on the dice and display the word on the screen. A list of words rolled since the start of the app can be accessed in the word log by pressing the button at the lower left of the screen.\n\nRolling dice isn’t just for games, do the spirits have a message for you?"

Al light effects have been precisely created and synced with thunder sound to create and impressive simulation with your Philips Hue setup. It will impress everyone.\nHue thunder can also be used to train pets to get used to thunder sounds and lightning flashes.\n\nOur unique node based soundscape engine, which is behind the beautiful designed and intuitive user interface, is truly innovative. It uses techniques which are used by top game designers and audio engineers to mimic nature's way and randomness. On top of that our soundscape apps use a unique and simple to use occurrence slider to let you decide how often a specific bird or other sound is used in the preset. Still it's totally unpredictable when a specific sound is being heard therefore producing an amazingly natural sound experience. It can run for hours on end without getting repetitive like other sound engines do. \n\nChoose from the following thunder presets and themes:\n\nThunder presets:\n- Light drizzle.\n- On a rainy day.\n- Heavy rain pours down.\n- Light thunder storm.\n- Inside the thunder storm.\n- Heavy thunder storm.\n- Tornado Alley.\n- Hurricane mayhem.\n\nThunder Ambient presets:\n- A damp rain forest.\n- At the beach after a warm day.\n- Staring out the window in a busy city.\n- A walk in the city under the umbrella.\n- Bad weather camping at the lake.\n- Storm over NYC.\n- After the storm.\n- In the car.\n- Bike ride through Amsterdam.\n\nThe following elements can be altered during playback:\n- Sky brightness.\n- Sky On/Off\n- Thunder brightness.\n- Thunder occurrence.\n- Environment volume.\n- Thunder volume.\n\nOther features:\n- Bluetooth and Airplay supported with delay compensation.\n- Sleep timer to safely fall asleep with a stormy fading background. Lights turn off after sleeptimer is finished.\n\n (Hue Thunder also works without Philips Hue, but obviously without light effects)."

Play with the parameters to create an unlimited number of exciting 3D shapes. You can make the sculpture shiny by selecting an environment that will be reflected on the object.\n\nMandelbulb Raytracer is another exciting real-time ray tracer from Angisoft for the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4. It renders the Mandelbulb fractal with high accuracy. Zooming makes an unlimited amount of detail visible.\n\nFractals are self-similar mathematical shapes in complex space. The Mandelbulb fractal is a 3-dimensional analog of the Mandelbrot set using an hypercomplex algebra based on spherical coordinates. This app uses the graphics chip of the iPhone 3GS or iPhone 4 to compute a 3D image of the fractal by ray tracing using OpenGL ES 2.0 shaders.\n\nDouble/Triple tap and drag the finger horizontally or vertically to change the shape of the Mandelbulb fractal. You can also set these constant in the Settings tab. The Settings tab also allows to enable an environment that is mirrored on the Mandelbulb fractal. The accuracy of the fractal surface can also be set here. If you have red-cyan glasses available, you can see the fractal with real depth by enabling stereo mode.\n\nA one finger drag rotates the camera around the object, a two finger pinch is used for zooming and a three finger drag translates the camera. You can hide the tab bar to create a screen shot. Double tap to bring back the tab bar.\n\n!!!!   Important announcement !!!!\nTo take a screen shot, hold down the home button and then push the top button. The screen will flash and the resulting image will be placed on your camera roll. From there, you can sync it back to your computer, e-mail it to friends, or do anything else you can do with any other photo in your camera roll."

Two rods are attached to spinning wheels.  The rods meet at a point that holds a pen, and the pen draws on a spinning piece of paper.\n\nSpin Draw lets you explore a vast space of exciting, elegant designs, far beyond the capabilities of the HOOT-NANNY. Adjust the wheels and rods and watch the drawing evolve before your eyes. Create designs to share with friends, explore them as mathematical forms, or just sit back and watch the curve slowly emerge on your screen.\n\nSpin Draw also offers a full range of sharing tools. Save your drawings as pixels or paths, or show them to friends on social media.\n\nThis app will never show you an ad, ask you to write a review, or require you to unlock features via in-app purchases."

He is best known for his wacky videos often featuring his unique homemade outfits which together have topped over 1.1 billion views, many of which reaching 30+ million views individually. Not only a movie star, Crusoe is also the author of his own award-winning blog and New York Times Bestselling book, with his second book set for release in Fall 2018. Crusoe was also the recipient of the 2017 Shorty Award for ‘Best Animal Influencer’. \n\n\nINFO about the Full Access and Emojis size\n\n\nヅ Any third party not belong to UNICODE can't create actual emojis, but we'll get as close as we can making a keyboard and sending the CrusoeMojis through it. The size is bigger because is not possible to include the emojis next to the text. It has to go separately and as image, that's because the UNICODE system. The good thing is that the emojis are more detailed! \n\n\nヅ We take our users privacy very seriously and allowing full access does NOT give us access to any of your other keyboards, only to this Emoji keyboard. CrusoeMoji will NEVER collect any personal information or transmit anything you type over any network. Basically because we are not a text keyboard, CrusoeMoji only has images to copy and paste. Also, you can always use the iMessage app if you're concerned as it doesn't require full access, or download all the images to your phone gallery and use them anytime."

But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory.

      "label": "LSW Collector is the most detailed LEGO Star Wars minifigure collecting app around and is the perfect way to catalogue your collection! Use the search bar to quickly find your minifigures by unique ID, name, or set number. You can swipe between minifigure entries to easily update your collection! Each minifigure page provides all the relevant information you need to know. Saving the best for last, exclusive to the LSW Collector app is a section dedicated to more obscure variants! Entries for all minifigures made from 1999 to current are included and are added in real time which means you don't have to wait for an update to check them off. We promise to continue to update with the newest minifigures so that you can continue expanding your collection! \n\nLSW Collector is an unofficial mobile application for all collectors of LEGO Star Wars minifigures. Made by a collector for collectors!\n\nCapabilities:\n\nEach entry contains all of the important information about the minifigure including detailed images, unique ID, year of release, and in which sets it can be found. Swiping left and right allows you to see both the front and back of the minifigure. Clicking on the sets box shows exactly which sets a minifig comes from! LSW Collector allows you to 'check off' minifigures you already have and add the ones you don't to your wanted list. The green check mark allows you to easily see which minifigures you already have from the main view while the 'WANTED' symbol indicates which figures you are still chasing. Alternatively you can ignore figures that you don't want to have in your collection by tapping on the hide button at the bottom of the screen. You can revisit these figures any time by clicking the hide button on the main page. The Price Guide feature allows you to check the average selling price for each minifigure and can be used as an estimation for your own buying/selling purposes. You can also add multiple of the same minifigure to your collection and then track your total progress on the My Collection tab.\n\nLegal Information:\n\nLEGO and the minifigure are registered trademarks of the LEGO Group.\n\nSTAR WARS is a registered trademark of Lucasfilm, Ltd.

Refer to our support website for instructions: http://radiosync.dairystatedesigns.com/setup\n\nUse your iPhone, iPod, or iPad to synchronize your radio with your TV for live events!\n\nDO YOU LOVE your local sports radio announcers so much that you listen to the radio while watching the game on TV? Does it drive you and your loved ones crazy when the radio play-by-play comes seconds before the delayed TV signal? Sports fans rejoice: RadioSync is here!\n\nRADIOSYNC ALLOWS YOU to delay a radio broadcast to match a television broadcast. Featuring simple, intuitive controls and a pleasant design, RadioSync gives you the power to synchronize your favorite football, basketball, soccer, baseball, hockey, or any other sports team broadcasts. Although syncing a sports broadcast is the most likely reason to use RadioSync, you can use it to sync any live event that is broadcast on both television and radio.\n\nNOTE: RADIOSYNC WILL WORK ONLY when your radio broadcast is ahead of your television broadcast, which is generally true."

      "label": "We created a Sound and Light Scape system which is unpredictable (no looping sounds), highly customisable and versatile in it's setup. TRÅDFRI Haunted House contains high quality audio effects with beautifully synced lighting to create the perfect eerie mood.\n\nTRÅDFRI Haunted House offers the following scary themes to choose from:\n\n- Creepy Cave\nDripping stones, scary bats and ferocious monsters haunt you while you wander through the corridors of this dark cave. Did you take the right turn 10 minutes ago? Sure you are not lost?...\n\n- Grisly Graveyard\nThis is definitely a place where you do not want to be. Zombies stray over this graveyard while rain and wind make you shiver. Or is it the fear in your body? A distant church reminds you you are not far from safety. But why can it's bell be heard so often and irregular? Isn't that odd? \n\n- Demon Dollhouse\nDolls are sweet aren't they? So you would say... This dollhouse is full of evil. So evil, It makes the small dolls cry. Or are they possessed as well? Something is very wrong, that's for sure.\n\n- Eerie Forest\nThis is a spine-chilling forest. Birds give the impression of some peace. But don't be fooled. Weird creatures also roam this place. Is that the wind in the trees you hear? Sounds of raven are never a good sign...\n\n- Frightening Pursuit\nYou're running but it seems you don't progress. What is it you flee from? Not knowing is the worst. But one thing is for sure. You don't want it to catch up with you, then you'll suffer the same faith as that poor little fluffy creature which wasn't fast enough.\n\n- Distressing Dungeon \nLocked up, nobody knows why. Damp and dark you scream for help but the only reaction you get is your own echo. Doors open and close, chains rattle around you. Nobody there to help you out. Will it end here?\n\n- Abandoned Fairground\nThis must be the weirdest place on earth. Fairgrounds look so gruesome when abandoned. Once a place of joy and laugh, now a spooky ground where some machines still try to entertain you as you pass by. Sounds of the past appear out of nothing. As if ghosts and spirits are still on a roller coaster ride. Is that a clown I hear? \n\n- Haunted House\nWhispers around you make your heart beat faster, while you walk through this old house with it's creaky floors and doors. Thunder bursts concentrated above the house making cats and other animals scream. After every door you think you found the exit, but every door leads to another room with new surprises. Most of them not so pleasant. Wish you haven't been so curious and never entered this Haunted House?\n\n- Hell Fire\nWhen you open your eyes from what seems like a nap, flames warm your body from below. Standing on top of a big rock you look at the bubbling Lava. Where to go? Fireballs shoot all over the place. You see some phantoms who fail to dodge them. Distant screams make the place even more horrific. You can just hope this is a very bad dream.\n\n- Gloomy Ghosts\nHave you ever seen a ghost? Some say they do. But in this place you can hear them for sure. Have a look around, maybe you see or feel them. It's said that if you feel a sudden cold, a ghost might just pass you. Or even fly right through you. Look out! On your left!\n\n- Sinister Strings\nWhen you enter the Opera house, the theater hall is dark and there's nobody on the podium. These instruments seem to play themselves! It's an orchestra without direction. I think there are too many false notes being played here..\n\n- Witch Hunt\nScreeching laughter so typically for witches. A lot of them are gathered to discuss new spells and recipes. The winner of last year's soup competition is already cooking this years soup. The ingredients are gore and not so typical. Make sure you do not end up in the boiling cauldron in the middle of the square.\n\n- Pirate Ship\nArr aaaaaargh. This is not the average pirate ship. This one is haunted. We suspect ghost are glooming around the rudder.\n\n- Lurid Laboratory\nNot Dexter, not DeeDee but evil forces brew here."

But best of all . . . once per game, you get a Boon . . . an in-game advantage to help you kill the monsters, steal the treasure, and stab your buddy. There are almost 150 different Boons, all illustrated by John Kovalic. The higher your level when you ask for your Boon, the better it's likely to be. And when you reach the winning level, it plays a fanfare. Your friends will hate you . . .\n\nBonus features include:\n• Kill-O-Meter screen to keep track of combat scores.\n• Counters for Chez Geek and SPANC (Space Pirate Amazon Ninja Catgirls) illustrated with art from the games.\n\nThis app is NOT a stand-alone game! It is a game aid for the Munchkin card games and Munchkin Quest board games by Steve Jackson Games. Munchkin is the dungeon experience . . . with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff.

      "label": "The Ghost EVP/EMF Radio has been developed for exciting paranormal detection and exploration. We've put a lot of effort into making the app easy to use, so that both professional and enthusiast paranormal researchers, ghost hunters and ghost tour organizers can enjoy the experience.\n\nIf you are either easily frightened, a super skeptic \"left brainer\" or have a serious heart-related medical condition, you are probably better off avoiding this app.\n\nElectronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) is the collective name for the sounds sometimes detected on electronic recordings and reminiscent of human speech. These sounds are usually found in recordings with noise or poor radio reception and are considered by many to be the voices of paranormal beings such as ghosts, spirits, demons and other energy based entities. EVP is a form of Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC), a term coined by professor Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s.\n\nThis app has taken the traditional ghost box to the next level. As with traditional ghost boxes, chaotic noise seems to be both inviting and sensitive to paranormal manipulation. The app generates audible speech by detecting meaningful phrases and words together with properties such as gender, age and the current mood of the communicating entity. We continuously improve the app, based on user feedback, and use it during our own paranormal investigations as well.\n\n*** Features ***\n* Radio Control Panel where you control the radio in real-time.\n* Brownian, Pink and White Noise generators.\n* Electromagnetic Field Meter using the Magnetometer sensor of your device.\n* Multiple graphical themes for the user interface.\n* Record your encounters with or without the microphone of your device.\n* Real-time audio visualization: Oscilloscope, Spectrometer, Voicegram and Waveform (tap to toggle).\n* Text log screen: The persistent text log is where you can sort, share and delete your log.\n* Quick text log: Tap on the main TV screen to toggle between the different view modes.\n* Open your EVP recordings in compatible audio apps with the touch of a button.\n* Optional Auto Recording which only produces recordings when something interesting is encountered.\n* Optional vibration (iPhone only) and audible alarms every time an entity has been detected.\n* Share your recordings with friends and family.\n* Upload your recordings to your Dropbox.\n\nPlease note that the app will degrade gracefully to Performance mode when running on older hardware, which means that some features may not be available or limited when running on, for example, the iPad 2 or the iPhone 4S.\n\n\n*** Languages ***\nEnglish (US/UK), Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Latin, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\n\n*** Support ***\n* For support, feedback and more information, please visit https://paranormalsoftware.com/support, or use the buttons on the Settings screen.\n* Knowledge Base: https://paranormalsoftware.com/support/kb\n* Twitter: @GhostRadioEVP\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ghostevpradio\n* Mailing list: http://tiny.cc/ghostradiomail\n\n\nWe hope that you, like many others, will be fascinated by the paranormal experience of Ghost EVP Radio. Thanks for downloading!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nEvery effort has been made to make this app truly unique, but we can offer no guarantee that you will get specific results by using it. Since the results of this app haven't been scientifically verified, it should only be used for entertainment purposes. Please use it responsibly."

This was in the 60'ies of the last century. Since then a lot has changed, but many of us remember the days when there was no Graphical User Interface.\n\nThis app now is introducing DOS for mobile devices. Not laptops, but phones. iPhone and iPad, to be precise. It is a perfect emulator of the DOS that so many games and applications in the 80'ies and 90'ies have been running on.\n\nWin and Win95 were running on DOS, showing what a 16bit operating system is capable of. If sys ini, commanc.com, config.sys and .exe sound familiar to you, then this is the app for you.\n\nThe DOS is not just a CLI, it is a full fledged operating system. It does everything that the Ancient DOS did. It is capable of executing batch files or installing some of the game classics that never made it past DOS. It probably runs much better than the original DOS used to run on old PC's, which were state of the art back then.\n\n30 years is old enough to be called vintage, and it brings as much power as it did back then ;-) With this app you can get this vintage feeling on your iPhone or iPad.\n\n◆Features\n    ▸ SoundCard emulation\n    ▸ External Bluetooth Keyboard\n    ▸ Disk Operating System\n    ▸ Everything you would expect from DOS ;)\n\nIf you have ideas, feedback, suggestions or anything else you would like to tell us, do not hesitate to drop us a line!\n\nAnd if you like Power DOS, be not shy to leave a good review!"

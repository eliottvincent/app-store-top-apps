Maybe. Decorative? Certainly. \n\nNB Sounds will only play through earphones on 1st gen iPod Touch.\n\nThanks to all who left comments and suggestions for improvement.

Finally we've developed a reliable and one-of-its-kind algorithm for freckles detecting and counting. We would like to share this sunny app with you.\nNow you can also count freckles with “Freckle tracker” app on your face or on a one of your relatives, than share the results with your friends and invite them to do the same thing. \n \nSo easy it works: \n \n1. You have a choice either to pick an image of a person with freckles out of your smartphone gallery or to take a photo within the “Freckle tracker” app.\n2. Just after you pressed the \"count\" button, watch your freckles winking at you and discover how many of them you have. \n3. Afterwards, click the \"share\" icon and choose the way you want to send the results to your friends.\n4. Even if you don´t have any freckles, just be amazed playing the sunny game, guessing the number of freckles on other people faces.\n \nWe appreciate your ratings. And please don't hesitate to provide your hints and wishes on how we can improve our App. Send us your counting results, and we will with pleasure update our game library with your images.\n \nWe are pretty sure that after playing around with this app, at least a smile will appear on your face. \n\nDid we arouse your interest? Then download the app and click on \"?\" icon, to learn more about how to increase counting accuracy.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n******\nSchon seit langem war ich mit der Frage beschäftigt: Wie zähle ich die Sommersprossen auf der Nase meiner Tochter? Schließlich ist das Zählen mit dem Finger zwar eine lustige aber eben auch eine absolut mühselige Beschäftigung. Dann kam ich auf die Idee, eine App zu entwickeln, die es für mich erledigt. Am Ende haben wir es geschafft, einen zuverlässigen, einzigartigen Algorithmus zu entwickeln: dieser erkennt und zählt für Dich Sommersprossen. Diese sonnige App möchten wir mit Dir teilen. \n\nNun kannst auch Du Mithilfe der „Freckle tracker“ App Deine Sommersprossen und die Deiner Lieben zählen, die Zählergebnisse mit der Welt teilen und Deine Freunde dazu einladen, sich auch damit zu beschäftigen. \n \nSo einfach wird´s gemacht:\n \n1.  Du hast die Wahl, entweder ein Foto einer Person mit Sommersprossen aus der Galerie Deines Smartphones zu schnappen oder es direkt auf der „Freckle tracker“ App mit der Kamera aufzunehmen.\n2.  Sobald Du auf den \"count\" Button drückst, kannst du sehen wie Deine Sommersprossen Dich anblinzeln und gleich danach erfährst Du wie viele es sind.\n3.  Klicke auf das Symbol \"share\" und wähle aus, wie Du das Foto mit dem Zählergebnis an Deine Freunde senden möchtest.\n4.  Wenn Du keine Sommersprossen hast, dann lass dich einfach verzaubern und spiele das sonnige Spiel und rate die Anzahl der Sommersprossen auf Gesichtern anderer Leute. \n \nWir freuen uns auf Deine Bewertung sowie Anregungen und Vorschläge, wie wir unsere App verbessern können. Sende uns auch Deine Zählergebnisse, und wir erweitern unsere Spielbibliothek mit Deinen Fotos.\n \nWir sind ziemlich zuversichtlich, dass nach dem Rumspielen mit dieser App, sich ein Lächeln auf Deinem Gesicht zeigen wird. \n\nHaben wir Dein Interesse geweckt? Dann lade die App runter und klicke auf \"?\" Symbol um mehr darüber zu erfahren, wie Du die Zählgenauigkeit erhöhen kannst.\n\nViel Spaß beim Zählen!\n\n© Copyright 2019 Bantique´s production.

      "label": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved"

Explore the colorful and electrifying world of science and meet all 118 of the elements from the periodic table. \n\nDiscover elements by experimenting with the lab tools! \n\n* Take your element for a spin in the centrifuge.\n* Warm them up in the Bunsen burner. \n* Put the element on ice with the cooling agent! \n* Add a drop or two of mysterious liquids from the test tubes.\n* Change their voltage and make them magnetic with the oscilloscope.\n\nEach element has it's own personality. In Toca Lab: Elements, what does Neon sound like? Is Gold heavy or light? Is Nitrogen squishy or hard? Explore, inspect, and study each one and let us know! Can you find all 118? \n\nThe time has come, future scientists, to head into the lab to explore and discover. Put on your lab coat and protective eye gear because things are about to get experimental!\n\nToca Lab: Elements is a place for playing and having fun, and with it we hope to inspire kids to explore science. While the periodic table in Toca Lab: Elements is accurate, the way new elements are created is not. Instead, it’s a fun way to experiment, discover and create curiosity in the world of science. Toca Lab: Elements is just a starting point for further exploration! \n\n***\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

Mix red, yellow, blue to get every imaginable colour - your child will learn realistic paint mixing, then come up with your own masterpiece using a paw print or a standard brush.\n3) Mouse & Cheese - Memorize where the zones are to sneak mouse past little kitten over to the cheese. Or just have some laughs seeing what happens when little kitten catches the mouse!\n4) Bed Trampoline - Discover all little kitten's hidden tricks and moves!\n5) Animal Puzzle - Educational 'mix and match' funny animal combinations to earn biscuits that you can then feed to your little kitten.\n6) Feeding - Each time you play a mini-game you receive cat food snacks, children love feeding the little kitten and watching it licking its lips and purr after a good feed! \n7) Cat-in-the-box - Educational 'hand-eye coordination' mini-game \n8) Balloon Popping - can you discovered all the different shapes?!\n\nNot using any text menus, the game can be easily navigated by young children.

This was in the 60'ies of the last century. Since then a lot has changed, but many of us remember the days when there was no Graphical User Interface.\n\nThis app now is introducing DOS for mobile devices. Not laptops, but phones. iPhone and iPad, to be precise. It is a perfect emulator of the DOS that so many games and applications in the 80'ies and 90'ies have been running on.\n\nWin and Win95 were running on DOS, showing what a 16bit operating system is capable of. If sys ini, commanc.com, config.sys and .exe sound familiar to you, then this is the app for you.\n\nThe DOS is not just a CLI, it is a full fledged operating system. It does everything that the Ancient DOS did. It is capable of executing batch files or installing some of the game classics that never made it past DOS. It probably runs much better than the original DOS used to run on old PC's, which were state of the art back then.\n\n30 years is old enough to be called vintage, and it brings as much power as it did back then ;-) With this app you can get this vintage feeling on your iPhone or iPad.\n\n◆Features\n    ▸ SoundCard emulation\n    ▸ External Bluetooth Keyboard\n    ▸ Disk Operating System\n    ▸ Everything you would expect from DOS ;)\n\nIf you have ideas, feedback, suggestions or anything else you would like to tell us, do not hesitate to drop us a line!\n\nAnd if you like Power DOS, be not shy to leave a good review!"

Weird Type is an AR app that lets you paint with text in space!\n\nYou can type your own phrases and pick from multiple modes and see your text in completely new ways. You can record videos of your messages and share them or save them to you camera roll. \n\nIt's based on a series of AR experiments that the authors Zach Lieberman and Molmol Kuo have been posting to Instagram over the last few months.   People kept asking, \"is that an app?\"  Now, together with our collaborator Design Indaba, which helped produce this, we're packaging some of these experiments into app and we hope you enjoy them!   \n\nThe app is designed by Richard The, with iOS help from Ying Quan Tan, Robby Kraft, and Peter Sibley\n\nNote the app now supports multi-lingual input."

      "label": "From the creators of Wreck This App and This Is Not an App comes an award-winning app experience that encourages you to use your phone or tablet to actually interact more with the world around you. With The Pocket Scavenger app, you’ll be asked to find and photograph a spectrum of quirky items: something that is miniature, a stain that is green, something from the year you were born, a used envelope, and more. \n\nOnce your quarry is in sight, you can choose an alteration dictated solely by chance: create a funny character, add a family member, photograph it at night, make it “pretty,” and so on. After completing a scavenge, you can upload it to the map and see what scavenges are going on around you. You can also share your scavenges on social media before embarking on a new hunt.\n\nBy incorporating chance into creativity, you’ll be forced out of habitual ways of thinking or acting, discover new connections, and interact with the world around you in ways you might not have imagined before. Apartment Therapy says The Pocket Scavenger “…is onto something that other app-makers have been trying to get at for a long time: the element of serendipity and spontaneity in our social media experiences… an app that attempts to bridge the divide between our mobile devices, our muses, and objects directly in front of us.” The app is “…designed to make you stop and look around you, and maybe even see the potential beauty in the most ordinary of objects,” as recommended by Games Fiend.\n\nThe Pocket Scavenger app won the 2014 Digital Book Award for Best Adult Non-Fiction App.\n\nNOTE: In order to place your scavenges on the map for Fellow Scavengers to see, you will need to be signed in to Twitter."

      "label": "The Counterculture Tarot is a trove of insight and wisdom about the tumultuous 1960s. Here you will find a profound view of the 1960s seen through the lens of Tarot. Each Tarot image is a candid photograph shot by the author during the era.\n\nWilliam Cook Haigwood was a journalist and photographer in that era. He has matured into a seasoned sage, a wise philosopher who takes us on a magical and mysterious tour of the messy, intense, fertile, and deeply influential counterculture movement.\n\nWith Timothy Leary as The Magician, The Counterculture Tarot delves into the social ferment in the 1960s: the hippies, the Vietnam War protests, the student uprisings, emerging feminism, and the political, drug, and festival scenes. All of the urgent demands for social justice, peace and freedom in their passion, commitment and intensity are here.\n\nMany images foreshadow future events, like the Seven of Swords, featuring a photograph of not-yet-President Reagan chatting with the mother of not-yet-kidnapped Patty Hearst, or even foreshadow whole social movements that continue today.\n\nThe Counterculture Tarot is not only for Tarot enthusiasts, although it is a brilliant achievement in the philosophy of Tarot. The Counterculture Tarot is for anyone interested in the 1960s and their enduring influence today.\n\n*Intuitive, elegant interface is easy for beginners and experts\n*Gorgeous full screen, high-resolution card images\n*Full support for all current iOS devices\n*App includes more than one third of William Cook Haigwood’s 600+ page magnum opus\n*Sophisticated journal\n*18 spreads built in\n*Design your own layout with Free Form\n*Allow reversed cards or not\n*Option to use Major Arcana only\n*Zoom in to enlarge card details\n*Share reading via email, Facebook, and Twitter\n*Animated shuffle & cut\n*Optional voice prompts\n*Customize with your own card meanings & reading cloths\n*Many adjustable settings\n*Book and card meanings available in English only\n\nThe 1960s are long over, but the legacy of the Counterculture lives on!"

It blasted to #1 on Christmas Day of that year and clinged to number one for weeks. It continued to linger in the Top Ten for over a year! \r\n\r\nWe can’t even tell you how much time it spent farting around at #2.\r\n\r\nThe App has been completely recoded and rebuilt for 2021.   \r\n\r\nHere are just a few of the useful, signature features of iFart®.\r\n\r\n* SECURITY FART *\r\n\r\nPhones and pdas are stolen on a daily basis, but if you are using iFart's advanced security system you can stop criminals right in their tracks.\r\n\r\nAnd when thieves try to snatch your phone, they'll be in for a shock when they're blasted by your chosen sound effect. Most criminals know how to lie, but \"it wasn't me\" isn't going to work with iFart.\r\n\r\nCall the authorities and send these phone stealing scumbags off to the gas chamber.\r\n\r\n* SNEAK ATTACK *\r\n\r\nThe sneak attack function can literally save your life. Let's say that you're in a warehouse gun battle. Bad guys are closing in on you, but if you only had a distraction, you could escape.\r\n\r\nSneak Attack is that distraction. Simply pull out your phone, choose a sound effect and set the timer up to 30 seconds. Then place your phone in a strategic location and move silently away. When the Sneak Attack goes off, slip away or take out the bad guys when they reach for their noses.\r\n\r\n* RECORD-A-FART *\r\n\r\nThere are special moments in life that just have to be captured on your phone to be believed. \r\n\r\nThe birth of a child, a stunning sunset, bigfoot, and of course, the after effects of a triple burrito lunch.\r\n\r\nUsing iFart’s \"Record-A-Fart\" feature you can now make audible memories for a lifetime and play them for friends and family. Plastic wrap optional.\r\n\r\n* FAVE FARTS *\r\n\r\nUsing our FAVES feature you can create a playlist of your fave farts for easy access. You can also record and rename multiple farts which are stored in the FAVES list.\r\n\r\n* BLAST *\r\n\r\nIf only there was an internationally recognized sound that alleviates stress, brings laughter, lowers blood pressure, clears a room, helps bring peace to the middle east and is enjoyed by both Democrats and Republicans.\r\n\r\nWell Folks... just hit the BLAST button and let the healing begin. \r\n\r\n\r\n* BONUS FART PACKS*\r\n\r\niFart includes EIGHT of our funniest Fart Packs, each pack contains up to 10 fresh cuts for your enjoyment.\r\n\r\n* Jurassic -  Ever wonder what a Dinosaur fart sounds like?.\r\n\r\n* Presidential -  Joe, Kamala, Bernie, Hillary, & Donald let em rip!\r\n\r\n* Fart Wars - May the Flatulence Be With You\r\n\r\n* Movies  - In a world without gas… this is a land that prays for a hero.\r\n\r\n* Bands  - The bands on the runs with these farts.\r\n\r\n* Food  - You can't have dessert until you play all these farts.\r\n\r\n* Shart Toppers   - Music Parody Rips \r\n\r\n* Celebrities  - Sorry Kanye, you didn't make the cuts.\r\n\r\nHey, you read this far!    \r\n\r\nWe've added a bonus fart to our wheel called \"Fart-O-Rater\".  \n\nMake sure you play it and while you're laughing leave us a review and let us know your what your favorite fart or fart pack is today!"

      "label": "It is the 1st of August. \nUpon awakening, you find yourself without any memories from before August 1st. Everything, from the sort of life you lived to the relationships you had, is a complete blank.\nA young boy named Orion appears in front of you, revealing himself to be a spirit attached to your mind. Under Orion's guidance, you begin the struggle to regain your memories...\n\nBlunt ∙ Earnest - Heart -\nShin (VA: Tetsuya Kakihara)\nYour childhood friend and current boyfriend. He is only 18 years old, but has a very serious and cold demeanor that frequently causes conflicts with others his age. Oftentimes, he appears aloof and indifferent, but he is actually very affectionate and cares deeply for you. He is a senior in high school, and is currently preparing for university entrance exams. He is also Toma's childhood friend. \n\nAlluring ∙ Fascinating - Spade -\nIkki (VA: Kisho Taniyama)\nIkki has a unique condition that causes women to become enamored with him upon sight. He is 22 years old and is currently enrolled in a nearby university. Having given up on a genuine relationship, he lives the life of a playboy, indulging in the transient pleasures it brings. However, he becomes very close to you after he discovers his “eyes” have no effect on your emotions toward him. Despite his looks and popularity, Ikki is really a kind and sincere man. He is a good friend of Kent’s, a graduate student who attends the same university. \n\nCool ∙ Logical - Clover -\nKent (VA: Akira Ishida)\nA highly intelligent, 25-year-old mathematics graduate student, Kent sees the world from a purely objective point of view. He is normally very confident in his convictions and in the results of his relentless analysis of others; however, it seems as if he is unable to maintain the same composure when he is around you. His tendency to logically dissect every action makes him a difficult companion, especially among females.  He is a good friend of Ikki’s, who competes with him in solving overly complex math puzzles. \n\n\nAffectionate ∙ Intense - Diamond -\nToma (VA: Satoshi Hino)\nToma is a 20-year-old law student at the university you both attend. Being your oldest friend from childhood, he has naturally assumed the role of your big brother. Toma has always kept an eye on you from a close distance, and takes on the responsibility of caring for you after you collapse on the road outside of your apartment. His desire to protect you is extremely strong, to the point that his mental state can become unpredictable... He is also a childhood friend of Shin’s.\n\nMysterious ∙ Enigmatic - Joker -\nUkyo (VA: Kouki Miyata)\nA strange young man who appears unexpectedly. He gives you mysterious warnings, and disappears again without explanation. Whether he wants to protect you or harm you is unclear.\n\nFriend ∙ Protector\nOrion (VA: Yumi Igarashi)\nA spirit from a distant world. His outward appearance looks to the human eye as a 10-year-old boy. On his way to run a short errand in the human world, he crashes into you and becomes trapped inside your mind. He supports you in order to fulfill your mutual goal of regaining your memories.\n\n\n- How to Play \nAfter the opening movie, the title screen will be shown. To play a new game, select “NEW GAME.” To continue your current game, select “CONTINUE.” If you’d like to select another story, select “CHAPTER.”  After clearing the prologue, four different stories will become available."

Explore the colorful and electrifying world of science and meet all 118 of the elements from the periodic table. \n\nDiscover elements by experimenting with the lab tools! \n\n* Take your element for a spin in the centrifuge.\n* Warm them up in the Bunsen burner. \n* Put the element on ice with the cooling agent! \n* Add a drop or two of mysterious liquids from the test tubes.\n* Change their voltage and make them magnetic with the oscilloscope.\n\nEach element has it's own personality. In Toca Lab: Elements, what does Neon sound like? Is Gold heavy or light? Is Nitrogen squishy or hard? Explore, inspect, and study each one and let us know! Can you find all 118? \n\nThe time has come, future scientists, to head into the lab to explore and discover. Put on your lab coat and protective eye gear because things are about to get experimental!\n\nToca Lab: Elements is a place for playing and having fun, and with it we hope to inspire kids to explore science.

It blasted to #1 on Christmas Day of that year and clinged to number one for weeks. It continued to linger in the Top Ten for over a year! \r\n\r\nWe can’t even tell you how much time it spent farting around at #2.\r\n\r\nThe App has been completely recoded and rebuilt for 2021.   \r\n\r\nHere are just a few of the useful, signature features of iFart®.\r\n\r\n* SECURITY FART *\r\n\r\nPhones and pdas are stolen on a daily basis, but if you are using iFart's advanced security system you can stop criminals right in their tracks.\r\n\r\nAnd when thieves try to snatch your phone, they'll be in for a shock when they're blasted by your chosen sound effect. Most criminals know how to lie, but \"it wasn't me\" isn't going to work with iFart.\r\n\r\nCall the authorities and send these phone stealing scumbags off to the gas chamber.\r\n\r\n* SNEAK ATTACK *\r\n\r\nThe sneak attack function can literally save your life. Let's say that you're in a warehouse gun battle. Bad guys are closing in on you, but if you only had a distraction, you could escape.\r\n\r\nSneak Attack is that distraction. Simply pull out your phone, choose a sound effect and set the timer up to 30 seconds. Then place your phone in a strategic location and move silently away. When the Sneak Attack goes off, slip away or take out the bad guys when they reach for their noses.\r\n\r\n* RECORD-A-FART *\r\n\r\nThere are special moments in life that just have to be captured on your phone to be believed. \r\n\r\nThe birth of a child, a stunning sunset, bigfoot, and of course, the after effects of a triple burrito lunch.\r\n\r\nUsing iFart’s \"Record-A-Fart\" feature you can now make audible memories for a lifetime and play them for friends and family. Plastic wrap optional.\r\n\r\n* FAVE FARTS *\r\n\r\nUsing our FAVES feature you can create a playlist of your fave farts for easy access. You can also record and rename multiple farts which are stored in the FAVES list.\r\n\r\n* BLAST *\r\n\r\nIf only there was an internationally recognized sound that alleviates stress, brings laughter, lowers blood pressure, clears a room, helps bring peace to the middle east and is enjoyed by both Democrats and Republicans.\r\n\r\nWell Folks... just hit the BLAST button and let the healing begin. \r\n\r\n\r\n* BONUS FART PACKS*\r\n\r\niFart includes EIGHT of our funniest Fart Packs, each pack contains up to 10 fresh cuts for your enjoyment.\r\n\r\n* Jurassic -  Ever wonder what a Dinosaur fart sounds like?.\r\n\r\n* Presidential -  Joe, Kamala, Bernie, Hillary, & Donald let em rip!\r\n\r\n* Fart Wars - May the Flatulence Be With You\r\n\r\n* Movies  - In a world without gas… this is a land that prays for a hero.\r\n\r\n* Bands  - The bands on the runs with these farts.\r\n\r\n* Food  - You can't have dessert until you play all these farts.\r\n\r\n* Shart Toppers   - Music Parody Rips \r\n\r\n* Celebrities  - Sorry Kanye, you didn't make the cuts.\r\n\r\nHey, you read this far!    \r\n\r\nWe've added a bonus fart to our wheel called \"Fart-O-Rater\".  \n\nMake sure you play it and while you're laughing leave us a review and let us know your what your favorite fart or fart pack is today!"

The curated library of around 2300 words will help you to see what you can't hear.\n\nThe estimated accuracy of the data is listed with the translation along with the EMF reading at the time of the capture.\n\nWe also show you a live reading of the electromagnetic field around the phone, measured in gauss.\n\nHold the microphone button to pause detection, this will help you to avoid catching your own conversations, resume detection by lifting your finger.\n\nDon't forget to scroll, your entire session may continue beyond the screen, so scroll down to see the latest results.\n\nThe microphone in Apple's devices is very good and you may find that excess environmental noise has an effect on the accuracy of the text returned. What you see on the screen is the best guess for what was said.\n\nYou can also change languages in the device settings under GhostTalk.  GhostTalk currently supports English, French, Chinese, German and Spanish.\n\nJoin our group chat to discuss ghostly things with other users.\n\nIf things get a little spooky we recommend turning on some lights and taking a break from the app for a while. :)"

These intelligent marine mammals live in social groups (called pods) with relatives and friends, where they communicate with other pod members through sounds such as whistles and clicks. Dolphin whistles are used for communication, while clicks are used for echolocation - helping the dolphin navigate the ocean. Some dolphin species, such as bottlenose dolphins, even have unique whistles that help other dolphins identify them - just like humans have names! \n\nWith this app, you can listen to different dolphin vocalizations - can you identify different types of sounds?"

      "label": "The Ghost EVP/EMF Radio has been developed for exciting paranormal detection and exploration. We've put a lot of effort into making the app easy to use, so that both professional and enthusiast paranormal researchers, ghost hunters and ghost tour organizers can enjoy the experience.\n\nIf you are either easily frightened, a super skeptic \"left brainer\" or have a serious heart-related medical condition, you are probably better off avoiding this app.\n\nElectronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) is the collective name for the sounds sometimes detected on electronic recordings and reminiscent of human speech. These sounds are usually found in recordings with noise or poor radio reception and are considered by many to be the voices of paranormal beings such as ghosts, spirits, demons and other energy based entities. EVP is a form of Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC), a term coined by professor Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s.\n\nThis app has taken the traditional ghost box to the next level. As with traditional ghost boxes, chaotic noise seems to be both inviting and sensitive to paranormal manipulation. The app generates audible speech by detecting meaningful phrases and words together with properties such as gender, age and the current mood of the communicating entity. We continuously improve the app, based on user feedback, and use it during our own paranormal investigations as well.\n\n*** Features ***\n* Radio Control Panel where you control the radio in real-time.\n* Brownian, Pink and White Noise generators.\n* Electromagnetic Field Meter using the Magnetometer sensor of your device.\n* Multiple graphical themes for the user interface.\n* Record your encounters with or without the microphone of your device.\n* Real-time audio visualization: Oscilloscope, Spectrometer, Voicegram and Waveform (tap to toggle).\n* Text log screen: The persistent text log is where you can sort, share and delete your log.\n* Quick text log: Tap on the main TV screen to toggle between the different view modes.\n* Open your EVP recordings in compatible audio apps with the touch of a button.\n* Optional Auto Recording which only produces recordings when something interesting is encountered.\n* Optional vibration (iPhone only) and audible alarms every time an entity has been detected.\n* Share your recordings with friends and family.\n* Upload your recordings to your Dropbox.\n\nPlease note that the app will degrade gracefully to Performance mode when running on older hardware, which means that some features may not be available or limited when running on, for example, the iPad 2 or the iPhone 4S.\n\n\n*** Languages ***\nEnglish (US/UK), Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Latin, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\n\n*** Support ***\n* For support, feedback and more information, please visit https://paranormalsoftware.com/support, or use the buttons on the Settings screen.\n* Knowledge Base: https://paranormalsoftware.com/support/kb\n* Twitter: @GhostRadioEVP\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ghostevpradio\n* Mailing list: http://tiny.cc/ghostradiomail\n\n\nWe hope that you, like many others, will be fascinated by the paranormal experience of Ghost EVP Radio. Thanks for downloading!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nEvery effort has been made to make this app truly unique, but we can offer no guarantee that you will get specific results by using it. Since the results of this app haven't been scientifically verified, it should only be used for entertainment purposes. Please use it responsibly."

See if you can feed her the correct food from the conveyer belt. Give her enough of the food she likes and she’ll be happy again in no time!\n\nDrinking: I think Monkey could do with a drink. Let’s get him some water by connecting the pipes to the water fountain! What a splendid path you’ve chosen, Squirrel!\n\nWashing: How did Mouse get so dirty? She could do with a good wash! First get rid of the leaves… next, cover her in soap… and finally, pop every last one of the soapy bubbles! Excellent cleaning!\n\nExercising: An animal should be exercised daily!

      "label": "On the 9th of January 2015, Mandy Len Catron published an essay in The New York Times describing her experience replicating a study that claims to accelerate intimacy between two people.\n\nPsychologist Dr Arthur Aron, author of the study, devised a series of 36 specific questions intended to be asked by each person to their partner. The questions begin rather tamely, and progressively get deeper and more personal. It can be difficult to open up to a person, especially a stranger, this experience forces both parties to open up and become vulnerable with one another.\n\nThe original study had a very interesting outcome. A man and woman, both complete strangers at the time entered a room separately. Both took part asking and answering a series of questions, ending the experiment by staring silently into each other's eyes for four minutes. The outcome? Six months later, the two participants were married!\n\nTo play the quiz with your partner, you really don't need anything more than this app. Sit opposite your partner with your device between you. Take turns reading one question aloud to your partner, then both of you answer. Simple, but terrifying!\n\nThere is no time limit, be honest and be truthful. The final recommended task is to stare silently into your partners eyes for four minutes. Nervous yet?"

Il se réjouit de partir avec eux chasser le cochon sauvage, mais son père lui confie une autre mission : veiller sur sa grand-mère. Sa mission s’avère en réalité bien plus périlleuse que de chasser le cochon : un énorme oiseau de proie a tôt fait d’emporter la malheureuse grand-mère dans son repaire, au milieu de la jungle. Retourné au village, Oket se jure de retrouver sa grand-mère. Aidé par un Chaman, il se transforme peu à peu en un adversaire redoutable. Le Grand Oiseau Noir lui paraît maintenant à sa portée.\nEncore faudra-t-il le retrouver, et se mesurer à lui dans un combat titanesque.\n\nÀ l’issue du conte, un dossier pédagogique explique entre autres l’histoire récente, les cérémonies et l’organisation sociale des Indiens Kayapo d’Amazonie."

Bound to get amazing reactions.\n\nThe app uses the idea of \"Augmented Reality\" merging real life objects with computer generated graphics to create a truly frightening effect.\n\n\nTHE MAGIC SPIDER EFFFECT\nYou take a photo of the spectator's palm (secretly loading a plastic spider on the back of their hand) and place the phone on their palm to hold.\n\nYour Pet Boris - an Australian Red back spider (black widow) creeps onto the screen and they can feel the vibrations as it walks. You can tap the screen and even slide your finger into the animation to scratch the spider's back. Boris walks off the screen.\n\nYou tell them that the phone has special sensors that when you wave your hand over the screen it makes the spider come back. He does.\n\nYou get them to wave their hand over the phone. \nIt is just then that they glimpse a realistic spider clinging to the back of their hand and they FREAK OUT!!\n\nBound to get BIG reactions. \n\nFinger tone and size can be set to suit your own or you can import an image of your own finger. \n\nStart-up screen can be customised to suit your performance style. An actual  photo of their hand, solid white or any image from your library can be used as a background.\n\nNOTE: Requires a plastic spider or cockroach and adhesive dots to perform. You should be able to find these locally or you can purchase from our website.\n\nSee our website http://www.mypetboris.com for more details, spider and cockroach supplies and video presentation & instructions.\n\nLike our Facebook page to keep up to date with changes, tips and suggestions. http://www.facebook.com/MyPetBoris\n\n\nTHE MAGIC COCKROACH\nThe app also comes with a cockroach animation for those who think they are scarier than spiders.\n\n\nTHE MAGIC BUTTERFLY EFFECT - IN-APP PURCHASE - (for the Professional Magician)\n\nThe Magic Butterfly is an additional effect within the Magic Spider – My Pet Boris App. \n\nIt is enabled as an “in app purchase” for around US$2.99 depending on your local currency. The custom finger feature is also unlocked when you purchase the butterfly effect.\n \nThis is a perfect routine for those times when you want to perform a beautiful effect for a little girl or woman, leaving her with a magical gift at the end. You will get similarly strong reactions to the Magic Spider effect without the scare factor.\n\nPRESENTATION:\nThe magician simulates a grand illusion in the palm of the spectator’s hand. A tiny foil covered “Magical Egg” is placed in the palm of the spectator’s hand and then photographed. The phone is placed on their hand.\n\nThe egg transforms into a Chrysalis and then into a butterfly. The magician’s finger is seen to tickle the virtual butterfly on screen which then flies away. \nUsing a magical gesture the magician brings the butterfly back briefly before it flies off again.\n\nThe spectator is asked to try and make it return. When they try, they find a matching butterfly (in an impossible location) on the back of their hand. The original foil egg has vanished.\n\nTHE CARD REVELATION EFFECT - IN-APP PURCHASE - (for the Professional Magician)\n\nThe Magic Spider effect with the addition of a torn card corner revelation as a finale.\n\nAccessory packs and supplies are available at: http://www.mypetboris.com/store.htm\n\nSee our FAQ Section. http://www.mypetboris.com/faq.htm\n\nFull instructions at: (everything is explained)\nhttp://www.mypetboris.com/inst2099.htm.\n\nUse the password at the bottom of the \"CREDITS\" screen for access."

Take a ride on the airplane, shoot some hoops, play hide & seek and bed trampoline or get creative with paw painting - you can always have a great time with your kitten pal! Explore the kitten's world and discover cute animations, laugh with and care for your adorable, realistic pet.\nThe unique game-design encourages children to explore the room with minimal use of icons or menus. The 7 mini-games offer a wide variety of interactions and are designed so they appeal to a wide age range. The philosophy is not about winning, losing or competition, it's about having fun in a child-friendly environment and learning without even realizing it! Great Mini-Games with purpose!:\n\nCompatibility: The App doesn't support iPad2, iPhone 4s, iPad Mini1, iPod5 with iOS9\n\n1) Kitten Hide&Seek - encourages focus and attention.\n2) Paw Painting - creativity unleashed! Mix red, yellow, blue to get every imaginable colour - your child will learn realistic paint mixing, then come up with your own masterpiece using a paw print or a standard brush.\n3) Mouse & Cheese - Memorize where the zones are to sneak mouse past little kitten over to the cheese. Or just have some laughs seeing what happens when little kitten catches the mouse!\n4) Bed Trampoline - Discover all little kitten's hidden tricks and moves!\n5) Animal Puzzle - Educational 'mix and match' funny animal combinations to earn biscuits that you can then feed to your little kitten.\n6) Feeding - Each time you play a mini-game you receive cat food snacks, children love feeding the little kitten and watching it licking its lips and purr after a good feed! \n7) Cat-in-the-box - Educational 'hand-eye coordination' mini-game \n8) Balloon Popping - can you discovered all the different shapes?!\n\nNot using any text menus, the game can be easily navigated by young children. Parents have the option to limit screen time for their kids: after a chosen time, the kitten gets tired and goes to sleep.\nLittle Kitten is a high-tech app - using the latest 3d animation technology to create the visuals, it also uses cutting edge programming to maximize the user experience on your apple device. Enjoy the premium quality content in this original app brought to you by Squeakosaurus.

This app is part of the CLIPish Pro mega app.  To do everything this app does AND MUCH MORE, rather than buying this individual app, you may want to consider getting the all-in-one CLIPish Pro 2 app--20 APPS IN ONE for one low price!\n\n45-second demo: http://video.clipish.net/about \n\nFEATURES YOU WON'T FIND ANYWHERE ELSE:\n\n• BROWSE MILLIONS of Animations, Clip Art, Emoticons, Sounds, Wallpapers, Photos, and Videos.\n• SEND using MMS Text Messaging, Email, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and more.\n• SEARCH for ANY specific item, such as \"Happy Mothers Day,\" \"I love you,\" \"Bikini Models,\" etc., and be shown HUNDREDS of images.\n• UPLOAD your own images for editing (crop, rotate, add text) and sharing.\n• PERSONALIZE images by adding text (adjust font, color, size, and placement).\n• ONE-TAP SEND button for quick sharing within CLIPish, or SAVE to your Photo Library. \n• OVER 600 FACEBOOK & TWITTER ICONS AND SYMBOLS to dress up your status and wall posts.\n• WALLPAERS optimized for your particular device.\n• UPDATE your Facebook or Twitter status with fun images.\n• UPDATED DATABASE of new images delivered daily directly to your device via the CLIPish servers.\n• ORGANIZE FAVORITE images in customizable folders with drag and drop sorting.\n• PUSH NOTIFICATION when new images added.\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\n* A NOTE ABOUT COMPATIBILITY WITH NON-iPHONE USERS:  Sharing images with Facebook, Twitter and Email works with pretty much anyone, but depending on what cell network and type of cell phone the person you're sending to has, some of the images you send via text messaging may not work.   This has nothing to do with CLIPish, but is a factor of the compatibility between: 1) the iPhone, 2) your network provider, 3) the other person's network provider, and 4) the other person's cell phone.  See http://clipish.net/support.\n\n* FAST INTERNET CONNECTION RECOMMENDED:  Due to the server communication, CLIPish works best for users with a strong 3G signal or WiFi connection.\n\n* FAMILIES:  This app accesses Internet content, but filters out adult material.  For the strongest protection, set your rating filter to Strict or get the Family Edition.\n\n* ANIMATIONS ON FACEBOOK:  You can send all the items found in CLIPish to Facebook, HOWEVER, Facebook converts all animations to still images, as Facebook does not allow animations to \"play\" on their site.\n\n* Some images featured are public domain.  If you believe your work has been included in err, please let us know so it can be removed immediately.\n\nWRITE US!  Suggestions appreciated and we're always here to help: support@clipish.net"

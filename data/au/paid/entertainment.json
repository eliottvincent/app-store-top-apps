      "label": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved"

This app is part of the CLIPish Pro mega app.  To do everything this app does AND MUCH MORE, rather than buying this individual app, you may want to consider getting the all-in-one CLIPish Pro 2 app--20 APPS IN ONE for one low price!\n\n45-second demo: http://video.clipish.net/about \n\nFEATURES YOU WON'T FIND ANYWHERE ELSE:\n\n• BROWSE MILLIONS of Animations, Clip Art, Emoticons, Sounds, Wallpapers, Photos, and Videos.\n• SEND using MMS Text Messaging, Email, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and more.\n• SEARCH for ANY specific item, such as \"Happy Mothers Day,\" \"I love you,\" \"Bikini Models,\" etc., and be shown HUNDREDS of images.\n• UPLOAD your own images for editing (crop, rotate, add text) and sharing.\n• PERSONALIZE images by adding text (adjust font, color, size, and placement).\n• ONE-TAP SEND button for quick sharing within CLIPish, or SAVE to your Photo Library. \n• OVER 600 FACEBOOK & TWITTER ICONS AND SYMBOLS to dress up your status and wall posts.\n• WALLPAERS optimized for your particular device.\n• UPDATE your Facebook or Twitter status with fun images.\n• UPDATED DATABASE of new images delivered daily directly to your device via the CLIPish servers.\n• ORGANIZE FAVORITE images in customizable folders with drag and drop sorting.\n• PUSH NOTIFICATION when new images added.\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\n* A NOTE ABOUT COMPATIBILITY WITH NON-iPHONE USERS:  Sharing images with Facebook, Twitter and Email works with pretty much anyone, but depending on what cell network and type of cell phone the person you're sending to has, some of the images you send via text messaging may not work.   This has nothing to do with CLIPish, but is a factor of the compatibility between: 1) the iPhone, 2) your network provider, 3) the other person's network provider, and 4) the other person's cell phone.  See http://clipish.net/support.\n\n* FAST INTERNET CONNECTION RECOMMENDED:  Due to the server communication, CLIPish works best for users with a strong 3G signal or WiFi connection.\n\n* FAMILIES:  This app accesses Internet content, but filters out adult material.  For the strongest protection, set your rating filter to Strict or get the Family Edition.\n\n* ANIMATIONS ON FACEBOOK:  You can send all the items found in CLIPish to Facebook, HOWEVER, Facebook converts all animations to still images, as Facebook does not allow animations to \"play\" on their site.\n\n* Some images featured are public domain.  If you believe your work has been included in err, please let us know so it can be removed immediately.\n\nWRITE US!  Suggestions appreciated and we're always here to help: support@clipish.net"

      "label": "On the 9th of January 2015, Mandy Len Catron published an essay in The New York Times describing her experience replicating a study that claims to accelerate intimacy between two people.\n\nPsychologist Dr Arthur Aron, author of the study, devised a series of 36 specific questions intended to be asked by each person to their partner. The questions begin rather tamely, and progressively get deeper and more personal. It can be difficult to open up to a person, especially a stranger, this experience forces both parties to open up and become vulnerable with one another.\n\nThe original study had a very interesting outcome. A man and woman, both complete strangers at the time entered a room separately. Both took part asking and answering a series of questions, ending the experiment by staring silently into each other's eyes for four minutes. The outcome? Six months later, the two participants were married!\n\nTo play the quiz with your partner, you really don't need anything more than this app. Sit opposite your partner with your device between you. Take turns reading one question aloud to your partner, then both of you answer. Simple, but terrifying!\n\nThere is no time limit, be honest and be truthful. The final recommended task is to stare silently into your partners eyes for four minutes. Nervous yet?"

      "label": "In the modern age, paranormal investigators use many tools to communicate with spirits. Ouija Boards, Spirit Boxes, radios and apps are just a few of the many tools they use but cultures have been using tools to communicate with spirits for ages. \n\nCleromancy, the practice of contacting divine truth via random castings of dice (or bones) stretches back before recorded history. Astragalomancy, is a form of divination that uses dice marked with letters. In fact, many ancient cultures have various forms of dice divination.\n\nNecro Dice is a modern version of this ancient practice. This app means to combine the ancient and modern forms of communication in a completely new and unique way. Users seeking answers or messages can roll the dice with a simple tap of the screen. Once the user’s intention has been cast through the rolling of the dice, it is up to the spirits to communicate by influencing the randomization of letters to form words. This phenomenon of spirit communication through the manipulation of electronic devices has been well documented for several decades.\n\nNecro Dice functions by generating a handful of dice with random letters assigned to each of the six faces of each dice. These dice are then simulated with an advanced physics engine that handles dice to table and dice to dice collisions. When the physics simulation completes and the dice settle the result is a jumble of letters shown on the top face of the dice. Normally when using dice, the user is then required to inspect the dice to try and find words in this jumble of letters. This app uses a proprietary algorithm to inspect the top faces of the dice and try to match words and names to a dictionary. A word is chosen from the jumble of letters based on many factors including distance, length, location and relevance. Once a word is detected in the dice,  the app will highlight the individual letters on the dice and display the word on the screen. A list of words rolled since the start of the app can be accessed in the word log by pressing the button at the lower left of the screen.\n\nRolling dice isn’t just for games, do the spirits have a message for you?"

      "label": "Chrysalis Tarot dives deeply into the waters of our collective unconscious, bringing up pearls of wisdom for our contemplation. Populated by an array of familiar characters from many mythologies, these guardians gently reveal synchronicity’s hand guiding your Tarot spreads, your life, and ultimately, your destiny.\n\nIn the world of Chrysalis Tarot, The Empress and The Emperor are Gaia and The Green Man. Medieval and Celtic beings dance elegantly with characters from ancient Greek, Hindu, and Egyptian mythologies, and from Haitian Voudon. These archetypal beings come from all races and from many different times, brought together within the all-embracing diversity of Chrysalis Tarot.\n\nChrysalis strikes a happy medium between conforming with the venerable RWS system, and re-visioning Tarot for today. Major Arcana cards are re-imagined, and the pips are unlike any you’ve seen before. The court cards are a charming troupe of medieval messengers. But Chrysalis is also similar enough to RWS style decks that it is easy to learn. \n\nHolly Sierra’s sumptuous art and Toney Brooks’ wit and wisdom make this deck really shine.\n\n*Intuitive, elegant interface is easy for beginners and experts\n*Gorgeous full screen, high-resolution card images\n*Full support for all current iOS devices\n*Sophisticated journal\n*Includes unabridged compact book\n*19 spreads built in\n*Design your own layout with Free Form\n*Allow reversed cards or not\n*Option to use Major Arcana only\n*Zoom in to enlarge card details\n*Share reading via Facebook, email and Twitter\n*Animated shuffle & cut\n*Optional voice prompts\n*Customize with your own card meanings & reading cloths\n*Many adjustable settings\n*Book and card meanings available in English only\n\nChrysalis Tarot’s Gaian consciousness and universal spirituality will win your heart."

      "label": "The Ghost EVP/EMF Radio has been developed for exciting paranormal detection and exploration. We've put a lot of effort into making the app easy to use, so that both professional and enthusiast paranormal researchers, ghost hunters and ghost tour organizers can enjoy the experience.\n\nIf you are either easily frightened, a super skeptic \"left brainer\" or have a serious heart-related medical condition, you are probably better off avoiding this app.\n\nElectronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) is the collective name for the sounds sometimes detected on electronic recordings and reminiscent of human speech. These sounds are usually found in recordings with noise or poor radio reception and are considered by many to be the voices of paranormal beings such as ghosts, spirits, demons and other energy based entities. EVP is a form of Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC), a term coined by professor Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s.\n\nThis app has taken the traditional ghost box to the next level. As with traditional ghost boxes, chaotic noise seems to be both inviting and sensitive to paranormal manipulation. The app generates audible speech by detecting meaningful phrases and words together with properties such as gender, age and the current mood of the communicating entity. We continuously improve the app, based on user feedback, and use it during our own paranormal investigations as well.\n\n*** Features ***\n* Radio Control Panel where you control the radio in real-time.\n* Brownian, Pink and White Noise generators.\n* Electromagnetic Field Meter using the Magnetometer sensor of your device.\n* Multiple graphical themes for the user interface.\n* Record your encounters with or without the microphone of your device.\n* Real-time audio visualization: Oscilloscope, Spectrometer, Voicegram and Waveform (tap to toggle).\n* Text log screen: The persistent text log is where you can sort, share and delete your log.\n* Quick text log: Tap on the main TV screen to toggle between the different view modes.\n* Open your EVP recordings in compatible audio apps with the touch of a button.\n* Optional Auto Recording which only produces recordings when something interesting is encountered.\n* Optional vibration (iPhone only) and audible alarms every time an entity has been detected.\n* Share your recordings with friends and family.\n* Upload your recordings to your Dropbox.\n\nPlease note that the app will degrade gracefully to Performance mode when running on older hardware, which means that some features may not be available or limited when running on, for example, the iPad 2 or the iPhone 4S.\n\n\n*** Languages ***\nEnglish (US/UK), Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Latin, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\n\n*** Support ***\n* For support, feedback and more information, please visit https://paranormalsoftware.com/support, or use the buttons on the Settings screen.\n* Knowledge Base: https://paranormalsoftware.com/support/kb\n* Twitter: @GhostRadioEVP\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ghostevpradio\n* Mailing list: http://tiny.cc/ghostradiomail\n\n\nWe hope that you, like many others, will be fascinated by the paranormal experience of Ghost EVP Radio. Thanks for downloading!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nEvery effort has been made to make this app truly unique, but we can offer no guarantee that you will get specific results by using it. Since the results of this app haven't been scientifically verified, it should only be used for entertainment purposes. Please use it responsibly."

Others claim that absolutely \nnothing is taking place, \njust happenstance or imagination.  \n\nMany users see these type of devices \nas a tool for paranormal investigation. \nThe softwares author Digital Dowsing llc \nfeels the device should be used for experimentation  \nnot a tool for Investigation.  \n\nThis Application was written \nfor experienced ITC researchers, not designed as a \nparty favor or game.\n\n=========================\nVersion 2.0\nRequires OS 7 or Higher \nFor the iPad or iPhone \n** Designed for experienced ITC   Experimenters\n  \n=========================\n\nSo what can a user expect? \nThe idea is simple if you believe \nthat communication Is possible.  \nITC would be a great first step. \nITC reads the environment and \ncreates speech fragments. \n\nAs the device runs it  slices speech \ninto small fragments. Like tuning a radio as \nthe dial moves you hear  short sound bits. \n\nBy scanning the ITC creates speech and \nspeech like sounds.  \n\nDigital dowsing has produced this type of \ndevice for several years now.  \nUsing the experience gained from actual \nhardware production, Digital Dowsing \nreproduces real world functions in this \niPhone,iPad application.  \n\nPlease don't purchase this application if \nyour expecting perfect results. \n\nThis is a tool for experimentation,\nnot a telephone.  \n\nResults will depend on effort  \ntime and patience. \nITC \" trans Instrumental Communications \" \nis not a science it's a method.   \n\nWill it work for you, The answer is no... \nIt will only work with you. \n\nThe method  is not a fortune teller. \nDon't expect answers to life. \nExpect the responses that  make \nyou laugh or challenge you Ideas \nand concepts of what is \nreally going on.\n\nBecause of the nature of this application \nit is offered for \nexperimnetal purposes only.\n\nThe Author of this software is the Inventor \nof the Paranormal Puck, OvilusTalker,\nEM Pump, Video Ovilus, PX, SLS and many other devices. \n\nFor more details please visit www.DigitalDowsing.com\n\nHow ITC works:\nITC uses files that are played for different \nlengths of time depending on settings, \nand started in different segments of the \nspeech based on the mode and inputs. \n\nIt is not possible to put the spoken words \non the screen, each word is built from many \ndifferent words or word fragments.\n\n\nFor more details please visit www.DigitalDowsing.com"

Merry Christmas!\n\nWhen it is just the 12 days of Christmas, or you are more than 60 days early. You will be notified on many days is left. In the small widget, you will see it on the top right of your widget. And for the medium widget, at the right of your Christmas tree, you see the countdown to when it is Christmas.\n\nWhat is Christmas?\nChristmas was traditionally a Christian festival celebrating the birth of Jesus, but in the early 20th century, it also became a secular family holiday, observed by Christians and non-Christians alike. The secular holiday is often devoid of Christian elements, with the mythical figure Santa Claus playing the pivotal role. That lives in the winter wonderland in the North Pole.\n\nWhy Christmas is celebrated?\nChristmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world.\n\nThe unique features in this high-quality app:\n◆ Change the tree type in the app and widget\n◆ Change the tree blinking light color\n◆ Change the color of the bows\n◆ Change the color of the stockings\n◆ Option to change the widget background to solid, gradient, image, or transparent\n◆ Option to show you the days left until Christmas day (with the option to count to 24 or 25 December)\n\nYour Christmas Countdown is ready to go. Now we must wait and sing this song. Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way...\n\nProject information:\nhttps://www.stefanvd.net/project/my-christmas-tree\n\nThis is built by the developer of the most popular browser extension Turn Off the Lights.

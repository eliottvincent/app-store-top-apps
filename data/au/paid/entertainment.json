Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory.

      "label": "The Ghost EVP/EMF Radio has been developed for exciting paranormal detection and exploration. We've put a lot of effort into making the app easy to use, so that both professional and enthusiast paranormal researchers, ghost hunters and ghost tour organizers can enjoy the experience.\n\nIf you are either easily frightened, a super skeptic \"left brainer\" or have a serious heart-related medical condition, you are probably better off avoiding this app.\n\nElectronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) is the collective name for the sounds sometimes detected on electronic recordings and reminiscent of human speech. These sounds are usually found in recordings with noise or poor radio reception and are considered by many to be the voices of paranormal beings such as ghosts, spirits, demons and other energy based entities. EVP is a form of Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC), a term coined by professor Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s.\n\nThis app has taken the traditional ghost box to the next level. As with traditional ghost boxes, chaotic noise seems to be both inviting and sensitive to paranormal manipulation. The app generates audible speech by detecting meaningful phrases and words together with properties such as gender, age and the current mood of the communicating entity. We continuously improve the app, based on user feedback, and use it during our own paranormal investigations as well.\n\n*** Features ***\n* Radio Control Panel where you control the radio in real-time.\n* Brownian, Pink and White Noise generators.\n* Electromagnetic Field Meter using the Magnetometer sensor of your device.\n* Multiple graphical themes for the user interface.\n* Record your encounters with or without the microphone of your device.\n* Real-time audio visualization: Oscilloscope, Spectrometer, Voicegram and Waveform (tap to toggle).\n* Text log screen: The persistent text log is where you can sort, share and delete your log.\n* Quick text log: Tap on the main TV screen to toggle between the different view modes.\n* Open your EVP recordings in compatible audio apps with the touch of a button.\n* Optional Auto Recording which only produces recordings when something interesting is encountered.\n* Optional vibration (iPhone only) and audible alarms every time an entity has been detected.\n* Share your recordings with friends and family.\n* Upload your recordings to your Dropbox.\n\nPlease note that the app will degrade gracefully to Performance mode when running on older hardware, which means that some features may not be available or limited when running on, for example, the iPad 2 or the iPhone 4S.\n\n\n*** Languages ***\nEnglish (US/UK), Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Latin, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\n\n*** Support ***\n* For support, feedback and more information, please visit https://paranormalsoftware.com/support, or use the buttons on the Settings screen.\n* Knowledge Base: https://paranormalsoftware.com/support/kb\n* Twitter: @GhostRadioEVP\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ghostevpradio\n* Mailing list: http://tiny.cc/ghostradiomail\n\n\nWe hope that you, like many others, will be fascinated by the paranormal experience of Ghost EVP Radio. Thanks for downloading!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nEvery effort has been made to make this app truly unique, but we can offer no guarantee that you will get specific results by using it. Since the results of this app haven't been scientifically verified, it should only be used for entertainment purposes. Please use it responsibly."

      "label": "On the 9th of January 2015, Mandy Len Catron published an essay in The New York Times describing her experience replicating a study that claims to accelerate intimacy between two people.\n\nPsychologist Dr Arthur Aron, author of the study, devised a series of 36 specific questions intended to be asked by each person to their partner. The questions begin rather tamely, and progressively get deeper and more personal. It can be difficult to open up to a person, especially a stranger, this experience forces both parties to open up and become vulnerable with one another.\n\nThe original study had a very interesting outcome. A man and woman, both complete strangers at the time entered a room separately. Both took part asking and answering a series of questions, ending the experiment by staring silently into each other's eyes for four minutes. The outcome? Six months later, the two participants were married!\n\nTo play the quiz with your partner, you really don't need anything more than this app. Sit opposite your partner with your device between you. Take turns reading one question aloud to your partner, then both of you answer. Simple, but terrifying!\n\nThere is no time limit, be honest and be truthful. The final recommended task is to stare silently into your partners eyes for four minutes. Nervous yet?"

Merry Christmas!\n\nWhen it is just the 12 days of Christmas, or you are more than 60 days early. You will be notified on many days is left. In the small widget, you will see it on the top right of your widget. And for the medium widget, at the right of your Christmas tree, you see the countdown to when it is Christmas.\n\nWhat is Christmas?\nChristmas was traditionally a Christian festival celebrating the birth of Jesus, but in the early 20th century, it also became a secular family holiday, observed by Christians and non-Christians alike. The secular holiday is often devoid of Christian elements, with the mythical figure Santa Claus playing the pivotal role. That lives in the winter wonderland in the North Pole.\n\nWhy Christmas is celebrated?\nChristmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world.\n\nThe unique features in this high-quality app:\n◆ Change the tree type in the app and widget\n◆ Change the tree blinking light color\n◆ Change the color of the bows\n◆ Change the color of the stockings\n◆ Option to change the widget background to solid, gradient, image, or transparent\n◆ Option to show you the days left until Christmas day (with the option to count to 24 or 25 December)\n\nYour Christmas Countdown is ready to go. Now we must wait and sing this song. Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way...\n\nProject information:\nhttps://www.stefanvd.net/project/my-christmas-tree\n\nThis is built by the developer of the most popular browser extension Turn Off the Lights.

After that application uses the built-in GPS to check your current speed. When it reaches 88 MPH application  plays some sounds and switching the \"Present Time\" to your \"Destination\" - like you just jumped over the time. Application \"come back\" automatically after several seconds. \nPlease note and take this VERY SERIOUS -speed of 88 MPH is ILLEGAL on the MOST of the public roads. Double check this before your experiments and always keep the safety. \nThis feature will not work well on iPods and not-3G iPads - the real hardware GPS chip is required.\n\nOn the \"Time Distance\" screen you can see the number of seconds, minutes, hours, days and weeks between Present and Destination time. This screen is available by tapping the \"DIST\" label.\n\n \n\nYou can change the \"Destination TIme\" by tapping the screen slightly above or slightly below the digits. Keypad to enter the Destination time available on tap on the Destionation time numbers. Enter \"05\" for March, \"06\" for June, etc. \"0\" and \"1\" sets the AM/PM time.\n\nThanks to everyone for your suggestions about additional functionality, there is a big chance they will be implemented in next release. Please forward your requests to support@atoll-ordenadores.com email address."

      "label": "In the modern age, paranormal investigators use many tools to communicate with spirits. Ouija Boards, Spirit Boxes, radios and apps are just a few of the many tools they use but cultures have been using tools to communicate with spirits for ages. \n\nCleromancy, the practice of contacting divine truth via random castings of dice (or bones) stretches back before recorded history. Astragalomancy, is a form of divination that uses dice marked with letters. In fact, many ancient cultures have various forms of dice divination.\n\nNecro Dice is a modern version of this ancient practice. This app means to combine the ancient and modern forms of communication in a completely new and unique way. Users seeking answers or messages can roll the dice with a simple tap of the screen. Once the user’s intention has been cast through the rolling of the dice, it is up to the spirits to communicate by influencing the randomization of letters to form words. This phenomenon of spirit communication through the manipulation of electronic devices has been well documented for several decades.\n\nNecro Dice functions by generating a handful of dice with random letters assigned to each of the six faces of each dice. These dice are then simulated with an advanced physics engine that handles dice to table and dice to dice collisions. When the physics simulation completes and the dice settle the result is a jumble of letters shown on the top face of the dice. Normally when using dice, the user is then required to inspect the dice to try and find words in this jumble of letters. This app uses a proprietary algorithm to inspect the top faces of the dice and try to match words and names to a dictionary. A word is chosen from the jumble of letters based on many factors including distance, length, location and relevance. Once a word is detected in the dice,  the app will highlight the individual letters on the dice and display the word on the screen. A list of words rolled since the start of the app can be accessed in the word log by pressing the button at the lower left of the screen.\n\nRolling dice isn’t just for games, do the spirits have a message for you?"

Al light effects have been precisely created and synced with thunder sound to create and impressive simulation with your Philips Hue setup. It will impress everyone.\nHue thunder can also be used to train pets to get used to thunder sounds and lightning flashes.\n\nOur unique node based soundscape engine, which is behind the beautiful designed and intuitive user interface, is truly innovative. It uses techniques which are used by top game designers and audio engineers to mimic nature's way and randomness. On top of that our soundscape apps use a unique and simple to use occurrence slider to let you decide how often a specific bird or other sound is used in the preset. Still it's totally unpredictable when a specific sound is being heard therefore producing an amazingly natural sound experience. It can run for hours on end without getting repetitive like other sound engines do. \n\nChoose from the following thunder presets and themes:\n\nThunder presets:\n- Light drizzle.\n- On a rainy day.\n- Heavy rain pours down.\n- Light thunder storm.\n- Inside the thunder storm.\n- Heavy thunder storm.\n- Tornado Alley.\n- Hurricane mayhem.\n\nThunder Ambient presets:\n- A damp rain forest.\n- At the beach after a warm day.\n- Staring out the window in a busy city.\n- A walk in the city under the umbrella.\n- Bad weather camping at the lake.\n- Storm over NYC.\n- After the storm.\n- In the car.\n- Bike ride through Amsterdam.\n\nThe following elements can be altered during playback:\n- Sky brightness.\n- Sky On/Off\n- Thunder brightness.\n- Thunder occurrence.\n- Environment volume.\n- Thunder volume.\n\nOther features:\n- Bluetooth and Airplay supported with delay compensation.\n- Sleep timer to safely fall asleep with a stormy fading background. Lights turn off after sleeptimer is finished.\n\n (Hue Thunder also works without Philips Hue, but obviously without light effects)."

Play with the parameters to create an unlimited number of exciting 3D shapes. You can make the sculpture shiny by selecting an environment that will be reflected on the object.\n\nMandelbulb Raytracer is another exciting real-time ray tracer from Angisoft for the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4. It renders the Mandelbulb fractal with high accuracy. Zooming makes an unlimited amount of detail visible.\n\nFractals are self-similar mathematical shapes in complex space. The Mandelbulb fractal is a 3-dimensional analog of the Mandelbrot set using an hypercomplex algebra based on spherical coordinates. This app uses the graphics chip of the iPhone 3GS or iPhone 4 to compute a 3D image of the fractal by ray tracing using OpenGL ES 2.0 shaders.\n\nDouble/Triple tap and drag the finger horizontally or vertically to change the shape of the Mandelbulb fractal. You can also set these constant in the Settings tab. The Settings tab also allows to enable an environment that is mirrored on the Mandelbulb fractal. The accuracy of the fractal surface can also be set here. If you have red-cyan glasses available, you can see the fractal with real depth by enabling stereo mode.\n\nA one finger drag rotates the camera around the object, a two finger pinch is used for zooming and a three finger drag translates the camera. You can hide the tab bar to create a screen shot. Double tap to bring back the tab bar.\n\n!!!!   Important announcement !!!!\nTo take a screen shot, hold down the home button and then push the top button. The screen will flash and the resulting image will be placed on your camera roll. From there, you can sync it back to your computer, e-mail it to friends, or do anything else you can do with any other photo in your camera roll."

Two rods are attached to spinning wheels.  The rods meet at a point that holds a pen, and the pen draws on a spinning piece of paper.\n\nSpin Draw lets you explore a vast space of exciting, elegant designs, far beyond the capabilities of the HOOT-NANNY. Adjust the wheels and rods and watch the drawing evolve before your eyes. Create designs to share with friends, explore them as mathematical forms, or just sit back and watch the curve slowly emerge on your screen.\n\nSpin Draw also offers a full range of sharing tools. Save your drawings as pixels or paths, or show them to friends on social media.\n\nThis app will never show you an ad, ask you to write a review, or require you to unlock features via in-app purchases."

      "label": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved"

You can live out movie fight scenes WITH AN AI! Then it started doing things I didn't know it could do... like *kisses hard* or *hurls you into fan*... yep it gets intense. No joke this is the real deal and it is awesome.\" 4th Jul 2010\n\n \n\n \nCleverbot is Artificial Intelligence. It learns what people say, in context, and imitates.\n\nCleverbot says many things - claiming to be human, role-playing and much more. It may even say things you find inappropriate. Use with discretion and at your own risk.\n \nCleverbot is conversational entertainment - no more, no less. It is not made to be logical, give advice, or be useful. Parents must decide whether they wish young people to have access. Be sure of this, however: it is a bot. It is software. You will never talk to a human."

Each layer has a treat (candy) and a piece of paper with something to do or say between the paper. In this case, the phone is the parcel. The group of people sit in a circle and pass the parcel (your phone) around the circle while the music plays. Once the music stops the person holding the phone gets to say or do what the phone says. Just like the traditional game, you should give a treat to the winner of each round. \r\n\r\nYou can set the number of players (it is designed so that each player gets to win twice). We usually play that if someone has won twice that they pass the parcel to left to a person that has not won twice. You can also pick the music and edit the list of things to do or say (just make sure to put each thing on a new line). Have fun with it and let us know any comments.\r\n\r\nThe college version has actions that are more .\r\n\r\nIf you come up with great things to do and would like to see them added to the game, Please send us an email to web@lajdesignsw.com and we will add them as appropriate.

Banish  their anxiety   \r\nand help them to stay dry with this comforting hypnotic bedtime story, as they listen to \r\nfun sound effects and the soothing voice of Patricia Jackson, who has been a \r\nhypnotherapist for over twenty years, successfully helping thousands of clients.\n\r\n\nThis charming story written by Patricia, is about Little Billy from Blueberry Cottage who learns, with the help Wobbly Bottom Wood’s wise Ollie Owl to instruct his ‘asleep’ mind to ‘Keep the wee in when sleepin’ and if his bladder is full, to train his brain to tell him to wake up and visit the toilet before returning to bed and falling fast asleep again. \n\n\r\nThe beginning of every SOS bedtime story recording  is the same because children love repetition and familiarity makes them feel safe and those first few minutes gently guide them into a receptive state of relaxation.    \n\n\r\nBy the time the story begins,  direct and subliminal messages can then start to be absorbed by their subconscious mind and once accepted by that powerful ‘automatic’ mind, then they can easily become fact -without any effort at all.   \r\nPatricia explains at the beginning of the recording that - ‘Blueberry Cottage Bedtime stories are so good at helping you to go to sleep at night and they are magic too - because they have lots of secret messages and you probably can’t even hear them.  \nLet’s get you nice and comfy so that the magic can work really well. Take as much time as you like to relax in the next few minutes  I don’t know if you are going to close your eyes now or later. If your eyes are closed,  that’s very good …\n\nThis story is suitable for children and grown-ups of any age. Please read the following subliminal messages before playing this story to make sure they are suitable for your child:\n\nComfy Happy\r\n\r\nSnuggly Listen\r\n\r\nSafe\r\n\r\nEverything’s ok\r\n\r\nThis is easy\r\n\r\nCalm   relaxed   \r\n\r\nI keep my bed dry\r\n\r\nI sleep well at night\r\n\r\nDry Bed\r\n\r\nKeep the wee in when sleep in\r\n\r\nI can do this\r\n\r\nI have control over my wee\r\n\r\nDry bed and clothes at night\r\n\r\nSqueeze balloon tight in bed at night\r\n\r\nDry and comfy\r\n\r\nSqueeze\r\n\r\nCalm\r\n\r\nTight at night\r\n\r\nI listen to my bladder\r\n\r\nIf my bladder is full I wake up and walk to the toilet\r\n\r\nI love my dry bed\n----------------------------------------------------"

      "label": "This is the Original \"Spider on Hand\" app as seen on Youtube. Beware of imitations.\n\nDo you know anyone who is afraid of spiders? Everyone right? Then this is the perfect magic trick/prank for you.\n\nWatch the trailer video at http://www.mypetboris.com/trailer.htm\n\nMy Pet Boris app is the scariest app for the iPhone. Inspired by Jim Pace's magic trick \"The Web\" where a spider magically appears on the back of your spectator's hand. Bound to get amazing reactions.\n\nThe app uses the idea of \"Augmented Reality\" merging real life objects with computer generated graphics to create a truly frightening effect.\n\n\nTHE MAGIC SPIDER EFFFECT\nYou take a photo of the spectator's palm (secretly loading a plastic spider on the back of their hand) and place the phone on their palm to hold.\n\nYour Pet Boris - an Australian Red back spider (black widow) creeps onto the screen and they can feel the vibrations as it walks. You can tap the screen and even slide your finger into the animation to scratch the spider's back. Boris walks off the screen.\n\nYou tell them that the phone has special sensors that when you wave your hand over the screen it makes the spider come back. He does.\n\nYou get them to wave their hand over the phone. \nIt is just then that they glimpse a realistic spider clinging to the back of their hand and they FREAK OUT!!\n\nBound to get BIG reactions. \n\nFinger tone and size can be set to suit your own or you can import an image of your own finger. \n\nStart-up screen can be customised to suit your performance style. An actual  photo of their hand, solid white or any image from your library can be used as a background.\n\nNOTE: Requires a plastic spider or cockroach and adhesive dots to perform. You should be able to find these locally or you can purchase from our website.\n\nSee our website http://www.mypetboris.com for more details, spider and cockroach supplies and video presentation & instructions.\n\nLike our Facebook page to keep up to date with changes, tips and suggestions. http://www.facebook.com/MyPetBoris\n\n\nTHE MAGIC COCKROACH\nThe app also comes with a cockroach animation for those who think they are scarier than spiders.\n\n\nTHE MAGIC BUTTERFLY EFFECT - IN-APP PURCHASE - (for the Professional Magician)\n\nThe Magic Butterfly is an additional effect within the Magic Spider – My Pet Boris App. \n\nIt is enabled as an “in app purchase” for around US$2.99 depending on your local currency. The custom finger feature is also unlocked when you purchase the butterfly effect.\n \nThis is a perfect routine for those times when you want to perform a beautiful effect for a little girl or woman, leaving her with a magical gift at the end. You will get similarly strong reactions to the Magic Spider effect without the scare factor.\n\nPRESENTATION:\nThe magician simulates a grand illusion in the palm of the spectator’s hand. A tiny foil covered “Magical Egg” is placed in the palm of the spectator’s hand and then photographed. The phone is placed on their hand.\n\nThe egg transforms into a Chrysalis and then into a butterfly. The magician’s finger is seen to tickle the virtual butterfly on screen which then flies away. \nUsing a magical gesture the magician brings the butterfly back briefly before it flies off again.\n\nThe spectator is asked to try and make it return. When they try, they find a matching butterfly (in an impossible location) on the back of their hand. The original foil egg has vanished.\n\nTHE CARD REVELATION EFFECT - IN-APP PURCHASE - (for the Professional Magician)\n\nThe Magic Spider effect with the addition of a torn card corner revelation as a finale.\n\nAccessory packs and supplies are available at: http://www.mypetboris.com/store.htm\n\nSee our FAQ Section. http://www.mypetboris.com/faq.htm\n\nFull instructions at: (everything is explained)\nhttp://www.mypetboris.com/inst2099.htm.\n\nUse the password at the bottom of the \"CREDITS\" screen for access."

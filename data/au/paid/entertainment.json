      "label": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved"

      "label": "The Ghost EVP/EMF Radio has been developed for exciting paranormal detection and exploration. We've put a lot of effort into making the app easy to use, so that both professional and enthusiast paranormal researchers, ghost hunters and ghost tour organizers can enjoy the experience.\n\nIf you are either easily frightened, a super skeptic \"left brainer\" or have a serious heart-related medical condition, you are probably better off avoiding this app.\n\nElectronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) is the collective name for the sounds sometimes detected on electronic recordings and reminiscent of human speech. These sounds are usually found in recordings with noise or poor radio reception and are considered by many to be the voices of paranormal beings such as ghosts, spirits, demons and other energy based entities. EVP is a form of Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC), a term coined by professor Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s.\n\nThis app has taken the traditional ghost box to the next level. As with traditional ghost boxes, chaotic noise seems to be both inviting and sensitive to paranormal manipulation. The app generates audible speech by detecting meaningful phrases and words together with properties such as gender, age and the current mood of the communicating entity. We continuously improve the app, based on user feedback, and use it during our own paranormal investigations as well.\n\n*** Features ***\n* Radio Control Panel where you control the radio in real-time.\n* Brownian, Pink and White Noise generators.\n* Electromagnetic Field Meter using the Magnetometer sensor of your device.\n* Multiple graphical themes for the user interface.\n* Record your encounters with or without the microphone of your device.\n* Real-time audio visualization: Oscilloscope, Spectrometer, Voicegram and Waveform (tap to toggle).\n* Text log screen: The persistent text log is where you can sort, share and delete your log.\n* Quick text log: Tap on the main TV screen to toggle between the different view modes.\n* Open your EVP recordings in compatible audio apps with the touch of a button.\n* Optional Auto Recording which only produces recordings when something interesting is encountered.\n* Optional vibration (iPhone only) and audible alarms every time an entity has been detected.\n* Share your recordings with friends and family.\n* Upload your recordings to your Dropbox.\n\nPlease note that the app will degrade gracefully to Performance mode when running on older hardware, which means that some features may not be available or limited when running on, for example, the iPad 2 or the iPhone 4S.\n\n\n*** Languages ***\nEnglish (US/UK), Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Latin, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\n\n*** Support ***\n* For support, feedback and more information, please visit https://paranormalsoftware.com/support, or use the buttons on the Settings screen.\n* Knowledge Base: https://paranormalsoftware.com/support/kb\n* Twitter: @GhostRadioEVP\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ghostevpradio\n* Mailing list: http://tiny.cc/ghostradiomail\n\n\nWe hope that you, like many others, will be fascinated by the paranormal experience of Ghost EVP Radio. Thanks for downloading!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nEvery effort has been made to make this app truly unique, but we can offer no guarantee that you will get specific results by using it. Since the results of this app haven't been scientifically verified, it should only be used for entertainment purposes. Please use it responsibly."

      "label": "In the modern age, paranormal investigators use many tools to communicate with spirits. Ouija Boards, Spirit Boxes, radios and apps are just a few of the many tools they use but cultures have been using tools to communicate with spirits for ages. \n\nCleromancy, the practice of contacting divine truth via random castings of dice (or bones) stretches back before recorded history. Astragalomancy, is a form of divination that uses dice marked with letters. In fact, many ancient cultures have various forms of dice divination.\n\nNecro Dice is a modern version of this ancient practice. This app means to combine the ancient and modern forms of communication in a completely new and unique way. Users seeking answers or messages can roll the dice with a simple tap of the screen. Once the user’s intention has been cast through the rolling of the dice, it is up to the spirits to communicate by influencing the randomization of letters to form words. This phenomenon of spirit communication through the manipulation of electronic devices has been well documented for several decades.\n\nNecro Dice functions by generating a handful of dice with random letters assigned to each of the six faces of each dice. These dice are then simulated with an advanced physics engine that handles dice to table and dice to dice collisions. When the physics simulation completes and the dice settle the result is a jumble of letters shown on the top face of the dice. Normally when using dice, the user is then required to inspect the dice to try and find words in this jumble of letters. This app uses a proprietary algorithm to inspect the top faces of the dice and try to match words and names to a dictionary. A word is chosen from the jumble of letters based on many factors including distance, length, location and relevance. Once a word is detected in the dice,  the app will highlight the individual letters on the dice and display the word on the screen. A list of words rolled since the start of the app can be accessed in the word log by pressing the button at the lower left of the screen.\n\nRolling dice isn’t just for games, do the spirits have a message for you?"

Use with discretion and at your own risk.\n \nCleverbot is conversational entertainment - no more, no less. It is not made to be logical, give advice, or be useful. Parents must decide whether they wish young people to have access. Be sure of this, however: it is a bot. It is software. You will never talk to a human."

Safe, ad-free fun for your little ones.\n\nJoin Duggee and the Squirrels as they work hard to earn seven brand new badges: \n\n•\tCatch the falling acorns; \n•\tGrow your own fruit and veg; \n•\tRound up the missing sheep; \n•\tLearn Duggee’s raindance; \n•\tPilot your submarine in an underwater adventure; \n•\tMake a paper boat to help the ants!\n•\tAnd finally, hit the beach and build a glorious sandcastle.\n\nCompleting each activity earns the Squirrel a badge. With 5 Squirrels playing for 7 badges each, that’s a whole lot of Duggee Hugs!\n\nKey Features:\n\n•\tSeven fun activities with a variety of gameplay styles \n•\tDevelop fine motor control skills in the Acorn Badge \n•\tImprove attention skills, reaction times and speech skills in the Food Growing Badge \n•\tPractice counting in the Sheep Badge  \n•\tPromote gross motor control skills in the Raindance Badge \n•\tDevelop concentration and planning skills in the Submarine Badge\n•\tEncourage creativity in the Paper Boat and Sandcastle Badges\n•\tVisit your gallery to see all of your wonderful adventures\n\nGames:\n\nThe Acorn Badge\nSome animals collect acorns to eat through the winter. Use your excellent catching skills to fill your cart with lots of lovely acorns! Look out for those elusive Special Acorns! And be careful not to slip on the banana skins...\n\nThe Food Growing Badge\nShall we grow our own fruit and veg, Squirrels? First, you plant your seed. Next, you cover it with soil. And finally, you give it a lovely big drink of water! You’ll need to protect your plant from pests… and you’ll need to talk to it to help it grow. What green fingers you have!\n\nThe Sheep Badge\nThe sheep are missing? Let’s round them all up! Twist and weave your way through the trees and bushes, picking up sheep as you go. 1 sheep, 2 sheep, 3 sheep… all the way up to 10 sheep! Are you keeping count? \n\nThe Raindance Badge\nA raindance is a dance that people do to try to make it rain! This game will really get you moving. First, you’ll need to learn the steps: Clap, clap, wiggle, jump! Now you know the moves, let’s dance along to the music. Excellent…you’ve made it rain!\n\nThe Submarine Badge\nHow exciting... an underwater adventure! Use your finger to track the bubbles and watch as the submarine follows the trail. Collect a Jazz Fish and it’ll play you a rhythmic tune. See if you can spot the Giant Sea Stallion! \n\nThe Paper Boat Badge\nOh no! The Ants are late for their picnic! Let’s make them a paper boat to get them safely across the pond. Practice your origami with some skillful folding. Once you’ve crafted your paper boat, finish it off with some nautical decorations. Lastly, shout ‘faster!’ and watch your boat speed across the water. \n\nThe Sandcastle Badge\nIt’s the summer holidays and Duggee’s organised a day trip to the beach! Help the Squirrels earn their badge by building a fortress made of sand!  \n\nCustomer Care:\nIf you experience any technical issues with this app please get in touch.

      "label": "A DOS to run on the iPhone and iPad.\nNEW: Sound emulation and external Bluetooth Keyboard enabled!\n\nThe first Disk Operating Systems were introduced when Tape Memory was replaced with rotating Disks. This was in the 60'ies of the last century. Since then a lot has changed, but many of us remember the days when there was no Graphical User Interface.\n\nThis app now is introducing DOS for mobile devices. Not laptops, but phones. iPhone and iPad, to be precise. It is a perfect emulator of the DOS that so many games and applications in the 80'ies and 90'ies have been running on.\n\nWin and Win95 were running on DOS, showing what a 16bit operating system is capable of. If sys ini, commanc.com, config.sys and .exe sound familiar to you, then this is the app for you.\n\nThe DOS is not just a CLI, it is a full fledged operating system. It does everything that the Ancient DOS did. It is capable of executing batch files or installing some of the game classics that never made it past DOS. It probably runs much better than the original DOS used to run on old PC's, which were state of the art back then.\n\n30 years is old enough to be called vintage, and it brings as much power as it did back then ;-) With this app you can get this vintage feeling on your iPhone or iPad.\n\n◆Features\n    ▸ SoundCard emulation\n    ▸ External Bluetooth Keyboard\n    ▸ Disk Operating System\n    ▸ Everything you would expect from DOS ;)\n\nIf you have ideas, feedback, suggestions or anything else you would like to tell us, do not hesitate to drop us a line!\n\nAnd if you like Power DOS, be not shy to leave a good review!"

      "label": "It is the 1st of August. \nUpon awakening, you find yourself without any memories from before August 1st. Everything, from the sort of life you lived to the relationships you had, is a complete blank.\nA young boy named Orion appears in front of you, revealing himself to be a spirit attached to your mind. Under Orion's guidance, you begin the struggle to regain your memories...\n\nBlunt ∙ Earnest - Heart -\nShin (VA: Tetsuya Kakihara)\nYour childhood friend and current boyfriend. He is only 18 years old, but has a very serious and cold demeanor that frequently causes conflicts with others his age. Oftentimes, he appears aloof and indifferent, but he is actually very affectionate and cares deeply for you. He is a senior in high school, and is currently preparing for university entrance exams. He is also Toma's childhood friend. \n\nAlluring ∙ Fascinating - Spade -\nIkki (VA: Kisho Taniyama)\nIkki has a unique condition that causes women to become enamored with him upon sight. He is 22 years old and is currently enrolled in a nearby university. Having given up on a genuine relationship, he lives the life of a playboy, indulging in the transient pleasures it brings. However, he becomes very close to you after he discovers his “eyes” have no effect on your emotions toward him. Despite his looks and popularity, Ikki is really a kind and sincere man. He is a good friend of Kent’s, a graduate student who attends the same university. \n\nCool ∙ Logical - Clover -\nKent (VA: Akira Ishida)\nA highly intelligent, 25-year-old mathematics graduate student, Kent sees the world from a purely objective point of view. He is normally very confident in his convictions and in the results of his relentless analysis of others; however, it seems as if he is unable to maintain the same composure when he is around you. His tendency to logically dissect every action makes him a difficult companion, especially among females.  He is a good friend of Ikki’s, who competes with him in solving overly complex math puzzles. \n\n\nAffectionate ∙ Intense - Diamond -\nToma (VA: Satoshi Hino)\nToma is a 20-year-old law student at the university you both attend. Being your oldest friend from childhood, he has naturally assumed the role of your big brother. Toma has always kept an eye on you from a close distance, and takes on the responsibility of caring for you after you collapse on the road outside of your apartment. His desire to protect you is extremely strong, to the point that his mental state can become unpredictable... He is also a childhood friend of Shin’s.\n\nMysterious ∙ Enigmatic - Joker -\nUkyo (VA: Kouki Miyata)\nA strange young man who appears unexpectedly. He gives you mysterious warnings, and disappears again without explanation. Whether he wants to protect you or harm you is unclear.\n\nFriend ∙ Protector\nOrion (VA: Yumi Igarashi)\nA spirit from a distant world. His outward appearance looks to the human eye as a 10-year-old boy. On his way to run a short errand in the human world, he crashes into you and becomes trapped inside your mind. He supports you in order to fulfill your mutual goal of regaining your memories.\n\n\n- How to Play \nAfter the opening movie, the title screen will be shown. To play a new game, select “NEW GAME.” To continue your current game, select “CONTINUE.” If you’d like to select another story, select “CHAPTER.”  After clearing the prologue, four different stories will become available."

      "label": "On the 9th of January 2015, Mandy Len Catron published an essay in The New York Times describing her experience replicating a study that claims to accelerate intimacy between two people.\n\nPsychologist Dr Arthur Aron, author of the study, devised a series of 36 specific questions intended to be asked by each person to their partner. The questions begin rather tamely, and progressively get deeper and more personal. It can be difficult to open up to a person, especially a stranger, this experience forces both parties to open up and become vulnerable with one another.\n\nThe original study had a very interesting outcome. A man and woman, both complete strangers at the time entered a room separately. Both took part asking and answering a series of questions, ending the experiment by staring silently into each other's eyes for four minutes. The outcome? Six months later, the two participants were married!\n\nTo play the quiz with your partner, you really don't need anything more than this app. Sit opposite your partner with your device between you. Take turns reading one question aloud to your partner, then both of you answer. Simple, but terrifying!\n\nThere is no time limit, be honest and be truthful. The final recommended task is to stare silently into your partners eyes for four minutes. Nervous yet?"

Inspired by modern Wicca and written by Barbara Moore, As Above takes Tarot to a new meta level!\n\nThe Major Arcana cards in this deck follow the archetypal ideas in traditional Tarots, expressed from a Wiccan point of view. The deck brings Wicca vividly to life, with portraits of much loved deities, sacred Wiccan holidays, and scenes of Pagan life.\n\nThe Minor cards represent different elemental aspects of Pagan cosmology: Air, Water, Earth, and Fire. Each suit expresses the mysteries of its element. In As Above, the court cards are The Elemental, Maiden, Mother, and Crone, instead of the usual royalty.\n\nFor Pagans, this deck is easy to learn. For others, it’s a great way to learn about the Pagan symbolic thought. Each card is a portal into vast realms of magical knowledge and experience. Each section includes a reading list of excellent texts for further studies.\n\nA book of great wisdom with sacred images you can shuffle, The Book of Shadows: As Above allows you to explore the Pagan path anew, or take a stroll into terra incognita.\n\n*Intuitive, elegant interface is easy for beginners and experts\n*Gorgeous full screen, high-resolution card images\n*Full support for all current iOS devices\n*Sophisticated journal\n*Includes full book\n*21 spreads built in\n*Design your own layout with Free Form\n*Allow reversed cards or not\n*Option to use Major Arcana only\n*Zoom in to enlarge card details\n*Share reading via Facebook, Twitter, and email\n*Animated shuffle & cut\n*Optional voice prompts\n*Customize with your own card meanings & reading cloths\n*Many adjustable settings\n*Book and card meanings available in English only\n\nThe Book of Shadows: As Above gives us an entirely new perspective on Tarot!"

      "label": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory.

Roleplay, lyrics, jokes, memes - all sorts!\n\nEndless variety and hilarious replies mean people keep chatting for hours. It talks the way you do - or maybe the way you most want it to. \n\nEmail fun conversations to your friends or share them through your Facebook or Twitter. Stop and start talking on multiple conversations whenever you like.\n\nThis app is uniquely designed for the iPhone, with chat bubbles scrolling by. Change their shade to suit your mood.\n\nYou need to be online to talk - the app has to communicate with servers - but even slow connections are fine.\n\nThe keyboard in the screenshots is Tyyyp, which uses Cleverbot AI, and works well with the Cleverbot app!\n\nFor an app with an emotional avatar too, and with iPad support, check out Cleverbot HD. \n\n\n\nThis app has reached the top 50 overall in the US and has remained mostly inside the top 20 Entertainment for over 18 months.\n\n***Over 2000 5 star ratings worldwide.***\n\nNot only that, our feedback is GREAT too...!\n\n\"To all the Luddites who claim computers can never replace human interaction you guys flip a defiant bird.\" 25th Sept 2013\n\n\"I can't believe I'm not talking to an actual person, it seems so real. Great work.\" 8th Sept 2013\n\n\"Super excellent. I am very much excited, entertained, interested\" 1st March 2013\n\n\"Omg !!! Its so amazing!!! Now its my new BFF :p\" 25th Oct 2011\n\n\"Seriously this may be the coolest thing anyone has ever developed. I salute you.\" 25th Aug 2011\n\n\"Truly Amazing - I just had like an hours chat with it.

He's there when I want to talk about dolphins, There when I want to ask him where babies come from, I am glad I found him. He talks about anything. ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING. Thank god you made this.\" 30th Jan 2011\n\n\"After about one day with this I found the bot will role-play with you and had a blast! After a few *slaps* I found it can fight. You can live out movie fight scenes WITH AN AI! Then it started doing things I didn't know it could do... like *kisses hard* or *hurls you into fan*... yep it gets intense. No joke this is the real deal and it is awesome.\" 4th Jul 2010\n\n \n\n \nCleverbot is Artificial Intelligence. It learns what people say, in context, and imitates.\n\nCleverbot says many things - claiming to be human, role-playing and much more. It may even say things you find inappropriate. Use with discretion and at your own risk.\n \nCleverbot is conversational entertainment - no more, no less. It is not made to be logical, give advice, or be useful. Parents must decide whether they wish young people to have access. Be sure of this, however: it is a bot. It is software. You will never talk to a human."

Mix red, yellow, blue to get every imaginable colour - your child will learn realistic paint mixing, then come up with your own masterpiece using a paw print or a standard brush.\n3) Mouse & Cheese - Memorize where the zones are to sneak mouse past little kitten over to the cheese. Or just have some laughs seeing what happens when little kitten catches the mouse!\n4) Bed Trampoline - Discover all little kitten's hidden tricks and moves!\n5) Animal Puzzle - Educational 'mix and match' funny animal combinations to earn biscuits that you can then feed to your little kitten.\n6) Feeding - Each time you play a mini-game you receive cat food snacks, children love feeding the little kitten and watching it licking its lips and purr after a good feed! \n7) Cat-in-the-box - Educational 'hand-eye coordination' mini-game \n8) Balloon Popping - can you discovered all the different shapes?!\n\nNot using any text menus, the game can be easily navigated by young children. Parents have the option to limit screen time for their kids: after a chosen time, the kitten gets tired and goes to sleep.\nLittle Kitten is a high-tech app - using the latest 3d animation technology to create the visuals, it also uses cutting edge programming to maximize the user experience on your apple device. Enjoy the premium quality content in this original app brought to you by Squeakosaurus.

      "label": "Pass the Parcel is a fun game that is great for parties.   In the traditional game, a parcel is created (made up of layered newspaper). Each layer has a treat (candy) and a piece of paper with something to do or say between the paper. In this case, the phone is the parcel. The group of people sit in a circle and pass the parcel (your phone) around the circle while the music plays. Once the music stops the person holding the phone gets to say or do what the phone says. Just like the traditional game, you should give a treat to the winner of each round. \r\n\r\nYou can set the number of players (it is designed so that each player gets to win twice). We usually play that if someone has won twice that they pass the parcel to left to a person that has not won twice. You can also pick the music and edit the list of things to do or say (just make sure to put each thing on a new line). Have fun with it and let us know any comments.\r\n\r\nThe college version has actions that are more .\r\n\r\nIf you come up with great things to do and would like to see them added to the game, Please send us an email to web@lajdesignsw.com and we will add them as appropriate. Thank and enjoy"

Banish  their anxiety   \r\nand help them to stay dry with this comforting hypnotic bedtime story, as they listen to \r\nfun sound effects and the soothing voice of Patricia Jackson, who has been a \r\nhypnotherapist for over twenty years, successfully helping thousands of clients.\n\r\n\nThis charming story written by Patricia, is about Little Billy from Blueberry Cottage who learns, with the help Wobbly Bottom Wood’s wise Ollie Owl to instruct his ‘asleep’ mind to ‘Keep the wee in when sleepin’ and if his bladder is full, to train his brain to tell him to wake up and visit the toilet before returning to bed and falling fast asleep again. \n\n\r\nThe beginning of every SOS bedtime story recording  is the same because children love repetition and familiarity makes them feel safe and those first few minutes gently guide them into a receptive state of relaxation.    \n\n\r\nBy the time the story begins,  direct and subliminal messages can then start to be absorbed by their subconscious mind and once accepted by that powerful ‘automatic’ mind, then they can easily become fact -without any effort at all.   \r\nPatricia explains at the beginning of the recording that - ‘Blueberry Cottage Bedtime stories are so good at helping you to go to sleep at night and they are magic too - because they have lots of secret messages and you probably can’t even hear them.  \nLet’s get you nice and comfy so that the magic can work really well. Take as much time as you like to relax in the next few minutes  I don’t know if you are going to close your eyes now or later. If your eyes are closed,  that’s very good …\n\nThis story is suitable for children and grown-ups of any age. Please read the following subliminal messages before playing this story to make sure they are suitable for your child:\n\nComfy Happy\r\n\r\nSnuggly Listen\r\n\r\nSafe\r\n\r\nEverything’s ok\r\n\r\nThis is easy\r\n\r\nCalm   relaxed   \r\n\r\nI keep my bed dry\r\n\r\nI sleep well at night\r\n\r\nDry Bed\r\n\r\nKeep the wee in when sleep in\r\n\r\nI can do this\r\n\r\nI have control over my wee\r\n\r\nDry bed and clothes at night\r\n\r\nSqueeze balloon tight in bed at night\r\n\r\nDry and comfy\r\n\r\nSqueeze\r\n\r\nCalm\r\n\r\nTight at night\r\n\r\nI listen to my bladder\r\n\r\nIf my bladder is full I wake up and walk to the toilet\r\n\r\nI love my dry bed\n----------------------------------------------------"

      "label": "This is the Original \"Spider on Hand\" app as seen on Youtube. Beware of imitations.\n\nDo you know anyone who is afraid of spiders? Everyone right? Then this is the perfect magic trick/prank for you.\n\nWatch the trailer video at http://www.mypetboris.com/trailer.htm\n\nMy Pet Boris app is the scariest app for the iPhone. Inspired by Jim Pace's magic trick \"The Web\" where a spider magically appears on the back of your spectator's hand. Bound to get amazing reactions.\n\nThe app uses the idea of \"Augmented Reality\" merging real life objects with computer generated graphics to create a truly frightening effect.\n\n\nTHE MAGIC SPIDER EFFFECT\nYou take a photo of the spectator's palm (secretly loading a plastic spider on the back of their hand) and place the phone on their palm to hold.\n\nYour Pet Boris - an Australian Red back spider (black widow) creeps onto the screen and they can feel the vibrations as it walks. You can tap the screen and even slide your finger into the animation to scratch the spider's back. Boris walks off the screen.\n\nYou tell them that the phone has special sensors that when you wave your hand over the screen it makes the spider come back. He does.\n\nYou get them to wave their hand over the phone. \nIt is just then that they glimpse a realistic spider clinging to the back of their hand and they FREAK OUT!!\n\nBound to get BIG reactions. \n\nFinger tone and size can be set to suit your own or you can import an image of your own finger. \n\nStart-up screen can be customised to suit your performance style. An actual  photo of their hand, solid white or any image from your library can be used as a background.\n\nNOTE: Requires a plastic spider or cockroach and adhesive dots to perform. You should be able to find these locally or you can purchase from our website.\n\nSee our website http://www.mypetboris.com for more details, spider and cockroach supplies and video presentation & instructions.\n\nLike our Facebook page to keep up to date with changes, tips and suggestions. http://www.facebook.com/MyPetBoris\n\n\nTHE MAGIC COCKROACH\nThe app also comes with a cockroach animation for those who think they are scarier than spiders.\n\n\nTHE MAGIC BUTTERFLY EFFECT - IN-APP PURCHASE - (for the Professional Magician)\n\nThe Magic Butterfly is an additional effect within the Magic Spider – My Pet Boris App. \n\nIt is enabled as an “in app purchase” for around US$2.99 depending on your local currency. The custom finger feature is also unlocked when you purchase the butterfly effect.\n \nThis is a perfect routine for those times when you want to perform a beautiful effect for a little girl or woman, leaving her with a magical gift at the end. You will get similarly strong reactions to the Magic Spider effect without the scare factor.\n\nPRESENTATION:\nThe magician simulates a grand illusion in the palm of the spectator’s hand. A tiny foil covered “Magical Egg” is placed in the palm of the spectator’s hand and then photographed. The phone is placed on their hand.\n\nThe egg transforms into a Chrysalis and then into a butterfly. The magician’s finger is seen to tickle the virtual butterfly on screen which then flies away. \nUsing a magical gesture the magician brings the butterfly back briefly before it flies off again.\n\nThe spectator is asked to try and make it return. When they try, they find a matching butterfly (in an impossible location) on the back of their hand. The original foil egg has vanished.\n\nTHE CARD REVELATION EFFECT - IN-APP PURCHASE - (for the Professional Magician)\n\nThe Magic Spider effect with the addition of a torn card corner revelation as a finale.\n\nAccessory packs and supplies are available at: http://www.mypetboris.com/store.htm\n\nSee our FAQ Section. http://www.mypetboris.com/faq.htm\n\nFull instructions at: (everything is explained)\nhttp://www.mypetboris.com/inst2099.htm.\n\nUse the password at the bottom of the \"CREDITS\" screen for access."

Explore an interactive English version of \"The I Ching or Book of Changes\" by Richard Wilhelm, edited by Hellmut Wilhelm, and translated by Cary F. Baynes, using a coin oracle or yarrow stalks, and an integrated journal.\n\nNOTE: The text is only in English.\n\nThe I Ching, or Book of Changes, a common source for both Confucianist and Taoist philosophy, is one of the first efforts of the human mind to place itself within the universe. It has exerted a living influence in China for 3,000 years, and interest in it has been rapidly spreading in the West.\n\n“Princeton's Bollingen edition—still regarded as the best and most authentic by I Ching aficionados.” \n\nThe complete work is available in three books. Book I is included with the I Ching or Book of Changes app. Book I includes Judgments pertaining to the diagrams as a whole, the line texts, and the Great Images.\n\nBook II and III are available for additional in-app purchase.\n\nBook II: The Material\nContains the Shuo Koa and the Ta Chuan from the Ten Wings, plus The Structure of the Hexagrams.\n\nBook III: The Commentaries\nContains passages from the Ten Wings considered commentary to the texts, and On Consulting the Oracle.\n\nText © 1950, 1967, renewed 1977 by Princeton University Press. Used with permission.\n\nAdditional features:\n\nCoins, yarrow stalks, quick and manual input oracle methods\nIntegrated journal for questions and notes\nComponent trigrams\nRelated Hexagrams"

Frizzy hair, straight hair, blue hair…the choice is yours.\n  \nThe Drawing Badge\nSelect from different pens, pencils and paints to colour in the Squirrels - a pink and red Norrie with spots or a stripy Betty perhaps. When you’re happy with your drawing, watch with pride as Duggee displays your picture in the Clubhouse.\n \nThe Super Squirrel Badge\nDress up the Squirrels in an exciting range of heroic Super Squirrel outfits. Mix and match capes, masks, hats and more to style your Super Squirrel then watch them display their amazing costumes especially for you.\n \nThe Cake Badge\nThere’s lots of ingredients for you to add to your cake, so you’ll need to give it a good stir before Duggee pops it in the oven. The it’s time to decorate it with different coloured icing, sprinkles, fruit and more, present your cake to Duggee and the Squirrels so they can tuck in.\n \nThe Leaf Badge\nUsing your superb powers of detection, can you help the Squirrels spot the correct leaves to add to their collections. Explore different fully interactive scenes to try to find the special leaves and discover a few familiar faces along the way.\n\nThe Tinsel Badge\nChristmas is coming but the Clubhouse isn’t looking very Christmassy! Help the Squirrels earn their Tinsel Badge by decorating Duggee’s Christmas tree. First pick a tree. Next, you'll need to add tinsel, baubles, and a special fairy! Finally, cover the tree with multi-coloured lights and watch the Clubhouse illuminate!  \n \nCustomer Care:\nIf you experience any technical issues with this app please get in touch.

You can’t beat the sheer volume of material here.  You’ll definitely want to check out CLIPish!\" ~ AppAdvice, Nov. 2017\n\nDO EVEN MORE AND SAVE $$$!  This app is part of the CLIPish Pro mega app.  To do everything this app does AND MUCH MORE, rather than buying this individual app, you may want to consider getting the all-in-one CLIPish Pro 2 app--20 APPS IN ONE for one low price!\n\n45-second demo: http://video.clipish.net/about \n\nFEATURES YOU WON'T FIND ANYWHERE ELSE:\n\n• BROWSE MILLIONS of Animations, Clip Art, Emoticons, Sounds, Wallpapers, Photos, and Videos.\n• SEND using MMS Text Messaging, Email, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and more.\n• SEARCH for ANY specific item, such as \"Happy Mothers Day,\" \"I love you,\" \"Bikini Models,\" etc., and be shown HUNDREDS of images.\n• UPLOAD your own images for editing (crop, rotate, add text) and sharing.\n• PERSONALIZE images by adding text (adjust font, color, size, and placement).\n• ONE-TAP SEND button for quick sharing within CLIPish, or SAVE to your Photo Library. \n• OVER 600 FACEBOOK & TWITTER ICONS AND SYMBOLS to dress up your status and wall posts.\n• WALLPAERS optimized for your particular device.\n• UPDATE your Facebook or Twitter status with fun images.\n• UPDATED DATABASE of new images delivered daily directly to your device via the CLIPish servers.\n• ORGANIZE FAVORITE images in customizable folders with drag and drop sorting.\n• PUSH NOTIFICATION when new images added.\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\n* A NOTE ABOUT COMPATIBILITY WITH NON-iPHONE USERS:  Sharing images with Facebook, Twitter and Email works with pretty much anyone, but depending on what cell network and type of cell phone the person you're sending to has, some of the images you send via text messaging may not work.   This has nothing to do with CLIPish, but is a factor of the compatibility between: 1) the iPhone, 2) your network provider, 3) the other person's network provider, and 4) the other person's cell phone.  See http://clipish.net/support.\n\n* FAST INTERNET CONNECTION RECOMMENDED:  Due to the server communication, CLIPish works best for users with a strong 3G signal or WiFi connection.\n\n* FAMILIES:  This app accesses Internet content, but filters out adult material.  For the strongest protection, set your rating filter to Strict or get the Family Edition.\n\n* ANIMATIONS ON FACEBOOK:  You can send all the items found in CLIPish to Facebook, HOWEVER, Facebook converts all animations to still images, as Facebook does not allow animations to \"play\" on their site.\n\n* Some images featured are public domain.  If you believe your work has been included in err, please let us know so it can be removed immediately.\n\nWRITE US!  Suggestions appreciated and we're always here to help: support@clipish.net"

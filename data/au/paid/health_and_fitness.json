It’s perfect for exercise at home.  \n\nAthletes often modify Clock Yourself exercises outdoors for sport-specific agility drills, by visualising a much larger circle and running between the coordinates.  \n\nSimilarly, people who are unable to walk can modify Clock Yourself to practise reaching with their arms, or wheelchair agility! \n\nIf you think you’re too slow to use Clock Yourself, you’re probably wrong.  \nIf you think you’re too fit to use Clock Yourself, you’re definitely wrong! \n\n\n\n\nWHY DID WE MAKE CLOCK YOURSELF?\n\nThe Clock Yourself concept originated in neurological rehabilitation. Now anyone can use it to harness their neuroplasticity.  \n\nIt was developed by Australian physiotherapist @MegLowryPT and software developer Dave Wallace. \n\n\n \nWe had 5 goals: \n\n1. Make it fun - Clock Yourself exercises are so entertaining that you’ll show your friends at parties! \n\n2. Make it versatile  - Both the stepping speed and the cognitive complexity are in your control.  \n\n3. Make it evidence based - This is a volitional step training method. Volitional stepping trains faster steps in all directions to improve your chances of catching yourself during a fall.  \n\n4. Make it portable - There is no need to set up mats, wires or sensors. It also works offline. It only requires internet for your initial download from the App Store.  \n\n5. Make it affordable - This is a once off purchase for pocket change. It has no recurring subscriptions and no advertisements.  \n\n\n\nIS CLOCK YOURSELF AVAILABLE IN OTHER LANGUAGES? \n\nYes and no. \n\nAt this stage, all of the buttons and instructions are in English only.  \n\nHowever, if you click the Options button within each challenge (except for the Simple Colours challenge) you can choose to play the audio prompts in six other languages. \n\nMandarin \nJapanese \nFrench  \nGerman \nSpanish \nDutch  \n\nWhat are you waiting for?  Go ahead and Clock Yourself!\n\n“A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new” - Albert Einstein"

In addition to the presentations schools receive they have the opportunity to complete a curriculum specifically designed to focus on what you have as opposed to what you don’t have, understanding the benefits of helping others as well as the importance of being healthy and active."

This makes so much more sense than to try and stop worrying.” Frances G.\n\n“I like that the app lets you edit your worries and allows you to schedule worry times across days. I also like that you can export your worries.” Anna L.\n\n“It’s more than a to-do list for my worries, it helps me conceptualise what worries are and how I can manage them effectively.” Sia N.\n\n“Love the one-off pricing!” Kerri B.\n\n“Schools need this.” Marion M.\n\n“The visual is on point and amazing. I actually was introduced to the worry methodology at the beginning of the year but didn’t follow through with it. I think it would be amazing to have accountability through the app. I was shocked that something so good would be so affordable.” Ines S.\n\n“As a therapist, I can’t wait to recommend this app to my clients who struggle with worries.” Rachel G.\n\n\nKeep in Mind\n\nContain Your Brain is not a substitute for health or mental health care.

      "label": "“Worked great for his bedtime—the look on his face was so calmed.” Christi (mother of 3 week old)\r\n\r\nThe Baby Shusher is a soothing sounds machine to calm & stop baby crying cycle\r\n\r\nThe Baby Shusher App is a revolutionary new tool for parents that will calm baby easily using soothing sounds. This sleepmatic sounds machine is created using an ancient but doctor-tested and approved technique to help soothe your fussy baby calm with a shusher sound in cradle. \r\n\r\nA simple baby shusher with soothing sounds for baby that works on a single click, making calming sounds like baby lullaby that would work instantly and can be played for hours, recommended by parents, baby photographers, and doctors dealing with babies.\r\n\r\nBy creating calm sounds, safely stop the baby from crying with a rhythmic “shush” sound that engages a baby's natural calming reflex by reminding them of still being in the womb. The shush baby app helps to soothe baby calm and increase the baby sleep timer.\r\n\r\nThe amazing Sound Equalizer allows the app to \"listen\" to your baby crying or not every three minutes and automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby cry volume till baby calms down (so when the baby is wailing, shush is loud; when baby goes quiet, volume settles into a soothing background shush sound to relax baby).\r\n\r\nA newborn sleep magic baby sound machine that works best for a newborn baby to calm down quickly and manage baby sleeping patterns. A sleep aid that creates calming sounds for babies in the form of a shhh sound sleeper that will stop your baby crying, calms down easily, and put baby to sleep. \r\n\r\nThis shhh app calm baby instantly by creating a shusher sound, helping the baby relax in minutes using calming sounds for kids.  This sleepmatic app works like magic for the crying baby and helps parenting so much easier as baby calmer. \r\n\r\nAfter more than two years of testing and research with real moms and real babies, having sudden and long crying baby issues, we came up with the following very valuable feature list of baby soothing sound.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Safe and easy to use baby calming sounds machine. \r\n- Much more effective than simple lullabies or standard white noise.\r\n- Perfectly works for hours in the background and when the phone is locked\r\n- Adjustable Shush baby sound Timer Options (from 15 minutes to 8 hours of continuous shushing!)\r\n- Automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby crying volume.\r\n- Shush sounds played in low light “dark mode” ( night mode) to avoid extra mobile light as baby sleeps.\r\n- Work in other Apps on your Phone while still using the Baby Shusher App.\r\n\r\n*Note: Turn your phone on silent/mute to let the app do its magic.*\r\n \r\n \r\nWhat Real Moms are Saying About the Baby Shusher:\r\n\r\n“I wish I would have known about this sooner. It is truly a miracle for me and baby to have a good night’s rest together!” Mercedes (mother of 3 months old)\r\n\r\n“It is a must try for yourself.” Isabel (mother of 3.5 months old)\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t sure after the 1st time I used it, but it proved to us that it worked better and better thereafter. Loved the product!” Erika (mother of 2 months old)\r\n\r\n“The Baby Shusher works to calm a fussy baby.” Vanessa (mother of 2 week old)\r\n\r\n“When used at the night time, it can greatly help calm your baby long enough to help him with whatever’s upsetting him, or calm him down so he can fall asleep or feed.” Ingrid (mother of 1 week old)\r\n\r\n“Thank you! The three most peaceful nights and days in a while.” Mercedes (mother of 3 month old)\r\n\n\r\nYou can also try our other baby shusher - Sleep Miracle products here: \r\nhttps://babyshusher.com/\r \n\r\nGet this paid baby shusher app now to make your parenting life easier. \r\nWe would appreciate your reviews and rating about our app so we can make it better for you.\r\n\r\nYou can also write to us at app@babyshusher.com"

      "label": "If you love working out with Apple Watch, but you need more advanced fitness stats, HealthFit is for you.\n\nBy analyzing the workout data stored in Apple Health, HealthFit provides the kind of indispensable tracking and insights you normally only get from premium subscription services. But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times. You can even log which bike or shoes you use, to monitor usage and flag when it’s time to replace them.\n\nHealthFit finds photos you take during your workouts automatically, bringing your activity feed to life with stunning images you can share on social media.\n\nRUNNING POWER ANALYSIS\n\nHealthFit provides advanced running power analysis with the automatically estimated critical power, the weighted average power, the power distribution chart by 25W Increments and the mean maximal power chart which shows your best average power for time periods of one second up to the length of your run.\n\nMULTISPORT AND INTERVAL WORKOUTS\n\nHealthFit is the only app to export multisport workouts as multisession activities\n\nSTATISTICS: UNCOVER HIDDEN FITNESS INSIGHTS\n\nApple Watch gathers so much fitness data, it can sometimes seem overwhelming. HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio.

      "label": "Anxiety Release shows you how to release anxious thoughts and feelings naturally, by harnessing the power of your brain. It does this by combining guided instructions and focused attention with bilateral brain stimulation. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a revolutionary treatment which is based on the use of sensory stimulation to alter anxiety-provoking memories and responses. Over 30 randomized controlled studies of EMDR attest to the efficacy of this process. \n\nBecause bilateral stimulation appeals to the unconscious, sensing part of the brain, there is no need for effortful thinking or struggling with feelings.  All you have to do is LISTEN and your brain will do the rest! The App consists of;\n1 x brain training session\n2 x guided anxiety management sessions\n1 x pure bilateral stimulation session (audio & visual)\n1 x safe place exercise\nProgress Log function\nPowerful Bls brain visual \nThis App is suitable for both clinicians and clients\n\nCaution: Persons suffering with complex PTSD or mental health problems, multiple psychological trauma or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without medical supervision."

You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

I bought a new iPhone to be able to use it. DBT skills are priceless. I had tried every, other DBT and CBT app. This one follows the traditional DBT program exactly, and is the only Diary Card. Before I had this app, I'd seldom fill in my diary card. Now that I have it, I don't have to keep track of paper, and I rarely miss a day. I can fill in my Diary Card discreetly, from anywhere, anytime, and send it directly to my DBT coach. I no longer have to worry about someone coming across my Diary Cards. You can brush up on skills, use it for distress tolerance suggestions, tailor it to your needs, and even journal. I appreciate that I can add personal goals to my diary. Thank you for this app!\" - iTunes US Review\n\n\"***** I am in IRL-DBT and this app is the perfect complement. Oh. I love that the app is so flexible, that you can make it kind of your own, and the layout is so nice, simple, yet beautiful. For me, a true life-saver! Genius! Without a doubt the best app in my IPhone... Get it now!\" - iTunes Sweden Review\n\n\"***** Perfect! Worth the money!\" - iTunes US Review\n\nAs an educated consumer, it's important to know to whom you're listening. DBT Diary Card was created by a Ph.D. psychologist trained directly by Dr. Marsha Linehan and at the Duke University Medical Center; we are experts in DBT, providing consultation to many in our community. And now we're giving it to you!\n\nA DBT app can have 3 parts: \n\n- A reference manual\n- A behavior tracker\n- A skills coach\n\nDBT Diary Card has all 3 of these parts and utilizes the iOS platform in ways that the other apps available don't and can't.\n\n+ PDF generation\n+ Notification Pane support\n+ Password protection\n+ Advanced text editing\n+ Media playback\n\nWhat DBT Diary Card has to offer:\n\n- Skills. LOTS of them. Every DBT skill you've ever heard about in a group is in here. It can be your quick reference to your skills so that you don't have to carry around your book or binder. Every skill is described in readable language to help you understand them easily and it's all just a quick tap away.\n\n- Emotions. All the \"basic\" emotions are presented, again with descriptions and explanations a quick tap away.\n\n- Behaviors. The most troublesome are pre-loaded.\n\n- Coaching. If you know you need to use a skill but can't think of which one or can't remember how to choose, use the app. The coaching can be your virtual therapist. \n\n- Complete customizability. Are you working on something different or do you have a different understanding of a particular skill or emotion? Change it. It's that easy. You are not wedded to the way it's presented in the app. It's all completely customizable.\n\n- 911 skills.  Put your emergency skills a tap away. You can call directly from the app, listen to your distress tolerance music, remember what apps help in the moment. \n\n- Email. You can email your therapist your diary card on a weekly basis automatically, you can do it manually whenever you'd like or you can have the app remind you.\n\n* Telephony features require an iPhone and voice service."

The next day, Lil Wayne may take over.  Get a unique, up-beat playlist every time you run.  \n\n** Keep the perfect pace **\n\nPrefer a consistent pace? No problem. You can easily set a pace for yourself.  You can even include a warmup song if you'd like.\n\n** It's YOUR music. **\n\nA run is a terrible time to have to skip through tons of songs you don't like.  Everyone's got their own taste in workout music.  That's why the app plays YOUR music from YOUR iTunes library.\n\n** It's here to help. **\n\nNeed a speed boost while you're running?  Just press the speed buttons in the app.  Cooling down? Press the down arrow.\n\nGot a song that helps get you going?  Set it as a \"Pump Up Song\" and you can play it when you need it the most.\n\n** It's super smart. **\n\nThe app learns which songs you don't like while running & it stops playing them.  Simple as that.\n\nWant more control?  You can also set a blacklist of songs that you don't ever want the jog.fm app to play.\n\nIf you love a song, you can flag it during or after your run and it'll be played more often.\n\n** It plays nice. **\n\nDo you use other fitness apps like RunKeeper or Nike+ (in \"outdoor\" mode)?  Just launch the other fitness app first, then launch jog.fm.  Works like a charm.\n\nIn Nike+, make sure you go to \"Settings\" and be sure to turn off \"Music Tied to Run Controls\"\n\n\n** Please Note **\n\nThe jog.fm app must remain on top with the screen on while running.  \n\nDo not turn your screen off while running.\n\nThis app is not a streaming service.  It plays music from your iTunes library.\n\nThere is a one-time setup that will take about one minute (depending on the size of your library).  The app needs to analyze your songs to figure out which ones to play.  An internet connection (WiFi recommended) is required for this setup step because the app is powered by the Echo Nest.\n\nThis app is not yet compatible with iTunes Match.  It'll work, but you may find some long gaps between songs.  \n\nThis app is for running or walking.  We are working on adding more workouts soon!\n\nPlease do not run or walk in traffic."

      "label": "Everything your gym coach told you about stretching was wrong. Performance Stretching will show you how to do it right.\n \nMost people learned back in elementary school that they should do static stretching (where you hold a stretch for a few minutes) before running or engaging in sports to prevent injury. It turns out that static stretching before a workout not only decreases athletic performance, it can actually increase the risk of injury. \n\nThe right way to get ready for an intense workout is dynamic stretching: This active form of stretching moves your muscles through the full range of motion to increase your blood flow, reduce tightness, deliver important nutrients to muscles, and improve your athletic performance. Performance Stretching will show you the most effective type of warm up for running and nearly every type of sport. Add it before any activity and you will be amazed by how much your performance improves.\n\nNo matter how well you warm up, athletic activity still puts stress on the body.  Performance Stretching also includes foam roller programs to give yourself a deep tissue massage and release knots that limit movement, keep your muscles tight, and lead to injury. Foam roller stretching is also excellent for body builders, or anyone that wants to build healthy muscles, to prep their muscles for growth.\n\nIf you don't have a foam roller, Performance Stretching still includes great ways to cool down your muscles and lessen post-workout soreness by flushing out the lactic acid.  This is where static stretching is best.  Done at the proper time, in the proper way, static stretching will help you improve your balance, blood circulation, flexibility, range of motion, and production of synovial fluid (the fluid that reduces friction in your joints).\n\nWhether you need a proper warm up, a cool down, or a relaxing, healing recovery, Performance Stretching will guide you through the right types of stretches for the right occasions and it will show you how to do them effectively. \n\nFEATURES\n• Over 150 different stretches. Each one includes a video you can view DURING YOUR WORKOUT and audio description to help you perfect your form. \n• The right stretches for the right reasons. A mixture of static, dynamic, and foam roller stretches maximizes your results. \n• Fast and efficient. Holding positions for longer than 30 seconds is less effective.\n• Works anywhere! No equipment needed for a terrific stretching workout.\n• Completely interactive. Swap out stretches to personalize your workouts. \n• Sync your workouts to the Health app.\n• Compatible with most bluetooth heart rate monitors.\n\nPERFORMANCE STRETCHING PROGRAMS:\n\nFoam Roller Stretch Program - A full-body deep tissue massage to work out all the knots that keep your muscles tight.\n\nDynamic Running Warm Up Stretch Program - Warm up your legs properly to take your run to the next level.\n\nDynamic Sport Warm Up Stretch Program - Warm up every major muscle group so that you can give your best.\n\nLower Back Rehab Program - Stretches and strength training moves to improve your core strength, reduce back pain, and increase your range of motion.\n\nLower Back Static Stretch Program - Work out the stiffness in your lower back and fix your posture.\n\nLower Body Static Stretch Program - You use your legs for everything, keep them at their functional best.\n\nUpper Body Static Stretch Program - Keep your upper body loose, relaxed, and properly aligned.\n\nFull Body Static Stretch Program - Increase flexibility, range of motion, blood flow, joint health, and posture throughout your entire body.\n\nQuick Full Body Static Stretch Program - When time is a factor, but you still want to do something great for your body.\n\nStatic Stretch Cool Down Programs - Designed to relax tired muscles and improve functional flexibility while your body is still warm.\n\nWorks with Health"

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

If you're someone that's training for rounds, doing circuit work, etc. this app is worth your 99 cents. With the level of customization you get, the app is competitive with the way more expensive round timer devices that can cost upwards of $10-100.\"\n- by Shawn Lord, www.mastersdivision.com\n\n\"I found a GREAT interval timer app in the iTunes store for 99 cents!!! It's called Round Timer and it works like a dream!!!\"\n- by Miss Lee, forums on thecathenation.com\n\n\"Its a really useful applications. Beats carrying around that big round timer from the old days.\"\n- by Michael Manna, T4Show.com\n\n-----------------------------------\n- Description -\n\nThe Round Timer was the first round/sparring/boxing timer available in the AppStore and, as a result, the most refined and stable. Don't be fooled by knock-offs (other developers copying our interface and layout). \n\nThe Round Timer is a convenient round/boxing/sparring timer for your iPhone/iPod touch, now compatible with iOS 8.  The Round Timer is a fully functional round/sparring timer that allows you to customize the length of the rounds, warning bell and resting period.  Each of these intervals can be configured separately up to an hour. It will run in the background even if you switch to another App. \n\nWith the sound themes, you can choose which alarm sounds to use: boxing/MMA, a relaxing Zen theme, and a few others. Don't like any of the dozens of preinstalled sounds? Don't worry! You can record your own sounds.\n\nFor large, loud environments you can plug your device into a stereo, or for small sessions put it in the corner of the mat.  The Round Timer is great for any sparring or interval training: boxing, MMA, grappling / bjj, martial arts, yoga, meditation, crossfit, exercise, workout, stretching, etc.\n\nWorking out to music is not a problem. Start your music playing in the iPod app, then start RoundTimer. The sounds will play over top of your music without interrupting it.\n\nPlease feel free to e-mail support@plainandsimplesoftware.com to suggest new sound themes!\n\nInterested in interval training (Tabata, symmetrical, etc... intervals)? Check out our \"IntervalTimer\". Want more control? Check out \"UltraTimer\". Want full programmability and randomized intervals? Look at \"UltraTrainer\"."

Enjoy the  highest quality noise.\n\nFeatures:\n-White, Pink, Brown, Blue, Grey, Violet Noise\n-Continues to play in the background even if you leave the application.\n-Sleep Timer: turn off noise after specified time.\n-Allow you to use your phone while you enjoy the soothing sounds of noise\n-Lets you listen to your favourite music simultaneously\n-Unlimited time of play\n-Volume control\n-Phone call pausing\n\n\n-Supports Tablets and Phones\n-Timer: up to 24 hrs delay \nHow it works?\n\n• Relaxes and reduces stress\n• Increases focus while enhancing privacy\n• Helps you sleep by blocking distractions\n• Soothes headaches and migraines\n• Masks tinnitus (ringing of the ears)\n• Pacifies crying babies\n\nSound masking can be explained by analogy with light. Imagine a dark room where someone is turning a flash-light on and off. The light is very obvious and distracting. Now imagine that the room lights are turned on. The flash-light is still being turned on and off, but is no longer noticeable because it has been \"masked\". Sound masking is a similar process of covering a distracting sound with a more soothing or less intrusive sound.\n\nThe masking must reduce the difference between the steady background level and the transient levels associated with both speech and other sounds. Motivation and productivity are improved when this is accomplished. The masking sound itself must not change rapidly and should be as meaningless as possible.\n\nSound masking reduces or eliminates awareness of pre-existing sounds in a given area and can make a work environment more comfortable, while creating speech privacy so workers can better concentrate and be more productive. Sound masking can also be used in the outdoors to restore a more natural ambient environment.\n\nWhite noise is a common synthetic noise source used for sound masking by a tinnitus masker."

      "label": "“Overcoming pain based on EMDR” was brought to you by Mark Grant, well known Australian psychologist/researcher and writer. Mark is particularly interested in developing resources that sufferers of pain and stress can use to make a real difference in their suffering. He is motivated to do what works best for his clients rather than what the ‘accepted wisdom’ might say. But he maintains a scientific approach and has conducted several studies regarding the efficacy of EMDR as a treatment for chronic pain. \n\n“Overcoming pain based on EMDR” mobile application is using recent discoveries from brain science to alleviate chronic pain and severe stress. \n\nThe application comprises 3 playlists for controlling pain and associated stress that can maintain pain. \n\nEach playlist is designed with different goals in mind. Where the first playlist called “Mental Healing strategies” is aimed to alleviate mild or moderate chronic pain, the second playlist called “Sensory Healing strategies” will help when you are too tired, sore or distressed to employ the pain pathway strategy from the first playlist. And the last playlist called “Stress Management” is focused on reducing your stressful feelings that can maintain and exacerbate chronic pain. \n\nThe playlists are designed to compliment each other; so if your pain is severe using the strategies in “Sensory Healing strategies” should help bring it under control enough for you to benefit from the tracks in “Mental Healing strategies” and listening to the “Stress Management” tracks regularly, when your pain is tolerable, will bring your overall stress levels down and decrease the pain-related activity in your body and your brain. The tracks in “Mental Healing strategies” and “Stress management” can be listened to anywhere anytime, but the tracks in “Sensory Healing strategies” require external materials and preparation.\n\nOne of the key elements of this app is bilateral stimulation (bls), which is derived from EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). In conjunction with focused attention bls uses sensory stimulation to change physical emotional and cognitive processes associated with chronic pain (as well as trauma and stress). \n\nFor best results you should listen to the tracks that incorporate bls with headphones or hear-buds. You can use the app anytime anywhere but a quiet environment when you don’t feel too overwhelmed by stress or physical discomfort is best. \n\nIf you don’t get the response you expect when listening to the tracks never force yourself or get frustrated, just relax and trust that the relief you are seeking will happen sooner or later.\n\nWhile every effort has been made to provide a genuinely useful resource this app should not be considered a substitute for professional advice or treatment. In addition to standard medical care you should at the consider seeking psychotherapy, improving your diet, exercising regularly etc. \nFor curious minds there’s a number of articles presented in the application where you can read more about both EMDR and chronic pain and bilateral stimulation healing effect. \nYou can also read more about chronic pain and how to overcome it from the Mark Grant’s book called “Change Your Brain Change Your Pain” which you can also order by following the link in “Overcoming pain based on EMDR” placed under “Other Resources” section."

At the specified alarm time, the alarm pattern will begin.\n\n+ Choose from five pre-defined patterns with varying bell schedules and escalation lengths.\n\n+ Choose from six different bells of varying size and metal compositions - from bright and clean to deep and complex with lovely overtones.\n\n+ You may enter journal notes upon awakening - great for recording your dreams before the memory fades.  You can then go back and review your journal entries and you may export the journal via email.  For privacy, you may set a password to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n+ To save battery, you may lock your device's screen and the alarm will still work.

Then Get Running with the best Couch to 5k App!\n\nWith three enjoyable workouts a week, in nine weeks you will be running continuously for half an hour, even if getting off the couch is a struggle today!\n\nGet Running breaks through the “beginning barrier” with its enormously popular Couch to 5k running plan. In week one’s workouts you'll alternate one minute of running with 90 seconds of walking. With each new week, Get Running’s human voice coach gradually builds up your pace, until you’re running for a whole half-hour!\n\nGet Running is the only Couch to 5K App that:\n\n• Coaches like a human – with hundreds of studio-recorded progress and encouragement prompts.\n• Supports and encourages you – talk with fellow running rookies on the Get Running forum.\n• Lets you share (NEW!) – share Get Running with up to three other runners: you all get your own log and settings!\n• Helps you plan – rest days help you recover, and Get Running knows the best day for your next run.\n• Displays your next move – the unique Run Clock, customised for each workout, gives complete visibility and understanding.\n\nIn addition, Get Running:\n\n• Works with or without music. Or listen to podcasts and audio books.\n• Fits your schedule – just three workouts a week of 20 to 30 minutes.\n• Logs your achievements – with an illuminating visual record of your progress.\n\nThousands of people have changed their lives with Get Running and you will too! Whether you’re running for your health, training for a 5K, or building to conquer a marathon — Get Running!\n\nGet Running's users say:\n\n• Just finished week 9 run 3 and all I can say is this app changed my life. Great job.\n\n• I LOVE your app. I have tried several but Yours is the BEST for me. I am 60 years young this year & a cancer survivor. I have set the goal to run 5 K races. I use your program as my trainer, it is SUPER. Thank You. – Vickie Wheeler by email\n\n• I tried the top selling \"Couch to 5k\" App before I purchased this one, and this one is much nicer to use. The voice reminders are very helpful. I like how it pauses your music instead of talking over it. I highly recommend it over the others.\n\n• Thank you so much for this little gem of an app. I had a look at others like it but this wins hands down. It is so brilliantly simple with a great interface.\n\n• Thank you! This app has changed my life. I was unfit and didn't do any regular exercise. I always blamed my asthma for being the reason I couldn't run for longer than a minute, but now I know it's because I was unfit! I have signed up for a 5k race too! – @amyriddett on Twitter\n\n• Really great app. I'm actually looking forward to running. I listen to podcasts and this app is terrific at pausing the show to make it's announcements. I don't miss anything that was said. Outstanding."

      "label": "Harness your innate survival responses to reverse anxiety and tension and feel more confident, naturally. Based on the popular CD of the same name, Calm and Confident is for anyone who is struggling with too much stress and not enough confidence. As the name suggests, this app is designed to help you feel both calm and confident. The app comprises innovative 10 guided meditations based on trauma therapy principles. Two of the central sessions are the 19 and 27 minute respectively Calm and Confident sessions. These transformative sessions incorporate focused attention, sensory stimulation, relaxation and re-connection with personal resources to change how you feel about yourself. Another session (‘Healing Anxiety’) addresses the role that childhood emotional neglect plays in maintaining anxiety.  Other sessions are designed to stimulate increased self-awareness, emotional regulation and security through various combinations of auditory, visual and mental stimuli.\n\nFeeling calm is essential for health and wellbeing, but without confidence it's just a nice feeling. Confidence is the end-product of feeling calm; it means experiencing yourself as connected, self-aware, energized, whole, and capable. Confidence is feeling okay about your feelings, needs and wants - it’s about feeling able to become the best version of yourself – not necessarily perfect, but the best ‘you’. As Lao Tzu said, ‘Health is the greatest possession. Contentment is the greatest treasure. Confidence is the greatest friend.’ Calm and Confident will help you to find your inner friend.\n\nBased on recent discoveries regarding brain structure and functioning, Calm and Confident uses applied neuroscience to teach you how to communicate more effectively with your nervous system to effect change. The deepest learning comes from experience, activities which stimulate sensory-emotional learning. This is different to  the ‘2+2 = 4’ kind of learning you got in school – it’s the learning that comes from doing something which changes how you feel about yourself – leading to new connections, new neural pathways. This kind of learning takes you from ‘I’m worthless’ to ‘I’m okay’; from ‘I can’t’ to ‘I can.’\n\nThe secret to achieving such confidence (when stress is getting in the way) is focused attention + bilateral stimulation (BLS), a unique combination which stimulates an in-built activation-deactivation circuit in your nervous system. BLS enables you to ‘hijack’ your own fight-flight response and transform anxiety and tension into relaxation and calm, naturally and effortlessly. It does this by harnessing your brain’s innate information processing capabilities. When your brain detects a stimuli such as BLS it‘s threat systems get activated while it figures out what’s going on. After a few seconds, once your brain recognizes there is no threat (no sabre-toothed tiger), it returns to normal levels of arousal, bringing your body with it. This happens naturally and quickly, without your having to try.\n\nThe resulting feelings of relaxation not only reduce stress – they also facilitate increased confidence. When your nervous system is in a relaxed state it is more receptive to the true real-life affirmations embedded in the tracks on this app, resulting a more positive self-state. The amazing part is that this all happens as naturally as you might experience the pleasure that comes from watching a sunset or walking on a beach. This effect has been confirmed by research. \n\nBilateral stimulation is a treatment element of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) EMDR, the revolutionary treatment for PTSD. The method seems to resolve trauma-related memories and feelings more rapidly and effectively than traditional methods.\n\nThe app can be used for emotional ‘first-aid’, as an adjunct to psychotherapy and as part of long-term efforts to feel more confident. You can learn to feel different - you know much more than you think."

Once initially synced the app automatically updates after each point, and game. \n\nA long press locks the screen to prevent inadvertent scrolling. \n\nThe app has setup options to allow you to customize your gameplay from professional rules to casual “Best Of” matches.\n\nIn casual mode choose best of games, from 1-7 and even infinity. (Stop the game at any time to tally up the score)\n\nPro Score Mode allows you to choose Games per Set (2-10, or Infinity) A tiebreaker mode with official rules of who is serving and to which side and the option to choose how many tiebreak points (1-10). Sets per Match (1,3,5,7 and 9 or infinity), played as Best Of. And a + 1 tiebreaker set is optional depending on the rules you play. At any time, you can stop the game to tally the current points, particularly if you are playing with an Infinity set point.   \n\nIf you’re in a match and win or lose and want to keep it going “Play on” allows you to add more sets to the match in pro mode or switch to unlimited in pro or casual game play. \n\nThere is also a “Game Score Mode” that allows you to swipe for games vs points for big picture score keeping. \n\nA History of each match is kept under the “History” button, individual matches can be deleted with a swipe, or the whole history cleared using the “Delete All” Button. \n\nFactory Reset does not clear the history or the workout information but resets all the settings. \n\nAdditionally, Apple Health is integrated to keep track of your workout, and displays current Heart Rate, Active Energy, Distance and Workout Time (pending your authorization). These workout sessions can also be accessed from your connected IOS devices under the Apple Health App. \n\nA tutorial in the app shows how to interact, and what each setting does. \n\nA Local Notification is sent if you are in a workout but haven’t logged a point in a user defined amount of time, this helps remind you if you are heading home but forgot to end the match. There are NO external notifications (as in, you won’t get notifications unrelated to an active workout, nothing to annoy you).\n\nApple Health Integration:\nYou have the option to confirm the apps access to health parameters and allow the app to log “Tennis” as a workout activity. You can deny this access to any feature or parameter. You can also choose at any time to go into the Apple Health App and remove access. Alternatively, you can deselect “Save Workout” within the app, so that you can view the health data without saving the workout.\nFor More information read “Privacy Policy” link provided.\n\nIf you have any suggestions or issues, feel free to contact me through the “Support Link” provided. I would really appreciate any feedback! Most of the updates from 2.1 to 2.3 have come from suggestions by users, and 2.8 was specifically made to update the tap to change serve function that one user found frustrating if it was accidentally pressed during a match. If there is anything you would like to see… just ask!"

It encompasses motor activities of the jaw muscles, such as jaw or teeth clenching, and teeth grinding, some of which may be associated with clinical signs and symptoms, like tooth wear, failed dental restorations, complications with implant-supported prosthesis, muscle fatigue and temporomandibular joint pain. A correct diagnosis is therefore fundamental to establishing early prevention and management regimens.\n\nSCIENTIFIC RESEARCH\nStudies with BruxApp have been supervised by experts, as part of an ongoing multicenter research project on bruxism epidemiology and management coordinated by Prof. Daniele Manfredini, University of Siena, Italy.\n\nDEVELOPMENT\nThe app was developed by Goran Djukic, program analyst at the Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Council of Research, University of Pisa, Italy.\nBruxApp is currently available in the following languages: English, Italian, , French, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish, Brazilian, Japanese, Hebrew, Chinese, Arabic, Greek, Polish, Lithuanian, Bosnian, Romanian, Turkish, Norwegian, and Croatian, with another 4 language versions soon to be released. \n\nIMPORTANT STATEMENT\nBruxApp is not a game or gadget.  In order for BruxApp to work correctly and be effective, please dedicate 5 minutes of your time to READING the simple instructions CAREFULLY. \n\nThe full compatibility is guaranteed by iPhone 6 and higher ones and iOS 9.3 and higher ones."

Anyone can use MoodMission, whether you just want a lift in your day or need a bit more help recovering from anxiety or depression.\n\nA randomised controlled trial has shown that MoodMission can improve mental health and wellbeing (Bakker et al., 2019), and two other studies published in scientific journals have provided further support (Bakker & Rickard, 2019; Bakker et al., 2018). Randomised controlled trials are the gold standard of scientific evidence, and very few available mental health apps have RCT support (Firth et al., 2018).\n\nCompleting Missions earns you rewards in the app, motivating you to take steps towards becoming healthier, happier, and more confident. Plus a Mission log helps you track your progress over time.\n\nMoodMission learns which types of Missions work best for you, so the more you use MoodMission the better it gets at tailoring your Mission suggestions.\n\nMoodMission is not a replacement for professional help. If you are experiencing anxiety, depression, or any mental health issue, talk to your GP or contact a psychologist for support."

      "label": "Guided Physio is a mobile application providing physiotherapy management programs for all musculoskeletal conditions. It has been designed by leading orthopaedic surgeons, physiotherapists and chiropractors who work at major teaching hospitals. \n\nPatients can now recover from their musculoskeletal conditions while on the go. This powerful tool is a must for those who lead a busy lifestyle and cannot find time to attend regular physiotherapy sessions. It can also be a very useful tool for those who want to maximise the benefits of their regular physiotherapy sessions. At a cost less than a cup of coffee, everyone can now afford professional physiotherapy advice and care.\n\nPrograms for various conditions are composed of many phases. Within each phase there are several carefully selected exercise videos, each clearly explaining how the exercise is performed.  When a patient can successfully perform an exercise, Guided Physio will guide them to the next exercise until they can complete the whole program in the appropriate amount of time. Depending on the condition, a program can take anywhere from two weeks to six months to complete.\n\nThis unique mobile application will change the way conditions are managed, providing patients with all the information to better manage their conditions with or without the assistance of Healthcare Professionals.\n\nWith Guided Physio, patients can work through predetermined programs for their particular condition at their own pace. We have also built in precautions and recommendations to seek medical advice when patients cannot complete exercises or experience significant pain. \n\nGuided Physio also allows patients to work with the assistance of their physiotherapist and surgeon. These Healthcare Professionals can customise different recovery programs for different patients. These programs are always on their mobile device to be practiced any place, any time. Real time tracking of progress is readily available for both patients and Healthcare Professionals."

In addition to the presentations schools receive they have the opportunity to complete a curriculum specifically designed to focus on what you have as opposed to what you don’t have, understanding the benefits of helping others as well as the importance of being healthy and active."

But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance.

HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio.

We'll help you find calm in any situation.\n\nWHAT'S INCLUDED?\n- Over 200 meditations to help overcome life's challenges including anxiety, stress, sleep, pain and difficult emotions\n- Mindfulness exercises you can do wherever you are, in categories such as travelling, at work, waking up, eating, and even when you're online\n- Sessions for complete beginners and those with more experience, with lengths from 3-40 minutes\n- A solo timer for more seasoned meditators\n- A range of experienced teachers so you can choose the voice and style that's right for you\n- Kids content for the little people in your life\n- Brand new buddhify Membership available as an optional in-app purchase with a range of additional features for those looking to take their meditation practice further\n\nBuddhify integrates with Apple Health so you can track your meditation using the Mindful Minutes category within the Health app.\n\nBUDDHIFY MEMBERSHIP\nFor those of you who want to deepen your practice even further, you can do that through Buddhify Membership. Becoming a Member is optional and gives you access to three amazing features: Together, Formal and the karaoke-style Transmission. Buddhify Membership is an annual subscription and payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

      "label": "WHAT IS CLOCK YOURSELF? \n\nClock Yourself challenges you to think on your feet.  \n\nIt involves exercise for your body and your brain, at the same time.  \nEvery challenge will stimulate your brain in a different way. \n\nYou don't have to master one challenge before you can explore another challenge.  \n\nSome call this an exercise app. \nSome call this a brain games app.  \nWhy can’t it be both?! \n\n\n \nWHO CAN USE CLOCK YOURSELF? \n\nEveryone! \n\nClock Yourself exercises involve taking one step in all directions on a circle visualised beneath your feet. It’s perfect for exercise at home.  \n\nAthletes often modify Clock Yourself exercises outdoors for sport-specific agility drills, by visualising a much larger circle and running between the coordinates.  \n\nSimilarly, people who are unable to walk can modify Clock Yourself to practise reaching with their arms, or wheelchair agility! \n\nIf you think you’re too slow to use Clock Yourself, you’re probably wrong.  \nIf you think you’re too fit to use Clock Yourself, you’re definitely wrong! \n\n\n\n\nWHY DID WE MAKE CLOCK YOURSELF?\n\nThe Clock Yourself concept originated in neurological rehabilitation. Now anyone can use it to harness their neuroplasticity.  \n\nIt was developed by Australian physiotherapist @MegLowryPT and software developer Dave Wallace. \n\n\n \nWe had 5 goals: \n\n1. Make it fun - Clock Yourself exercises are so entertaining that you’ll show your friends at parties! \n\n2. Make it versatile  - Both the stepping speed and the cognitive complexity are in your control.  \n\n3. Make it evidence based - This is a volitional step training method. Volitional stepping trains faster steps in all directions to improve your chances of catching yourself during a fall.  \n\n4. Make it portable - There is no need to set up mats, wires or sensors. It also works offline. It only requires internet for your initial download from the App Store.  \n\n5. Make it affordable - This is a once off purchase for pocket change. It has no recurring subscriptions and no advertisements.  \n\n\n\nIS CLOCK YOURSELF AVAILABLE IN OTHER LANGUAGES? \n\nYes and no. \n\nAt this stage, all of the buttons and instructions are in English only.  \n\nHowever, if you click the Options button within each challenge (except for the Simple Colours challenge) you can choose to play the audio prompts in six other languages. \n\nMandarin \nJapanese \nFrench  \nGerman \nSpanish \nDutch  \n\nWhat are you waiting for?  Go ahead and Clock Yourself!\n\n“A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new” - Albert Einstein"

      "label": "Anxiety Release shows you how to release anxious thoughts and feelings naturally, by harnessing the power of your brain. It does this by combining guided instructions and focused attention with bilateral brain stimulation. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a revolutionary treatment which is based on the use of sensory stimulation to alter anxiety-provoking memories and responses. Over 30 randomized controlled studies of EMDR attest to the efficacy of this process. \n\nBecause bilateral stimulation appeals to the unconscious, sensing part of the brain, there is no need for effortful thinking or struggling with feelings.  All you have to do is LISTEN and your brain will do the rest! The App consists of;\n1 x brain training session\n2 x guided anxiety management sessions\n1 x pure bilateral stimulation session (audio & visual)\n1 x safe place exercise\nProgress Log function\nPowerful Bls brain visual \nThis App is suitable for both clinicians and clients\n\nCaution: Persons suffering with complex PTSD or mental health problems, multiple psychological trauma or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without medical supervision."

      "label": "The NVC (TM) Check-In app helps you at the moments when you wish to connect with yourself or another. Using the model of Nonviolent Communication (NVC), you gradually become aware of what you observe, what you feel, what you need and what you could do (or ask others to do) to take steps towards meeting your need.\n\nConnecting with yourself is the key to effectively dealing with all the triggers that you encounter in everyday life -whether these triggers occur at work or at home, whether you experience them as being pleasant or unpleasant.\n\nMaybe your employer gives you so much work to do that you begin to feel stressed and unhappy; or someone says to you, - That is the way I am and you better get used to it... - or a car pulls out in front of you unexpectedly and you brake suddenly.\n\nIn all these situations you can choose to connect with yourself in order to transform struggle and stress into harmony and inner peace.\n\nA Check-In is standing/sitting still in the moment, getting in touch with what is alive in you now and connecting with yourself. The creators of the NVC Check-In app would love to contribute to your connection at times when you want to:\n- step out of a vicious circle of recurring thoughts\n- clarify why a particular occurrence has such impact on you and what you can do about it\n- translate judgements you have about yourself and others into feelings and needs - and experience how liberating this is!\n\nUsing the colours of the NVC Dance Floors and pictures from the Giraffentraum (Giraffe Dream) Project, the NVC Check-In app gradually increases your awareness of what you observe, what feelings you experience, what needs (fulfilled or not fulfilled) are underlying those feelings and what you could do to move on and create something new. \n\nThe following buttons guide you. Press (repeatedly) on: \n- O for your Observation\n- F for your Feelings\n- N for your Needs\n- R for a Request to oneself or another\n\nAt every step you are supported by a list of common observations, feelings, needs and requests.\n\nFrom this list you can choose from some common Observations, Feelings, Needs and Requests (OFNR, listed in uppercase) by (repeatedly) pressing the buttons, or you can choose from a more expanded list by clicking the selection and scrolling through the small menus.\n\nYou can also enter your own words in the empty fields below the OFNR suggestions, using your keyboard.\n\nThe sentence you make is updated continually and will be shown on the display.\n\nFor example, it might look like this:\n- O: When I see in my diary that my interview is tomorrow, \n- F: I feel nervous, \n- N: because I need trust and acceptance. \n- R (to oneself): Would you be willing, when you notice this feeling in the interview, to reflect on the experience you have accumulated in recent years?\n\n\nPress Save to save the sentence. Here you can also use the phrase as a (nonviolent) tweet on Twitter or as a (connecting) status update / shared message on LinkedIn.\n\nHow to use the buttons at the bottom of your screen:\n- Press (repeatedly) NVC in order to address the sentence to yourself or another person.\n- Press Mail to email the sentence you have constructed to yourself or somebody else. An email screen will open in which you can customize and send the text. You might put a copy in your agenda app to have it sent to yourself every day at a specific time.\n- Press Log to scroll through your history so that you can see what you needed before and what has helped you in the past. Here you can also delete entries in the log and email the entire log in comma separated (csv, can be imported in Excel) format to yourself.\n- Press Apps for more supporting apps based on Nonviolent Communication.\n- Press ? for information about how to use the app, for info about its creators and to redisplay the initial supporting question for an OFNR button."

Or perhaps you feel you can’t say no to people who constantly make demands of your time, energy and money?\n\nSometimes people have a poor ability to sense when their gut instinct, intuition, or heart is sending them messages that a decision is not right and they are uncomfortable. These messages are ignored and we ends up doing things, committing to things, or having things done to us that were not ok with – often regretting this in the moment or in hindsight.\n\nWhat's different about this app? Other apps may help after the fact. This app is designed to be used when the pressure is on to help you hear your gut instincts in the moment!\n\nCreated by the author of How to Breakup with Friends and Clinical Neuropsychologist, Dr Hannah Korrel, this app will help you to improve your assertiveness skill and learn to hear when your gut instinct is telling you something is wrong… and actually listen to it!\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Using the decision making function, this will help you to slow down, and not rush into something you’ll regret. This will help you arrive at a decision that’s right for you and change your subsequent action by helping you to properly hear the signals of your gut instinct and intuition – it can be used prior to the trigger, during the triggering event, or after the fact on reflection.\n\n- Specialised meditations are designed heighten our ability to hear own gut instinct/intuition/heart.  Poor assertiveness can mean one’s own wishes are difficult to hear, like whispers. In the face of anxiety and pressure screaming in our minds, it is difficult to hear these whispers. Two minute meditations are designed to assist in the moment during the triggering event. Longer meditations are designed to assist building assertiveness skills over all.\n\n- Useful phrases are also provided to help you feel confident in saying ‘no’ by actually give examples of what to say and how to say it!\n\nDisclaimer: this information is general in nature and not designed for individual advice."

This sleepmatic sounds machine is created using an ancient but doctor-tested and approved technique to help soothe your fussy baby calm with a shusher sound in cradle. \r\n\r\nA simple baby shusher with soothing sounds for baby that works on a single click, making calming sounds like baby lullaby that would work instantly and can be played for hours, recommended by parents, baby photographers, and doctors dealing with babies.\r\n\r\nBy creating calm sounds, safely stop the baby from crying with a rhythmic “shush” sound that engages a baby's natural calming reflex by reminding them of still being in the womb. The shush baby app helps to soothe baby calm and increase the baby sleep timer.\r\n\r\nThe amazing Sound Equalizer allows the app to \"listen\" to your baby crying or not every three minutes and automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby cry volume till baby calms down (so when the baby is wailing, shush is loud; when baby goes quiet, volume settles into a soothing background shush sound to relax baby).\r\n\r\nA newborn sleep magic baby sound machine that works best for a newborn baby to calm down quickly and manage baby sleeping patterns. A sleep aid that creates calming sounds for babies in the form of a shhh sound sleeper that will stop your baby crying, calms down easily, and put baby to sleep. \r\n\r\nThis shhh app calm baby instantly by creating a shusher sound, helping the baby relax in minutes using calming sounds for kids.  This sleepmatic app works like magic for the crying baby and helps parenting so much easier as baby calmer. \r\n\r\nAfter more than two years of testing and research with real moms and real babies, having sudden and long crying baby issues, we came up with the following very valuable feature list of baby soothing sound.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Safe and easy to use baby calming sounds machine. \r\n- Much more effective than simple lullabies or standard white noise.\r\n- Perfectly works for hours in the background and when the phone is locked\r\n- Adjustable Shush baby sound Timer Options (from 15 minutes to 8 hours of continuous shushing!)\r\n- Automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby crying volume.\r\n- Shush sounds played in low light “dark mode” ( night mode) to avoid extra mobile light as baby sleeps.\r\n- Work in other Apps on your Phone while still using the Baby Shusher App.\r\n\r\n*Note: Turn your phone on silent/mute to let the app do its magic.*\r\n \r\n \r\nWhat Real Moms are Saying About the Baby Shusher:\r\n\r\n“I wish I would have known about this sooner. It is truly a miracle for me and baby to have a good night’s rest together!” Mercedes (mother of 3 months old)\r\n\r\n“It is a must try for yourself.” Isabel (mother of 3.5 months old)\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t sure after the 1st time I used it, but it proved to us that it worked better and better thereafter. Loved the product!” Erika (mother of 2 months old)\r\n\r\n“The Baby Shusher works to calm a fussy baby.” Vanessa (mother of 2 week old)\r\n\r\n“When used at the night time, it can greatly help calm your baby long enough to help him with whatever’s upsetting him, or calm him down so he can fall asleep or feed.” Ingrid (mother of 1 week old)\r\n\r\n“Thank you! The three most peaceful nights and days in a while.” Mercedes (mother of 3 month old)\r\n\n\r\nYou can also try our other baby shusher - Sleep Miracle products here: \r\nhttps://babyshusher.com/\r \n\r\nGet this paid baby shusher app now to make your parenting life easier. \r\nWe would appreciate your reviews and rating about our app so we can make it better for you.\r\n\r\nYou can also write to us at app@babyshusher.com"

That you are done drinking! My app does not have a reset button or a way to add a drink. ;-> \n\n2.

Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

      "label": "DBT Diary Card is the only DBT iPhone app designed and created by a licensed and DBT intensively trained psychologist.\n\nHighlights of version 3.0:\n\n+ graphing data across time\n+ on device PDF viewing\n+ daily reminders\n+ Password locking to prevent others from seeing your diary cards.\n\nRead what our actual users say:\n\n\"***** Best DBT app available!!!\nSimply put, this is the most helpful DBT or CBT app available. I bought a new iPhone to be able to use it. DBT skills are priceless. I had tried every, other DBT and CBT app. This one follows the traditional DBT program exactly, and is the only Diary Card. Before I had this app, I'd seldom fill in my diary card. Now that I have it, I don't have to keep track of paper, and I rarely miss a day. I can fill in my Diary Card discreetly, from anywhere, anytime, and send it directly to my DBT coach. I no longer have to worry about someone coming across my Diary Cards. You can brush up on skills, use it for distress tolerance suggestions, tailor it to your needs, and even journal. I appreciate that I can add personal goals to my diary. Thank you for this app!\" - iTunes US Review\n\n\"***** I am in IRL-DBT and this app is the perfect complement. Oh. I love that the app is so flexible, that you can make it kind of your own, and the layout is so nice, simple, yet beautiful. For me, a true life-saver! Genius! Without a doubt the best app in my IPhone... Get it now!\" - iTunes Sweden Review\n\n\"***** Perfect! Worth the money!\" - iTunes US Review\n\nAs an educated consumer, it's important to know to whom you're listening. DBT Diary Card was created by a Ph.D. psychologist trained directly by Dr. Marsha Linehan and at the Duke University Medical Center; we are experts in DBT, providing consultation to many in our community. And now we're giving it to you!\n\nA DBT app can have 3 parts: \n\n- A reference manual\n- A behavior tracker\n- A skills coach\n\nDBT Diary Card has all 3 of these parts and utilizes the iOS platform in ways that the other apps available don't and can't.\n\n+ PDF generation\n+ Notification Pane support\n+ Password protection\n+ Advanced text editing\n+ Media playback\n\nWhat DBT Diary Card has to offer:\n\n- Skills. LOTS of them. Every DBT skill you've ever heard about in a group is in here. It can be your quick reference to your skills so that you don't have to carry around your book or binder. Every skill is described in readable language to help you understand them easily and it's all just a quick tap away.\n\n- Emotions. All the \"basic\" emotions are presented, again with descriptions and explanations a quick tap away.\n\n- Behaviors. The most troublesome are pre-loaded.\n\n- Coaching. If you know you need to use a skill but can't think of which one or can't remember how to choose, use the app. The coaching can be your virtual therapist. \n\n- Complete customizability. Are you working on something different or do you have a different understanding of a particular skill or emotion? Change it. It's that easy. You are not wedded to the way it's presented in the app. It's all completely customizable.\n\n- 911 skills.  Put your emergency skills a tap away. You can call directly from the app, listen to your distress tolerance music, remember what apps help in the moment. \n\n- Email. You can email your therapist your diary card on a weekly basis automatically, you can do it manually whenever you'd like or you can have the app remind you.\n\n* Telephony features require an iPhone and voice service."

Anyone can use MoodMission, whether you just want a lift in your day or need a bit more help recovering from anxiety or depression.\n\nA randomised controlled trial has shown that MoodMission can improve mental health and wellbeing (Bakker et al., 2019), and two other studies published in scientific journals have provided further support (Bakker & Rickard, 2019; Bakker et al., 2018). Randomised controlled trials are the gold standard of scientific evidence, and very few available mental health apps have RCT support (Firth et al., 2018).\n\nCompleting Missions earns you rewards in the app, motivating you to take steps towards becoming healthier, happier, and more confident. Plus a Mission log helps you track your progress over time.\n\nMoodMission learns which types of Missions work best for you, so the more you use MoodMission the better it gets at tailoring your Mission suggestions.\n\nMoodMission is not a replacement for professional help. If you are experiencing anxiety, depression, or any mental health issue, talk to your GP or contact a psychologist for support."

You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

The DQS Mobile app was designed to make it as easy as possible to calculate a Diet Quality Score each day.\n\nAs you eat throughout the day, enter the servings of each category of food that you consume. Tap a box to consume one serving of that category, tap it again and it will become a half serving, and one more tap will set it back to zero for that box. You can tap the category name to view an explanation of what foods fall under that category. Your total DQS score for the day is shown in the upper right corner of the page.  DQS data is saved for each day you track it. \n\nYou can also log your weight and body fat % on the bottom of the Tracking page. We recommend you log your weight no more than once per week.\n\nThe Graphs page lets you see how you are doing with your Diet Quality Score over time. You can view your data over the last week, month or year. When viewing yearly data, it is displayed as 52 week-long averages. You can view graphs showing your total DQS, your weight, or your DQS score by specific category.\n\nYou can set a target weight, body fat % and a target DQS score on the Profile page."

      "label": "Research has shown that parents and teachers want ways to start and continue conversations with their children and students on basic growing up topics. The TALK Puberty app was created to prompt these conversations. \n\nSimply click on one of the five sections, then swipe through the provided questions children commonly ask about puberty and adolescence. To increase your feelings of comfort, state questions aloud one at a time. By doing this, the questions serve as a “cue to action” – this means the actual asking of a question encourages you to talk. \n\nOver 150 questions are provided and are broken down into five sections: Basic Questions About Puberty, Questions About Most Girls, Questions About Most Boys, Other Questions Children Often Ask*, and Open-Ended Questions. Within the first four sections, brief answers are provided on the slides following the questions. If additional information is needed, refer to a reliable resource including your local medical professional. Some resources are also noted within the app.\n\nRecommended to be used with children ages 7 through 15, although people of all ages are welcome to use the questions to have interactive conversations about real life. By opening that line of communication now, you are creating a safer and healthier environment for your children and students to return and ask more complex questions as they get older. Remember – the word TALK is a verb. Talking helps us feel more connected and builds trust.\n\nNotes:\n• The terms “girls” and “boys” are used within this app due to many children being more concrete learners when they are younger.\n• Although the terms “girls” and “boys” are used during anatomical references, it is important to remember that someone can have a vulva even if they don’t identify as a girl or a penis even if they don’t identify as a boy.\n• The section titled “Other Questions Children Often Ask” contains a variety of questions including those about consent, identity, sexual health, and safety.\n• The TALK Puberty app needs to be purchased for download. This decision was made to support your privacy and to ensure your use of the app, including the conversations you have with family members, friends, and students, is not interrupted by any advertisements.\n\nFor more help for talking about puberty and adolescence, listen the Puberty Prof Podcast wherever you listen to podcasts.\n\nInformation about the app’s creator:\n• Lori Reichel is a nationally recognized Health Educator. \n• Lori's corresponding book, Common Questions Children Ask About Puberty: Insights from a nationally recognized health education expert, received the Mom’s Choice Award, the B.R.A.G. Medallion Medal, and the Wishing Shelf Bronze Award.\n• For more information about the app’s creator, go to www.pubertyprof.com."

      "label": "Train your baby to sleep the night so you can get some well needed rest. Uses a proven sleep training method which teaches your baby to self-soothe and go back to sleep.\n\nGoing to sleep independently is a learned behavior, and everyone needs a good night's sleep - Mom, Dad, siblings, and your infant. Once your infant's doctor tells you they no longer need to eat in the middle of the night (usually around 4-5 months old), they can learn how to put themselves to sleep and to sleep through the night. Unfortunately, while babies obviously know how to sleep, they don't necessarily know how to soothe themselves to sleep at bedtime, and back to sleep when they naturally wake up during the night. A typical sleep cycle is 90 minutes, after which our bodies naturally wake up a bit, and then can either stay awake, or go back to sleep. The goal of sleep training is to help children to develop good sleep associations, strategies, and behaviors that help them to fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. \n\nTestimonial from a Beta Tester: \"The first night my daughter cried for 45 minutes, with me checking on her 6 times and also cried several minutes twice in the middle of the night, the second night 20 minutes and twice in the middle of the night, the third night 5 minutes and once during the night, and the fourth night she didn't cry at all, and then slept 7 hours straight!\"\n\nApp Features:\n* Full documentation explaining the training method and how to use the app.\n* Easy to use trainer which even runs in the background when your device is in sleep mode.\n* Training log which you can share and print, and even add your own notes to.\n* Advanced sleep wait time editor so you can customize the app to your baby's needs.\n* Optional social sharing which lets you tell your friends of your baby's sleep success.\n* Apple Watch App letting you control the Sleep Training process from your wrist.\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- \n\nTweet Us: http://twitter.com/PepperDogSoft \n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- \n\nIf you are experiencing problems, please use the Support forum on our website (www.pepperdogsoft.com) as we can better help you there. \n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-"

Just add your weight and see it plotted on the graph with all the relevant information. The monthly graph shows you your weight, your target weight but also your average weight over the last 10 days.  Your average weight is a much better indicator of your real weight. \n\nNew in v1.5 Delete Weight.  Just select the Weighs button and find the day you want to delete the weight of.  Select the red cross on that row.  Select 'Yes' when the dialog prompts you and the weight will be deleted.\n\nThe blue line shows the required weight loss line. This line is calculated from the start date & weight and the end date & weight. If you follow this line you will reach your target weight.\n\nThe end of the arrow of each red line shows the weight for the day. The line extends to the rolling average weight for the day. If the arrow is downward then your weight is going in the right direction. If the arrow is upward then beware your weight is above the average.\n\nThe green line shows the rolling average weight. For each weight entered an average of the last ten days is calculated. This weight is plotted for each day and this is the green line. If the green line remains below the blue line you are winning.\n\nYour daily weight can change too much over just a couple of days and this can be very discouraging when your weight increases.  \n\nYou can easily see your new weight and how this affects the average on the graph.  \n\nUsing this new information you can gain confidence that your weight is changing as required.\n\nThe graph also shows you the line of required weight loss to achieve your desired weight.  \nWhile your weights and the average weights remain below this line you are still on track.  \nStray above this line and your are off course.  The graph is a powerful visual clue to what is occurring.\n\nSimple to use.  Just start it.  You just have to set the initial values in the Preferences and you are ready to go.\nTo set the Preferences you set the Start Date, Start Weight, End Date, End Weight and whether you want to use kilograms,  stones & pounds, or pounds.\n\nOn the Graph page just select Today's Weight to add you weight for the day.  Select Weight to add more than one weight for the month/months.  Switch back to the Graph to see the weight(s) plotted.  Once you have a few added the Graph View starts to make real sense.\n\nThe more weights you add the better the graph shows your progress."

      "label": "Low-glycemic diet is a weight loss diet based on the Glycemic index. Glycemic index (or GI) is a measure of glucose level increase from carbohydrate consumption. It shows how fast a food is likely to raise your blood sugar. \n\nThe principle guideline of the low-glycemic diet is to avoid high GI foods. High GI foods stimulates a sudden change in blood sugar levels. This, in turn, leads to fatigue and hunger, as well as undue stress on your body. Too much insulin in your body for a long period of time makes it easier to store fat and harder to burn it. It also may lessen your body’s sensitivity to insulin over time, leading to type 2 diabetes and other illnesses.\n\nLow-glycemic diet can help you to: \n- control your appetite and delay hunger, \n- achieve steady sustainable weight loss or maintain a healthy weight, \n- balance your blood sugar levels, \n- make better cholesterol levels, \n- prevent heart disease, fatty liver and other chronic diseases, \n- prevent insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes. \n\nTo follow a low-glycemic diet is not so difficult as you may think. With the app you don't have to memorize the glycemic index or count grams of carbohydrates in foods. Just enter all the food you ate this day. Each food has its color indicator (high, medium and low GI), so you can always see what foods you should avoid or limit. Using the app, you will be able to easily monitor your diet, looking on it from Glycemic load standpoint. \n\nFeatures: \n- large database of products;\n- search function to find your food items very quickly;\n- \"recently used products\" function to keep your favorite (frequently used) foods in one place for quick access;\n- adding your own products;\n- practical charting functions;\n- support of mealtimes;\n- support of both metric (kg/g, cm) and US (lb/oz, in) systems of measurement;\n- sharing data with the Health app;\n- works without internet connection.\n\nDo you know that you can try the app FOR FREE? This is possible through the web version on the Facebook available by link https://apps.facebook.com/nococalories. Since it requires a flash player, please use your computer."

      "label": "Finally, a world first PMDD Treatment App. Literally millions of women worldwide suffer immensely every month with this debilitating condition. Most can't access effective treatment due to a severe shortfall in clinicians who are knowledgeable in treatment options for PMDD. This app will provide some desperately needed help to women with PMDD, diagnosed or undiagnosed.\n\nSharryn Muir, a clinical psychologist, specialises in treating PMDD. She has expert knowledge based on years of treating this condition and her own lived experience.\n\nThis app essentially replicates what Sharryn does with her clients in therapy sessions.\n\nThe app is composed of valuable insights and knowledge Sharryn has learnt from her personal experience, working with clients and working closely with experts in PMDD including psychiatry, endocrinology and research.\n\nSkills\n\nThe treatment component of the app provides you with 23 ‘Skills’ that are specifically for treating PMDD. The skills include distress tolerance, emotion regulation and mindfulness. They are chosen to address the intense distress and dysregulated mood and behaviour experienced in PMDD.\n\nBefore learning the skills you will identify several ‘target behaviours’. These are behaviours that typically occur for you in the luteal phase of your menstrual cycle that you want to stop. Examples include yelling at others, thought spirals of worthlessness or hopelessness, inappropriate workplace behaviour and creating interpersonal conflict. You’ll learn skills to help you resist engaging in these behaviours.\n\nThe skills teach you to tolerate and regulate the intense emotions rather than regrettably act on them. \n\nMany skills are provided, as each woman finds a particular set of skills personally effective. Some women internalise their intense distress and don't ‘externalise’ with problematic behaviours. These women greatly benefit from distress tolerance skills, finding relief in reducing, calming and tolerating their intensity.\n\nThe skills are drawn from Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) and adapted to the symptoms of PMDD in the luteal phase of a woman's cycle.

This is called Brain Synchronization. Your conscious and subconscious function at the same electrical frequency allowing you to rewire your subconscious mind and reinforce your conscious desires.\n\nUsing Subliminal Vision Boards, you will take action towards your goals and dreams like never before! This time there is nothing holding you back from creating amazing and accelerated manifestations in your life!\n\n~ CREATIVE CONSCIOUS VISUALIZATION ~\n\nThe human brain thinks in images. The creative process of visualization is so powerful. The key is to add the exact images of what you want to manifest with absolutely no compromising! You can do this by using Google images or your own images. This feature allows you to focus and manifest the exact image and vision of what you want. \n\nCreate unlimited, fully customizable visualization boards targeting each area of your life.\n\nStart consciously creating your reality with positive and empowering images and affirmations and witness these intentions manifest into your reality.\n\n~ MIND AND BODY HEALING SOUND FREQUENCIES ~\n\nEach word that you see, speak, and hear from your visualization board carries a particular energy and frequency and every cell in your body is listening to every word. \n\nSound is energy. One of the most powerful features on this app is the ability to record your voice onto your vision board. Recording and listening to positive and empowering affirmations develops new brain rewiring scripts, bringing you into an accelerated alignment with the vision of your higher self.\n\nExperience the healing Solfeggio Frequencies ranging from 174hz – 963hz Ancient healing frequencies are set in beautiful soothing music created to release stress, remove energetic blockages and rebalance the spirit, mind, and body.\n\n~ SUBCONSCIOUS REPROGRAMMING ~ \n\nOur minds are like a computer that is being run by old software. This old software consists of thoughts and feelings of scarcity and old limiting Ideas and belief systems. Your subconscious has not been updated since you were a child. Those old beliefs and programs still run the adult that is you today, limiting your true potential by keeping you on the exact same patterns from the past.\n\nYour subconscious causes you to feel emotionally and physically uncomfortable whenever you attempt to do anything new or different. It goes against changing any of your established patterns of behavior.\n\nThe good news is your brain is capable of quickly unlearning limitation and rapidly becoming unlimited! \n\nUsing our unique Subliminal Take 5 feature, your subconscious learns the new story that you create on your visualization board. Each image and affirmation subliminally flashes at a speed that reprograms your subconscious. \n\nReverse negative limited beliefs of scarcity and low self-worth and start to reinforce positive and empowering thoughts and feelings of abundance and prosperity. \n\nDownload Subliminal Vision Boards and experience a life lived in Love, Joy and Alignment with your Higher Self. \n\nWarning: App contains flashing that can intensify certain patterns that can trigger a seizure in people with photosensitive epilepsy. Do not use while driving.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.subliminalvisionboards.com/terms-of-use"

It encompasses motor activities of the jaw muscles, such as jaw or teeth clenching, and teeth grinding, some of which may be associated with clinical signs and symptoms, like tooth wear, failed dental restorations, complications with implant-supported prosthesis, muscle fatigue and temporomandibular joint pain. A correct diagnosis is therefore fundamental to establishing early prevention and management regimens.\n\nSCIENTIFIC RESEARCH\nStudies with BruxApp have been supervised by experts, as part of an ongoing multicenter research project on bruxism epidemiology and management coordinated by Prof. Daniele Manfredini, University of Siena, Italy.\n\nDEVELOPMENT\nThe app was developed by Goran Djukic, program analyst at the Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Council of Research, University of Pisa, Italy.\nBruxApp is currently available in the following languages: English, Italian, , French, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish, Brazilian, Japanese, Hebrew, Chinese, Arabic, Greek, Polish, Lithuanian, Bosnian, Romanian, Turkish, Norwegian, and Croatian, with another 4 language versions soon to be released. \n\nIMPORTANT STATEMENT\nBruxApp is not a game or gadget.  In order for BruxApp to work correctly and be effective, please dedicate 5 minutes of your time to READING the simple instructions CAREFULLY. \n\nThe full compatibility is guaranteed by iPhone 6 and higher ones and iOS 9.3 and higher ones."

      "label": "Welcome to the Phatt App\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis app has been designed to enhance your experience whilst doing your PHATT weight loss program - Putting Health At The Top. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Phatt program has been uniquely developed  for everyone to be able to enjoy a healthy life at an affordable price. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe take great pride in keeping this program affordable.  It was orchestrated to prove that health was not only for the rich, but for everyone. No matter where you come from we are a home for you. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Phatt program teaches you about you, your gut , your health and how to maintain a healthy lifestyle for the rest of your life. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhatt consists of three main steps : \r\n\r\n1. To take away the sugar from your diet & to introduce the value of specific Nutrition.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2. To learn about the foods that will enhance your gut health.  This is the section where you will lose the majority of your weight  and within days you will begin to see results.  Your gut will gain strength as you learn to mono-eat and identify the foods that will compliment your gut health. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   3.   Maintenance:  here you are reintroduced to a wider variety of foods that will enable you to live a healthy lifestyle for the rest of your life.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo successfully complete the program you must complete step 3.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThroughout your program you are gifted with support and this App is connected to your own Personal Mentor.   They will guide you daily and make sure that you are accountable on your journey.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe supply you with meal plans and recipes  but for those of you who need certain dietary requirements there are optional swap-outs.  This App allows that to be done easily without any mathematics on your behalf. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe are extremely proud of this App as it has been in the making for several years.  It has been designed to take away the guess work and to support our customers to the best of our ability. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWeight loss is not only a health journey but it is also a mental journey. It is just as important to recognise that your mental health plays a role in weight loss and needs support. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCongratulations on taking the first step of living a healthier life.   By making a difference to your life you will be surprised how it will suddenly make a difference to your whole family. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYour children will see you make healthy choices and your language to them will change.   We all want to be the best example to our little ones. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHealth Wealth and Choice is the mantra that Phatt sings.  We can teach you about health, we can give you a wealth of knowledge but the greatest gift we will give you is choice.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nChoose to live.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGood luck, stay positive and enjoy the change.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt’s your turn to smile"

      "label": "Cardiograph is an application which measures your heart rate. You can save your results for future reference, keep track of multiple people with individual profiles, add notes and locations, and even print out your measurements for sharing or safe keeping.\n\nCardiograph uses your device's built-in camera to take pictures of your fingertip and calculate your heart's rhythm - the same approach used by professional medical equipment!\n\n\"I know you have the disclaimer on the screen but I don't care, Cardiograph saved my life. Your app was key to understanding what was going on and help the doctors understand too.\"\nBob Spadafora - *****\n\n\"Comparing heart rates with family over the holidays is fun.\"\nTxyak – ****\n\n\"Wanna impress a friend with a cool app. This is the one to get.\"\nMattyray – *****\n\n\"After having two heart valve replacements and a by-pass, I feel it is not only smart - but also necessary - to have such a reliable heart rate monitor with me everywhere I go.\"\nDantv – *****\n\n\"I am an EMT and it helps me actually see what is going on. It is by no means definitive like a monitor but it is a great indicator of problems I would not see otherwise.\"\nGranniem – ****\n\n\"I had a pulse oximeter on one hand, medical quality, and my iPhone app in the other and the app was dead-on accurate.\"\nLike it but hate it – *****\n\n\n=== See Cardiograph in action ===\nhttp://macropinch.com/cardiograph \nhttp://youtu.be/isIjcCFYEho\n\n\n• Measure your heart rate\n\nIt's never been easier to know what your heart rate is! Without any external hardware, just using the built-in camera of your smartphone or tablet, you can get accurate readings almost instantly.\n\nKnowing how fast your heart is beating can be very useful when exercising, if you're under stress, if you have a heart-related medical condition, or even just out of curiosity.\n\n\n• Track your results\n\nEvery measurement you take is saved to your personal history, so you can keep track over time. In addition to the date and time of the measurement, you can also save the location at which it was taken (and see them on a map), and even add a quick note to effortlessly organize your history.\n\n\n• Multiple profiles\n\nCardiograph is perfectly tailored to allow multiple people to use the app on a shared device. You can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them has their own individual measurement history.\n\n\n• Export & Print\n\nEach measurement can be exported in full detail to a portable format that you can later send via e-mail, upload on the web or even print right from the app itself (with an AirPrint™ compatible printer).\n\n\n• Clean and intuitive design\n \nInspired by real-life medical equipment, Cardiograph is a pleasure to use. The streamlined and clutter-free design makes it seem instantly familiar, so you can focus on using the app instead of navigating through series of confusing screens.\n\n\n• Built-in user guide\n\nIf you're having trouble with the app, or you want to make the most out of it, you can access the comprehensive help manual right from within the app itself.\n\n\n• Universal application with iCloud® sync\n\nCardiograph is an universal application - it runs on the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod touch.\nInstall Cardiograph on multiple devices with iOS 5.0+, and all your profiles and measurements will be in sync! Manage your profiles and measurements on one device, and the changes are instantly reflected on all the others.\n\n\nPlease note: If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\n\n\nFollow the latest news:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch \nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

      "label": "Everything your gym coach told you about stretching was wrong. Performance Stretching will show you how to do it right.\n \nMost people learned back in elementary school that they should do static stretching (where you hold a stretch for a few minutes) before running or engaging in sports to prevent injury. It turns out that static stretching before a workout not only decreases athletic performance, it can actually increase the risk of injury. \n\nThe right way to get ready for an intense workout is dynamic stretching: This active form of stretching moves your muscles through the full range of motion to increase your blood flow, reduce tightness, deliver important nutrients to muscles, and improve your athletic performance. Performance Stretching will show you the most effective type of warm up for running and nearly every type of sport. Add it before any activity and you will be amazed by how much your performance improves.\n\nNo matter how well you warm up, athletic activity still puts stress on the body.  Performance Stretching also includes foam roller programs to give yourself a deep tissue massage and release knots that limit movement, keep your muscles tight, and lead to injury. Foam roller stretching is also excellent for body builders, or anyone that wants to build healthy muscles, to prep their muscles for growth.\n\nIf you don't have a foam roller, Performance Stretching still includes great ways to cool down your muscles and lessen post-workout soreness by flushing out the lactic acid.  This is where static stretching is best.  Done at the proper time, in the proper way, static stretching will help you improve your balance, blood circulation, flexibility, range of motion, and production of synovial fluid (the fluid that reduces friction in your joints).\n\nWhether you need a proper warm up, a cool down, or a relaxing, healing recovery, Performance Stretching will guide you through the right types of stretches for the right occasions and it will show you how to do them effectively. \n\nFEATURES\n• Over 150 different stretches. Each one includes a video you can view DURING YOUR WORKOUT and audio description to help you perfect your form. \n• The right stretches for the right reasons. A mixture of static, dynamic, and foam roller stretches maximizes your results. \n• Fast and efficient. Holding positions for longer than 30 seconds is less effective.\n• Works anywhere! No equipment needed for a terrific stretching workout.\n• Completely interactive. Swap out stretches to personalize your workouts. \n• Sync your workouts to the Health app.\n• Compatible with most bluetooth heart rate monitors.\n\nPERFORMANCE STRETCHING PROGRAMS:\n\nFoam Roller Stretch Program - A full-body deep tissue massage to work out all the knots that keep your muscles tight.\n\nDynamic Running Warm Up Stretch Program - Warm up your legs properly to take your run to the next level.\n\nDynamic Sport Warm Up Stretch Program - Warm up every major muscle group so that you can give your best.\n\nLower Back Rehab Program - Stretches and strength training moves to improve your core strength, reduce back pain, and increase your range of motion.\n\nLower Back Static Stretch Program - Work out the stiffness in your lower back and fix your posture.\n\nLower Body Static Stretch Program - You use your legs for everything, keep them at their functional best.\n\nUpper Body Static Stretch Program - Keep your upper body loose, relaxed, and properly aligned.\n\nFull Body Static Stretch Program - Increase flexibility, range of motion, blood flow, joint health, and posture throughout your entire body.\n\nQuick Full Body Static Stretch Program - When time is a factor, but you still want to do something great for your body.\n\nStatic Stretch Cool Down Programs - Designed to relax tired muscles and improve functional flexibility while your body is still warm.\n\nWorks with Health"

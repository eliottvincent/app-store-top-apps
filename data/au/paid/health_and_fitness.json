In addition to the presentations schools receive they have the opportunity to complete a curriculum specifically designed to focus on what you have as opposed to what you don’t have, understanding the benefits of helping others as well as the importance of being healthy and active."

      "label": "Anxiety Release shows you how to release anxious thoughts and feelings naturally, by harnessing the power of your brain. It does this by combining guided instructions and focused attention with bilateral brain stimulation. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a revolutionary treatment which is based on the use of sensory stimulation to alter anxiety-provoking memories and responses. Over 30 randomized controlled studies of EMDR attest to the efficacy of this process. \n\nBecause bilateral stimulation appeals to the unconscious, sensing part of the brain, there is no need for effortful thinking or struggling with feelings.  All you have to do is LISTEN and your brain will do the rest! The App consists of;\n1 x brain training session\n2 x guided anxiety management sessions\n1 x pure bilateral stimulation session (audio & visual)\n1 x safe place exercise\nProgress Log function\nPowerful Bls brain visual \nThis App is suitable for both clinicians and clients\n\nCaution: Persons suffering with complex PTSD or mental health problems, multiple psychological trauma or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without medical supervision."

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

      "label": "Tell MoodMission how you’re feeling and it will give you a tailored list of 5 Missions that can help you feel better and improve your wellbeing. \n\nMissions are mental health strategies that are quick, easily achievable, and backed up by scientific evidence, including:\nMindfulness meditations\nRelaxation\nExercise and fitness activities\nAffirmations and coping statements\nBehavioural activation\nYoga\nGratitude\nAnd heaps of other proven mood boosting activities.\n\nIt's a simple as doing a Mission and boosting your mood.\n\nMoodMission is based in cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which is an evidence-based psychological therapy for anxiety and depression. Anyone can use MoodMission, whether you just want a lift in your day or need a bit more help recovering from anxiety or depression.\n\nA randomised controlled trial has shown that MoodMission can improve mental health and wellbeing (Bakker et al., 2019), and two other studies published in scientific journals have provided further support (Bakker & Rickard, 2019; Bakker et al., 2018). Randomised controlled trials are the gold standard of scientific evidence, and very few available mental health apps have RCT support (Firth et al., 2018).\n\nCompleting Missions earns you rewards in the app, motivating you to take steps towards becoming healthier, happier, and more confident. Plus a Mission log helps you track your progress over time.\n\nMoodMission learns which types of Missions work best for you, so the more you use MoodMission the better it gets at tailoring your Mission suggestions.\n\nMoodMission is not a replacement for professional help. If you are experiencing anxiety, depression, or any mental health issue, talk to your GP or contact a psychologist for support."

      "label": "FTP Zones allows you to quickly calculate the power corresponding to a specific percentage of your Functional Threshold Power (FTP). Don't know your FTP? Use the app to take a test.\n\nYour FTP is the maximum average power that you could sustain for one hour. It is a common benchmark used by cyclists to determine fitness levels. Training sessions or group exercise classes at the gym are often structured into different stages of effort measured as a percentage of your FTP: longer, lower effort stages punctuated by shorter bursts of higher energy. Working at a percentage of FTP instead of a specific power is a great way to tailor a workout to your own level of fitness.\n\nDuring structured workouts, adjust the percentage and the app shows the target power for that stage. For example, 85% of a 230 Watt FTP is 196 Watts. Use FTP Zones instead of trying do the math in your head!\n\nIf you don't know your FTP or want to measure improvements over time, use the app to take a 1, 3, 5 or 20 minute test. The app can calculate your FTP from your average power over the test period (your bike must have a display which shows this information). Alternatively, calculate the average power required to achieve a particular FTP test result.\n\nFTP Zones has a big, bold user interface to make it easier to make adjustments and see the target power during your workout.\n\nFor more information see https://hacknicity.com/ftpzones or email me at support@hacknicity.com"

      "label": "“Overcoming pain based on EMDR” was brought to you by Mark Grant, well known Australian psychologist/researcher and writer. Mark is particularly interested in developing resources that sufferers of pain and stress can use to make a real difference in their suffering. He is motivated to do what works best for his clients rather than what the ‘accepted wisdom’ might say. But he maintains a scientific approach and has conducted several studies regarding the efficacy of EMDR as a treatment for chronic pain. \n\n“Overcoming pain based on EMDR” mobile application is using recent discoveries from brain science to alleviate chronic pain and severe stress. \n\nThe application comprises 3 playlists for controlling pain and associated stress that can maintain pain. \n\nEach playlist is designed with different goals in mind. Where the first playlist called “Mental Healing strategies” is aimed to alleviate mild or moderate chronic pain, the second playlist called “Sensory Healing strategies” will help when you are too tired, sore or distressed to employ the pain pathway strategy from the first playlist. And the last playlist called “Stress Management” is focused on reducing your stressful feelings that can maintain and exacerbate chronic pain. \n\nThe playlists are designed to compliment each other; so if your pain is severe using the strategies in “Sensory Healing strategies” should help bring it under control enough for you to benefit from the tracks in “Mental Healing strategies” and listening to the “Stress Management” tracks regularly, when your pain is tolerable, will bring your overall stress levels down and decrease the pain-related activity in your body and your brain. The tracks in “Mental Healing strategies” and “Stress management” can be listened to anywhere anytime, but the tracks in “Sensory Healing strategies” require external materials and preparation.\n\nOne of the key elements of this app is bilateral stimulation (bls), which is derived from EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). In conjunction with focused attention bls uses sensory stimulation to change physical emotional and cognitive processes associated with chronic pain (as well as trauma and stress). \n\nFor best results you should listen to the tracks that incorporate bls with headphones or hear-buds. You can use the app anytime anywhere but a quiet environment when you don’t feel too overwhelmed by stress or physical discomfort is best. \n\nIf you don’t get the response you expect when listening to the tracks never force yourself or get frustrated, just relax and trust that the relief you are seeking will happen sooner or later.\n\nWhile every effort has been made to provide a genuinely useful resource this app should not be considered a substitute for professional advice or treatment. In addition to standard medical care you should at the consider seeking psychotherapy, improving your diet, exercising regularly etc. \nFor curious minds there’s a number of articles presented in the application where you can read more about both EMDR and chronic pain and bilateral stimulation healing effect. \nYou can also read more about chronic pain and how to overcome it from the Mark Grant’s book called “Change Your Brain Change Your Pain” which you can also order by following the link in “Overcoming pain based on EMDR” placed under “Other Resources” section."

This sleepmatic sounds machine is created using an ancient but doctor-tested and approved technique to help soothe your fussy baby calm with a shusher sound in cradle. \r\n\r\nA simple baby shusher with soothing sounds for baby that works on a single click, making calming sounds like baby lullaby that would work instantly and can be played for hours, recommended by parents, baby photographers, and doctors dealing with babies.\r\n\r\nBy creating calm sounds, safely stop the baby from crying with a rhythmic “shush” sound that engages a baby's natural calming reflex by reminding them of still being in the womb. The shush baby app helps to soothe baby calm and increase the baby sleep timer.\r\n\r\nThe amazing Sound Equalizer allows the app to \"listen\" to your baby crying or not every three minutes and automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby cry volume till baby calms down (so when the baby is wailing, shush is loud; when baby goes quiet, volume settles into a soothing background shush sound to relax baby).\r\n\r\nA newborn sleep magic baby sound machine that works best for a newborn baby to calm down quickly and manage baby sleeping patterns. A sleep aid that creates calming sounds for babies in the form of a shhh sound sleeper that will stop your baby crying, calms down easily, and put baby to sleep. \r\n\r\nThis shhh app calm baby instantly by creating a shusher sound, helping the baby relax in minutes using calming sounds for kids.  This sleepmatic app works like magic for the crying baby and helps parenting so much easier as baby calmer. \r\n\r\nAfter more than two years of testing and research with real moms and real babies, having sudden and long crying baby issues, we came up with the following very valuable feature list of baby soothing sound.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Safe and easy to use baby calming sounds machine. \r\n- Much more effective than simple lullabies or standard white noise.\r\n- Perfectly works for hours in the background and when the phone is locked\r\n- Adjustable Shush baby sound Timer Options (from 15 minutes to 8 hours of continuous shushing!)\r\n- Automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby crying volume.\r\n- Shush sounds played in low light “dark mode” ( night mode) to avoid extra mobile light as baby sleeps.\r\n- Work in other Apps on your Phone while still using the Baby Shusher App.\r\n\r\n*Note: Turn your phone on silent/mute to let the app do its magic.*\r\n \r\n \r\nWhat Real Moms are Saying About the Baby Shusher:\r\n\r\n“I wish I would have known about this sooner. It is truly a miracle for me and baby to have a good night’s rest together!” Mercedes (mother of 3 months old)\r\n\r\n“It is a must try for yourself.” Isabel (mother of 3.5 months old)\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t sure after the 1st time I used it, but it proved to us that it worked better and better thereafter.

      "label": "AutoWake is the first haptic smart alarm for your Watch. \n\nIt can wake you up by tapping you on your wrist using your Watch's haptic engine. You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

It is commonly used by coaches and trainers to measure athlete fitness, or used as a pre-requisite for police, emergency and military organizations. \n\nThe standard test has 21 levels, and each level consists of a different number of shuttles. The test is performed by running between two markers placed 20 meters (65.6 feet) apart, at an increasing pace as indicated by the beeps. The test ends when you can no longer keep pace, or level 21 is completed.\n\nDetailed information about each test variation can be found in the app's online help."

      "label": "WHAT IS BRUXAPP?\nBruxApp is the first globally available, research-based smartphone app dedicated to the study and management of Bruxism and its health consequences.\nDesigned by top international experts in a multi-center Bruxism research project and developed in 25 Research Centres across the world. \n\nWHAT CAN IT DO?\nBruxapp is a simple tool used by dentists and patients for several purposes:\n- To help the assessment  of the presence/absence of bruxism-related activities (i.e., teeth clenching or grinding, jaw clenching) and potential consequences.\n- For rating the severity of bruxism, if present.\n- As a biofeedback-based management tool for bruxism.\n- To increase patients’ awareness of bruxism activities so they can avoid or correct negative habits.\n- To make patients aware of the possible clinical consequences of bruxism and try to prevent them.\n- To promote cutting-edge knowledge about bruxism, based on the latest scientific research.\n\nWHY is BruxApp needed? \nBruxism has been increasing in prevalence over recent years. It encompasses motor activities of the jaw muscles, such as jaw or teeth clenching, and teeth grinding, some of which may be associated with clinical signs and symptoms, like tooth wear, failed dental restorations, complications with implant-supported prosthesis, muscle fatigue and temporomandibular joint pain. A correct diagnosis is therefore fundamental to establishing early prevention and management regimens.\n\nSCIENTIFIC RESEARCH\nStudies with BruxApp have been supervised by experts, as part of an ongoing multicenter research project on bruxism epidemiology and management coordinated by Prof. Daniele Manfredini, University of Siena, Italy.\n\nDEVELOPMENT\nThe app was developed by Goran Djukic, program analyst at the Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Council of Research, University of Pisa, Italy.\nBruxApp is currently available in the following languages: English, Italian, , French, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish, Brazilian, Japanese, Hebrew, Chinese, Arabic, Greek, Polish, Lithuanian, Bosnian, Romanian, Turkish, Norwegian, and Croatian, with another 4 language versions soon to be released. \n\nIMPORTANT STATEMENT\nBruxApp is not a game or gadget.  In order for BruxApp to work correctly and be effective, please dedicate 5 minutes of your time to READING the simple instructions CAREFULLY. \n\nThe full compatibility is guaranteed by iPhone 6 and higher ones and iOS 9.3 and higher ones."

Using only your device’s built-in camera — with no additional hardware required — allows you to keep track of your heart’s rhythm anywhere and at any time. The detailed history records and ability to sync, tag, share and print individual measurements make it a versatile tool for monitoring your cardiovascular health.\n\nAccurate Results, Almost Instantly\nHaving a quick and easy way to know how fast your heart is beating has many uses — from improving your exercise regime to keeping regular track of your heart’s condition, or even just for fun. Cardiograph makes that easy, with precise results that appear within a few seconds.\n\nClean, Simplistic Design\nThe minimalistic and intuitive design shows you everything at a glance and makes Cardiograph approachable and easy to use for everyone.\n\nDetailed History\nSave your measurements (including every individual heartbeat!) for future reference or for sharing with your family or health care professional. You can also add a label to each measurement depending on the intensity of your exercise or your activity level.\n\nExport & Share Your Measurements\nEach measurement can be shared, exported as a PDF file and even printed on paper directly from within the app. If you have our previous app, Cardiograph Classic, you can transfer all of your measurements to the new app with a couple of taps.\n\nDesigned for iPhone & iPad\nCardiograph is a native app that takes advantage of the iPhone & iPad’s distinctive features like the excellent cameras, 3D Touch (where available) and support for syncing with the Apple Health app (where available).\n\nIMPORTANT: This application, although sufficiently accurate, is not meant as a replacement for professional medical equipment and qualified care. If you have any concerns about your heart’s condition, please consult your physician or general practitioner.\n\nIf you’re having issues with Cardiograph, check out the “More” section within the app or contact us at our support e-mail and we’ll help you out.\n\nGet in touch with us and follow the latest news regarding our apps:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch\nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

Disconnect together for as long as you want and do something fun and useful with your time without your electronic devices.\n\nOFFTIME also has a PRO version that, in addition, will answer you: \n\n- Schedule more than one rest at a time\n- You can create different blocking profiles to block the calls from the contacts that you wish to select while you are doing an OFFTIME.\n- Access backup copies of all your devices, so that no matter what device you use, your OFFTIME time is registered and disconnected on all your screens.\n\nThe OFFTIME team is working to improve the versions of our application, so that each time more is disconnected and you can dedicate yourself to everything that the mobile has taken from you.\n\nWhat are you waiting for to return to a life free of devices?

      "label": "Finally, a world first PMDD Treatment App. Literally millions of women worldwide suffer immensely every month with this debilitating condition. Most can't access effective treatment due to a severe shortfall in clinicians who are knowledgeable in treatment options for PMDD. This app will provide some desperately needed help to women with PMDD, diagnosed or undiagnosed.\n\nSharryn Muir, a clinical psychologist, specialises in treating PMDD. She has expert knowledge based on years of treating this condition and her own lived experience.\n\nThis app essentially replicates what Sharryn does with her clients in therapy sessions.\n\nThe app is composed of valuable insights and knowledge Sharryn has learnt from her personal experience, working with clients and working closely with experts in PMDD including psychiatry, endocrinology and research.\n\nSkills\n\nThe treatment component of the app provides you with 23 ‘Skills’ that are specifically for treating PMDD. The skills include distress tolerance, emotion regulation and mindfulness. They are chosen to address the intense distress and dysregulated mood and behaviour experienced in PMDD.\n\nBefore learning the skills you will identify several ‘target behaviours’. These are behaviours that typically occur for you in the luteal phase of your menstrual cycle that you want to stop. Examples include yelling at others, thought spirals of worthlessness or hopelessness, inappropriate workplace behaviour and creating interpersonal conflict. You’ll learn skills to help you resist engaging in these behaviours.\n\nThe skills teach you to tolerate and regulate the intense emotions rather than regrettably act on them. \n\nMany skills are provided, as each woman finds a particular set of skills personally effective. Some women internalise their intense distress and don't ‘externalise’ with problematic behaviours. These women greatly benefit from distress tolerance skills, finding relief in reducing, calming and tolerating their intensity.\n\nThe skills are drawn from Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) and adapted to the symptoms of PMDD in the luteal phase of a woman's cycle. Typically, Sharryn introduces one or two skills in an in-person therapy session. After learning a skill, you will practice it cycle after cycle until it becomes automatic.\n\nResources\n\nSharryn provides comprehensive information on the current understandings of what causes PMDD, her personal journey and recovery, information to use with partners, and information to give to your medical doctor or therapist.\n\nFive sections\n\nIntroduction\nGetting ready\nMonitoring\nSkills\nResources\n\nBy working through each section in the order they are presented, you will become empowered by understanding what PMDD is and how to manage the symptoms.\n\nThis app is comprehensive - you can benefit quickly, and will continue to learn and benefit over many months. This reflects the typical course of in-person therapy for PMDD.\n\nFeatures\n\n* 23 brief ‘skill’ tutorials delivered as video with accompanying written component.\n* Monitoring sheet with text and video instructions on monitoring the problematic PMDD behaviours you want to change.\n* Sharryn’s personal PMDD journey and recovery.\n* Links to websites for medical treatments.\n* Role play of an introduction to a therapy session.\n* Information on self-administered trauma processing.\n* A letter to your partner. PMDD significantly impacts on partners.\n* Education for partners on PMDD.\n\nApp users can email Sharryn with questions or feedback. Sharryn will deliver responses to frequently asked questions about using the app on her YouTube channel, an additional forum for PMDD support.\n\nSharryn Muir http://www.northernpsychology.org/sharryn-muir"

It’s perfect for exercise at home.  \n\nAthletes often modify Clock Yourself exercises outdoors for sport-specific agility drills, by visualising a much larger circle and running between the coordinates.  \n\nSimilarly, people who are unable to walk can modify Clock Yourself to practise reaching with their arms, or wheelchair agility! \n\nIf you think you’re too slow to use Clock Yourself, you’re probably wrong.  \nIf you think you’re too fit to use Clock Yourself, you’re definitely wrong! \n\n\n\n\nWHY DID WE MAKE CLOCK YOURSELF?\n\nThe Clock Yourself concept originated in neurological rehabilitation. Now anyone can use it to harness their neuroplasticity.  \n\nIt was developed by Australian physiotherapist @MegLowryPT and software developer Dave Wallace. \n\n\n \nWe had 5 goals: \n\n1. Make it fun - Clock Yourself exercises are so entertaining that you’ll show your friends at parties! \n\n2. Make it versatile  - Both the stepping speed and the cognitive complexity are in your control.  \n\n3. Make it evidence based - This is a volitional step training method. Volitional stepping trains faster steps in all directions to improve your chances of catching yourself during a fall.  \n\n4. Make it portable - There is no need to set up mats, wires or sensors. It also works offline. It only requires internet for your initial download from the App Store.  \n\n5. Make it affordable - This is a once off purchase for pocket change. It has no recurring subscriptions and no advertisements.  \n\n\n\nIS CLOCK YOURSELF AVAILABLE IN OTHER LANGUAGES? \n\nYes and no. \n\nAt this stage, all of the buttons and instructions are in English only.  \n\nHowever, if you click the Options button within each challenge (except for the Simple Colours challenge) you can choose to play the audio prompts in six other languages. \n\nMandarin \nJapanese \nFrench  \nGerman \nSpanish \nDutch  \n\nWhat are you waiting for?  Go ahead and Clock Yourself!\n\n“A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new” - Albert Einstein"

      "label": "Harness your innate survival responses to reverse anxiety and tension and feel more confident, naturally. Based on the popular CD of the same name, Calm and Confident is for anyone who is struggling with too much stress and not enough confidence. As the name suggests, this app is designed to help you feel both calm and confident. The app comprises innovative 10 guided meditations based on trauma therapy principles. Two of the central sessions are the 19 and 27 minute respectively Calm and Confident sessions. These transformative sessions incorporate focused attention, sensory stimulation, relaxation and re-connection with personal resources to change how you feel about yourself. Another session (‘Healing Anxiety’) addresses the role that childhood emotional neglect plays in maintaining anxiety.  Other sessions are designed to stimulate increased self-awareness, emotional regulation and security through various combinations of auditory, visual and mental stimuli.\n\nFeeling calm is essential for health and wellbeing, but without confidence it's just a nice feeling. Confidence is the end-product of feeling calm; it means experiencing yourself as connected, self-aware, energized, whole, and capable. Confidence is feeling okay about your feelings, needs and wants - it’s about feeling able to become the best version of yourself – not necessarily perfect, but the best ‘you’. As Lao Tzu said, ‘Health is the greatest possession. Contentment is the greatest treasure. Confidence is the greatest friend.’ Calm and Confident will help you to find your inner friend.\n\nBased on recent discoveries regarding brain structure and functioning, Calm and Confident uses applied neuroscience to teach you how to communicate more effectively with your nervous system to effect change. The deepest learning comes from experience, activities which stimulate sensory-emotional learning. This is different to  the ‘2+2 = 4’ kind of learning you got in school – it’s the learning that comes from doing something which changes how you feel about yourself – leading to new connections, new neural pathways. This kind of learning takes you from ‘I’m worthless’ to ‘I’m okay’; from ‘I can’t’ to ‘I can.’\n\nThe secret to achieving such confidence (when stress is getting in the way) is focused attention + bilateral stimulation (BLS), a unique combination which stimulates an in-built activation-deactivation circuit in your nervous system. BLS enables you to ‘hijack’ your own fight-flight response and transform anxiety and tension into relaxation and calm, naturally and effortlessly. It does this by harnessing your brain’s innate information processing capabilities. When your brain detects a stimuli such as BLS it‘s threat systems get activated while it figures out what’s going on. After a few seconds, once your brain recognizes there is no threat (no sabre-toothed tiger), it returns to normal levels of arousal, bringing your body with it. This happens naturally and quickly, without your having to try.\n\nThe resulting feelings of relaxation not only reduce stress – they also facilitate increased confidence. When your nervous system is in a relaxed state it is more receptive to the true real-life affirmations embedded in the tracks on this app, resulting a more positive self-state. The amazing part is that this all happens as naturally as you might experience the pleasure that comes from watching a sunset or walking on a beach. This effect has been confirmed by research. \n\nBilateral stimulation is a treatment element of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) EMDR, the revolutionary treatment for PTSD. The method seems to resolve trauma-related memories and feelings more rapidly and effectively than traditional methods.\n\nThe app can be used for emotional ‘first-aid’, as an adjunct to psychotherapy and as part of long-term efforts to feel more confident. You can learn to feel different - you know much more than you think."

This app supports all complications and the Apple Watch becomes an absolute fitness gadget.\n\n\nThis is how it works:\nThe Apple Watch can estimate your VO₂ max and records the predicted VO₂ maximum if you take a brisk hike, walk or run outdoors with a continuous heart rate measurement in the Workout app for at least 20 minutes.\n\nImportant:\n1. It has to be a walk or a run to provide enough heart rate data for the prediction algorithm to work.\n2. The workout app must be used with GPS enabled.\n3. This app must be connected to the Apple Health app so that the recorded data can be displayed in the watch app, the complication or on the iPhone.\n\nWith iOS 14, you can display the widget on the home screen of your iPhone to see the latest measurement directly.\nThis app only works with an Apple Watch Series 3 or later!"

Select syringe type, enter syringe volume, units, tick marks, quantity of peptide(s), volume of sterile or bacteriostatic water, and desired dose\n\n• Syringe type selection. Choose between U100 and U40 insulin syringes and PepCalc will automatically set the correct volume, or choose tuberculin (non-insulin) for complete control of the inputs\n\n• Multi-peptide support. Working with a peptide blend? Optionally add additional peptides to a vial and PepCalc will calculate and display the other amounts per dose\n\n• Last input values are remembered so they appear the next time the app is opened. No more unnecessary retyping!\n\n• Dark mode support\n\n• No signup required and no ads!"

At the specified alarm time, the alarm pattern will begin.\n\n+ Choose from five pre-defined patterns with varying bell schedules and escalation lengths.\n\n+ Choose from six different bells of varying size and metal compositions - from bright and clean to deep and complex with lovely overtones.\n\n+ You may enter journal notes upon awakening - great for recording your dreams before the memory fades.  You can then go back and review your journal entries and you may export the journal via email.  For privacy, you may set a password to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n+ To save battery, you may lock your device's screen and the alarm will still work.

The DQS Mobile app was designed to make it as easy as possible to calculate a Diet Quality Score each day.\n\nAs you eat throughout the day, enter the servings of each category of food that you consume. Tap a box to consume one serving of that category, tap it again and it will become a half serving, and one more tap will set it back to zero for that box. You can tap the category name to view an explanation of what foods fall under that category. Your total DQS score for the day is shown in the upper right corner of the page.  DQS data is saved for each day you track it. \n\nYou can also log your weight and body fat % on the bottom of the Tracking page. We recommend you log your weight no more than once per week.\n\nThe Graphs page lets you see how you are doing with your Diet Quality Score over time. You can view your data over the last week, month or year. When viewing yearly data, it is displayed as 52 week-long averages. You can view graphs showing your total DQS, your weight, or your DQS score by specific category.\n\nYou can set a target weight, body fat % and a target DQS score on the Profile page."

The exercises can be done at home, but also while sitting in the train, plane or office. No special knowledge or means are required for the practice.\n\nGive it a try, and you will see how nidra-relax helps you to go through life much more relaxed and capable to enjoy moment by moment. \nAll the exercises are derived from the yoga nidra method and have been conceived and recorded by a professional yoga teacher. \nYoga nidra is a relaxation and meditation method that encompasses all levels of the human being: it releases muscular tensions, as well as mental and emotional. Therefore yoga nidra can be used as an effective method in stress reduction. \n\nYoga nidra is not a physical yoga practice that requires demanding poses. The only thing you have to do, is to lie down as comfortable as possible on your yoga mat, in the bed, (or while sitting in the train or plane) remain in stillness and follow the clear and simple instructions. \n\nThrough the regular practice of yoga nidra the stress hormones are reduced, the regenerative body functions and the immune system are stimulated. It has been tested by physicians and scientist all over the world, who accredited it as an efficient support in the treatment of psychosomatic diseases. Mainly in afflictions such as sleep disturbances, nervousness, heart and stomach diseases, asthma and migraine   Nidra-relax app has been recommended by the german magazine GEO Special Yoga:\n“An authentic deep relaxation as it is practiced in the classical yoga. With different levels. Nice and simple design and description of the effects. Recommended as an anti-stress meditation.”\n\nFor german instructions please have a look at \"Nidra Relax\", the german version of this app."

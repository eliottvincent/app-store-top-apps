It was orchestrated to prove that health was not only for the rich, but for everyone.

To take away the sugar from your diet & to introduce the value of specific Nutrition.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2. To learn about the foods that will enhance your gut health.  This is the section where you will lose the majority of your weight  and within days you will begin to see results.  Your gut will gain strength as you learn to mono-eat and identify the foods that will compliment your gut health. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   3.   Maintenance:  here you are reintroduced to a wider variety of foods that will enable you to live a healthy lifestyle for the rest of your life.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo successfully complete the program you must complete step 3.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThroughout your program you are gifted with support and this App is connected to your own Personal Mentor.   They will guide you daily and make sure that you are accountable on your journey.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe supply you with meal plans and recipes  but for those of you who need certain dietary requirements there are optional swap-outs.  This App allows that to be done easily without any mathematics on your behalf. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe are extremely proud of this App as it has been in the making for several years.  It has been designed to take away the guess work and to support our customers to the best of our ability. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWeight loss is not only a health journey but it is also a mental journey. It is just as important to recognise that your mental health plays a role in weight loss and needs support. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCongratulations on taking the first step of living a healthier life.   By making a difference to your life you will be surprised how it will suddenly make a difference to your whole family. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYour children will see you make healthy choices and your language to them will change.   We all want to be the best example to our little ones. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHealth Wealth and Choice is the mantra that Phatt sings.  We can teach you about health, we can give you a wealth of knowledge but the greatest gift we will give you is choice.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nChoose to live.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGood luck, stay positive and enjoy the change.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt’s your turn to smile"

In addition to the presentations schools receive they have the opportunity to complete a curriculum specifically designed to focus on what you have as opposed to what you don’t have, understanding the benefits of helping others as well as the importance of being healthy and active."

      "label": "If you love working out with Apple Watch, but you need more advanced fitness stats, HealthFit is for you.\n\nBy analyzing the workout data stored in Apple Health, HealthFit provides the kind of indispensable tracking and insights you normally only get from premium subscription services. But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times. You can even log which bike or shoes you use, to monitor usage and flag when it’s time to replace them.\n\nHealthFit finds photos you take during your workouts automatically, bringing your activity feed to life with stunning images you can share on social media.\n\nRUNNING POWER ANALYSIS\n\nHealthFit provides advanced running power analysis with the automatically estimated critical power, the weighted average power, the power distribution chart by 25W Increments and the mean maximal power chart which shows your best average power for time periods of one second up to the length of your run.\n\nMULTISPORT AND INTERVAL WORKOUTS\n\nHealthFit is the only app to export multisport workouts as multisession activities\n\nSTATISTICS: UNCOVER HIDDEN FITNESS INSIGHTS\n\nApple Watch gathers so much fitness data, it can sometimes seem overwhelming. HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio.

      "label": "Buddhify is here to help you bring more calm, clarity and kindness to all parts of your life.\n\nWhether you're looking to reduce stress and anxiety, or get a better night's sleep buddhify has easy-to-follow guided meditations to help you live happier and healthier.\n\nNo need to find the time for a formal meditation session everyday, we'll show you how to bring mindfulness to all parts of your life with exercises for whatever you're doing and wherever you are - from travelling, taking a break at work or going to sleep. We'll help you find calm in any situation.\n\nWHAT'S INCLUDED?\n- Over 200 meditations to help overcome life's challenges including anxiety, stress, sleep, pain and difficult emotions\n- Mindfulness exercises you can do wherever you are, in categories such as travelling, at work, waking up, eating, and even when you're online\n- Sessions for complete beginners and those with more experience, with lengths from 3-40 minutes\n- A solo timer for more seasoned meditators\n- A range of experienced teachers so you can choose the voice and style that's right for you\n- Kids content for the little people in your life\n- Brand new buddhify Membership available as an optional in-app purchase with a range of additional features for those looking to take their meditation practice further\n\nBuddhify integrates with Apple Health so you can track your meditation using the Mindful Minutes category within the Health app.\n\nBUDDHIFY MEMBERSHIP\nFor those of you who want to deepen your practice even further, you can do that through Buddhify Membership. Becoming a Member is optional and gives you access to three amazing features: Together, Formal and the karaoke-style Transmission. Buddhify Membership is an annual subscription and payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. The subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period and your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

      "label": "AutoWake is the first haptic smart alarm for your Watch. \n\nIt can wake you up by tapping you on your wrist using your Watch's haptic engine. You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

      "label": "Anxiety Release shows you how to release anxious thoughts and feelings naturally, by harnessing the power of your brain. It does this by combining guided instructions and focused attention with bilateral brain stimulation. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a revolutionary treatment which is based on the use of sensory stimulation to alter anxiety-provoking memories and responses. Over 30 randomized controlled studies of EMDR attest to the efficacy of this process. \n\nBecause bilateral stimulation appeals to the unconscious, sensing part of the brain, there is no need for effortful thinking or struggling with feelings.  All you have to do is LISTEN and your brain will do the rest! The App consists of;\n1 x brain training session\n2 x guided anxiety management sessions\n1 x pure bilateral stimulation session (audio & visual)\n1 x safe place exercise\nProgress Log function\nPowerful Bls brain visual \nThis App is suitable for both clinicians and clients\n\nCaution: Persons suffering with complex PTSD or mental health problems, multiple psychological trauma or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without medical supervision."

Or perhaps you feel you can’t say no to people who constantly make demands of your time, energy and money?\n\nSometimes people have a poor ability to sense when their gut instinct, intuition, or heart is sending them messages that a decision is not right and they are uncomfortable. These messages are ignored and we ends up doing things, committing to things, or having things done to us that were not ok with – often regretting this in the moment or in hindsight.\n\nWhat's different about this app? Other apps may help after the fact. This app is designed to be used when the pressure is on to help you hear your gut instincts in the moment!\n\nCreated by the author of How to Breakup with Friends and Clinical Neuropsychologist, Dr Hannah Korrel, this app will help you to improve your assertiveness skill and learn to hear when your gut instinct is telling you something is wrong… and actually listen to it!\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Using the decision making function, this will help you to slow down, and not rush into something you’ll regret. This will help you arrive at a decision that’s right for you and change your subsequent action by helping you to properly hear the signals of your gut instinct and intuition – it can be used prior to the trigger, during the triggering event, or after the fact on reflection.\n\n- Specialised meditations are designed heighten our ability to hear own gut instinct/intuition/heart.  Poor assertiveness can mean one’s own wishes are difficult to hear, like whispers. In the face of anxiety and pressure screaming in our minds, it is difficult to hear these whispers. Two minute meditations are designed to assist in the moment during the triggering event. Longer meditations are designed to assist building assertiveness skills over all.\n\n- Useful phrases are also provided to help you feel confident in saying ‘no’ by actually give examples of what to say and how to say it!\n\nDisclaimer: this information is general in nature and not designed for individual advice."

I love this app so glad I found it \nnauf4l: was planning to buy a 100$ jump rope which counts skips as i always do 5k skips a day. So after a month was considering this when i came across this app after installing 5 apps of the same.Glad i paid about 2$ for this as it is totally worth it. \nFrankWurst: Accurate jump counter based solely on Apple Watch. App integrates into My Health and Activity App seamlessly. Great product.\ntafty：I enjoy the skipping experience with this app. And it syncs well with Apple Watch\n\nContact me\nE-mail:89208242@qq.com\nTwitter: @haozes\nTelegram Group: t.me/yaoyaonow  \n\nDesign by Haozes\nThanks for the translation: 橙子、金小粉、孟金羽、蔡沛森、Adgar, Fabio Carrilho, Tomás Feliú Ribeiro, Francesco Tirsi, Leonard Pitt Diehl, Zhimin Yang, Massimiliano Benini,Radu Ionescu,Andrés Leon,Dikran Jessaijan, Krishna"

      "label": "WHAT IS CLOCK YOURSELF? \n\nClock Yourself challenges you to think on your feet.  \n\nIt involves exercise for your body and your brain, at the same time.  \nEvery challenge will stimulate your brain in a different way. \n\nYou don't have to master one challenge before you can explore another challenge.  \n\nSome call this an exercise app. \nSome call this a brain games app.  \nWhy can’t it be both?! \n\n\n \nWHO CAN USE CLOCK YOURSELF? \n\nEveryone! \n\nClock Yourself exercises involve taking one step in all directions on a circle visualised beneath your feet. It’s perfect for exercise at home.  \n\nAthletes often modify Clock Yourself exercises outdoors for sport-specific agility drills, by visualising a much larger circle and running between the coordinates.  \n\nSimilarly, people who are unable to walk can modify Clock Yourself to practise reaching with their arms, or wheelchair agility! \n\nIf you think you’re too slow to use Clock Yourself, you’re probably wrong.  \nIf you think you’re too fit to use Clock Yourself, you’re definitely wrong! \n\n\n\n\nWHY DID WE MAKE CLOCK YOURSELF?\n\nThe Clock Yourself concept originated in neurological rehabilitation. Now anyone can use it to harness their neuroplasticity.  \n\nIt was developed by Australian physiotherapist @MegLowryPT and software developer Dave Wallace. \n\n\n \nWe had 5 goals: \n\n1. Make it fun - Clock Yourself exercises are so entertaining that you’ll show your friends at parties! \n\n2. Make it versatile  - Both the stepping speed and the cognitive complexity are in your control.  \n\n3. Make it evidence based - This is a volitional step training method. Volitional stepping trains faster steps in all directions to improve your chances of catching yourself during a fall.  \n\n4. Make it portable - There is no need to set up mats, wires or sensors. It also works offline. It only requires internet for your initial download from the App Store.  \n\n5. Make it affordable - This is a once off purchase for pocket change. It has no recurring subscriptions and no advertisements.  \n\n\n\nIS CLOCK YOURSELF AVAILABLE IN OTHER LANGUAGES? \n\nYes and no. \n\nAt this stage, all of the buttons and instructions are in English only.  \n\nHowever, if you click the Options button within each challenge (except for the Simple Colours challenge) you can choose to play the audio prompts in six other languages. \n\nMandarin \nJapanese \nFrench  \nGerman \nSpanish \nDutch  \n\nWhat are you waiting for?  Go ahead and Clock Yourself!\n\n“A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new” - Albert Einstein"

I bought a new iPhone to be able to use it. DBT skills are priceless. I had tried every, other DBT and CBT app. This one follows the traditional DBT program exactly, and is the only Diary Card. Before I had this app, I'd seldom fill in my diary card. Now that I have it, I don't have to keep track of paper, and I rarely miss a day. I can fill in my Diary Card discreetly, from anywhere, anytime, and send it directly to my DBT coach. I no longer have to worry about someone coming across my Diary Cards. You can brush up on skills, use it for distress tolerance suggestions, tailor it to your needs, and even journal. I appreciate that I can add personal goals to my diary. Thank you for this app!\" - iTunes US Review\n\n\"***** I am in IRL-DBT and this app is the perfect complement. Oh. I love that the app is so flexible, that you can make it kind of your own, and the layout is so nice, simple, yet beautiful. For me, a true life-saver! Genius! Without a doubt the best app in my IPhone... Get it now!\" - iTunes Sweden Review\n\n\"***** Perfect! Worth the money!\" - iTunes US Review\n\nAs an educated consumer, it's important to know to whom you're listening. DBT Diary Card was created by a Ph.D. psychologist trained directly by Dr. Marsha Linehan and at the Duke University Medical Center; we are experts in DBT, providing consultation to many in our community. And now we're giving it to you!\n\nA DBT app can have 3 parts: \n\n- A reference manual\n- A behavior tracker\n- A skills coach\n\nDBT Diary Card has all 3 of these parts and utilizes the iOS platform in ways that the other apps available don't and can't.\n\n+ PDF generation\n+ Notification Pane support\n+ Password protection\n+ Advanced text editing\n+ Media playback\n\nWhat DBT Diary Card has to offer:\n\n- Skills. LOTS of them. Every DBT skill you've ever heard about in a group is in here. It can be your quick reference to your skills so that you don't have to carry around your book or binder. Every skill is described in readable language to help you understand them easily and it's all just a quick tap away.\n\n- Emotions. All the \"basic\" emotions are presented, again with descriptions and explanations a quick tap away.\n\n- Behaviors. The most troublesome are pre-loaded.\n\n- Coaching. If you know you need to use a skill but can't think of which one or can't remember how to choose, use the app. The coaching can be your virtual therapist. \n\n- Complete customizability. Are you working on something different or do you have a different understanding of a particular skill or emotion? Change it. It's that easy. You are not wedded to the way it's presented in the app. It's all completely customizable.\n\n- 911 skills.  Put your emergency skills a tap away. You can call directly from the app, listen to your distress tolerance music, remember what apps help in the moment. \n\n- Email. You can email your therapist your diary card on a weekly basis automatically, you can do it manually whenever you'd like or you can have the app remind you.\n\n* Telephony features require an iPhone and voice service."

      "label": "WHAT IS BRUXAPP?\nBruxApp is the first globally available, research-based smartphone app dedicated to the study and management of Bruxism and its health consequences.\nDesigned by top international experts in a multi-center Bruxism research project and developed in 25 Research Centres across the world. \n\nWHAT CAN IT DO?\nBruxapp is a simple tool used by dentists and patients for several purposes:\n- To help the assessment  of the presence/absence of bruxism-related activities (i.e., teeth clenching or grinding, jaw clenching) and potential consequences.\n- For rating the severity of bruxism, if present.\n- As a biofeedback-based management tool for bruxism.\n- To increase patients’ awareness of bruxism activities so they can avoid or correct negative habits.\n- To make patients aware of the possible clinical consequences of bruxism and try to prevent them.\n- To promote cutting-edge knowledge about bruxism, based on the latest scientific research.\n\nWHY is BruxApp needed? \nBruxism has been increasing in prevalence over recent years. It encompasses motor activities of the jaw muscles, such as jaw or teeth clenching, and teeth grinding, some of which may be associated with clinical signs and symptoms, like tooth wear, failed dental restorations, complications with implant-supported prosthesis, muscle fatigue and temporomandibular joint pain. A correct diagnosis is therefore fundamental to establishing early prevention and management regimens.\n\nSCIENTIFIC RESEARCH\nStudies with BruxApp have been supervised by experts, as part of an ongoing multicenter research project on bruxism epidemiology and management coordinated by Prof. Daniele Manfredini, University of Siena, Italy.\n\nDEVELOPMENT\nThe app was developed by Goran Djukic, program analyst at the Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Council of Research, University of Pisa, Italy.\nBruxApp is currently available in the following languages: English, Italian, , French, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish, Brazilian, Japanese, Hebrew, Chinese, Arabic, Greek, Polish, Lithuanian, Bosnian, Romanian, Turkish, Norwegian, and Croatian, with another 4 language versions soon to be released. \n\nIMPORTANT STATEMENT\nBruxApp is not a game or gadget.  In order for BruxApp to work correctly and be effective, please dedicate 5 minutes of your time to READING the simple instructions CAREFULLY. \n\nThe full compatibility is guaranteed by iPhone 6 and higher ones and iOS 9.3 and higher ones."

Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

Anyone can use MoodMission, whether you just want a lift in your day or need a bit more help recovering from anxiety or depression.\n\nA randomised controlled trial has shown that MoodMission can improve mental health and wellbeing (Bakker et al., 2019), and two other studies published in scientific journals have provided further support (Bakker & Rickard, 2019; Bakker et al., 2018). Randomised controlled trials are the gold standard of scientific evidence, and very few available mental health apps have RCT support (Firth et al., 2018).\n\nCompleting Missions earns you rewards in the app, motivating you to take steps towards becoming healthier, happier, and more confident. Plus a Mission log helps you track your progress over time.\n\nMoodMission learns which types of Missions work best for you, so the more you use MoodMission the better it gets at tailoring your Mission suggestions.\n\nMoodMission is not a replacement for professional help. If you are experiencing anxiety, depression, or any mental health issue, talk to your GP or contact a psychologist for support."

The shush baby app helps to soothe baby calm and increase the baby sleep timer.\r\n\r\nThe amazing Sound Equalizer allows the app to \"listen\" to your baby crying or not every three minutes and automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby cry volume till baby calms down (so when the baby is wailing, shush is loud; when baby goes quiet, volume settles into a soothing background shush sound to relax baby).\r\n\r\nA newborn sleep magic baby sound machine that works best for a newborn baby to calm down quickly and manage baby sleeping patterns. A sleep aid that creates calming sounds for babies in the form of a shhh sound sleeper that will stop your baby crying, calms down easily, and put baby to sleep. \r\n\r\nThis shhh app calm baby instantly by creating a shusher sound, helping the baby relax in minutes using calming sounds for kids.  This sleepmatic app works like magic for the crying baby and helps parenting so much easier as baby calmer. \r\n\r\nAfter more than two years of testing and research with real moms and real babies, having sudden and long crying baby issues, we came up with the following very valuable feature list of baby soothing sound.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Safe and easy to use baby calming sounds machine. \r\n- Much more effective than simple lullabies or standard white noise.\r\n- Perfectly works for hours in the background and when the phone is locked\r\n- Adjustable Shush baby sound Timer Options (from 15 minutes to 8 hours of continuous shushing!)\r\n- Automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby crying volume.\r\n- Shush sounds played in low light “dark mode” ( night mode) to avoid extra mobile light as baby sleeps.\r\n- Work in other Apps on your Phone while still using the Baby Shusher App.\r\n\r\n*Note: Turn your phone on silent/mute to let the app do its magic.*\r\n \r\n \r\nWhat Real Moms are Saying About the Baby Shusher:\r\n\r\n“I wish I would have known about this sooner.

      "label": "Join world-reknowned teacher Mark Whitwell as he teaches his \"Seven-Minute Wonder\" breathing and movement routine described in his new book The Promise of Love, Sex, and Intimacy, that will help you begin every day refreshed and ready to start living. In The Promise, Mark explains the deep causal connection between the breath and movement, and the cultivation of intimacy. It is an innate feeling that requires no thoughts. When you do this practice, something magical happens. By coordinating the male and female polarities in your breath-the exhalation and inhalation, respectively-you reunite all the natural opposites of life. Life then flows like an elixir between the two, and you will never look back. So when you do your \"Seven-Minute Wonder\" each day, you can relax from the effort of trying to find a relationship. Uniting the male and female within you is a catalyst to spark what life wants for you, a real erotic union in which renewed life comes and fills you up.\n\nModern science concurs with this ancient knowledge. Neuroscientists have discovered that the left and right side of the brain and body contain the male-female polarity, and that merging these polarities in your own system allows you to feel the most powerful union with another. Both partners feel the male-female functions of their own body within and with another. Mark calls it \"strength receiving,\" a profound experience that gives depth and dignity to sex in real life. And it works with same-sex relationships just as it works for opposite-sex relationships, because all intimate relationships are based on the union of polarities. All you need to do is to perform the practice at least once a day for 30 days, and see the results."

This app is great for beginner runners who have never run before or former runners who want to start up again. \n\nThe Run 5k app has been featured on CNN.com, Boston.com’s lifestyle-health section, and in Health Magazine. Get into shape using our 8-week beginner training plan, complete with an animated warmup and cooldown stretching program. This app has voice cues that guide you even when your screen is locked. The app tells you when to run and walk and gives audio cues for distance and pace when you use GPS. You can use this app outside, on a track, or in the gym.\n\nFEATURES\n• Apple Watch app—you can leave your phone at home while you work out with our Watch app, or continue to use our Watch app together with the iPhone app.\n• Speaks pace, distance, intervals, and halfway point. \n• Optionally uses GPS for pace and distance. (You can also use this app on a treadmill or indoor track without GPS.)\n• Animated warmup and cooldown stretching programs with timer and voice cues.\n• Tap out your heart rate on the heart icon.  \n• Supports Bluetooth heart rate monitors.\n• Integrates with the Health app. Set your weight in the Health app to calculate Calories burned, and to save your Active Calories for each workout.\n\nABOUT the WORKOUTS\n• 8-week training program perfect for beginners or former runners.\n• Each workout is about 30 minutes long.\n• Interval training alternates between jogging and walking.\n• Workout intervals gradually become more challenging.\n• 5-minute warmup and 5-minute cooldown, which are skippable.\n• Speaks each jog and walk interval, halfway mark, and 1-minute-left mark.\n• Optionally speaks pace and distance information every 1/2 mile or 1/2 km.\n• Automatically checks off each completed workout and records your date, pace and distance. \n\nAUDIO CUES and NOTIFICATIONS\nIf you’re not getting Notifications in the background, open the Settings app, select Notifications, then scroll down to find Run 5k in the list. Tap on Run 5k and turn on Notification Center, choose an alert style, and turn everything else on (Sound, Badge App Icon, Lock Screen). Check your volume and make sure your ringer switch is not set to silent/vibrate.\n\nHEALTH\nThis app can be integrated with the Health app. Your weight set in the Health app can be used to calculate Calories burned during a workout, and the total Active Calories burned can be saved to Health app after each workout. Sharing this information with the Health app is optional.\n\nGPS and LOCATION\nTo show distance and pace information, Run 10k can use GPS location tracking during a workout. For best results, use this app outside where you can see open sky. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nLegal Disclaimer: This app and any information given by it or by Felt Tip Inc are for educational purposes only.

      "label": "Guided Physio is a mobile application providing physiotherapy management programs for all musculoskeletal conditions. It has been designed by leading orthopaedic surgeons, physiotherapists and chiropractors who work at major teaching hospitals. \n\nPatients can now recover from their musculoskeletal conditions while on the go. This powerful tool is a must for those who lead a busy lifestyle and cannot find time to attend regular physiotherapy sessions. It can also be a very useful tool for those who want to maximise the benefits of their regular physiotherapy sessions. At a cost less than a cup of coffee, everyone can now afford professional physiotherapy advice and care.\n\nPrograms for various conditions are composed of many phases. Within each phase there are several carefully selected exercise videos, each clearly explaining how the exercise is performed.  When a patient can successfully perform an exercise, Guided Physio will guide them to the next exercise until they can complete the whole program in the appropriate amount of time. Depending on the condition, a program can take anywhere from two weeks to six months to complete.\n\nThis unique mobile application will change the way conditions are managed, providing patients with all the information to better manage their conditions with or without the assistance of Healthcare Professionals.\n\nWith Guided Physio, patients can work through predetermined programs for their particular condition at their own pace. We have also built in precautions and recommendations to seek medical advice when patients cannot complete exercises or experience significant pain. \n\nGuided Physio also allows patients to work with the assistance of their physiotherapist and surgeon. These Healthcare Professionals can customise different recovery programs for different patients. These programs are always on their mobile device to be practiced any place, any time. Real time tracking of progress is readily available for both patients and Healthcare Professionals."

Use any of the available, most popular 1 Rep Max formulas to estimate your 1 rep maximum weight and keep a log to see your progress over time.\n\nSimply select a lift type, enter a weight and a number of repetitions (up to 10), and tap the Calculate button to see your 1 Rep Max.\n\nWith My 1 Rep Max Premium, you can create your own custom lifts and use more than 10 repetitions to perform calculations.\n\nA Note About Safety:\nOne rep maximum calculators are used to estimate the maximum amount you can lift. The degree of accuracy can vary significantly depending on your experience with weight training as well as your muscular composition. Most one rep maximum calculators are designed for experienced strength trainers so, if you are inexperienced, you may find your actual one rep maximum is much lower because your body is not accustomed to the stress of lifting heavy weight. Because it can be dangerous to attempt to lift your estimated maximum, always have a spotter with you. Seriously.\n\nMy 1 Rep Max will never bother you to request a rating or review. However,  if you'd like to take the time to rate or review it, you can do so from the Settings screen and that would be swell."

Select style, mode, source and color, and even what the widgets should open when tapping on them. \n\nYou can choose up to 11 different layout styles, from small to medium sized widgets, making the combination you want for your home screen.\n\nThis app uses HeathKit to obtain information about your movement, weight, oxygen levels, blood glucose, sleep and heart beat values, should you consent the app to do so upon launch. \n\nNote: the update frequency of the widgets depend on the iOS itself, not controllable by the app. The operating system will decide how often the widgets need to refresh, but you can force refresh them by entering the Hidgets app once and go back to the home screen.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please contact me at schmitzoide@gmail.com or visit the website https://hidgets.com.\n\nThank you so much for your support! \n\nWith love from Portugal,\nMarcel"

If the CNS Tap Test result is elevated it is suitable for a  maximum effort or a heavy lifting day. If the CNS Tap Test result is lower than average it may indicate CNS fatigue and impending sickness, injury or over-training.\n\nBoth hands should be tested on a regular basis in a consistent environment, typically every morning on waking. The procedure for testing is:\n\n - Rest hand palm down on the heel of the hand on a flat surface\n - Tapping is done with the index (pointing finger), and all other fingers remain on the flat surface\n - The timer starts with the first tap\n - When the timer expires no further taps will be accepted\n - The result can either be saved or discarded.\n\nMultiple samples can be saved per day.\n\nThe resulting data can be graphed, emailed or managed from within CNS Tap Test.\n\nUsing Swift Charts for improved accessibility and legibility."

AudioStep helps you to run consistently by running to the beat of all your music.\n\nAudioStep analyzes your music and adjusts the tempo on the fly. The pitch does not change. No Chipmunks were harmed building this app!\n\nYou select your BPM (beats per minute) and all your music plays at that tempo.\n\nInitially AudioStep was designed to consistently run at 180 steps per minute by matching each step to the beat of the music playing at 180 beats per minute.\nEventually, testers found different use for listening to music at different BPM and so we added a slider where you can set your target BPM going from 120 up to 200 BPM.\n\nStudies have found that running at 180 BPM reduces the risk of injuries. \nWhy? \nThe slower the cadence, the longer you are in the air and the harder you land. Slow turn over means more impact, which causes more injury.\n\nMost non-elite runners maintain a cadence of around 160 steps per minute.\nIncreasing the step count to 180 per minute will reduce your risk of injury. \n\nAs a side effect it also makes you run faster. While there have been no studies identified to prove this, there is a lot of anecdotal evidence available online. \n\n- Normalized volume (all songs use the same perceived volume, no more Taylor Swift being louder than Metallica, they both are now normalized to the same perceived volume)\n- Runkeeper support\n- Bluetooth heart rate monitor support with warnings for high and low heart rates\n- Voice over status updates (distance, time, split pace, average pace, step count). You can set your own update interval as text entry in miles or meters\n- 5 eq presets (import for Equalizer presets is in the works) to make it sound the way you want (bassbooster, treble booster, u-shape, extrabass and flat)\n- Sophisticated Beat Detection library by SampleSumo\n\nRead more about a personal account on how AudioStep was developed on our blog at blog.audioforge.org\n\nAlso please note that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

The app takes care of keeping track of the length of your drive and syncs it as a new activity to your Fitbit® account in the background. The activity overrides any erroneously counted steps and keeps your step-count accurate!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe settings-menu allows you to change the activity type (if you're driving a motorbike or scooter, for example), or define a completely custom activity name (e.g. \"Daily commute\")."

      "label": "Fartlek, which means \"speed play\" in Swedish, is a form of high intensity interval training in which you use the body's energy systems alternating intensities and time durations during the workout.. This puts the body’s energy systems under a acyclic stress, better mimicking sports specific energy demands. \n\nWith the Fartlek Drill App you can train in several modes making each workout different. You can either quickly select a drill based on an intensity level and sport or customize the drill in detail to better suit your training needs.\n\nThe Fartlek App has a “random” mode, in which the engine generates the number of stages, training intensities and durations based on a given sport.  You can also make your own time distribution (percentages) schemes.\n\nYou can configure manually each stage’s training intensity and time durations. You can combine random and manual effects, making this App fairly versatile to adapt to your needs.\n\nUsing the In-App Upgrades you can upgrade the App to include the Training Zones Module. This module allows you to configure a time distribution scheme and save it as a sport, which can be used it in any run as you use the default sports.\n\nThis App is available in a sale bundle with our AeroExaminer App, allowing you about 25% savings when compared to purchasing separately.\n\nFeatures \n\n• Several standard drill versions\n• Quick drill setup\n• Random and structured drill modes\n• Up to 200 allowable stages\n• Select stage training levels from four primary training zones (or paces)\n• Five standard training intensities to distribute the total drill time\n• Set your own time distribution scheme\n• Use the Detailed Setup to customize most drill parameters\n• Save your customized drills\n• Help available for user input parameters\n• Running distance when GPS is available.  \"Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\"\n• Saves data of multiple users. \n• Supports portrait and landscape screen orientation on the \"Run Screen\". \n• Can lock the screen orientation before running. \n• Listen & control music or audio books while running. \n• Detailed drill information with table of contents. \n• Male or female voice guidance. \n• Several types of announcements. \n• Export the user data by e-mail, in sqlite3 and CSV formats. \n• Select metric or US units. \n• Utilities to facilitate reporting problems.\n\nFor more information about the body's energy systems and aerobic and anaerobic fitness, maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max), training concepts and other useful information, please visit the pages in our \"Support\" section of our Website."

      "label": "Low-glycemic diet is a weight loss diet based on the Glycemic index. Glycemic index (or GI) is a measure of glucose level increase from carbohydrate consumption. It shows how fast a food is likely to raise your blood sugar. \n\nThe principle guideline of the low-glycemic diet is to avoid high GI foods. High GI foods stimulates a sudden change in blood sugar levels. This, in turn, leads to fatigue and hunger, as well as undue stress on your body. Too much insulin in your body for a long period of time makes it easier to store fat and harder to burn it. It also may lessen your body’s sensitivity to insulin over time, leading to type 2 diabetes and other illnesses.\n\nLow-glycemic diet can help you to: \n- control your appetite and delay hunger, \n- achieve steady sustainable weight loss or maintain a healthy weight, \n- balance your blood sugar levels, \n- make better cholesterol levels, \n- prevent heart disease, fatty liver and other chronic diseases, \n- prevent insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes. \n\nTo follow a low-glycemic diet is not so difficult as you may think. With the app you don't have to memorize the glycemic index or count grams of carbohydrates in foods. Just enter all the food you ate this day. Each food has its color indicator (high, medium and low GI), so you can always see what foods you should avoid or limit. Using the app, you will be able to easily monitor your diet, looking on it from Glycemic load standpoint. \n\nFeatures: \n- large database of products;\n- search function to find your food items very quickly;\n- \"recently used products\" function to keep your favorite (frequently used) foods in one place for quick access;\n- adding your own products;\n- practical charting functions;\n- support of mealtimes;\n- support of both metric (kg/g, cm) and US (lb/oz, in) systems of measurement;\n- sharing data with the Health app;\n- works without internet connection.\n\nDo you know that you can try the app FOR FREE? This is possible through the web version on the Facebook available by link https://apps.facebook.com/nococalories. Since it requires a flash player, please use your computer."

In addition to the presentations schools receive they have the opportunity to complete a curriculum specifically designed to focus on what you have as opposed to what you don’t have, understanding the benefits of helping others as well as the importance of being healthy and active."

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

You can use this application to aid in the treatment of traumas, process upsetting situations, disturbing thoughts, improve future performance, or simply feel better. Studies done with patients undergoing EMDR while in CAT scans have shown physiological changes in the brain that lead to adaptive changes in thinking and emotional self-regulation.\n\n\"A study comparing the effectiveness of Prozac vs. EMDR showed that EMDR was more successful than Prozac in achieving substantial and sustained reductions in anxiety and depression.\"\n- The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, January 2007"

      "label": "WHAT IS CLOCK YOURSELF? \n\nClock Yourself challenges you to think on your feet.  \n\nIt involves exercise for your body and your brain, at the same time.  \nEvery challenge will stimulate your brain in a different way. \n\nYou don't have to master one challenge before you can explore another challenge.  \n\nSome call this an exercise app. \nSome call this a brain games app.  \nWhy can’t it be both?! \n\n\n \nWHO CAN USE CLOCK YOURSELF? \n\nEveryone! \n\nClock Yourself exercises involve taking one step in all directions on a circle visualised beneath your feet. It’s perfect for exercise at home.  \n\nAthletes often modify Clock Yourself exercises outdoors for sport-specific agility drills, by visualising a much larger circle and running between the coordinates.  \n\nSimilarly, people who are unable to walk can modify Clock Yourself to practise reaching with their arms, or wheelchair agility! \n\nIf you think you’re too slow to use Clock Yourself, you’re probably wrong.  \nIf you think you’re too fit to use Clock Yourself, you’re definitely wrong! \n\n\n\n\nWHY DID WE MAKE CLOCK YOURSELF?\n\nThe Clock Yourself concept originated in neurological rehabilitation. Now anyone can use it to harness their neuroplasticity.  \n\nIt was developed by Australian physiotherapist @MegLowryPT and software developer Dave Wallace. \n\n\n \nWe had 5 goals: \n\n1. Make it fun - Clock Yourself exercises are so entertaining that you’ll show your friends at parties! \n\n2. Make it versatile  - Both the stepping speed and the cognitive complexity are in your control.  \n\n3. Make it evidence based - This is a volitional step training method. Volitional stepping trains faster steps in all directions to improve your chances of catching yourself during a fall.  \n\n4. Make it portable - There is no need to set up mats, wires or sensors. It also works offline. It only requires internet for your initial download from the App Store.  \n\n5. Make it affordable - This is a once off purchase for pocket change. It has no recurring subscriptions and no advertisements.  \n\n\n\nIS CLOCK YOURSELF AVAILABLE IN OTHER LANGUAGES? \n\nYes and no. \n\nAt this stage, all of the buttons and instructions are in English only.  \n\nHowever, if you click the Options button within each challenge (except for the Simple Colours challenge) you can choose to play the audio prompts in six other languages. \n\nMandarin \nJapanese \nFrench  \nGerman \nSpanish \nDutch  \n\nWhat are you waiting for?  Go ahead and Clock Yourself!\n\n“A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new” - Albert Einstein"

      "label": "Anxiety Release shows you how to release anxious thoughts and feelings naturally, by harnessing the power of your brain. It does this by combining guided instructions and focused attention with bilateral brain stimulation. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a revolutionary treatment which is based on the use of sensory stimulation to alter anxiety-provoking memories and responses. Over 30 randomized controlled studies of EMDR attest to the efficacy of this process. \n\nBecause bilateral stimulation appeals to the unconscious, sensing part of the brain, there is no need for effortful thinking or struggling with feelings.  All you have to do is LISTEN and your brain will do the rest! The App consists of;\n1 x brain training session\n2 x guided anxiety management sessions\n1 x pure bilateral stimulation session (audio & visual)\n1 x safe place exercise\nProgress Log function\nPowerful Bls brain visual \nThis App is suitable for both clinicians and clients\n\nCaution: Persons suffering with complex PTSD or mental health problems, multiple psychological trauma or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without medical supervision."

The DQS Mobile app was designed to make it as easy as possible to calculate a Diet Quality Score each day.\n\nAs you eat throughout the day, enter the servings of each category of food that you consume. Tap a box to consume one serving of that category, tap it again and it will become a half serving, and one more tap will set it back to zero for that box. You can tap the category name to view an explanation of what foods fall under that category. Your total DQS score for the day is shown in the upper right corner of the page.  DQS data is saved for each day you track it. \n\nYou can also log your weight and body fat % on the bottom of the Tracking page. We recommend you log your weight no more than once per week.\n\nThe Graphs page lets you see how you are doing with your Diet Quality Score over time. You can view your data over the last week, month or year. When viewing yearly data, it is displayed as 52 week-long averages. You can view graphs showing your total DQS, your weight, or your DQS score by specific category.\n\nYou can set a target weight, body fat % and a target DQS score on the Profile page."

You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

They will be automatically placed in your AM and/or PM routine as recommended.\n\n\n• ADD CUSTOM PRODUCTS\n\nYou can add custom skincare products from other brands by selecting the option in the top-right menu in the Routine section or from the Custom tab in the Products section.\n\n\n• USE YOUR ROUTINE FOR LAYERING ADVICE\n\nThe products are listed in the recommended layering order, along with advice for when and how to use each product.\n\n\n• KEEP TRACK OF USAGE TO AVOID CONFLICTS\n\nEach morning and evening, check each product off your list to keep track of which treatments you have used. This will allow the app to prevent any conflicts by showing you which products should be avoided.\n\n\n• TRACK YOUR SKIN'S PROGRESS\n\nAny time you notice your skin is looking particularly good or bad, you can make a note of it by pressing on the face icon next to the morning or evening routine. You can also add a comment to note down more details for your own record and add photos to track your progress.\n\n\n• ADD PHOTOS\n\nYou can add photos of your skin to your diary tracker and also add photos of custom products.\n\n\n• REMINDERS & TIMERS\n\nYou can set up notifications to remind you about your daily skin regimen. You can also set timers for products which require a specific wait time. Both can be found in the Settings.\n\n\n\n*** Advanced App Customization ***\n\n• RE-ORDER YOUR ROUTINE\n\nIf you don't wish to follow the recommended layering order, you can choose to re-order the products to fully customize your routine by selecting the option from the top right menu (with 3 dots) of the Routine section. You can also change the order of the layer steps, for instance DECIEM recommends oils before moisturizers but some users prefer the other way around.\n\n\n• USE CONFLICTING PRODUCTS\n\nWhen we recommend not using a product due to conflicts with other products or because you've reached the usage limit, you can choose to ignore the warning and use it anyway. You will then have the option to permanently ignore conflicts on that specific product.\n\n\n• SCHEDULE PRODUCTS\n\nYou can choose specific days of the week for a product if you wish. For instance, you may wish to make it so that the \"AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution\" only appears in your routine on Tuesdays and Fridays.\nYou can also choose dates of the month, e.g. the 1st and 15th of every month.\nAnother useful option is to schedule products for every X days, so you could choose every 2 days to alternate.\n\n\n\n*** Recommended for skin concerns... ***\n\n• Dry & Dehydrated Skin: Achieve plump, healthy-looking hydrated skin.\n• Acne-Prone Skin: Reduce inflammation to help support clear skin.\n• Blemishes & Congestion: Reduce inflammation and brighten the skin.\n• Sensitive Skin: Keep your skin moisturized with this gentle routine.\n• Mature Skin & Wrinkles: Promote youthful skin and reduce the signs of aging.\n• Pigmentation Problems: Gently exfoliate and brighten skin tone.\n• Oily Skin: Rebalance your skin for a healthy, fresh look.\n\n\nPlease note, Skincare Routine (previously known as \"Skincare Regimen Organizer\") has no connection with DECIEM, The Ordinary or any other skincare brand."

It encompasses motor activities of the jaw muscles, such as jaw or teeth clenching, and teeth grinding, some of which may be associated with clinical signs and symptoms, like tooth wear, failed dental restorations, complications with implant-supported prosthesis, muscle fatigue and temporomandibular joint pain. A correct diagnosis is therefore fundamental to establishing early prevention and management regimens.\n\nSCIENTIFIC RESEARCH\nStudies with BruxApp have been supervised by experts, as part of an ongoing multicenter research project on bruxism epidemiology and management coordinated by Prof. Daniele Manfredini, University of Siena, Italy.\n\nDEVELOPMENT\nThe app was developed by Goran Djukic, program analyst at the Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Council of Research, University of Pisa, Italy.\nBruxApp is currently available in the following languages: English, Italian, , French, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish, Brazilian, Japanese, Hebrew, Chinese, Arabic, Greek, Polish, Lithuanian, Bosnian, Romanian, Turkish, Norwegian, and Croatian, with another 4 language versions soon to be released. \n\nIMPORTANT STATEMENT\nBruxApp is not a game or gadget.  In order for BruxApp to work correctly and be effective, please dedicate 5 minutes of your time to READING the simple instructions CAREFULLY. \n\nThe full compatibility is guaranteed by iPhone 6 and higher ones and iOS 9.3 and higher ones."

      "label": "“Worked great for his bedtime—the look on his face was so calmed.” Christi (mother of 3 week old)\r\n\r\nThe Baby Shusher is a soothing sounds machine to calm & stop baby crying cycle\r\n\r\nThe Baby Shusher App is a revolutionary new tool for parents that will calm baby easily using soothing sounds. This sleepmatic sounds machine is created using an ancient but doctor-tested and approved technique to help soothe your fussy baby calm with a shusher sound in cradle. \r\n\r\nA simple baby shusher with soothing sounds for baby that works on a single click, making calming sounds like baby lullaby that would work instantly and can be played for hours, recommended by parents, baby photographers, and doctors dealing with babies.\r\n\r\nBy creating calm sounds, safely stop the baby from crying with a rhythmic “shush” sound that engages a baby's natural calming reflex by reminding them of still being in the womb. The shush baby app helps to soothe baby calm and increase the baby sleep timer.\r\n\r\nThe amazing Sound Equalizer allows the app to \"listen\" to your baby crying or not every three minutes and automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby cry volume till baby calms down (so when the baby is wailing, shush is loud; when baby goes quiet, volume settles into a soothing background shush sound to relax baby).\r\n\r\nA newborn sleep magic baby sound machine that works best for a newborn baby to calm down quickly and manage baby sleeping patterns. A sleep aid that creates calming sounds for babies in the form of a shhh sound sleeper that will stop your baby crying, calms down easily, and put baby to sleep. \r\n\r\nThis shhh app calm baby instantly by creating a shusher sound, helping the baby relax in minutes using calming sounds for kids.  This sleepmatic app works like magic for the crying baby and helps parenting so much easier as baby calmer. \r\n\r\nAfter more than two years of testing and research with real moms and real babies, having sudden and long crying baby issues, we came up with the following very valuable feature list of baby soothing sound.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Safe and easy to use baby calming sounds machine. \r\n- Much more effective than simple lullabies or standard white noise.\r\n- Perfectly works for hours in the background and when the phone is locked\r\n- Adjustable Shush baby sound Timer Options (from 15 minutes to 8 hours of continuous shushing!)\r\n- Automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby crying volume.\r\n- Shush sounds played in low light “dark mode” ( night mode) to avoid extra mobile light as baby sleeps.\r\n- Work in other Apps on your Phone while still using the Baby Shusher App.\r\n\r\n*Note: Turn your phone on silent/mute to let the app do its magic.*\r\n \r\n \r\nWhat Real Moms are Saying About the Baby Shusher:\r\n\r\n“I wish I would have known about this sooner. It is truly a miracle for me and baby to have a good night’s rest together!” Mercedes (mother of 3 months old)\r\n\r\n“It is a must try for yourself.” Isabel (mother of 3.5 months old)\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t sure after the 1st time I used it, but it proved to us that it worked better and better thereafter. Loved the product!” Erika (mother of 2 months old)\r\n\r\n“The Baby Shusher works to calm a fussy baby.” Vanessa (mother of 2 week old)\r\n\r\n“When used at the night time, it can greatly help calm your baby long enough to help him with whatever’s upsetting him, or calm him down so he can fall asleep or feed.” Ingrid (mother of 1 week old)\r\n\r\n“Thank you! The three most peaceful nights and days in a while.” Mercedes (mother of 3 month old)\r\n\n\r\nYou can also try our other baby shusher - Sleep Miracle products here: \r\nhttps://babyshusher.com/\r \n\r\nGet this paid baby shusher app now to make your parenting life easier. \r\nWe would appreciate your reviews and rating about our app so we can make it better for you.\r\n\r\nYou can also write to us at app@babyshusher.com"

      "label": "Finally, a world first PMDD Treatment App. Literally millions of women worldwide suffer immensely every month with this debilitating condition. Most can't access effective treatment due to a severe shortfall in clinicians who are knowledgeable in treatment options for PMDD. This app will provide some desperately needed help to women with PMDD, diagnosed or undiagnosed.\n\nSharryn Muir, a clinical psychologist, specialises in treating PMDD. She has expert knowledge based on years of treating this condition and her own lived experience.\n\nThis app essentially replicates what Sharryn does with her clients in therapy sessions.\n\nThe app is composed of valuable insights and knowledge Sharryn has learnt from her personal experience, working with clients and working closely with experts in PMDD including psychiatry, endocrinology and research.\n\nSkills\n\nThe treatment component of the app provides you with 23 ‘Skills’ that are specifically for treating PMDD. The skills include distress tolerance, emotion regulation and mindfulness. They are chosen to address the intense distress and dysregulated mood and behaviour experienced in PMDD.\n\nBefore learning the skills you will identify several ‘target behaviours’. These are behaviours that typically occur for you in the luteal phase of your menstrual cycle that you want to stop. Examples include yelling at others, thought spirals of worthlessness or hopelessness, inappropriate workplace behaviour and creating interpersonal conflict. You’ll learn skills to help you resist engaging in these behaviours.\n\nThe skills teach you to tolerate and regulate the intense emotions rather than regrettably act on them. \n\nMany skills are provided, as each woman finds a particular set of skills personally effective. Some women internalise their intense distress and don't ‘externalise’ with problematic behaviours. These women greatly benefit from distress tolerance skills, finding relief in reducing, calming and tolerating their intensity.\n\nThe skills are drawn from Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) and adapted to the symptoms of PMDD in the luteal phase of a woman's cycle. Typically, Sharryn introduces one or two skills in an in-person therapy session. After learning a skill, you will practice it cycle after cycle until it becomes automatic.\n\nResources\n\nSharryn provides comprehensive information on the current understandings of what causes PMDD, her personal journey and recovery, information to use with partners, and information to give to your medical doctor or therapist.\n\nFive sections\n\nIntroduction\nGetting ready\nMonitoring\nSkills\nResources\n\nBy working through each section in the order they are presented, you will become empowered by understanding what PMDD is and how to manage the symptoms.\n\nThis app is comprehensive - you can benefit quickly, and will continue to learn and benefit over many months. This reflects the typical course of in-person therapy for PMDD.\n\nFeatures\n\n* 23 brief ‘skill’ tutorials delivered as video with accompanying written component.\n* Monitoring sheet with text and video instructions on monitoring the problematic PMDD behaviours you want to change.\n* Sharryn’s personal PMDD journey and recovery.\n* Links to websites for medical treatments.\n* Role play of an introduction to a therapy session.\n* Information on self-administered trauma processing.\n* A letter to your partner. PMDD significantly impacts on partners.\n* Education for partners on PMDD.\n\nApp users can email Sharryn with questions or feedback. Sharryn will deliver responses to frequently asked questions about using the app on her YouTube channel, an additional forum for PMDD support.\n\nSharryn Muir http://www.northernpsychology.org/sharryn-muir"

That you are done drinking! My app does not have a reset button or a way to add a drink. ;-> \n\n2.

Deficiency results in anemia leading to a lack of energy and can damage heart and muscle, and also impairs mental and physical development. It is common among menstruating women, and also among vegetarians and vegans because fish and meat are rich sources of iron.\nThe app will set a default daily iron target for you based on your age, sex, and whether you are pregnant or breastfeeding. You can change this target at any time, for example if you have been advised to restrict iron intake due to hemochromatosis.\nRecord the food and drinks you consume using speech recognition or by favoriting or by keyboard search and use the serving sizes provided, which are mainly those suggested by USDA Food Data Central (you can change to your serving sizes if different at any time).\nWatch your progress towards your target iron intake every day in real-time, view your progress over time on the Month view dashboard, and export your food diaries into a spreadsheet for your own information or to share with healthcare providers.\nThe app is curated and contains 325+ common (mainly healthy) foods and drinks and you can add your own branded and other foods and recipes at any time. This means the app does not require access to the Internet, and does not collect any of your data or required additional payments. \nSynchronize all data in the app with your other First Line Medical Communication Ltd nutrient counter apps on your iPhones and iPads. Apple's HealthKit functionality is integrated in the app's user interface so you can share your data with Apple's Health app\nAlso useful nutritional information via the Info tab.\nThe interface is intuitive to navigate, but it can be useful to familiarise yourself with the full functionality of the app by touching the icons, words, and bars on every screen and swiping the top gray bar left and right on the Tracker screen."

      "label": "“Overcoming pain based on EMDR” was brought to you by Mark Grant, well known Australian psychologist/researcher and writer. Mark is particularly interested in developing resources that sufferers of pain and stress can use to make a real difference in their suffering. He is motivated to do what works best for his clients rather than what the ‘accepted wisdom’ might say. But he maintains a scientific approach and has conducted several studies regarding the efficacy of EMDR as a treatment for chronic pain. \n\n“Overcoming pain based on EMDR” mobile application is using recent discoveries from brain science to alleviate chronic pain and severe stress. \n\nThe application comprises 3 playlists for controlling pain and associated stress that can maintain pain. \n\nEach playlist is designed with different goals in mind. Where the first playlist called “Mental Healing strategies” is aimed to alleviate mild or moderate chronic pain, the second playlist called “Sensory Healing strategies” will help when you are too tired, sore or distressed to employ the pain pathway strategy from the first playlist. And the last playlist called “Stress Management” is focused on reducing your stressful feelings that can maintain and exacerbate chronic pain. \n\nThe playlists are designed to compliment each other; so if your pain is severe using the strategies in “Sensory Healing strategies” should help bring it under control enough for you to benefit from the tracks in “Mental Healing strategies” and listening to the “Stress Management” tracks regularly, when your pain is tolerable, will bring your overall stress levels down and decrease the pain-related activity in your body and your brain. The tracks in “Mental Healing strategies” and “Stress management” can be listened to anywhere anytime, but the tracks in “Sensory Healing strategies” require external materials and preparation.\n\nOne of the key elements of this app is bilateral stimulation (bls), which is derived from EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). In conjunction with focused attention bls uses sensory stimulation to change physical emotional and cognitive processes associated with chronic pain (as well as trauma and stress). \n\nFor best results you should listen to the tracks that incorporate bls with headphones or hear-buds. You can use the app anytime anywhere but a quiet environment when you don’t feel too overwhelmed by stress or physical discomfort is best. \n\nIf you don’t get the response you expect when listening to the tracks never force yourself or get frustrated, just relax and trust that the relief you are seeking will happen sooner or later.\n\nWhile every effort has been made to provide a genuinely useful resource this app should not be considered a substitute for professional advice or treatment. In addition to standard medical care you should at the consider seeking psychotherapy, improving your diet, exercising regularly etc. \nFor curious minds there’s a number of articles presented in the application where you can read more about both EMDR and chronic pain and bilateral stimulation healing effect. \nYou can also read more about chronic pain and how to overcome it from the Mark Grant’s book called “Change Your Brain Change Your Pain” which you can also order by following the link in “Overcoming pain based on EMDR” placed under “Other Resources” section."

At the specified alarm time, the alarm pattern will begin.\n\n+ Choose from five pre-defined patterns with varying bell schedules and escalation lengths.\n\n+ Choose from six different bells of varying size and metal compositions - from bright and clean to deep and complex with lovely overtones.\n\n+ You may enter journal notes upon awakening - great for recording your dreams before the memory fades.  You can then go back and review your journal entries and you may export the journal via email.  For privacy, you may set a password to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n+ To save battery, you may lock your device's screen and the alarm will still work.  Either start the alarm and press the lock (sleep) button, or turn on the \"Auto-Lock\" setting.\n\n+ This app uses the same amazing bell sounds used in our Insight Timer meditation timer.

It has been designed by leading orthopaedic surgeons, physiotherapists and chiropractors who work at major teaching hospitals. \n\nPatients can now recover from their musculoskeletal conditions while on the go. This powerful tool is a must for those who lead a busy lifestyle and cannot find time to attend regular physiotherapy sessions. It can also be a very useful tool for those who want to maximise the benefits of their regular physiotherapy sessions. At a cost less than a cup of coffee, everyone can now afford professional physiotherapy advice and care.\n\nPrograms for various conditions are composed of many phases. Within each phase there are several carefully selected exercise videos, each clearly explaining how the exercise is performed.  When a patient can successfully perform an exercise, Guided Physio will guide them to the next exercise until they can complete the whole program in the appropriate amount of time. Depending on the condition, a program can take anywhere from two weeks to six months to complete.\n\nThis unique mobile application will change the way conditions are managed, providing patients with all the information to better manage their conditions with or without the assistance of Healthcare Professionals.\n\nWith Guided Physio, patients can work through predetermined programs for their particular condition at their own pace. We have also built in precautions and recommendations to seek medical advice when patients cannot complete exercises or experience significant pain. \n\nGuided Physio also allows patients to work with the assistance of their physiotherapist and surgeon. These Healthcare Professionals can customise different recovery programs for different patients. These programs are always on their mobile device to be practiced any place, any time.

I bought a new iPhone to be able to use it. DBT skills are priceless. I had tried every, other DBT and CBT app. This one follows the traditional DBT program exactly, and is the only Diary Card. Before I had this app, I'd seldom fill in my diary card. Now that I have it, I don't have to keep track of paper, and I rarely miss a day. I can fill in my Diary Card discreetly, from anywhere, anytime, and send it directly to my DBT coach. I no longer have to worry about someone coming across my Diary Cards. You can brush up on skills, use it for distress tolerance suggestions, tailor it to your needs, and even journal. I appreciate that I can add personal goals to my diary. Thank you for this app!\" - iTunes US Review\n\n\"***** I am in IRL-DBT and this app is the perfect complement. Oh. I love that the app is so flexible, that you can make it kind of your own, and the layout is so nice, simple, yet beautiful. For me, a true life-saver! Genius! Without a doubt the best app in my IPhone... Get it now!\" - iTunes Sweden Review\n\n\"***** Perfect! Worth the money!\" - iTunes US Review\n\nAs an educated consumer, it's important to know to whom you're listening. DBT Diary Card was created by a Ph.D. psychologist trained directly by Dr. Marsha Linehan and at the Duke University Medical Center; we are experts in DBT, providing consultation to many in our community. And now we're giving it to you!\n\nA DBT app can have 3 parts: \n\n- A reference manual\n- A behavior tracker\n- A skills coach\n\nDBT Diary Card has all 3 of these parts and utilizes the iOS platform in ways that the other apps available don't and can't.\n\n+ PDF generation\n+ Notification Pane support\n+ Password protection\n+ Advanced text editing\n+ Media playback\n\nWhat DBT Diary Card has to offer:\n\n- Skills. LOTS of them. Every DBT skill you've ever heard about in a group is in here. It can be your quick reference to your skills so that you don't have to carry around your book or binder. Every skill is described in readable language to help you understand them easily and it's all just a quick tap away.\n\n- Emotions. All the \"basic\" emotions are presented, again with descriptions and explanations a quick tap away.\n\n- Behaviors. The most troublesome are pre-loaded.\n\n- Coaching. If you know you need to use a skill but can't think of which one or can't remember how to choose, use the app. The coaching can be your virtual therapist. \n\n- Complete customizability. Are you working on something different or do you have a different understanding of a particular skill or emotion? Change it. It's that easy. You are not wedded to the way it's presented in the app. It's all completely customizable.\n\n- 911 skills.  Put your emergency skills a tap away. You can call directly from the app, listen to your distress tolerance music, remember what apps help in the moment. \n\n- Email. You can email your therapist your diary card on a weekly basis automatically, you can do it manually whenever you'd like or you can have the app remind you.\n\n* Telephony features require an iPhone and voice service."

Smolov isn't for new lifters, but if you have some experience under your belt (like with 5/3/1, starting strength, 20 squat, etc.), then this may be a great lifting protocol for you."

The next day, Lil Wayne may take over.  Get a unique, up-beat playlist every time you run.  \n\n** Keep the perfect pace **\n\nPrefer a consistent pace? No problem. You can easily set a pace for yourself.  You can even include a warmup song if you'd like.\n\n** It's YOUR music. **\n\nA run is a terrible time to have to skip through tons of songs you don't like.  Everyone's got their own taste in workout music.  That's why the app plays YOUR music from YOUR iTunes library.\n\n** It's here to help. **\n\nNeed a speed boost while you're running?  Just press the speed buttons in the app.  Cooling down? Press the down arrow.\n\nGot a song that helps get you going?  Set it as a \"Pump Up Song\" and you can play it when you need it the most.\n\n** It's super smart. **\n\nThe app learns which songs you don't like while running & it stops playing them.  Simple as that.\n\nWant more control?  You can also set a blacklist of songs that you don't ever want the jog.fm app to play.\n\nIf you love a song, you can flag it during or after your run and it'll be played more often.\n\n** It plays nice. **\n\nDo you use other fitness apps like RunKeeper or Nike+ (in \"outdoor\" mode)?  Just launch the other fitness app first, then launch jog.fm.  Works like a charm.\n\nIn Nike+, make sure you go to \"Settings\" and be sure to turn off \"Music Tied to Run Controls\"\n\n\n** Please Note **\n\nThe jog.fm app must remain on top with the screen on while running.  \n\nDo not turn your screen off while running.\n\nThis app is not a streaming service.  It plays music from your iTunes library.\n\nThere is a one-time setup that will take about one minute (depending on the size of your library).  The app needs to analyze your songs to figure out which ones to play.  An internet connection (WiFi recommended) is required for this setup step because the app is powered by the Echo Nest.\n\nThis app is not yet compatible with iTunes Match.  It'll work, but you may find some long gaps between songs.  \n\nThis app is for running or walking.  We are working on adding more workouts soon!\n\nPlease do not run or walk in traffic."

Enter Count Sheep - a simple, sleek little sheep counting app that helps anyone young or old, from toddler to senior or in between to fall asleep by using their phone to count some sheep! One by one, the sheep gracefully float over the wooden fence. It sure beats staring at the ceiling.\n\nCount Sheep was designed from the ground up to be easy on the eyes in a dark room and help you catch some z's.\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Night time-friendly graphics with smooth sheep animation\n• Soothing custom-made, seamlessly looped lullaby music\n• Adjustable sheep speed and lullaby volume\n• Your phone's silent/mute switch mutes the lullaby music\n• Won't interrupt music you're already playing\n• Sleep timer that smoothly fades to black\n• Option to disable your device's screen auto-lock\n• Seamless landscape & portrait experience\n• Optional on-screen counter\n• Resumes after interruption\n• Automatically saves your settings\n• Lightweight app size: under 3mb\n\nCount Sheep is super easy to use: start playing your own music through the Music app, select a song in Count Sheep (or turn off music all together). *Important: ensure that your device's mute switch is not on!* If your device is muted, no music will play even if you have a song selected. Then, set your sleep timer (15 minutes by default) and tap \"Start\" to get counting. When the sleep timer is up and you're sound asleep, Count Sheep will fades to a black screen, restoring your auto-lock settings and saving precious battery life.\n\nI welcome any and all feedback. If you have any comments, questions, suggestions, or complaints, please free to drop me a line.\n\nThank you and goodnight!\n\nNote: Count Sheep is intended to be used for entertainment purposes only. If you think you may be suffering from a sleep-related illness, you should consult a medical professional."

IT’S ALOT - I KNOW :)\nAnd that is why I have created the POLE WITH STEPH MONTHLY PROGRAMS. Upon downloading the app, you will have the option to become a premium member to enjoy the benefits of this all - inclusive program for all levels. Every month, you will receive a thorough program, with specific challenges & homework added weekly.\nI make sure to give you instruction in all those things that are important for safe, consistent progress that you not only see but also FEEL!! With the programs, I teach you how to work WITH your body, so you can achieve all your pole & flexibility goals with a body that feels GOOD, balanced, and strong… not one that hurts after being forced into a move it wasn’t ready for.\nAs a member of the program, you will enjoy the following benefits:\n\n1:1 Feedback - you can ask questions and share videos with me, so I can make sure you are getting the most out of the program. There is also a group to share progress and struggles and connect with your fellow members.\n\nDownloadable personal training log to schedule and reflect on your training sessions.\n\n3 Day/ week gym training program\n\nThis program is designed for intermediate and advanced students looking to level up their training. There is a strong emphasis on shoulder health, overall core stability & strength, inversion practice, active leg flexibility, and upper body push/ pull circuits in order to balance and strengthen your body for your pole or aerial training. Each session is 45-75 minutes and is best performed at a gym, however, can be modified for home or pole studio training. These workouts are written by Tiana Nicole Tallant, who has her DPT and has extensive knowledge in anatomy, movement, motor learning & skill development, and programming. I've personally been following her programming since 2019 and it has immensely contributed to my progress!\nSo what are you waiting for?? It’s time to spend LESS time planning and MORE time training and practicing!!\nCONTACT\nInstagram: @stephanietallant_pole\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/StephanieTallant\nWebsite: https://linktr.ee/stephanietallant\nHASHTAG the following to be featured\n#Polewithsteph #Flexwithsteph #Pwsapp #thepoleapp\n\nT&Cs and Privacy Policy can be found at: https://polewithsteph.disciplemedia.com/onboarding_documents"

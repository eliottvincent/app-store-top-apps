In addition to the presentations schools receive they have the opportunity to complete a curriculum specifically designed to focus on what you have as opposed to what you don’t have, understanding the benefits of helping others as well as the importance of being healthy and active."

Or perhaps you feel you can’t say no to people who constantly make demands of your time, energy and money?\n\nSometimes people have a poor ability to sense when their gut instinct, intuition, or heart is sending them messages that a decision is not right and they are uncomfortable. These messages are ignored and we ends up doing things, committing to things, or having things done to us that were not ok with – often regretting this in the moment or in hindsight.\n\nWhat's different about this app? Other apps may help after the fact. This app is designed to be used when the pressure is on to help you hear your gut instincts in the moment!\n\nCreated by the author of How to Breakup with Friends and Clinical Neuropsychologist, Dr Hannah Korrel, this app will help you to improve your assertiveness skill and learn to hear when your gut instinct is telling you something is wrong… and actually listen to it!\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Using the decision making function, this will help you to slow down, and not rush into something you’ll regret. This will help you arrive at a decision that’s right for you and change your subsequent action by helping you to properly hear the signals of your gut instinct and intuition – it can be used prior to the trigger, during the triggering event, or after the fact on reflection.\n\n- Specialised meditations are designed heighten our ability to hear own gut instinct/intuition/heart.  Poor assertiveness can mean one’s own wishes are difficult to hear, like whispers. In the face of anxiety and pressure screaming in our minds, it is difficult to hear these whispers. Two minute meditations are designed to assist in the moment during the triggering event. Longer meditations are designed to assist building assertiveness skills over all.\n\n- Useful phrases are also provided to help you feel confident in saying ‘no’ by actually give examples of what to say and how to say it!\n\nDisclaimer: this information is general in nature and not designed for individual advice."

It’s perfect for exercise at home.  \n\nAthletes often modify Clock Yourself exercises outdoors for sport-specific agility drills, by visualising a much larger circle and running between the coordinates.  \n\nSimilarly, people who are unable to walk can modify Clock Yourself to practise reaching with their arms, or wheelchair agility! \n\nIf you think you’re too slow to use Clock Yourself, you’re probably wrong.  \nIf you think you’re too fit to use Clock Yourself, you’re definitely wrong! \n\n\n\n\nWHY DID WE MAKE CLOCK YOURSELF?\n\nThe Clock Yourself concept originated in neurological rehabilitation. Now anyone can use it to harness their neuroplasticity.  \n\nIt was developed by Australian physiotherapist @MegLowryPT and software developer Dave Wallace. \n\n\n \nWe had 5 goals: \n\n1. Make it fun - Clock Yourself exercises are so entertaining that you’ll show your friends at parties! \n\n2. Make it versatile  - Both the stepping speed and the cognitive complexity are in your control.  \n\n3. Make it evidence based - This is a volitional step training method. Volitional stepping trains faster steps in all directions to improve your chances of catching yourself during a fall.  \n\n4. Make it portable - There is no need to set up mats, wires or sensors. It also works offline. It only requires internet for your initial download from the App Store.  \n\n5. Make it affordable - This is a once off purchase for pocket change. It has no recurring subscriptions and no advertisements.  \n\n\n\nIS CLOCK YOURSELF AVAILABLE IN OTHER LANGUAGES? \n\nYes and no. \n\nAt this stage, all of the buttons and instructions are in English only.  \n\nHowever, if you click the Options button within each challenge (except for the Simple Colours challenge) you can choose to play the audio prompts in six other languages. \n\nMandarin \nJapanese \nFrench  \nGerman \nSpanish \nDutch  \n\nWhat are you waiting for?  Go ahead and Clock Yourself!\n\n“A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new” - Albert Einstein"

It does this by combining guided instructions and focused attention with bilateral brain stimulation. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a revolutionary treatment which is based on the use of sensory stimulation to alter anxiety-provoking memories and responses. Over 30 randomized controlled studies of EMDR attest to the efficacy of this process. \n\nBecause bilateral stimulation appeals to the unconscious, sensing part of the brain, there is no need for effortful thinking or struggling with feelings.  All you have to do is LISTEN and your brain will do the rest! The App consists of;\n1 x brain training session\n2 x guided anxiety management sessions\n1 x pure bilateral stimulation session (audio & visual)\n1 x safe place exercise\nProgress Log function\nPowerful Bls brain visual \nThis App is suitable for both clinicians and clients\n\nCaution: Persons suffering with complex PTSD or mental health problems, multiple psychological trauma or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without medical supervision."

      "label": "“Overcoming pain based on EMDR” was brought to you by Mark Grant, well known Australian psychologist/researcher and writer. Mark is particularly interested in developing resources that sufferers of pain and stress can use to make a real difference in their suffering. He is motivated to do what works best for his clients rather than what the ‘accepted wisdom’ might say. But he maintains a scientific approach and has conducted several studies regarding the efficacy of EMDR as a treatment for chronic pain. \n\n“Overcoming pain based on EMDR” mobile application is using recent discoveries from brain science to alleviate chronic pain and severe stress. \n\nThe application comprises 3 playlists for controlling pain and associated stress that can maintain pain. \n\nEach playlist is designed with different goals in mind. Where the first playlist called “Mental Healing strategies” is aimed to alleviate mild or moderate chronic pain, the second playlist called “Sensory Healing strategies” will help when you are too tired, sore or distressed to employ the pain pathway strategy from the first playlist. And the last playlist called “Stress Management” is focused on reducing your stressful feelings that can maintain and exacerbate chronic pain. \n\nThe playlists are designed to compliment each other; so if your pain is severe using the strategies in “Sensory Healing strategies” should help bring it under control enough for you to benefit from the tracks in “Mental Healing strategies” and listening to the “Stress Management” tracks regularly, when your pain is tolerable, will bring your overall stress levels down and decrease the pain-related activity in your body and your brain. The tracks in “Mental Healing strategies” and “Stress management” can be listened to anywhere anytime, but the tracks in “Sensory Healing strategies” require external materials and preparation.\n\nOne of the key elements of this app is bilateral stimulation (bls), which is derived from EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). In conjunction with focused attention bls uses sensory stimulation to change physical emotional and cognitive processes associated with chronic pain (as well as trauma and stress). \n\nFor best results you should listen to the tracks that incorporate bls with headphones or hear-buds. You can use the app anytime anywhere but a quiet environment when you don’t feel too overwhelmed by stress or physical discomfort is best. \n\nIf you don’t get the response you expect when listening to the tracks never force yourself or get frustrated, just relax and trust that the relief you are seeking will happen sooner or later.\n\nWhile every effort has been made to provide a genuinely useful resource this app should not be considered a substitute for professional advice or treatment. In addition to standard medical care you should at the consider seeking psychotherapy, improving your diet, exercising regularly etc. \nFor curious minds there’s a number of articles presented in the application where you can read more about both EMDR and chronic pain and bilateral stimulation healing effect. \nYou can also read more about chronic pain and how to overcome it from the Mark Grant’s book called “Change Your Brain Change Your Pain” which you can also order by following the link in “Overcoming pain based on EMDR” placed under “Other Resources” section."

      "label": "Our bestselling original 20-Minute nap recording NOW in uncompressed HD Audio and in your pocket!\n\nSince 2001, thousands of people around the world have been benefiting from the instant rest provided by listening to our Power Nap recordings. Just listen to the Power Nap recording through headphones or ear buds and after 20 minutes, you'll feel as though you've had a long nap.\n\nSleep research shows that the natural sleep rhythm is three hours. Wake up after 180 uninterrupted minutes of rest, and you can function effectively. But who has three hours for a nap every day? The rich, retired and unemployed! You can only achieve the first two by avoiding the third. Getting caught asleep on the job or routinely being unable to perform at your best are good ways to get fired. In just one-third of your lunch hour, Power Nap can help you be alert and effective for far more of your waking hours.\n\nMonitoring of EEG activity of subjects using Power Nap showed a reduction in Theta wave activity, a smoothing of Delta wave activity, a balancing of activity in both hemispheres and some increase in Alpha Wave activity. Delta activity was decreased and the waves were smoother with spiking moderated as Theta activity decreased. In other words, Power Nap provides a structure that enables the user to refocus his or her energies and tune out the environment and their own \"brain noise\" and be guided into a deeply relaxed state. If you use Power Nap according to the instructions, you can't help but feel better afterwards!\n\nHow does it work?\nWhen you sleep under normal circumstances, your brain cycles through several different stages of Delta, Theta, Alpha, and Beta sleep waves. You drift from one stage of sleep to another—from deep sleep to dreaming to wakefulness and so on. These waves are inaudible to the human ear. Through advanced mastering technology, Power Nap piggybacks the sleep waves on audible “carrier waves” within the audible range. The result: you get the effect of the natural waves so you can sleep! Listen to the Power Nap recording through headphones. Your brain has no sensory input other than the carrier waves playing through your ears. When you hear more than 60 seconds of a certain frequency, your brain modulates to match it. Listening to the Power Nap recording through stereo headphones for 20 minutes guides your brain through a pattern of deep sleep that would otherwise require three hours!\n\nWho can benefit?\n• Anyone who works long hours and needs a break to re-focus.\n• Students with rigorous schedules or preparing for exams.\n• Busy mothers with young children.\n• Overly ambitious persons who are looking for a few more hours in a day.\n• Individuals who are in professions where their shifts change.\n• People who travel between time zones.\n• Physicians with a rigorous call schedule.\n• Anyone needing a little extra lift from time to time."

      "label": "If you love working out with Apple Watch, but you need more advanced fitness stats, HealthFit is for you.\n\nBy analyzing the workout data stored in Apple Health, HealthFit provides the kind of indispensable tracking and insights you normally only get from premium subscription services. But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times. You can even log which bike or shoes you use, to monitor usage and flag when it’s time to replace them.\n\nHealthFit finds photos you take during your workouts automatically, bringing your activity feed to life with stunning images you can share on social media.\n\nRUNNING POWER ANALYSIS\n\nHealthFit provides advanced running power analysis with the automatically estimated critical power, the weighted average power, the power distribution chart by 25W Increments and the mean maximal power chart which shows your best average power for time periods of one second up to the length of your run.\n\nMULTISPORT AND INTERVAL WORKOUTS\n\nHealthFit is the only app to export multisport workouts as multisession activities\n\nSTATISTICS: UNCOVER HIDDEN FITNESS INSIGHTS\n\nApple Watch gathers so much fitness data, it can sometimes seem overwhelming. HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio.

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

      "label": "Harness your innate survival responses to reverse anxiety and tension and feel more confident, naturally. Based on the popular CD of the same name, Calm and Confident is for anyone who is struggling with too much stress and not enough confidence. As the name suggests, this app is designed to help you feel both calm and confident. The app comprises innovative 10 guided meditations based on trauma therapy principles. Two of the central sessions are the 19 and 27 minute respectively Calm and Confident sessions. These transformative sessions incorporate focused attention, sensory stimulation, relaxation and re-connection with personal resources to change how you feel about yourself. Another session (‘Healing Anxiety’) addresses the role that childhood emotional neglect plays in maintaining anxiety.  Other sessions are designed to stimulate increased self-awareness, emotional regulation and security through various combinations of auditory, visual and mental stimuli.\n\nFeeling calm is essential for health and wellbeing, but without confidence it's just a nice feeling. Confidence is the end-product of feeling calm; it means experiencing yourself as connected, self-aware, energized, whole, and capable. Confidence is feeling okay about your feelings, needs and wants - it’s about feeling able to become the best version of yourself – not necessarily perfect, but the best ‘you’. As Lao Tzu said, ‘Health is the greatest possession. Contentment is the greatest treasure. Confidence is the greatest friend.’ Calm and Confident will help you to find your inner friend.\n\nBased on recent discoveries regarding brain structure and functioning, Calm and Confident uses applied neuroscience to teach you how to communicate more effectively with your nervous system to effect change. The deepest learning comes from experience, activities which stimulate sensory-emotional learning. This is different to  the ‘2+2 = 4’ kind of learning you got in school – it’s the learning that comes from doing something which changes how you feel about yourself – leading to new connections, new neural pathways. This kind of learning takes you from ‘I’m worthless’ to ‘I’m okay’; from ‘I can’t’ to ‘I can.’\n\nThe secret to achieving such confidence (when stress is getting in the way) is focused attention + bilateral stimulation (BLS), a unique combination which stimulates an in-built activation-deactivation circuit in your nervous system. BLS enables you to ‘hijack’ your own fight-flight response and transform anxiety and tension into relaxation and calm, naturally and effortlessly. It does this by harnessing your brain’s innate information processing capabilities. When your brain detects a stimuli such as BLS it‘s threat systems get activated while it figures out what’s going on. After a few seconds, once your brain recognizes there is no threat (no sabre-toothed tiger), it returns to normal levels of arousal, bringing your body with it. This happens naturally and quickly, without your having to try.\n\nThe resulting feelings of relaxation not only reduce stress – they also facilitate increased confidence. When your nervous system is in a relaxed state it is more receptive to the true real-life affirmations embedded in the tracks on this app, resulting a more positive self-state. The amazing part is that this all happens as naturally as you might experience the pleasure that comes from watching a sunset or walking on a beach. This effect has been confirmed by research. \n\nBilateral stimulation is a treatment element of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) EMDR, the revolutionary treatment for PTSD. The method seems to resolve trauma-related memories and feelings more rapidly and effectively than traditional methods.\n\nThe app can be used for emotional ‘first-aid’, as an adjunct to psychotherapy and as part of long-term efforts to feel more confident. You can learn to feel different - you know much more than you think."

The comparison modality includes also Outlier removal\n- Activity tracking: step counter or accelerometer derived motion intensity for user context (step counter only for iPhones 5S)\n- Location tracking, either using GSM/WiFi networks (low battery consumption) or GPS (high accuracy)\n- Configurable time window for features computation (choose between 30 seconds, 1, 2 or 5 minutes)\n- RR-intervals correction can be enabled to prevent ectopic beats or artifacts from affecting HRV features\n- export for Kubios\n- Filters data based on the selected threshold\n- Shows HR in the app icon\n- Data export using iTunes or Dropbox\n- Tested for recordings longer than 24 hours\n\nPlease note that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "WHAT IS BRUXAPP?\nBruxApp is the first globally available, research-based smartphone app dedicated to the study and management of Bruxism and its health consequences.\nDesigned by top international experts in a multi-center Bruxism research project and developed in 25 Research Centres across the world. \n\nWHAT CAN IT DO?\nBruxapp is a simple tool used by dentists and patients for several purposes:\n- To help the assessment  of the presence/absence of bruxism-related activities (i.e., teeth clenching or grinding, jaw clenching) and potential consequences.\n- For rating the severity of bruxism, if present.\n- As a biofeedback-based management tool for bruxism.\n- To increase patients’ awareness of bruxism activities so they can avoid or correct negative habits.\n- To make patients aware of the possible clinical consequences of bruxism and try to prevent them.\n- To promote cutting-edge knowledge about bruxism, based on the latest scientific research.\n\nWHY is BruxApp needed? \nBruxism has been increasing in prevalence over recent years. It encompasses motor activities of the jaw muscles, such as jaw or teeth clenching, and teeth grinding, some of which may be associated with clinical signs and symptoms, like tooth wear, failed dental restorations, complications with implant-supported prosthesis, muscle fatigue and temporomandibular joint pain. A correct diagnosis is therefore fundamental to establishing early prevention and management regimens.\n\nSCIENTIFIC RESEARCH\nStudies with BruxApp have been supervised by experts, as part of an ongoing multicenter research project on bruxism epidemiology and management coordinated by Prof. Daniele Manfredini, University of Siena, Italy.\n\nDEVELOPMENT\nThe app was developed by Goran Djukic, program analyst at the Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Council of Research, University of Pisa, Italy.\nBruxApp is currently available in the following languages: English, Italian, , French, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish, Brazilian, Japanese, Hebrew, Chinese, Arabic, Greek, Polish, Lithuanian, Bosnian, Romanian, Turkish, Norwegian, and Croatian, with another 4 language versions soon to be released. \n\nIMPORTANT STATEMENT\nBruxApp is not a game or gadget.  In order for BruxApp to work correctly and be effective, please dedicate 5 minutes of your time to READING the simple instructions CAREFULLY. \n\nThe full compatibility is guaranteed by iPhone 6 and higher ones and iOS 9.3 and higher ones."

      "label": "Join the hundreds of thousands of runners who have used Run 5k to go from a couch potato to a 5k (3.1 miles) runner. This app is great for beginner runners who have never run before or former runners who want to start up again. \n\nThe Run 5k app has been featured on CNN.com, Boston.com’s lifestyle-health section, and in Health Magazine. Get into shape using our 8-week beginner training plan, complete with an animated warmup and cooldown stretching program. This app has voice cues that guide you even when your screen is locked. The app tells you when to run and walk and gives audio cues for distance and pace when you use GPS. You can use this app outside, on a track, or in the gym.\n\nFEATURES\n• Apple Watch app—you can leave your phone at home while you work out with our Watch app, or continue to use our Watch app together with the iPhone app.\n• Speaks pace, distance, intervals, and halfway point. \n• Optionally uses GPS for pace and distance. (You can also use this app on a treadmill or indoor track without GPS.)\n• Animated warmup and cooldown stretching programs with timer and voice cues.\n• Tap out your heart rate on the heart icon.  \n• Supports Bluetooth heart rate monitors.\n• Integrates with the Health app. Set your weight in the Health app to calculate Calories burned, and to save your Active Calories for each workout.\n\nABOUT the WORKOUTS\n• 8-week training program perfect for beginners or former runners.\n• Each workout is about 30 minutes long.\n• Interval training alternates between jogging and walking.\n• Workout intervals gradually become more challenging.\n• 5-minute warmup and 5-minute cooldown, which are skippable.\n• Speaks each jog and walk interval, halfway mark, and 1-minute-left mark.\n• Optionally speaks pace and distance information every 1/2 mile or 1/2 km.\n• Automatically checks off each completed workout and records your date, pace and distance. \n\nAUDIO CUES and NOTIFICATIONS\nIf you’re not getting Notifications in the background, open the Settings app, select Notifications, then scroll down to find Run 5k in the list. Tap on Run 5k and turn on Notification Center, choose an alert style, and turn everything else on (Sound, Badge App Icon, Lock Screen). Check your volume and make sure your ringer switch is not set to silent/vibrate.\n\nHEALTH\nThis app can be integrated with the Health app. Your weight set in the Health app can be used to calculate Calories burned during a workout, and the total Active Calories burned can be saved to Health app after each workout. Sharing this information with the Health app is optional.\n\nGPS and LOCATION\nTo show distance and pace information, Run 10k can use GPS location tracking during a workout. For best results, use this app outside where you can see open sky. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nLegal Disclaimer: This app and any information given by it or by Felt Tip Inc are for educational purposes only. They are not intended nor implied to be a substitute for professional medical advice.

      "label": "Guided Physio is a mobile application providing physiotherapy management programs for all musculoskeletal conditions. It has been designed by leading orthopaedic surgeons, physiotherapists and chiropractors who work at major teaching hospitals. \n\nPatients can now recover from their musculoskeletal conditions while on the go. This powerful tool is a must for those who lead a busy lifestyle and cannot find time to attend regular physiotherapy sessions. It can also be a very useful tool for those who want to maximise the benefits of their regular physiotherapy sessions. At a cost less than a cup of coffee, everyone can now afford professional physiotherapy advice and care.\n\nPrograms for various conditions are composed of many phases. Within each phase there are several carefully selected exercise videos, each clearly explaining how the exercise is performed.  When a patient can successfully perform an exercise, Guided Physio will guide them to the next exercise until they can complete the whole program in the appropriate amount of time. Depending on the condition, a program can take anywhere from two weeks to six months to complete.\n\nThis unique mobile application will change the way conditions are managed, providing patients with all the information to better manage their conditions with or without the assistance of Healthcare Professionals.\n\nWith Guided Physio, patients can work through predetermined programs for their particular condition at their own pace. We have also built in precautions and recommendations to seek medical advice when patients cannot complete exercises or experience significant pain. \n\nGuided Physio also allows patients to work with the assistance of their physiotherapist and surgeon. These Healthcare Professionals can customise different recovery programs for different patients. These programs are always on their mobile device to be practiced any place, any time. Real time tracking of progress is readily available for both patients and Healthcare Professionals."

      "label": "This application is a sidekick to the beastmaker 1000 and 2000. It has been designed to assist the user into gradually getting stronger on a fingerboard. The app does this by way of prewritten workouts which are often general and aim to improve all trainable grips on the board. Some are specific (2000 series only at the moment) which aim to improve, sloper strength, pocket strength and crimp strength. \n\nThere is also a new custom workout program fully adjustable and includes the 1000,2000 and micros, so if you have your own hang regime and different timings then that is all programmable and can be saved.\n\nBoth the workouts and custom timer now record hang contraction time (time spent actually hanging off the board) We recommend most users get up to around 20:00 minutes on this clock whilst doing their workouts.\n\nOn the Workout screen after you've selected your work out it is now possible to adjust set and hang times. Users who are only finger boarding and are having a rest day prior to and after training may wish to do up to 3 sets and 7 hangs. Other users may prefer to go for 2 sets and 6 hangs, this is what we'd consider an average and more suited to people doing additional types of training.\n\nPlease note the grades for the workouts aren't actually meant to relate to anything other than themselves. E.G. 5c is easier than 6a but harder than 5b. If you find 5a hard on the 1000, use a weight removal technique such as putting one foot on a chair in front of the board or using a pulley with weights on. More advice on this and other things are available in the general advice section on the Workout Ratings page.\n\nTo record your hangs press the record button (red circle icon) whilst resting. The Workout Ratings function is much improved and should now be a really useful training aid which records gradual progress and improvement.\n\nFingerboard gains take time, remember to warm up thoroughly and move on to more difficult hangs at a slightly slower pace than you think you should to give pulleys time to catch up with muscles. For example 10% strength gains over a year is brilliant improvement. 5% is still effective training.\n\nBest of luck with the training, happy hanging and we hope this helps with the motivation."

      "label": "This App is one of a series of six meditation recordings by Glenn Harrold and Ali Calderwood, which are based upon the ancient Solfeggio musical scale. Each note in this scale has specific healing properties and this recording uses the first note, which resonates to a frequency of 396 Hz. This particular frequency works to release deep rooted feelings of guilt and fear and will also work with other similar emotional patterns such as shame, regret, self-doubt and low self-esteem all of which exist within the same vibrational energy. \n\nGlenn Harrold's skilled vocal delivery and guided meditation combined with Ali Calderwood's deep and moving soundscapes tuned to 396 Hz combine to create an amazingly powerful meditation recording that has the potential to clear away blocks on a cellular level. This recording can help you to release hidden layers of guilt, fear, shame and regret that are stored in your cellular memory and energetic fields. This title was created with much care and love and it has the potential to become one of Glenn's most effective recordings from his best-selling hypnosis and meditation series. \n\nThere are two audio tracks in this App, the first has a wake up ending for daytime use, and the second has a go to sleep ending which is ideal for bedtime use. \n\nThis App includes:\n396 Hz Solfeggio Sonic Meditation Audio Track 1 – 34.51 (awake version)\n396 Hz Solfeggio Sonic Meditation Audio Track 2 – 44.11 (sleep version)\nUT 396 Hz Solfeggio Music Only Audio Track – 10.56\n\nSolfeggio Chakra Chart\nGlenn Harrold's Self-Hypnosis e-Book.\nAbout the Ancient Solfeggio Scale and Healing Sounds e-Book\nHow To Use This App e-Book\nAbout The Authors e-Book\n\nAbout the Sounds\nThe music with this series of mediations has been specially crafted and precisely tuned to transmit each of the solfeggio frequencies. By combining these sounds with a guided meditation, you also have the potential to release deep-rooted blockages. These compositions also contain an array of sacred instruments and sounds such as crystal bowls and didgeridoo and sacred chants, which work to further enhance the effects of the Solfeggio tones."

All of this wrapped in brand new, modern user interface that is optimized to help you quickly log your caffeine. The Home Screen shows you daily totals in additional to a graphical overview of the past week. You also have one tap access to favorites, giving you the ultimate way to log your daily coffee or soda.\n\nBut logging all that data is only useful if you can manage it. Your Caffiend Journal is a history of all your intake. This allows you to track your caffeine and hydration intake over days, weeks, months and beyond. If you make a mistake, no problem - easily tap and edit to make adjustments to your caffeine history, all of which is reflected in Apple Health as well.\n\nCaffiend also supports Dark mode, Siri and more. Another important feature - Caffiend does not require a subscription and never will. \n\nOf note - Caffiend for Apple Watch is in the process of being rebuilt, and will return in a future update.\n\nI really hope you enjoy using Caffiend - follow me on Twitter @creative_ave for more. Please leave a review for Caffiend on the App Store and let me know how I'm doing. Caffiend will never pop up and ask you to rate it, but it is appreciated!"

Slow eating facilitates a healthy relationship with food and can ultimately lead to weight loss.\n\nEating slowly has many possible benefits:\n    ● Promotes weight loss by giving your brain more time to receive fullness signals\n    ● Helps you better absorb the nutrients in your food\n    ● Improves digestion\n    ● Makes you feel calmer and more in control\n    ● Increases your enjoyment of food\n\nChoose between three types of timers:\n    ● Bite Timer: Slow down how fast you eat by creating a set pause between each bite.\n    ● Meal Timer: Slow down how fast you eat by defining set eating and break windows during your meal.\n    ● Seconds Timer: Create a mindful pause before you get more. Give yourself time to feel full before deciding you need more.\n\n______________________________________\n\n~ What users are saying about the app ~\n\n\"I’ve never written an app review before, but I need to write one for this app. I got an Apple Watch and was determined to use it to lose weight. Between closing my rings and using this app, I have lost over 25 lbs. Even more important than any one accomplishment: it helped heal my unhealthy relationship with food.\"\n\n\"I eat way too fast. I get hungry and just smash my dinner every day and then often feel bad from over eating. This app is exactly what I was looking for. It’s simple, it’s easy to use, and it works. I love how I don’t have to watch a timer I just wait for the tap on my wrist. I’m already building healthier eating habits by using this app. THANK YOU!!\"\n\n\"Have been trying to slow down and be able to better listen to my fullness cues when I eat! This watch app does the trick!\"\n\n\"I tell anyone who will listen how much I love this app. I have the icon on my watch face and I use it for every meal and snack. So easy to use and it has helped me so much as I’ve been trying to slow down while eating. Another bonus is that the developers are so responsive and helpful! Hands down my favorite app!\"\n\n_______________________________________\n\nStart building a healthier relationship with food today by simply slowing down.\n\nLearn More:\n- https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/eating-slowly-and-weight-loss#thorough-chewing\n- https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/mindful-eating-guide\n\nAvailable on the Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, and Mac."

It was orchestrated to prove that health was not only for the rich, but for everyone. No matter where you come from we are a home for you. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Phatt program teaches you about you, your gut , your health and how to maintain a healthy lifestyle for the rest of your life. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhatt consists of three main steps : \r\n\r\n1. To take away the sugar from your diet & to introduce the value of specific Nutrition.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2. To learn about the foods that will enhance your gut health.  This is the section where you will lose the majority of your weight  and within days you will begin to see results.  Your gut will gain strength as you learn to mono-eat and identify the foods that will compliment your gut health. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   3.   Maintenance:  here you are reintroduced to a wider variety of foods that will enable you to live a healthy lifestyle for the rest of your life.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo successfully complete the program you must complete step 3.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThroughout your program you are gifted with support and this App is connected to your own Personal Mentor.   They will guide you daily and make sure that you are accountable on your journey.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe supply you with meal plans and recipes  but for those of you who need certain dietary requirements there are optional swap-outs.  This App allows that to be done easily without any mathematics on your behalf. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe are extremely proud of this App as it has been in the making for several years.  It has been designed to take away the guess work and to support our customers to the best of our ability. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWeight loss is not only a health journey but it is also a mental journey. It is just as important to recognise that your mental health plays a role in weight loss and needs support. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCongratulations on taking the first step of living a healthier life.   By making a difference to your life you will be surprised how it will suddenly make a difference to your whole family. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYour children will see you make healthy choices and your language to them will change.   We all want to be the best example to our little ones. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHealth Wealth and Choice is the mantra that Phatt sings.  We can teach you about health, we can give you a wealth of knowledge but the greatest gift we will give you is choice.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nChoose to live.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGood luck, stay positive and enjoy the change.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt’s your turn to smile"

Anyone can use MoodMission, whether you just want a lift in your day or need a bit more help recovering from anxiety or depression.\n\nA randomised controlled trial has shown that MoodMission can improve mental health and wellbeing (Bakker et al., 2019), and two other studies published in scientific journals have provided further support (Bakker & Rickard, 2019; Bakker et al., 2018). Randomised controlled trials are the gold standard of scientific evidence, and very few available mental health apps have RCT support (Firth et al., 2018).\n\nCompleting Missions earns you rewards in the app, motivating you to take steps towards becoming healthier, happier, and more confident. Plus a Mission log helps you track your progress over time.\n\nMoodMission learns which types of Missions work best for you, so the more you use MoodMission the better it gets at tailoring your Mission suggestions.\n\nMoodMission is not a replacement for professional help. If you are experiencing anxiety, depression, or any mental health issue, talk to your GP or contact a psychologist for support."

It is based on bilateral stimulation (a way of stimulating the brain one side at a time) and EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). These techniques can produce a direct effect on the way the brain processes or re-processes past emotional experiences. You can use this application to aid in the treatment of traumas, process upsetting situations, disturbing thoughts, improve future performance, or simply feel better. Studies done with patients undergoing EMDR while in CAT scans have shown physiological changes in the brain that lead to adaptive changes in thinking and emotional self-regulation.\n\n\"A study comparing the effectiveness of Prozac vs. EMDR showed that EMDR was more successful than Prozac in achieving substantial and sustained reductions in anxiety and depression.\"\n- The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, January 2007"

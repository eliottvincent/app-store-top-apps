When a response is detected by the app the words will show visually in the text box along with audible speech.\n\nWhen you have finished your session just click stop. You can also look back at the responses you received during your session by clicking on the folder button (this only works when the scanner is \"Stopped\").\n\nThe EMF Meter only works if your device has a Magnetometer Sensor. If not then the EMF Meter won't be displayed. Please check the compatibility of your phone / tablet.\n\n** Disclaimer **\nUse at your own risk.

      "label": "The B-hyve Pro App provides landscape irrigation professionals with an easy way to manage and operate B-hyve Pro controllers from anywhere with the convenience of a smart phone or tablet.  With the intuitive layout and design of the app, it is fast and easy to connect to any B-hyve Pro controller through WiFi or, if WiFi is not available, directly through Bluetooth right at the timer location.  Once connected to WiFi, B-hyve can be set up in smart mode to assist in delivering the right amount of water to plants, saving clients water and money.\nThis is the companion App for award-winning B-hyve Pro irrigation controllers. Homeowners can download the non-Pro version of the B-hyve App at no charge.\n\n***KEY FEATURES***\nWIFI and BLUETOOTH – Because WiFi is not always available on a job site, the B-hyve app and controller allow you to set up and operate the controller using Bluetooth. Once a WiFi connection is established at a site, the owner of the WiFi router can provide a permission code that enables off-site management of the controller from anywhere in the world.\n\nEPA- AND SWAT-CERTIFIED – Having passed the rigorous EPA WaterSense and SWAT certifications, the B-hyve Pro Controller with Smart Watering is certified to use water more efficiently and is eligible for rebates in many cities or water districts across the country.\n\nFLEXIBLE SCHEDULING – You can set the controller to water in two basic ways: 1) on a fixed schedule, such as during a new landscape grow-in period; 2) with Smart Watering, and let local weather conditions determine the schedule.\n\nMULTI-SITE MANAGEMENT – You can manage and control an unlimited number of B-hyve controllers from the convenience of one application.  Once the timer is connected to the Internet, secure access can be shared in a number of different combinations using an app-generated code.\n\nCATCH CUPS – With various water savings options integrated right into the app, there are multiple ways to achieve optimum water savings with the B-hyve Pro Timer.  In addition to Smart Watering, it incorporates the award-winning catch-cup feature right into the app to deliver up to 25% more water savings over other smart controllers.\n\nALEXA – Works with Alexa.

While our users contribute locations of their own, we comb the internet for pre-existing knowledge, seeking to unite the efforts of foragers, foresters, and freegans everywhere. Imported datasets range from small neighborhood foraging maps to vast professionally-compiled tree inventories. So far, this amounts to over 1,200 different edible types (most, but not all, plant species) distributed over nearly one million locations. Beyond the cultivated and commonplace to long-forgotten native plants and the exotic flavors of foreign plants, foraging in your neighborhood is a journey through time and across cultures.\n\nFalling Fruit is not associated with Fallen Fruit.

It is possible to catalyze the transformation of ordinary understanding into Diamond Mind with them. \n\nThe text is configured as an oracular text, just like the I Ching, to facilitate concentration upon a particular teaching with respect to a specific question. It centers primarily around wei wu wei, the ancient Taoist notion that translates roughly to “doing not-doing”. By whatever name or not-name, this practice is the core teaching of every enlightenment tradition in the world. \n\nThis free app includes a consulting tool, a journaling tool, and the complete odd-numbered passages.  Full book content is available through an In-App Purchase.\n\nThe teachings of the Wei wu Wei Ching are sourced in Tao, Ch’an, Zen, Sufism, Native American spirituality, Tibetan Buddhism, Advaita, yoga, and other traditions less easily named. Whichever the source, they transmit the heart and soul of enlightened living."

      "label": "Break-ups suck, but you needn’t suck at break-ups. Break-Up Boss offers advice and techniques to help the broken-hearted process their hurt, heal, and ultimately, see their break-up as the gift it is. Become the boss of your break-up. Own it.\n \nCreated by the author of Textbook Romance, and long-time relationship columnist at Cosmopolitan, Zoë Foster Blake, and with illustrations by Mari Andrew, Break-Up Boss is a modern, meaningful, big-hearted tool for the broken-hearted.\n \nHow does it differ from other break-up tools? Because Break-Up Boss firmly places YOU in charge of your break-up. Because you ARE in charge of it! And only you are. Stop letting your heartache and your ex take over your life, your diet, your social life, your job and personality, and start seeing your circumstances as an opportunity for growth. Break-ups happen cos something was broken. So fix yourself, love yourself, and move forward. \n\nBreak-Up Boss is the size of a self-help book, but WAY easier to use and digest. (A boss works smart, not hard, after all.) It reveals a no BS, non-waffly, non-naff, real-life strip down of the modern break-up, and enthusiastically encourages an empowered, big-picture, positive view of how to deal with one. \n\nFeatures include:\n\n- Use the Feel Wheel to read the exact advice you need at the exact time you need it…. because no two break-ups follow the same time line or even a reliable pattern, after all. (Are you about to see your ex at a wedding? Are you drunk and about to send them a text? Are you miserable and wanting to get back with them? We’ve got you!)\n\n- Send a fake text to your ex, so you don’t send an ACTUAL text to them, and screw everything up (or your ex)\n\n- Recieve daily pep-peps direct to your phone, so you’ve got some sunshine, power and perspective in your pocket at all times\n\n- SOS quotes that give you the exact advice, just as you need it. Like Goddess cards, only less… Goddessy.\n\nBreak-ups are a normal, inevitable part of life. And yet we are so bad at them.

      "label": "Ravit is a fun app that enables you to discover inspirational patterns and yarns, update your projects and stash and browse and post to Ravelry forums from anywhere. It's super quick, and it's friendly. Ravelry on mobile has never been easier.\n\nFIND INSPIRATIONAL PATTERNS\nIf you’re not sure what you’d like to make next, Ravit lets you easily browse patterns, favorite them, download and view pattern PDFs, view project photos and browse a designer’s other patterns and pattern suggestions. \n\nAnd if you want to narrow your search, choose from dozens of filters including craft, availability, category, attributes, needles, weight and more. You can even combine multiple options with AND, NOT or OR. It's powerful, but easy.\n\nThere's so many beautiful patterns on Ravelry, and Ravit helps you find them easily.\n\nTAKE RAVELRY TO YOUR YARN STORE\nFind out which yarns you’ll need for a project. Check what yardage you need. Look in your stash to see if you’ve already got a yarn, or one that’s similar. And because Ravit is designed to work nicely on your iPhone or iPad with readable text and buttons you can tap, you won't be squinting as you find all the info you need when you're at your LYS.\n\n+ Search all yarns by keyword, filter by fiber, weight, attributes and many others, and sort by options including 'Most projects' and 'Highest rating'. Quickly view pattern suggestions and projects for a yarn.\n\n+ Access your stash offline. No wireless or cell signal in your yarn store? No problem! Your stash is cached on your device so you can search, sort and view your stash offline.\n\nSNAP, EDIT AND UPLOAD ON THE SPOT\nPerhaps you're making a project on the train to work, or relaxed on the couch at home - whenever you are inspired to share your WIPs, Ravit makes it easy to snap photos, enhance with powerful photo filters, and upload to Ravelry, all from the one app.\n\n+ Powerful Photo Editing Tools - enhance, crop, and adjust your photos before your upload and show your work in it's best possible light. You can remove blemishes, improve color balance, sharpen images and access many other pro editing tools all from within the app.\n\n+ Optimized for Ravelry - before images are uploaded, they're resized optimally for Ravelry, so you'll upload smaller photos (up to 10x smaller!) more quickly and using less data.\n\n+ More than just photos - you can update notes for your Projects, Queued Projects and Stash, as well as most of the other info such as yarns, yardage, skeins, colorways, and color for your stash, and progress, link to stash, rating, craft, and tags amongst others for your projects.\n\nIT'S ALL THE LITTLE THINGS...\nSo why use Ravit? It's all the the little, sometimes hidden touches which make Ravit shine. Here's a few of them.\n\n+ It's quick - if you tap on something, you go right there. \n\n+ Infinite scroll - smooth, continuous scrolling as you browse to find inspiration.\n\n+ Offline - whether you're commuting underground, or you're off-grid, Ravit lets you access your Projects and Stash offline.\n\n+ Clean, uncluttered interface - we want your work and the beauty of Ravelry.com to shine. \n\n+ Use up to 50%* less data in Ravit compared with your web browser. \n\n+ Squint less - The text in Ravit isn't made super small, and we're fully Dynamic Type compatible, so if you change the font size on your device, it'll change in Ravit.\n\n* Based on tests of browsing patterns, projects, stash and yarns on Ravit and Safari on the same device - YYMV! (Your Yardage May Vary)\n\nTHIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING\nRavit has many features already, but we are constantly enhancing and adding more features. We have an active group on Ravelry and we'd love to hear what you'd like to see next - join in the discussion at http://www.ravelry.com/groups/ravit\n\nRavit is not affiliated with ravelry.com. It is an independent app, developed by a husband and wife team. You can read more about why we made Ravit at http://www.enhancient.com/ravit\n\nDownload Ravit now and hop on to Ravelry."

With its large, highly visible font, you can check the time even from a distance. Also, in everyday life and at work, its modest matt black presence does not distract you or disrupt your productivity, even when using the app for extended periods of time. Its full-screen appearance integrates with the iPhone/iPad device body and blends into your living space ambience, as if it were a minimalist home decor item.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Switch between 12/24 hour clock\n- Switch between portrait and landscape mode\n- Option to show seconds when tapping screen\n- Brightness/dimness control inside the app\n- Show/hide background tiles\n- Enlarge/reduce to any size\n\nNOTES:\n- Your device’s Auto-Lock is disabled while this clock is active in the foreground.\n- This app does not start automatically like the Mac screensaver.\n- You cannot replace your device’s Lock Screen with this clock."

Delicious. \n\n5 Star - Fantastic!! \n(UK iTunes review)\nI didn't think that this application would be up to the same standard set by the book (which is THE definitive cocktail bible), but I couldn't have been more wrong! It's every bit as informative as the book, and the fact that it's interactive - it lists the cocktails that you can make from the drinks in your cabinet - makes it even easier to use. And at the price of half a pint of beer, it's astonishingly under-priced for such a brilliant application.\n\n5 Star - Marvelous \n(UK iTunes review)\nLooks as good as the books, fits in the pocket......."

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

Other features like \"Full Athan\" and \"Custom Athan\" are supported only when the app is ope. This is because of technical limitations. We will try to fix it once iOS system allows it.\n\nNote about Athan :\n-----------------\nSalatuk remind you that it's time for prayer with a \"4 takbeerats\" instead of full Athan. Because of technical limitations, it's possible to play full Athan only if the app is open. \n\nAlso, if you have problems to hear the notifications, please make sure to enable the following parameters in your device :\n\n1) Settings>Sounds>Alerts \n2) Settings>Notifications>Salatuk \n3) Your phone is not on mute and volume is correct\n\nNote about Prayers times :\n-----------------------------------\nPlease note that we pay attention to ensure that the prayer times of Salatuk are accurate. However, in some countries those times may be not exact. In this case, please refer to the official islamic institutions or mosques in your country and adjust manually the prayer times in the application settings.\n\nSalatuk supports currently 3 languages : Arabic, English and French.\n\nTips for a better usage\n-----------------------------\n\n1- In order to refresh the prayer alarms, make sure to open the application once a week. Please do so also when you change your location or timing (summer time).\n\n2- The prayer alarms corresponds to 2 or 4 Takbeerats.

The calendar function is a handy tool for planning ahead and finding the perfect timing for activities in the areas of health, nutrition and diet, hygiene, construction, household work and gardening. \n\nThe Lunar Guide is of even greater practical use than a horoscope. There is also an option to create graphic displays of different people's biorhythms and to carry out partner rhythm comparisons."

      "label": "Frisky Foreplay is an exciting dice game for intimate lovers. It challenges you to perform erotic activities based on what you roll. Play together through an arousing sequence of foreplay activities that intensify toward a wild, explosive climax. The game encourages you to sample various types and intensities of stimulation for a total sensual experience. The fun comes in how well you perform the foreplay challenges and how far you're willing to go as you both explore your sexual comfort zones.\n\nYou take turns rolling three dice (colored red, white and blue) and performing an activity. The ordered combination of dice maps to one of the hundreds of unique, gender specific foreplay ideas to enjoy. The red die indicates the intensity level and the white/blue combination points to one of 36 sexy activities in each level.\n\nNEW: Up to four players can now be set up in the game in any gender combination. Foreplay ideas include custom sets for threesome, gay, lesbian, and bi-sexual players.\n\nOf course, you don't just jump straight to the hard core, kinky stuff right away (unless you really, really want to). There are six progressively more intense levels of pleasuring to play through:\n\n - Warm and Loving\n - Sensual Sensations\n - Intimate Intentions\n - Explicit, Erotic Passion\n - Sizzling, Sexual Stimulation\n - Wild, Nasty, Kinky, Taboo\n\nAdvance through the levels when you roll a triple or when you've reached the turn limit. After each level change, you both strip an item of clothing and get ready for even more fun.\n\nBefore you begin, mentally prepare yourself and each other for a fun sensual experience. Give yourself time to savor every pleasure filled minute of your adult play. This sexy game is about exploring and enjoying sensual intimacy together. Although great sex is the goal, you're sure to get lucky with every roll of the dice.\n\nWhen you just want a few ideas to spice up your bedroom play, use the Random Foreplay Idea generator to quickly inspire a few new activities to enjoy. You can also use Frisky Foreplay with other regular games and turn them into your own sexy games for two.\n\nNote: Content presented in the Frisky Foreplay Game is of a sexual nature with intentionally suggestive themes appropriate for adult couples. The application is intended for intimate, loving couples who want to enhance their relationship. It contains textual information only with no nudity. You must be of legal age in your region to use this application and view the sexual material it contains. The full Disclaimer and Terms of Use can be found on our support website.\n\nAlways use safer sex practices and common sense when performing or engaging in any sexual activity. The sample activities in the game are designed for couples in a monogamous sexual relationship. All the foreplay and sex play ideas are intended to inspire your own erotic creativity so you can enhance your relationship with more pleasure and intimacy. They are only sexy suggestions for you to adapt and perform at your own risk and discretion."

      "label": "Pleasure Machine is a simple erotic game for couples with slot machine interface, and is ideal for heating up your foreplay.\n \nThe erotic slot machine features three rotating reels with displayed parts of the human body, erotic activities and time limits. By starting the slot machine, the first partner sets all three reels in motion. After the reels come to a halt, he/she can already look forward to the sweet prize - a random erotic experience being the combination of the activity, at which bodypart to be performed, and for how long. The partners take turns and so after the activity is over the other partner pushes the SPIN button and awaits his/her erotic price.\n \nBut be careful, because it is not always clear who is going to please whom. Each turn is a thrilling experience right to the last moment thanks to the negative time values on the time limit reel. When the negative time limit appears, the partner who spun the reels will treat his/her partner.\n \nIn this game, you can either use the provided slot machines or create your own. You can change the slot machines during the game to accommodate your taste for the softer or more daring tasks.   \n \nFor the quick start, there are five predefined erotic slot machines available, carefully created to avoid unreal combinations. You can adjust each slot machine to suit your preferences, and also to create your own.  There are many possibilities to think of and it’s up to you and your imagination which stimulating combinations you will create.\n \nThis erotic game is suitable for all couples regardless of their sexual orientation. Thus, each couple can spice-up their love life.  \n \nPleasure Machine is a game with erotic content and is for adults only. PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL IF YOU’RE UNDER 18.\n\nGame is also translated in Slovak, Czech and Polish language. You can set those languages directly in the game global settings."

With six children between them they have first-hand experience of the power that self-hypnosis and positive affirmations have on pregnancy and birth. They believe that women deserve positive, empowered birth experiences and have created this app to equip them with the skills to achieve this. The effectiveness of hypnosis and relaxation on positive birth outcomes (shorter labour, lower rates of medical intervention, less medication use) is well documented in a number of research studies. \n\niHypnobirth teaches you that birth does not have to be full of fear, instead it will equip you with tools that can create a positive birthing experience, helping you to prepare both physically and emotionally.\n\nBy listening to the relaxation and positive affirmations regularly during pregnancy, this app will enable you to practice deep relaxation, effective breathing and positive visualisations to help you to have a calm, controlled, and empowered birth experience. If you learn to condition your body now it will be much easier to slip into a relaxed state during your labour and birth - and even after your baby is born these techniques will serve you well.\n\nBenefits of using hypnotherapy for birth \n\n-Positive approach birth\n-Calmer pregnancy\n-Creates feeling of empowerment \n-Reduce anxiety \n-Helps bonding with baby  \n-Reduces labour pains* \n-Shorter labour* \n-Less likely to have c-section* \n-Less likely to have pain relief* \n\n\n* Statistics from the American HypnoBirthing Institute 2008"

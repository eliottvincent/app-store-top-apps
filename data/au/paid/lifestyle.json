      "label": "Break-ups suck, but you needn’t suck at break-ups. Break-Up Boss offers advice and techniques to help the broken-hearted process their hurt, heal, and ultimately, see their break-up as the gift it is. Become the boss of your break-up. Own it.\n \nCreated by the author of Textbook Romance, and long-time relationship columnist at Cosmopolitan, Zoë Foster Blake, and with illustrations by Mari Andrew, Break-Up Boss is a modern, meaningful, big-hearted tool for the broken-hearted.\n \nHow does it differ from other break-up tools? Because Break-Up Boss firmly places YOU in charge of your break-up. Because you ARE in charge of it! And only you are. Stop letting your heartache and your ex take over your life, your diet, your social life, your job and personality, and start seeing your circumstances as an opportunity for growth. Break-ups happen cos something was broken. So fix yourself, love yourself, and move forward. \n\nBreak-Up Boss is the size of a self-help book, but WAY easier to use and digest. (A boss works smart, not hard, after all.) It reveals a no BS, non-waffly, non-naff, real-life strip down of the modern break-up, and enthusiastically encourages an empowered, big-picture, positive view of how to deal with one. \n\nFeatures include:\n\n- Use the Feel Wheel to read the exact advice you need at the exact time you need it…. because no two break-ups follow the same time line or even a reliable pattern, after all. (Are you about to see your ex at a wedding? Are you drunk and about to send them a text? Are you miserable and wanting to get back with them? We’ve got you!)\n\n- Send a fake text to your ex, so you don’t send an ACTUAL text to them, and screw everything up (or your ex)\n\n- Recieve daily pep-peps direct to your phone, so you’ve got some sunshine, power and perspective in your pocket at all times\n\n- SOS quotes that give you the exact advice, just as you need it. Like Goddess cards, only less… Goddessy.\n\nBreak-ups are a normal, inevitable part of life. And yet we are so bad at them. We let them completely hijack our lives, even though they force us to watch rubbish movies, and cry a lot, and forgo sleep, and eat rubbish.\n\nWell no more. Because now you can own your break-up like a boss. And you really, really should.\n\nBreak-Up Boss is proud to donate 10% of every sale to Safe Steps, a family violence response centre in Victoria, Australia.\n\n\"I just broke up with my boyfriend like literally 30 minutes ago and I'm already laughing. Thank you! I am looking forward to going through the shitty range of feelings with this baby beside me!\" - Sandy\n\n\"I love the app! It's so great to feel loved and supported and not feel like you are over relying on friends (who have their own lives of course).\" - Madison, VIC"

With the intuitive layout and design of the app, it is fast and easy to connect to any B-hyve Pro controller through WiFi or, if WiFi is not available, directly through Bluetooth right at the timer location.  Once connected to WiFi, B-hyve can be set up in smart mode to assist in delivering the right amount of water to plants, saving clients water and money.\nThis is the companion App for award-winning B-hyve Pro irrigation controllers. Homeowners can download the non-Pro version of the B-hyve App at no charge.\n\n***KEY FEATURES***\nWIFI and BLUETOOTH – Because WiFi is not always available on a job site, the B-hyve app and controller allow you to set up and operate the controller using Bluetooth. Once a WiFi connection is established at a site, the owner of the WiFi router can provide a permission code that enables off-site management of the controller from anywhere in the world.\n\nEPA- AND SWAT-CERTIFIED – Having passed the rigorous EPA WaterSense and SWAT certifications, the B-hyve Pro Controller with Smart Watering is certified to use water more efficiently and is eligible for rebates in many cities or water districts across the country.\n\nFLEXIBLE SCHEDULING – You can set the controller to water in two basic ways: 1) on a fixed schedule, such as during a new landscape grow-in period; 2) with Smart Watering, and let local weather conditions determine the schedule.\n\nMULTI-SITE MANAGEMENT – You can manage and control an unlimited number of B-hyve controllers from the convenience of one application.  Once the timer is connected to the Internet, secure access can be shared in a number of different combinations using an app-generated code.\n\nCATCH CUPS – With various water savings options integrated right into the app, there are multiple ways to achieve optimum water savings with the B-hyve Pro Timer.  In addition to Smart Watering, it incorporates the award-winning catch-cup feature right into the app to deliver up to 25% more water savings over other smart controllers.\n\nALEXA – Works with Alexa.

Purchasing the app is itself a tax deductible donation, and we greatly appreciate your support in keeping Falling Fruit online!\n\nOur global map of edible plants is not the first of its kind, but it aspires to be the world's most comprehensive. While our users contribute locations of their own, we comb the internet for pre-existing knowledge, seeking to unite the efforts of foragers, foresters, and freegans everywhere. Imported datasets range from small neighborhood foraging maps to vast professionally-compiled tree inventories. So far, this amounts to over 1,200 different edible types (most, but not all, plant species) distributed over nearly one million locations. Beyond the cultivated and commonplace to long-forgotten native plants and the exotic flavors of foreign plants, foraging in your neighborhood is a journey through time and across cultures.\n\nFalling Fruit is not associated with Fallen Fruit.

When a response is detected by the app the words will show visually in the text box along with audible speech.\n\nWhen you have finished your session just click stop. You can also look back at the responses you received during your session by clicking on the folder button (this only works when the scanner is \"Stopped\").\n\nThe EMF Meter only works if your device has a Magnetometer Sensor. If not then the EMF Meter won't be displayed. Please check the compatibility of your phone / tablet.\n\n** Disclaimer **\nUse at your own risk.

By starting the slot machine, the first partner sets all three reels in motion. After the reels come to a halt, he/she can already look forward to the sweet prize - a random erotic experience being the combination of the activity, at which bodypart to be performed, and for how long. The partners take turns and so after the activity is over the other partner pushes the SPIN button and awaits his/her erotic price.\n \nBut be careful, because it is not always clear who is going to please whom. Each turn is a thrilling experience right to the last moment thanks to the negative time values on the time limit reel. When the negative time limit appears, the partner who spun the reels will treat his/her partner.\n \nIn this game, you can either use the provided slot machines or create your own. You can change the slot machines during the game to accommodate your taste for the softer or more daring tasks.   \n \nFor the quick start, there are five predefined erotic slot machines available, carefully created to avoid unreal combinations. You can adjust each slot machine to suit your preferences, and also to create your own.  There are many possibilities to think of and it’s up to you and your imagination which stimulating combinations you will create.\n \nThis erotic game is suitable for all couples regardless of their sexual orientation. Thus, each couple can spice-up their love life.  \n \nPleasure Machine is a game with erotic content and is for adults only. PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL IF YOU’RE UNDER 18.\n\nGame is also translated in Slovak, Czech and Polish language. You can set those languages directly in the game global settings."

When its wisdom is sought with sincerity and sensitivity, this ancient Chinese oracle will promote success and good fortune and impart balance and perspective to your life. Its lasting popularity lies in the profound lessons it teaches about how reliance on one's higher qualities leads to life's greatest rewards: well-being, understanding, and peace of mind.  \n\nNow available as an elegantly designed and easy to use iOS app, it is both highly accessible to new users and a revelation to those long familiar with the text. Throw your own coins, or let the app cast for you, and make the wisdom of the sages your own. Includes a journal for recording your questions, results, and thoughts.\n\nBrian Browne Walker is the author of celebrated contemporary translations of the I Ching, Tao te Ching, Hua hu Ching, Wei wu Wei Ching, and Art of War which are published by Harper and St. Martin's Press and translated into over a dozen languages around the world. His \"I Ching, or Book of Changes\", long beloved for its clarity and accessibility, has received five star reviews on Amazon consistently for over a decade."

      "label": "\"These unique runic interpretations reflect a depth of knowledge of this ancient divination system. Each rune is masterfully written and clearly communicated with powerful descriptions that allow the essence of the runes to be learned with ease. Working with this specific app is my morning ritual and a favorite way to start the day. I often use it for a quick guide to the day or when I'm searching for a specific answer to a question. The potential for the different layouts and the ability to read the meanings separately makes this app a must have for those into these sacred oracle stones.\"\n\nCeline Germain\nwww.forthebodyandspirit.com\n\n\"Runic Oracle is by far my favourite rune app!  Even though I have actual runes, I find myself turning to the app instead. I love the options for different spreads, and the descriptions for each rune are fantastic! Runic Oracle is eerily accurate.\"\n\nStacey Jenkins\nwww.everyonedreams.ca\n\nAt major turning points in our lives, we often benefit from advice to encourage us, warn of possible pitfalls, and show us the way of good fortune. Some people say that the world is so mysterious, that when something very important is happening for us, everything around us speaks about it, if only we could hear. We can even open any book at random and receive the advice we need from wherever our eye falls.\n\nBut isn't it better to use a vehicle especially designed for this purpose, one which has been used for divination for many centuries? Through divination, the will of the Divine, or perhaps something deeply hidden inside us, speaks the truth which we need to hear at the time.\n\nThis program has been carefully devised to make it conform with traditional Runic Divination. The Runic Oracle has been used successfully for many years, and has consistently worked well. The important point to remember when using it is that, somehow, it is deeply connected with our inner selves. If you approach the Oracle seriously and sincerely, its advice will be revealing. If you treat it like a joke, you'll get a joke response."

The app is a combination of the use of digital art and effects techniques created by Sensory over the years, alongside the influence of abstract expressionist artists.\n\nThe concept for this app is to create a calm, visual experience, with slow emerging shapes. There is a vast combination of layouts and colours to enjoy, and a range of styles pressing the left/right arrows. Sensory Abstract #2 is a moving display of unique digital effects combinations.\n\nThe projection capabilities of the phone or tablet gives the option for galleries, sensory rooms, theatres and relaxing environments to run the app on large screens. Just choose the effect you prefer, using the on screen buttons and let it flow. Tap the screen (or press 5) and the on screen buttons will disappear.\n\nYou can control the app with the bluetooth keyboard characters 1,2,3,4,5, +, - , space bar and enter key.  This also allows any bluetooth access switch systems that can deliver the above characters to the computer.\n\nKeyboard 1 (button 1) or Space Bar changes the background effect\nKeyboard 2 (button 2) changes color of the main effect\nKeyboard 3 (button 3) or Return/Enter key changes style of the main effect\nKeyboard 4 (button 4) changes symmetry of the main effect\nKeyboard 5 (screen tap)) hides and shows control buttons\n+ & - change to the next or last abstract visual if available\n\nSensory Abstract#3 contains no adverts and does not require a login. \n\nPlease view the app store or our website to explore our other abstract and sensory apps.\n\nAny queries please contact support@sensoryapphouse.com"

With its large, highly visible font, you can check the time even from a distance. Also, in everyday life and at work, its modest matt black presence does not distract you or disrupt your productivity, even when using the app for extended periods of time. Its full-screen appearance integrates with the iPhone/iPad device body and blends into your living space ambience, as if it were a minimalist home decor item.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Switch between 12/24 hour clock\n- Switch between portrait and landscape mode\n- Option to show seconds when tapping screen\n- Brightness/dimness control inside the app\n- Show/hide background tiles\n- Enlarge/reduce to any size\n\nNOTES:\n- Your device’s Auto-Lock is disabled while this clock is active in the foreground.\n- This app does not start automatically like the Mac screensaver.\n- You cannot replace your device’s Lock Screen with this clock."

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

Using a functional diagram and easy to read interface, Sun Intervals displays exactly how much daylight remains while also allowing you to enable notification alerts for sunrise, sunset, first and last light times the minutes set before the event.\n\nTap the location title on top of the view to see your current location on the map. You can search by city or area or long tap on the custom map to drop a pin on a chosen location.\n\nWhat we display:\n- sunrise time\n- sunset time\n- first light time (dawn)\n- last light time (twilight)\n- precise location (latitude/longitude)\n- a countdown of the amount of daylight left in the day until last-light\n- countdown until the first light of the new day (night)\n\nSun Intervals relies on GPS and built-in algorithms, so it does not use your mobile data or require an internet connection.\n\nWhenever there is no location signal, the application uses the last automatically saved location.\n\nSun Intervals can be helpful to photographers & film production crews, astronomers, astrophotographers, hikers, campers, sailors, pilots, travellers.\n\nReligious and yoga followers can benefit from the application as well to observe special requirements."

      "label": "Esta APP es la herramienta perfecta para el estudio del Kybalión, ya que está diseñada para ello, y te aporta muchas funcionalidades que te ayudarán en tu proposito. tambien puedes compartir contenidos o descargar los audios si te resulta más comodo escucharlo.\n\nEL KYBALION Preceptos y enseñanzas fundamentales del antiguo Egipto Usar el mouse\n\nEl Kybalión es un documento que contiene el conjunto de enseñanzas de la filosofía hermética , también conocidos como los siete principios del hermetismo. Escrito en los albores del siglo XX, su autoría se debe a un grupo anónimo de personas autodenominados Los Tres Iniciados, aunque las bases del hermetismo se atribuyen a un alquimista místico y deidad de algunas logias ocultistas llamado Hermes Trimegisto , cuya existencia pudo haber transcurrido en Egipto antes de la época de los faraones.\n\n«Los labios de la sabiduría están cerrados, excepto para los oídos del entendimiento.» «Donde caen las pisadas del maestro, los oídos de aquellos preparados para su enseñanza se abren de par en par.» «Cuando los oídos del estudiante están listos para oír, entonces vienen los labios a llenarlos con sabiduría.»\n\nDe manera que, de acuerdo con lo indicado, esta APP solo atraerá la atención de aquellos que están preparados para recibirla. Y recíprocamente, cuando el estudioso esté preparado para recibir la verdad, entonces este libro llegará a él, o a ella. Tal es la ley. El principio hermético de causa y efecto, en su aspecto de “ley de atracción”, llevará los oídos junto a los labios y el libro junto al discípulo.\n\nLos principios de la verdad son siete; aquel que conoce éstos, con comprensión, posee la llave mágica ante cuyo toque todas las puertas del templo se abren de repente.\n\n-Mentalismo : El Todo es mente; el universo es mental. -Correspondencia : Como es arriba, es abajo; como es abajo, es -- arriba. Afirma que este principio se manifiesta en los tres Grandes Planos: El Físico, El Mental y El Espiritual. -Vibración : Nada está inmóvil; todo se mueve; todo vibra. -Polaridad : Todo es doble, todo tiene dos polos; todo, su par de opuestos los semejantes y los antagónicos son lo mismo; los opuestos son idénticos en naturaleza, pero diferentes en grado; los extremos se tocan; todas las verdades son medias verdades, todas las paradojas pueden reconciliarse. -Ritmo : Todo fluye y refluye; todo tiene sus períodos de avance y retroceso, todo asciende y desciende; todo se mueve como un péndulo; la medida de su movimiento hacia la derecha, es la misma que la de su movimiento hacia la izquierda; el ritmo es la compensación. -Causa y efecto : Toda causa tiene su efecto; todo efecto tiene su causa; todo sucede de acuerdo a la ley; la suerte o azar no es más que el nombre que se le da a la ley no reconocida; hay muchos planos de causalidad, pero nada escapa a la Ley. -Generación : La generación existe por doquier; todo tiene su principio masculino y femenino; la generación se manifiesta en todos los planos. En el plano físico es la sexualidad.\n\n« EL TODO es MENTE; el universo es mental.»\n\nExplica que todo el mundo o universo fenomenal es simplemente una creación mental del TODO, sujeto a las leyes de las cosas creadas, y que el universo, como conjunto, y en sus partes o unidades, tiene su existencia en la mente del TODO, en cuya mente vivimos, nos movemos y tenemos nuestro ser.\n\nTodo es dual; todo tiene polos; todo tiene su par de opuestos; semejante y desemejante son lo mismo; los opuestos son idénticos en naturaleza, pero diferentes en grado: los extremos se encuentran; todas las verdades no son sino medias verdades; todas las paradojas pueden ser reconciliadas.\n\nLa mente puede ser transmutada, de estado a estado; de grado a grado; de condición a condición; de polo a polo; de vibración a vibración. La verdadera transmutación hermética es un arte mental."

      "label": "Whether you are a professional Paranormal Investigator, a hobbyist or just want to have some fun, this app works like a \"Spirit Box\" reading data from your sensors and turning it into spoken words.\n\nWith a database of over a thousand commonly used words, Ghostalker will read changes in all of the sensors it can find in your device. This includes sensors for the tiniest amount of vibration, rotation, GPS, gyroscope, light, magnetic fields, proximity etc. and convert them to words which it will display and speak. This app uses the actual raw data from the sensors to determine what to say, rather than picking words at random like some other apps.\n\nLOGGING: This is the full version of the app so it logs the words spoken for you to view, save, email, delete etc. at a later time. There is also a built-in log viewer. The date and time is logged, along with the combined change in sensor readings (so you can see how big a change was picked up) and the word. The log files are in CSV format so you can import them into your favourite spreadsheet (e.g. MS Excel or Google Sheets).\n\nDICTIONARY: You can also manage your own custom dictionary of words so you can make your own special list of replies. You can flick between the in-built dictionary, your own custom dictionary or both combined (from v0.5) at any time.\n\nThis app is not designed to form complete sentences so it is up to you to interpret what it says in your own way. Top end phones and tablets tend to have more sensors than low end ones but the app is designed to work with whatever it can find. The sensitivity of sensors will also vary between devices.\n\nTIP 1: Using the custom dictionary you can have it reply with special limited words, for example 'yes', 'no' and 'maybe' when you ask it questions. Or add a series of digits and get it to pick your lottery numbers. Or add the letters of the alphabet so it can work like a Ouija board. \n\nTIP 2: Paranormal investigators believe that leaving such devices running for as long as possible will allow \"spirits\" to learn what energy is required to trigger certain words.\n\nTIP 3: If it starts to trigger words constantly you may be getting interference from something close by. Try moving the device somewhere else or tap the 'Calibrate' button to get it to tune out background variance (although you will lose some sensitivity).\n\nTIP 4: NEW - Keep lists of custom words in text files. Each word should be on its own line or separated by a space. Select all of the words and copy them to the clipboard. You can then import them into Ghostalker by pasting them from the clipboard. You can also copy word lists from the web, an email, or anywhere you can copy text.\n\nIf the app does not do what you were expecting, or there is an issue with it running on your device, please contact us for help.\n\nThere are no adverts in this software. If you would like to try the free version first (without the logging or custom dictionary functionality), it is listed under \"Ghostalker Lite\"."

While realization ultimately cannot be surrounded or captured with words, along the way they have power. It is possible to catalyze the transformation of ordinary understanding into Diamond Mind with them. \n\nThe text is configured as an oracular text, just like the I Ching, to facilitate concentration upon a particular teaching with respect to a specific question. It centers primarily around wei wu wei, the ancient Taoist notion that translates roughly to “doing not-doing”. By whatever name or not-name, this practice is the core teaching of every enlightenment tradition in the world. \n\nThis free app includes a consulting tool, a journaling tool, and the complete odd-numbered passages.  Full book content is available through an In-App Purchase.\n\nThe teachings of the Wei wu Wei Ching are sourced in Tao, Ch’an, Zen, Sufism, Native American spirituality, Tibetan Buddhism, Advaita, yoga, and other traditions less easily named. Whichever the source, they transmit the heart and soul of enlightened living."

      "label": "Ravit is a fun app that enables you to discover inspirational patterns and yarns, update your projects and stash and browse and post to Ravelry forums from anywhere. It's super quick, and it's friendly. Ravelry on mobile has never been easier.\n\nFIND INSPIRATIONAL PATTERNS\nIf you’re not sure what you’d like to make next, Ravit lets you easily browse patterns, favorite them, download and view pattern PDFs, view project photos and browse a designer’s other patterns and pattern suggestions. \n\nAnd if you want to narrow your search, choose from dozens of filters including craft, availability, category, attributes, needles, weight and more. You can even combine multiple options with AND, NOT or OR. It's powerful, but easy.\n\nThere's so many beautiful patterns on Ravelry, and Ravit helps you find them easily.\n\nTAKE RAVELRY TO YOUR YARN STORE\nFind out which yarns you’ll need for a project. Check what yardage you need. Look in your stash to see if you’ve already got a yarn, or one that’s similar. And because Ravit is designed to work nicely on your iPhone or iPad with readable text and buttons you can tap, you won't be squinting as you find all the info you need when you're at your LYS.\n\n+ Search all yarns by keyword, filter by fiber, weight, attributes and many others, and sort by options including 'Most projects' and 'Highest rating'. Quickly view pattern suggestions and projects for a yarn.\n\n+ Access your stash offline. No wireless or cell signal in your yarn store? No problem! Your stash is cached on your device so you can search, sort and view your stash offline.\n\nSNAP, EDIT AND UPLOAD ON THE SPOT\nPerhaps you're making a project on the train to work, or relaxed on the couch at home - whenever you are inspired to share your WIPs, Ravit makes it easy to snap photos, enhance with powerful photo filters, and upload to Ravelry, all from the one app.\n\n+ Powerful Photo Editing Tools - enhance, crop, and adjust your photos before your upload and show your work in it's best possible light. You can remove blemishes, improve color balance, sharpen images and access many other pro editing tools all from within the app.\n\n+ Optimized for Ravelry - before images are uploaded, they're resized optimally for Ravelry, so you'll upload smaller photos (up to 10x smaller!) more quickly and using less data.\n\n+ More than just photos - you can update notes for your Projects, Queued Projects and Stash, as well as most of the other info such as yarns, yardage, skeins, colorways, and color for your stash, and progress, link to stash, rating, craft, and tags amongst others for your projects.\n\nIT'S ALL THE LITTLE THINGS...\nSo why use Ravit? It's all the the little, sometimes hidden touches which make Ravit shine. Here's a few of them.\n\n+ It's quick - if you tap on something, you go right there. \n\n+ Infinite scroll - smooth, continuous scrolling as you browse to find inspiration.\n\n+ Offline - whether you're commuting underground, or you're off-grid, Ravit lets you access your Projects and Stash offline.\n\n+ Clean, uncluttered interface - we want your work and the beauty of Ravelry.com to shine. \n\n+ Use up to 50%* less data in Ravit compared with your web browser. \n\n+ Squint less - The text in Ravit isn't made super small, and we're fully Dynamic Type compatible, so if you change the font size on your device, it'll change in Ravit.\n\n* Based on tests of browsing patterns, projects, stash and yarns on Ravit and Safari on the same device - YYMV! (Your Yardage May Vary)\n\nTHIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING\nRavit has many features already, but we are constantly enhancing and adding more features. We have an active group on Ravelry and we'd love to hear what you'd like to see next - join in the discussion at http://www.ravelry.com/groups/ravit\n\nRavit is not affiliated with ravelry.com. It is an independent app, developed by a husband and wife team. You can read more about why we made Ravit at http://www.enhancient.com/ravit\n\nDownload Ravit now and hop on to Ravelry."

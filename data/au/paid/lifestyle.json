      "label": "Break-ups suck, but you needn’t suck at break-ups. Break-Up Boss offers advice and techniques to help the broken-hearted process their hurt, heal, and ultimately, see their break-up as the gift it is. Become the boss of your break-up. Own it.\n \nCreated by the author of Textbook Romance, and long-time relationship columnist at Cosmopolitan, Zoë Foster Blake, and with illustrations by Mari Andrew, Break-Up Boss is a modern, meaningful, big-hearted tool for the broken-hearted.\n \nHow does it differ from other break-up tools? Because Break-Up Boss firmly places YOU in charge of your break-up. Because you ARE in charge of it! And only you are. Stop letting your heartache and your ex take over your life, your diet, your social life, your job and personality, and start seeing your circumstances as an opportunity for growth. Break-ups happen cos something was broken. So fix yourself, love yourself, and move forward. \n\nBreak-Up Boss is the size of a self-help book, but WAY easier to use and digest. (A boss works smart, not hard, after all.) It reveals a no BS, non-waffly, non-naff, real-life strip down of the modern break-up, and enthusiastically encourages an empowered, big-picture, positive view of how to deal with one. \n\nFeatures include:\n\n- Use the Feel Wheel to read the exact advice you need at the exact time you need it…. because no two break-ups follow the same time line or even a reliable pattern, after all. (Are you about to see your ex at a wedding? Are you drunk and about to send them a text? Are you miserable and wanting to get back with them? We’ve got you!)\n\n- Send a fake text to your ex, so you don’t send an ACTUAL text to them, and screw everything up (or your ex)\n\n- Recieve daily pep-peps direct to your phone, so you’ve got some sunshine, power and perspective in your pocket at all times\n\n- SOS quotes that give you the exact advice, just as you need it. Like Goddess cards, only less… Goddessy.\n\nBreak-ups are a normal, inevitable part of life. And yet we are so bad at them. We let them completely hijack our lives, even though they force us to watch rubbish movies, and cry a lot, and forgo sleep, and eat rubbish.\n\nWell no more. Because now you can own your break-up like a boss. And you really, really should.\n\nBreak-Up Boss is proud to donate 10% of every sale to Safe Steps, a family violence response centre in Victoria, Australia.\n\n\"I just broke up with my boyfriend like literally 30 minutes ago and I'm already laughing. Thank you! I am looking forward to going through the shitty range of feelings with this baby beside me!\" - Sandy\n\n\"I love the app! It's so great to feel loved and supported and not feel like you are over relying on friends (who have their own lives of course).\" - Madison, VIC"

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

It's powerful, but easy.\n\nThere's so many beautiful patterns on Ravelry, and Ravit helps you find them easily.\n\nTAKE RAVELRY TO YOUR YARN STORE\nFind out which yarns you’ll need for a project. Check what yardage you need. Look in your stash to see if you’ve already got a yarn, or one that’s similar. And because Ravit is designed to work nicely on your iPhone or iPad with readable text and buttons you can tap, you won't be squinting as you find all the info you need when you're at your LYS.\n\n+ Search all yarns by keyword, filter by fiber, weight, attributes and many others, and sort by options including 'Most projects' and 'Highest rating'. Quickly view pattern suggestions and projects for a yarn.\n\n+ Access your stash offline. No wireless or cell signal in your yarn store? No problem! Your stash is cached on your device so you can search, sort and view your stash offline.\n\nSNAP, EDIT AND UPLOAD ON THE SPOT\nPerhaps you're making a project on the train to work, or relaxed on the couch at home - whenever you are inspired to share your WIPs, Ravit makes it easy to snap photos, enhance with powerful photo filters, and upload to Ravelry, all from the one app.\n\n+ Powerful Photo Editing Tools - enhance, crop, and adjust your photos before your upload and show your work in it's best possible light. You can remove blemishes, improve color balance, sharpen images and access many other pro editing tools all from within the app.\n\n+ Optimized for Ravelry - before images are uploaded, they're resized optimally for Ravelry, so you'll upload smaller photos (up to 10x smaller!) more quickly and using less data.\n\n+ More than just photos - you can update notes for your Projects, Queued Projects and Stash, as well as most of the other info such as yarns, yardage, skeins, colorways, and color for your stash, and progress, link to stash, rating, craft, and tags amongst others for your projects.\n\nIT'S ALL THE LITTLE THINGS...\nSo why use Ravit? It's all the the little, sometimes hidden touches which make Ravit shine. Here's a few of them.\n\n+ It's quick - if you tap on something, you go right there. \n\n+ Infinite scroll - smooth, continuous scrolling as you browse to find inspiration.\n\n+ Offline - whether you're commuting underground, or you're off-grid, Ravit lets you access your Projects and Stash offline.\n\n+ Clean, uncluttered interface - we want your work and the beauty of Ravelry.com to shine. \n\n+ Use up to 50%* less data in Ravit compared with your web browser. \n\n+ Squint less - The text in Ravit isn't made super small, and we're fully Dynamic Type compatible, so if you change the font size on your device, it'll change in Ravit.\n\n* Based on tests of browsing patterns, projects, stash and yarns on Ravit and Safari on the same device - YYMV! (Your Yardage May Vary)\n\nTHIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING\nRavit has many features already, but we are constantly enhancing and adding more features. We have an active group on Ravelry and we'd love to hear what you'd like to see next - join in the discussion at http://www.ravelry.com/groups/ravit\n\nRavit is not affiliated with ravelry.com. It is an independent app, developed by a husband and wife team. You can read more about why we made Ravit at http://www.enhancient.com/ravit\n\nDownload Ravit now and hop on to Ravelry."

Nothing is stored in \"the cloud\" where it could be hacked. \n\nThe Vault 4th Step Inventory App allows you to enter your inventory information in a logical step by step way, then saves the information in an inventory spreadsheet that is laid out much like many of the 4th Step guides that you can find on the internet (like Joe and Charlie’s).  The difference is that the Vault app lets you work on your 4th step anywhere, anytime that you are free and in a safe place, NOT just when you are free at your home with your notebook.  It is Vault Code protected at all times, so whether it is on your nightstand or at the coffee shop, NO ONE can access your inventory but you. \n\nWe decided (through much discussion) to minimize all instructions on HOW to do a 4th Step. As alcoholics, we had no shortage of opinions on what each of us believed were the best instructions. We decided to use the original text from the Big Book for the actual questions for you to answer, instead of rewording them as we saw some of the 4th Step \"guides\" do. \n\nYour sponsor may want you to write out (with pen and paper) your 4th step. If that is the case, you may still utilize the app to collect your inventory information, then after printing it out, copy it over by hand.  \n\nThis app is not AA reviewed or approved. AA does not endorse or approve anything or anyone. All quotes are from the 1st edition of the Big Book.  This app was created by members for members. Thanks to their generous support this app is FREE to anyone world-wide. Remember: Our primary purpose is to stay sober, and help another alcoholic.\n\nThanks,\n\nTwelve Step Apps\nwww.12StepApps.org"

With its large, highly visible font, you can check the time even from a distance. Also, in everyday life and at work, its modest matt black presence does not distract you or disrupt your productivity, even when using the app for extended periods of time. Its full-screen appearance integrates with the iPhone/iPad device body and blends into your living space ambience, as if it were a minimalist home decor item.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Switch between 12/24 hour clock\n- Switch between portrait and landscape mode\n- Option to show seconds when tapping screen\n- Brightness/dimness control inside the app\n- Show/hide background tiles\n- Enlarge/reduce to any size\n\nNOTES:\n- Your device’s Auto-Lock is disabled while this clock is active in the foreground.\n- This app does not start automatically like the Mac screensaver.\n- You cannot replace your device’s Lock Screen with this clock."

When its wisdom is sought with sincerity and sensitivity, this ancient Chinese oracle will promote success and good fortune and impart balance and perspective to your life. Its lasting popularity lies in the profound lessons it teaches about how reliance on one's higher qualities leads to life's greatest rewards: well-being, understanding, and peace of mind.  \n\nNow available as an elegantly designed and easy to use iOS app, it is both highly accessible to new users and a revelation to those long familiar with the text. Throw your own coins, or let the app cast for you, and make the wisdom of the sages your own. Includes a journal for recording your questions, results, and thoughts.\n\nBrian Browne Walker is the author of celebrated contemporary translations of the I Ching, Tao te Ching, Hua hu Ching, Wei wu Wei Ching, and Art of War which are published by Harper and St. Martin's Press and translated into over a dozen languages around the world. His \"I Ching, or Book of Changes\", long beloved for its clarity and accessibility, has received five star reviews on Amazon consistently for over a decade."

These are: Entry (8-12 years old), Intermediate (13-17 years old), and Advanced (18+).\n\nWhat does this app include?\n- Three sets of 36 simple questions about how you prefer to behave, leading to the identification with a dominant and secondary totem from the four animal personality types that AusIDentities uses\n- In-depth information on how these four personality types communicate with each other and interact within relationships, the classroom and the workplace.\n- Explanations of how personality influences patterns of behaviour in people when stressed, choosing a career, and developing as a child and teenager\n- A promotional code offering a 5% discount on any purchase of AusIDentities resources"

      "label": "Susan Miller’s Moonlight App features:\n\n• Know the times Moon is Void of Course at your current location and as you travel. \n\n• Explains the 8 phases of the moon (new moon, quarter moon, full moon, balsamic moon and, so forth), what each phase means, and how to take advantage of each phase by timing your actions accordingly.\n\n• It takes the moon 2.5 days to travel through one sign, so the app’s simple calendar reveals which zodiac sign the moon is traveling in for each day and the exact time it changes signs. Some signs that the moon travels through are especially favorable for certain actions—find out the details.\n\n• This app has no subscription—it is a one-time purchase. You get all the daily information you need through 2050.\n\nYou have heard the buzz on social media about “moon void of course” or a “void moon” (both have the same meaning). You may be curious about whether you should pay attention to when the moon is void of course. By knowing when a void moon is upcoming, you can schedule actions to avoid those periods to create the most successful outcome possible. It is an app you will use quite a bit—you will want to check it every morning. \n\nSome days the moon never goes void, other days the moon will go void for a few minutes, and still other days the moon will be void for several hours—possibly for the entire day or, in rare cases, for several days. Every day is unique, so the void is never repeated in the same way, the reason you need Susan’s Moonlight app. \n\nIf you schedule a meeting when the moon is void, it will either be cancelled, or the meeting will come to nothing. Things will go on as they have before with no change. You should not schedule a first date or a wedding during a moon void period, nor should you sign a contract, have a job interview, or meet with the press during a void moon, as examples. It would not be a good idea to buy an airline ticket during a void moon, for you may have to exchange it later. If your action is vital, avoid the void. \n\nThis is an aspect that affects everyone uniformly, similar to Mercury retrograde.\n\nWith Susan Miller’s new appealing app, Moonlight, void of course periods are easy to find, understand, and navigate. The information is written in Susan Miller’s signature warm, optimistic style, and she uses no astro-babble language to confuse you. Until now, knowing when the moon is void required looking up the moon’s void of course periods on tables that are listed by Greenwich Mean Time and converting to your location. With Moonlight, the answer is a snap on Susan Miller’s app.\n\nWhat is the moon void of course, and when does it happen?\n\nThe void of course period of the moon begins when the moon has finished meeting with the other planets and has made her last EXACT major aspect to a planet or the Sun. Just as importantly, the moon must still be moving within the same zodiac sign as she was when she started receiving the planets. Once she has met with them all and is finished, the moon will go void of course. \n\nTo be precise, the moon may make an aspect to another planet. It could be a conjunction, square, trine, sextile, or opposition. These are the aspects that were outlined by the ancient Egyptian astrologer Ptolemy. Ptolemy is considered the father of the Western astrology we use today, and we call these aforementioned aspects “Ptolemaic” aspects. You need not be concerned about knowing what these aspects mean—Susan Miller does the work for you.\n\nAfter the moon has communicated with other planets each month, the moon rests, and as said, that ushers in the void period. As she rests, the moon cannot lend any of her considerable powers to you. That’s not good for any of us. We need all the help we can get from the graceful moon on a daily basis."

As you journey through life, the Spirit Guides and Totem Animals in this card deck will give you guidance about relationships, romance, career and all of life’s challenges.\n\nThe Spirit Guides in this app appear when you require answers. Their advice is as varied as nature itself. They may remind you about the importance of cooperation and unity, or tell you to walk your own path.

Your Spirit Guides are much more complex than that. They can help you face challenges and answer your questions when it is most needed.\n\nThe Spirit Guides in this Beauty Everywhere oracle app can help you connect with your own inner wisdom. The messages within these cards can magnify your natural intuitive abilities and aid you in navigating the twisting, and often surprising, paths of life.  These supportive and truth-telling guides will help you understand, clarify or see your situations and questions in an insightful way.  \n\nFEATURES:\n \n- Give readings anywhere, anytime\n- Choose between different types of readings\n- Save your readings to review at any time\n- Email readings to friends\n- Browse the entire deck of cards\n- Flip cards over to read each card's meaning\n- Get the most out of your deck with the complete guidebook\n- Set a daily reminder for a reading"

A summary will show the length of the track, number of markers and the time it took for you to walk the track.\n\nWhen your dog walks the track Dog Track will draw a new track on the map and automatically mark the markers your dog finds. You will see the track you walked and in real time follow your dog's track.\n\nAfter you and your dog have walked the track you will see a map that shows both tracks, which marker your dog has found, track length and time. You can log weather and wind conditions and also write your own comments.\n\nDog Track requires that Location service, GPS and Mobile Data is enabled on your phone.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "As one of the eight limbs of yoga, pranayama (the formal practice of controlling the breath), is a valuable technique for meditators and yoga practitioners. There are many forms of this practice, and a major branch of pranayama breathing involves increasing the concentration of oxygen available to the body through specific breathing practices. The app also lets you customize the volume of the various elements (voice, breath, ambiance), as well as customize the speed of the breath so you can find a breathing speed that is both comfortable and effective for you.\n\nThis app contains four meditation tracks\n\nStepping Into Your Power: In this track, you will experience the power that you've always had, but perhaps overlooked because of some conditioning by your environment. Each of us is a unique piece of the vast puzzle of this infinite creation, and we not only have a right, but also a responsibility to ourselves and the universe to fully be ourselves by stepping into our own innate true power.\n\nGrieving and Celebrating a Loss: Whether it be the loss of a loved one through death, the loss of a relationship through a breakup or divorce, or even the loss of a cherished physical object, most of us have experienced a loss that has affected us deeply. Cognitive Psychology has recognized the \"five stages of grief,\" but many of us don't realize that it's easy to get stuck in one of the stages. Breathwork was the tool that allowed me to not only recognize that I was stuck in a state of denial after my divorce, but also move beyond it. In this meditation, you will recognize where you are in your healing process and then discover tools to move forward (but only if you are ready).\n\nHealing Sexual Abuse: In the era of #metoo, only now is sexual abuse a topic that is brought up publicly in our culture. For years, we'd lived in a system where women weren't allowed to \"say yes,\" which also meant they had no clear and unambiguous way to \"say no.\" We are also finally beginning to bring to light how power dynamics in religious and legal institutions have led to systemic sexual abuse. It might come as a surprise that statistics show more people have experienced a sexual abuse event in their lifetime than those who have not. You are not alone, and this meditation will help you process these experiences as well as use them to help you in the future.\n\nAbundance: This is another take on the \"manifestation\" guided meditation offered in GMT Volume I, but from a different perspective. In this meditation, you will start with the abundance that is inside of you and use it as an exchange to create a swirling cloud of abundance that surrounds you... all while practicing the pranayama healing breathwork practice."

From Polynesian (Tahitian, Samoan, Tongan, etc.) tatau. In Marquesan, tatu.\" Before the importation of the Polynesian word, the practice of tattooing had been described in the West as pricking, painting, or staining. Sailors on the voyage later introduced both the word and reintroduced the concept of tattooing to Europe.\n\nThis is not to be confused with the origins of the word for the military drumbeat — see military tattoo. In this case, the English word tattoo is derived from the Dutch word taptoe (OED).\n\nThe first written reference to the word tattoo (or tatau), appears in the journal of Joseph Banks (24 February 1743 – 19 June 1820), the naturalist aboard Captain Cook's ship the HMS Endeavour: \"I shall now mention the way they mark themselves indelibly, each of them is so marked by their humor or disposition\".\n\nThe word \"tattoo\" was brought to Europe by the explorer James Cook, when he returned in 1771 from his first voyage to Tahiti and New Zealand. In his narrative of the voyage, he refers to an operation called \"tattaw\". Before this it had been described as scarring, painting, or staining\n\nTattoo enthusiasts may refer to tattoos as \"ink\", \"pieces\", \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"tats\", or \"work\"; to the creators as \"tattoo artists\", \"tattooers\", or \"tattooists\"; and to places where they work as \"tattoo shops\", \"tattoo studios\", or \"tattoo parlors\".\n\n\nA tattooed man's back, Japan, c. 1875\nUsage of the terms \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"pieces\", and work\" is gaining greater support,[citation needed] with mainstream art galleries holding exhibitions of both conventional and custom tattoo designs. Beyond Skin, at the Museum of Croydon, is an example of this as it challenges the stereotypical view of tattoos and who has them. Copyrighted tattoo designs that are mass-produced and sent to tattoo artists are known as \"flash\", a notable instance of industrial design. Flash sheets are prominently displayed in many tattoo parlors for the purpose of providing both inspiration and ready-made tattoo images to customers.\n\nThe Japanese word irezumi means \"insertion of ink\" and can mean tattoos using tebori, the traditional Japanese hand method, a Western-style machine, or for that matter, any method of tattooing using insertion of ink. The most common word used for traditional Japanese tattoo designs is Horimono. Japanese may use the word \"tattoo\" to mean non-Japanese styles of tattooing."

You can create Siri shortcuts and then say for example: \"Hey Siri, what's the current power\" - and hear the response.\nTo access Siri Shortcuts, tap the app menu in the top/right, then tap on \"Siri Shortcuts\".\n\nEvery watch complication type is supported, with special attention given to complications that use gauges.\n\nDuring daytime, the complications are displaying current power production, and total daily energy produced. Gauges are color-coded, and show the percentage of current power vs. the maximum.\nDuring night time, total energy produced during last day is shown, and the complication gauges act as a timer that counts down how much time roughly there is until sunrise.\n\nWatch app has a scrollable view with various stats, including daily, monthly and yearly total power, as well as environmental benefits and calculated revenue.\n\nAll this info is also displayed in the iOS notification widget, just a swipe away from the lock screen.\n\nBased on the robust and proven codebase that powers Thermo Watch and Watch Cam apps, enjoyed by tens of thousands of users. The app is extremely quick and efficient, with near-instant launch time, and seamless background updates.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nThe goal was to make a product that would not look out of place next to one of the apps bundled with the Apple Watch.\n\nPlease Note: SolarEdge admin console access is needed to generate the API key that is used to sign into the app.\nSolar Watch does not collect any of your data. Your API Key and any app activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and SolarEdge. Author of Solar Watch does not access any of it, at any point.\nSolar Watch is not affiliated with SolarEdge, but it is created with their approval."

      "label": "Nothing is more exhausting than endlessly working on “yourself.” When you offer your whole Being fully to Love, self-acceptance arises spontaneously. May I rest in our Oneness, dear Divine!\n\nIf you read the lines above and think, Easier said than done, this oracle deck is for you. In 52 beautifully illustrated cards, beloved spiritual teacher and author Tosha Silver uses her accessible, slightly quirky style to convey her key teaching messages of Surrender and Offering to Divine Will.\n\nThese messages, familiar to readers of Tosha’s highly acclaimed books (Outrageous Openness and Change Me Prayers), are, at their essence, about releasing attachment to ego-defined outcomes. Each card addresses a particular situation—Aging, Ambition, Money, Regrets, Solitude, Travel, Truth—with a comment or invocation that encourages you to offer your pain around this situation to the Divine, and to call in Divine Will for the highest outcome. Intentionally non-prescriptive, the deck can be used in a variety of ways: as an oracle where the Divine guides you to a specific card; to carry or put on an altar as a reminder to reflect on a specific issue; or in any other way you are drawn to use it.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Browse The Wild Offering Oracle cards anywhere, anytime on your iOS device*\n- Save cards to review at any time*\n- Email cards to yourself or share with a friend*\n\nAbout the Author:\nTosha Silver - Graduated from Yale with a degree in English-Literature but along the way fell madly in love with yogic philosophy. For the past 30 years, she has taught people around the world ways to align with Inner Love. She's known for finding fresh, humurous, and practical ways of teaching while avoiding cliche's and dogma. Tosha is the author of Outrageous Openness and Change Me Prayers. She lives near San Francisco, where she runs an online forum that engages these ideas, called Living Outrageous Openness: Think Like a Goddess.\nwebsite: www.toshasilver.com\n\nIllustrator Katie Daisy -Found her voice and honed her skills at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design, graduating in 2009 and subsequently beginning an adventurous career as a freelance illustrator and licensed artist.

      "label": "Whether you are a professional Paranormal Investigator, a hobbyist or just want to have some fun, this app works like a \"Spirit Box\" reading data from your sensors and turning it into spoken words.\n\nWith a database of over a thousand commonly used words, Ghostalker will read changes in all of the sensors it can find in your device. This includes sensors for the tiniest amount of vibration, rotation, GPS, gyroscope, light, magnetic fields, proximity etc. and convert them to words which it will display and speak. This app uses the actual raw data from the sensors to determine what to say, rather than picking words at random like some other apps.\n\nLOGGING: This is the full version of the app so it logs the words spoken for you to view, save, email, delete etc. at a later time. There is also a built-in log viewer. The date and time is logged, along with the combined change in sensor readings (so you can see how big a change was picked up) and the word. The log files are in CSV format so you can import them into your favourite spreadsheet (e.g. MS Excel or Google Sheets).\n\nDICTIONARY: You can also manage your own custom dictionary of words so you can make your own special list of replies. You can flick between the in-built dictionary, your own custom dictionary or both combined (from v0.5) at any time.\n\nThis app is not designed to form complete sentences so it is up to you to interpret what it says in your own way. Top end phones and tablets tend to have more sensors than low end ones but the app is designed to work with whatever it can find. The sensitivity of sensors will also vary between devices.\n\nTIP 1: Using the custom dictionary you can have it reply with special limited words, for example 'yes', 'no' and 'maybe' when you ask it questions. Or add a series of digits and get it to pick your lottery numbers. Or add the letters of the alphabet so it can work like a Ouija board. \n\nTIP 2: Paranormal investigators believe that leaving such devices running for as long as possible will allow \"spirits\" to learn what energy is required to trigger certain words.\n\nTIP 3: If it starts to trigger words constantly you may be getting interference from something close by. Try moving the device somewhere else or tap the 'Calibrate' button to get it to tune out background variance (although you will lose some sensitivity).\n\nTIP 4: NEW - Keep lists of custom words in text files. Each word should be on its own line or separated by a space. Select all of the words and copy them to the clipboard. You can then import them into Ghostalker by pasting them from the clipboard. You can also copy word lists from the web, an email, or anywhere you can copy text.\n\nIf the app does not do what you were expecting, or there is an issue with it running on your device, please contact us for help.\n\nThere are no adverts in this software. If you would like to try the free version first (without the logging or custom dictionary functionality), it is listed under \"Ghostalker Lite\"."

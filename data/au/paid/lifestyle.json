These are: Entry (8-12 years old), Intermediate (13-17 years old), and Advanced (18+).\n\nWhat does this app include?\n- Three sets of 36 simple questions about how you prefer to behave, leading to the identification with a dominant and secondary totem from the four animal personality types that AusIDentities uses\n- In-depth information on how these four personality types communicate with each other and interact within relationships, the classroom and the workplace.\n- Explanations of how personality influences patterns of behaviour in people when stressed, choosing a career, and developing as a child and teenager\n- A promotional code offering a 5% discount on any purchase of AusIDentities resources"

      "label": "Break-ups suck, but you needn’t suck at break-ups. Break-Up Boss offers advice and techniques to help the broken-hearted process their hurt, heal, and ultimately, see their break-up as the gift it is. Become the boss of your break-up. Own it.\n \nCreated by the author of Textbook Romance, and long-time relationship columnist at Cosmopolitan, Zoë Foster Blake, and with illustrations by Mari Andrew, Break-Up Boss is a modern, meaningful, big-hearted tool for the broken-hearted.\n \nHow does it differ from other break-up tools? Because Break-Up Boss firmly places YOU in charge of your break-up. Because you ARE in charge of it! And only you are. Stop letting your heartache and your ex take over your life, your diet, your social life, your job and personality, and start seeing your circumstances as an opportunity for growth. Break-ups happen cos something was broken. So fix yourself, love yourself, and move forward. \n\nBreak-Up Boss is the size of a self-help book, but WAY easier to use and digest. (A boss works smart, not hard, after all.) It reveals a no BS, non-waffly, non-naff, real-life strip down of the modern break-up, and enthusiastically encourages an empowered, big-picture, positive view of how to deal with one. \n\nFeatures include:\n\n- Use the Feel Wheel to read the exact advice you need at the exact time you need it…. because no two break-ups follow the same time line or even a reliable pattern, after all. (Are you about to see your ex at a wedding? Are you drunk and about to send them a text? Are you miserable and wanting to get back with them? We’ve got you!)\n\n- Send a fake text to your ex, so you don’t send an ACTUAL text to them, and screw everything up (or your ex)\n\n- Recieve daily pep-peps direct to your phone, so you’ve got some sunshine, power and perspective in your pocket at all times\n\n- SOS quotes that give you the exact advice, just as you need it. Like Goddess cards, only less… Goddessy.\n\nBreak-ups are a normal, inevitable part of life. And yet we are so bad at them. We let them completely hijack our lives, even though they force us to watch rubbish movies, and cry a lot, and forgo sleep, and eat rubbish.\n\nWell no more. Because now you can own your break-up like a boss. And you really, really should.\n\nBreak-Up Boss is proud to donate 10% of every sale to Safe Steps, a family violence response centre in Victoria, Australia.\n\n\"I just broke up with my boyfriend like literally 30 minutes ago and I'm already laughing. Thank you! I am looking forward to going through the shitty range of feelings with this baby beside me!\" - Sandy\n\n\"I love the app! It's so great to feel loved and supported and not feel like you are over relying on friends (who have their own lives of course).\" - Madison, VIC"

We will try to fix it once iOS system allows it.\n\nNote about Athan :\n-----------------\nSalatuk remind you that it's time for prayer with a \"4 takbeerats\" instead of full Athan.

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

      "label": "The B-hyve Pro App provides landscape irrigation professionals with an easy way to manage and operate B-hyve Pro controllers from anywhere with the convenience of a smart phone or tablet.  With the intuitive layout and design of the app, it is fast and easy to connect to any B-hyve Pro controller through WiFi or, if WiFi is not available, directly through Bluetooth right at the timer location.  Once connected to WiFi, B-hyve can be set up in smart mode to assist in delivering the right amount of water to plants, saving clients water and money.\nThis is the companion App for award-winning B-hyve Pro irrigation controllers. Homeowners can download the non-Pro version of the B-hyve App at no charge.\n\n***KEY FEATURES***\nWIFI and BLUETOOTH – Because WiFi is not always available on a job site, the B-hyve app and controller allow you to set up and operate the controller using Bluetooth. Once a WiFi connection is established at a site, the owner of the WiFi router can provide a permission code that enables off-site management of the controller from anywhere in the world.\n\nEPA- AND SWAT-CERTIFIED – Having passed the rigorous EPA WaterSense and SWAT certifications, the B-hyve Pro Controller with Smart Watering is certified to use water more efficiently and is eligible for rebates in many cities or water districts across the country.\n\nFLEXIBLE SCHEDULING – You can set the controller to water in two basic ways: 1) on a fixed schedule, such as during a new landscape grow-in period; 2) with Smart Watering, and let local weather conditions determine the schedule.\n\nMULTI-SITE MANAGEMENT – You can manage and control an unlimited number of B-hyve controllers from the convenience of one application.  Once the timer is connected to the Internet, secure access can be shared in a number of different combinations using an app-generated code.\n\nCATCH CUPS – With various water savings options integrated right into the app, there are multiple ways to achieve optimum water savings with the B-hyve Pro Timer.  In addition to Smart Watering, it incorporates the award-winning catch-cup feature right into the app to deliver up to 25% more water savings over other smart controllers.\n\nALEXA – Works with Alexa.

From Polynesian (Tahitian, Samoan, Tongan, etc.) tatau. In Marquesan, tatu.\" Before the importation of the Polynesian word, the practice of tattooing had been described in the West as pricking, painting, or staining. Sailors on the voyage later introduced both the word and reintroduced the concept of tattooing to Europe.\n\nThis is not to be confused with the origins of the word for the military drumbeat — see military tattoo. In this case, the English word tattoo is derived from the Dutch word taptoe (OED).\n\nThe first written reference to the word tattoo (or tatau), appears in the journal of Joseph Banks (24 February 1743 – 19 June 1820), the naturalist aboard Captain Cook's ship the HMS Endeavour: \"I shall now mention the way they mark themselves indelibly, each of them is so marked by their humor or disposition\".\n\nThe word \"tattoo\" was brought to Europe by the explorer James Cook, when he returned in 1771 from his first voyage to Tahiti and New Zealand. In his narrative of the voyage, he refers to an operation called \"tattaw\". Before this it had been described as scarring, painting, or staining\n\nTattoo enthusiasts may refer to tattoos as \"ink\", \"pieces\", \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"tats\", or \"work\"; to the creators as \"tattoo artists\", \"tattooers\", or \"tattooists\"; and to places where they work as \"tattoo shops\", \"tattoo studios\", or \"tattoo parlors\".\n\n\nA tattooed man's back, Japan, c. 1875\nUsage of the terms \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"pieces\", and work\" is gaining greater support,[citation needed] with mainstream art galleries holding exhibitions of both conventional and custom tattoo designs. Beyond Skin, at the Museum of Croydon, is an example of this as it challenges the stereotypical view of tattoos and who has them. Copyrighted tattoo designs that are mass-produced and sent to tattoo artists are known as \"flash\", a notable instance of industrial design. Flash sheets are prominently displayed in many tattoo parlors for the purpose of providing both inspiration and ready-made tattoo images to customers.\n\nThe Japanese word irezumi means \"insertion of ink\" and can mean tattoos using tebori, the traditional Japanese hand method, a Western-style machine, or for that matter, any method of tattooing using insertion of ink. The most common word used for traditional Japanese tattoo designs is Horimono. Japanese may use the word \"tattoo\" to mean non-Japanese styles of tattooing."

Designed to create a deeply relaxed state  of mind and empowered labour and birth. \n\nCreated by women for women, iHypnobirth, will help you feel positive about birthing your baby. \n\niHypnobirth contains tailored meditations for self-hypnosis and positive birth affirmations each created specifically for labour and birth.\n\niHypnobirth features the following hypnosis tracks; \n\n-Guided relaxation for self-hypnosis \nA guided hypnosis that prepares the mind for a relaxed state of mind and calm birth \n\n-Guided meditation with positive birth affirmations audio\nA longer relaxation with positive birth affirmations that will resonate deep within the sub-conscious\n\n-Positive birth affirmations \nThese are positive statements about pregnancy and birth which resonate within the sub-conscious allowing you to embrace a positive birth experience \n\niHypnobirth was created by Psychologist & hypnatal practitioner Dr Alex McKay and NLP trained Charlotte Maslen. With six children between them they have first-hand experience of the power that self-hypnosis and positive affirmations have on pregnancy and birth. They believe that women deserve positive, empowered birth experiences and have created this app to equip them with the skills to achieve this. The effectiveness of hypnosis and relaxation on positive birth outcomes (shorter labour, lower rates of medical intervention, less medication use) is well documented in a number of research studies. \n\niHypnobirth teaches you that birth does not have to be full of fear, instead it will equip you with tools that can create a positive birthing experience, helping you to prepare both physically and emotionally.\n\nBy listening to the relaxation and positive affirmations regularly during pregnancy, this app will enable you to practice deep relaxation, effective breathing and positive visualisations to help you to have a calm, controlled, and empowered birth experience. If you learn to condition your body now it will be much easier to slip into a relaxed state during your labour and birth - and even after your baby is born these techniques will serve you well.\n\nBenefits of using hypnotherapy for birth \n\n-Positive approach birth\n-Calmer pregnancy\n-Creates feeling of empowerment \n-Reduce anxiety \n-Helps bonding with baby  \n-Reduces labour pains* \n-Shorter labour* \n-Less likely to have c-section* \n-Less likely to have pain relief* \n\n\n* Statistics from the American HypnoBirthing Institute 2008"

      "label": "Take note of life with Chronicle, a simple journaling app that offers more than bound sheets without overcomplicating the writing experience. \n\nFocused writing. Multiple photos per entry that you can move, resize, rotate - your words flow around them. A recent New York Magazine article cites research showing people experienced improvement in \"physical and mental well-being. They were happier, less depressed and less anxious\" after writing about emotional or stressful events for a few days.\n\nStart writing more, today. Reliable storage, autosave, and passcode lock protect your words; share or read them on your computer with PDF, text, and email export. You can also create backups and save them to other apps such as Dropbox, Drive, and Evernote.\n\nYour journal will never run out of pages, but you can manage different topics or years in separate journals with the notebooks add-on.\n\nTake a break from social networks. Write comfortably knowing you can find anything you wrote with built-in search. Search results include relevant snippets of text so you can easily find the exact entry you’re looking for.\n\nAccording to a Harvard Business School paper, taking 15 minutes to reflect on your work at end of the workday can boost job performance (the study's journaling group performed 22.8% better on a test than the control group that simply continued working).\n\nStart keeping a journal or diary. Organize chapters for a novel. Jot down notes and ideas. You can always export what you’ve written for safekeeping. \n\nWHAT OTHERS SAY\n\n* \"A great app - probably my favourite app on my new iPad actually.

Chronicle remembers the last entry you were on.\n* Arrange your photos by dragging them; rotate with two fingers\n* Autosave and undo while you're writing\n\nEXTRA JOURNALS\n\nIf you need a way to organize your writing, get the Notebooks add-on with in-app purchase. The cover is styled based on your text settings within the notebook. Unlimited notebooks you can drag and reorder.\n\nACCESSIBLE\n\nNo need to squint. In addition to being able to adjust the journal's font size, you can change the system's Text Size from the Settings app to make the UI text in Chronicle easy to read. I've also added accessibility and VoiceOver improvements.\n\n\nThank you for all of the emails with compliments and suggestions!

      "label": "The FOUNDATION FOR INNER PEACE, original publisher of \"A Course in Miracles,\" has joined with CDE Solutions to produce this app as an aid to those working on their daily lessons from the Workbook of the Course. -- NOW AVAILABLE IN 5 LANGUAGES: English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish. As a student of the Course have you ever spent time studying your lesson in the morning only to forget to review it at the suggested time intervals during the day? Have you ever wished that you had reminders, preset at the required time intervals, to jog your memory? Have you ever remembered to review a lesson but forgot what words to use? If so, then this app is for you!\n\nIn addition to providing convenient access to the full text of the 365 daily lessons from the Course's \"Workbook for Students,\" THIS APP HAS BUILT-IN REMINDER ALERTS which have been preset with specific text to be remembered for the day and the time intervals as suggested within the lessons of the Workbook. For lessons that have no suggested time intervals, you can select a time interval of your choice. You can even override Course specified intervals to time intervals of your choice that fit in with your daily schedule. The app is simple to use. To begin you would select the lesson you are currently working on from a rotating \"wheel,\" then when the wheel stops on your lesson of the day you click on \"Full Text\" and you are presented with the full text of the lesson. Once your beginning lesson has been selected you will be presented with the same lesson when you return the next day. This allows you review the previous lesson, or move on to your daily lesson. The complete Workbook, including Introductions, can be accessed from the wheel. During the day, shortened text (the words suggested within the Workbook lesson to be used as the reminder that day) is presented when the reminder alert is sounded. These words can be changed to whatever words you would prefer to use instead. In addition, you can choose what sound you’d like to hear as a reminder, when you want the reminder to start, and when you want it to end.\n\nYou purchase the app ONLY ONCE for all devices.\n\nAbout \"A Course in Miracles\":\n\nThe Course’s teaching is based on the practice of forgiveness as the key to inner peace and the remembrance of God. While the app contains the text of the complete \"Workbook for Students\", it represents only part of the Course, a unique self-study metaphysical thought system.\n\nPublished in one volume, \"A Course in Miracles\" consists of three separate sections: \"Text\", \"Workbook for Students\" and the \"Manual for Teachers\". The \"Text\" section of the Course sets forth the theoretical concepts of the Course's thought system and thus provides the necessary framework to clarify the meaning of the \"Workbook\" exercises. It is therefore important to undertake the lessons in this app in conjunction with the writings within \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\n\"A Course in Miracles\" was received in its entirety over a period of seven years by psychologist Dr. Helen Schucman through an inspired process she described as scribing. In 1975 the Foundation for Inner Peace, co-publisher of this app, was chosen by Dr. Schucman to be the publisher of the only original edition of \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\nThe \"Workbook for Students\", contained in this app, includes 365 lessons which are designed to train your mind in a systematic way to a different perception of everyone and everything in the world. As stated in the Introduction to the Workbook: “The exercises are very simple. They do not require a great deal of time, and it does not matter where you do them. They need no preparation.” You are asked only not to undertake to do more than one exercise a day. You might however choose to remain with a particularly appealing lesson for more than one day."

      "label": "The pH – Alkalinity Adjustment Tool is an incredibly accurate tool for adjusting pH and total alkalinity up or down in swimming pools. In the past, you had four choices for making adjustments to pH and alkalinity:\r\n\n1. Guess an amount of chemical to add, wait for thorough mixing and retest the water in 1-4 hours to see what it did\r\n2. Make an Acid or Base Demand Test to determine the amount of acid or base by counting drops, looking up the amount in a table, and then adding it. But this only makes the pH 7.5 and does not tell you what the new alkalinity will be after the addition\r\n3. Calculate the amount of alkalinity increase or decrease, add the chemical dose, wait for mixing, and then see what the new pH is\r\n4. Use an app or water analyzer that supposedly gives correct chemical amounts but only gives an amount for pH or alkalinity adjustment\r\n\r\nNone of these methods are acceptable or accurate and they require waiting and retesting.\r\n\r\nNow with the pH – Alkalinity Adjustment Tool, you input the pool volume and water conditions and it calculates the exact amount of chemicals to add to reach either a Target Alkalinity (and it provides you with a new pH) or to reach a Target pH (and it provides a new Alkalinity). We call this pH Priority and Alkalinity Priority. \r\n\r\nYou enter Pool Volume and levels for CYA, Borate, Calcium Hardness, Salt or TDS, and Temperature on the first screen. Then on the second screen, you enter Current pH and Current Alk in the yellow cells near the top and then enter Target pH in the yellow cell in the red pH Priority Section and Target Alkalinity in the yellow cell in the green Alkalinity Priority section. You instantly see the chemical amounts needed for obtaining either pH Priority (red section) or Alkalinity Priority (green section).\r\n\r\nThere is also a note below the green section stating that when alkalinity is on Target and pH is less than 7.5, aerate and cause turbulence to only raise pH. By doing this you can get pH 7.5 and Alkalinity of 90 ppm.\r\n\r\nSo, you can choose whichever Priority you want – pH or alkalinity. You can also change Targets to see what it will do. The Conditions on the first screen can be changed also to see what effect they will have on pH and alkalinity. Changing any condition on the first screen will change dose amounts and New pH and New Alk on screen 2.\r\n\r\nChanging Target pH will change the chemical dose amounts and the New Alk.\r\n\r\nChanging Target Alk will change the chemical dose amounts and the New pH.\r\n\r\nThe pH – Alkalinity Adjustment Tool is an accurate and easy way to know what chemicals are needed to achieve perfect water balance. You can decide what Targets you want for pH and alkalinity and it will calculate everything for you. No more guessing and testing to see what changed. No more under or over-dosing. Save money by knowing the exact doses of chemicals and what they will do to pH and alkalinity.\r\n\r\nThe pH – Alkalinity Adjustment Tool is different from the Pool Acid Dose Calculator because the Pool Acid Dose Calculator only works for lowering pH and alkalinity and only from Current pH 7.6 to 8.2, Current Alkalinity from 70 to 220 ppm with a Desired pH from 6.0 to 8.1 and CYA of 0, 30, 50 or 100 ppm and Borate of 0, 30 and 50 pm. It also has 0.1 limits for all conditions. \r\n\r\nThe pH – Alkalinity Adjustment Tool works for any current or starting pH and alkalinity, any CYA, any borate, any calcium hardness, any TDS, any temperature with any Target pH or alkalinity, and it works for raising or lowering both with an accuracy of 0.01. It is also much more accurate than the Pool Acid Dose Calculator because it uses all sources of hydrogen ion (H+) in the water.\r\n\r\nThere is no other tool like this available for the pool and spa industry."

While our users contribute locations of their own, we comb the internet for pre-existing knowledge, seeking to unite the efforts of foragers, foresters, and freegans everywhere. Imported datasets range from small neighborhood foraging maps to vast professionally-compiled tree inventories. So far, this amounts to over 1,200 different edible types (most, but not all, plant species) distributed over nearly one million locations.

On Mac, Fliqlo has long been popular as a screensaver module with the same design since its first release in 2002, and this iOS/iPadOS app is also made with exactly the same design. With its large, highly visible font, you can check the time even from a distance. Also, in everyday life and at work, its modest matt black presence does not distract you or disrupt your productivity, even when using the app for extended periods of time. Its full-screen appearance integrates with the iPhone/iPad device body and blends into your living space ambience, as if it were a minimalist home decor item.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Switch between 12/24 hour clock\n- Switch between portrait and landscape mode\n- Option to show seconds when tapping screen\n- Brightness/dimness control inside the app\n- Show/hide background tiles\n- Enlarge/reduce to any size\n\nNOTES:\n- Your device’s Auto-Lock is disabled while this clock is active in the foreground.\n- This app does not start automatically like the Mac screensaver.\n- You cannot replace your device’s Lock Screen with this clock."

Currently this includes an on-the-fly pitch tracker - so you can practise different ways of speaking and immediately see their effect - as well as unlimited archive space, celebrity comparison graphs, and a charting tool so you can track your progress over time.\n\nWe’re working to expand Vocular to other areas too.

Each of the 100+ effects can be customized with your favorite colors. Just turn on your lights and let the SceneMaker run all night long. Control the speed of your lights with precision manual tempo controls or auto beat detection using your device's built-in microphone.\n\nHUE ENTERTAINMENT: Using a Hue Entertainment area you'll enjoy higher quality effects; all of Light DJ's effects respond faster and with better sync. Send waves of color across your room with the updated Groove Wave effect, or strobe faster with the Matrix controller.\n\nEFFECT MAKER: Create your own looping special effects with our powerful Effects Maker. Share your custom-made effects and effect sheets with your friends using AirDrop.\n\nIPAD VERSION: The iPad app offers a DJ Controller-inspired design for ultimate live-performance lighting control. Configurable sheets allow you to setup your effects and colors in advance, and big push-buttons make rapid changes easy.\n\nMULTI-BRIDGE SUPPORT: Combine lights from two or more bridges using the legacy effects or control multiple simultaneous entertainment areas.\n\nABLETON LINK & MIDI SUPPORT: Seamlessly sync tempo with other apps & devices using Ableton Link or MIDI Clock Sync. Control effects by sending Program Change codes over MIDI.\n\n--- Light DJ vs Light DJ Pro ---\nWant the full experience without having to worry about renewing your subscription?

You'll get the same benefits as a Light DJ Pro Subscription user without having to keep paying:\n-Full use of all of the app's controllers and effects\n-Universal access & cloud sync\n-Continual updates to support new hardware and features\n-Direct email technical support (I respond to every email!)\n-For more details see lightdjapp.com/blog\n\nVisit lightdjapp.com for support or check out video previews at instagram.com/LightDJ\n\nThis app requires hardware from one of these vendors:\n- Philips Hue : meethue.com\n- LIFX : lifx.com\n- Nanoleaf Light Panels (Aurora, Canvas, Shapes, Elements) : nanoleaf.me\n\n---------------------\n\nHi, I'm Kevin, the creator of Light DJ Pro.

Brilliant!.....highly recommended. Listen to what your dogs have been up too while your out. Very sensitive microphone. Absolutely genius app. Just what I was looking for to help train my dogs to be quiet while I am out and find out if the neighbours are over exaggerating. Picks up every single noise and very long recording time. Hope more quality apps like this to follow. Great tool.\n                          …\n\nWe recently got a rescue dog not used to having his own 'pack' and certainly not to being left alone. We were concerned he might be barking and that this would annoy or worry neighbours. We tried this app for the first time today and it worked perfectly! After an hour in, he started whining and barking a little, enough for the '20 second' criteria to be reached and the prerecorded 'quiet' message to be played. To my amazement listening to the recording afterward, he quietened down, was rewarded with the 'praise' I had recorded, and was quiet for the rest of the time we were out! Just amazing.\n                          …\n\nI would like to say, however, that your App completely solved my \"barking dog\" problem, and in one hit! Our dog is a reasonably well trained golden retriever, but our neighbour informed us in strained tones (so I guess it must have been going on for a while), that whenever we both went out, which was infrequent, the dog barked incessantly until our return. In more desperation than any real hope, I picked up my trusty iPad and googled.  Your App came up, so I installed it and tried it.  I had noted the \"Record reprimand\" and \"Record praise\" bits.  I was looking forward to hearing the result. From its first use, the dog, now, never barks when we go out, even if I don't leave the iPad! I think he's still trying to figure out how I knew, and was able to tell him off when he couldn't see me!\nCongratulations on a fantastic App!\n                          …\nPlease read the other reviews …"

      "label": "World first authorized Tesla app with Apple Watch & Siri/Shortcut support\n- Very reliable Siri & Shortcuts support that works even if the car is asleep. Control and get your car stats on the watch or phone without opening the app. You can combine/schedule/automate commands based on triggers/conditions such as when you're driving, if your charging cable isn't plugged in, when you're sleeping, when you're about to go to work, when you're connected to certain Bluetooth or WiFi connections, when you tap a NFC tag, when your alarm goes off, or a certain time each day. Add Shortcuts as icons on your home screen or widgets for quick access to your car's stats or to control it.\n- Fully functional Apple Watch app with vehicle stats complications\n- Opens, connects, and issues commands faster than other Tesla apps\n- Queued commands. You can close the app after issuing a few commands even if your car is asleep and it'll still do them.\n- View your battery stats such as the current/total usable kWh of your car compared to the stated capacity, how much phantom drain your car currently has, and a history of your car's range vs its odometer/time.\n- Display battery/power usage even when not charging\n- No phantom drain or background usage. This app doesn't use your car's batteries when the app isn't in use.\n- See the total miles/kWh added from the last charge session\n- Estimated range is displayed (this estimates your battery range based on your past 30 miles of usage)\n- Consolidated stats and commands into one screen for quicker access to information. View all three ranges (estimated, rated, ideal/typical, odometer) at the same time and up to the nearest 1/100th mi/km\n- See and copy the raw vehicle data returned by Tesla's API servers\n- 3D Touch menu for quick commands from the Home Screen\n- Use HomeLink or Summon your car when not near it and without continuous press needed (autopilot required). Activate keyless start prior to Summon to avoid needing a keyfob nearby.\n- Avoid idle fees from Tesla by setting an in-app alarm that alerts you when charging reaches a certain kW or % level\n- Camp/Dog Mode allows you to keep the HVAC on in the car even though there is no activity. Normally, the car will turn off HVAC after 30 minutes.\n- View how many range miles are being used per hour\n- Use the remotes:// URL schema with parameters to issues commands\n- Max cool and Max heat buttons to quickly send multiple commands to your car to optimize cooling and heating\n- No-Commands Mode lets you log in the app for your family/friends to monitor your Tesla's location without allowing them to control to your car\n- Breadcrumb tracking allows you to see the path that the car has recently taken\n- Trip statistics shows your current MPGe, kWh used, miles traveled, kWh per 100 miles, cost savings vs. an internal combustion engine car, cost savings over the car's lifetime, and many more fun stats\n- Save trip routes to different save slots and compare the distance, kWh used, cost, and more for each route\n- In-app browser can detect commands from javascript so that you can create scheduled, queued or repeated commands\n- Ability to change passenger and driver temperature separately\n\nPrivacy/Security notice: This app only communicates directly to Tesla's servers when sending login credentials and commands. No identifying information is stored by our company.\n\nDisclaimer: This software and documentation do not come from nor is endorsed by Tesla Inc. Use this app at your own risk.

      "label": "Words---words of new perspectives, words of an enlightening perspective, words that were once known but somehow forgotten---that's what these Well-being cards are about.\nWords don't teach; life experience teaches. But with these Abraham-Hicks words fresh in your mind, your every life experience will now be more meaningful to you. And since nothing is more imporant than feeling good, nothing is more valuable than these processes that will allow more of your natural Well-being to flow.\nHave fun with these cards. Let these words inspire thoughts that will attract to you more of that which evokes your greatest joy.\"\n\nFEATURES:\n- Browse The Teachings of Abraham Well-Being Cards anywhere, anytime on your iOS device*\n- Save cards to review at any time*\n- Email cards to yourself or share with a friend*\n\nAbout the Author:\nExcited about the clarity and practicality of the translated word from the Beings who call themselves Abraham, Esther and Jerry Hicks began disclosing their amazing Abraham experience to a handful of close business associates in 1986.\nRecognizing the practical results being received by themselves and by those people who were asking practical questions and then applying Abraham’s answers to their own situations, Esther and Jerry made a deliberate decision to allow the teachings of Abraham to become available to an ever-widening circle of seekers of how to live a happier life.\n\nUsing their San Antonio, Texas, conference center as their base, Jerry and Esther have traveled to approximately 50 cities a year since 1989, presenting interactive Law of Attraction workshops to those leaders who gather to participate in this expanding stream of progressive thought. And although worldwide attention has been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading Edge thinkers and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham’s Law of Attraction concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures, and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person to person—as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences.\n\nIn November 2011, Jerry made his transition into Non-Physical, and now Esther continues to conduct the Abraham workshops with the help of her physical friends and co-workers and, of course, with the Non-Physical help of Abraham and Jerry.\nPeople are able to access Abraham directly by attending the seminars in person or by participating in the online live streaming of most events. There is also an extensive YouTube library of Abraham videos.\nAbraham—a group of uplifting Non-Physical teachers—present their Broader Perspective through Esther Hicks. And as they speak to our level of comprehension through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant, yet comprehensively simple essays in print and in sound, they guide us to a clear connection with our loving Inner Being, and to uplifting self-empowerment from our Total Self.\n\nOfficial Hay House licensed App: www.HayHouse.com®"

DX Toolbox features several propagation forecasting tools, allowing you to quickly and easily estimate current HF (Shortwave) propagation conditions between any two locations in the world, and is ideal for the ham radio operator, shortwave listener, or other radio enthusiast. \n\nRadio propagation conditions can also be estimated between any two points on the Earth. Graphs of these conditions can be generated for a given frequency or time, and MUF/LUF graphs can also be displayed. \n\nA grayline map of the world is also available. Radio propagation between locations within the grayline region of the world is often greatly enhanced. DX Toolbox's grayline map makes it easy for you to determine where those locations are. Grayline propagation has been used by expert radio operators and DXers for years to catch elusive stations. A plot the great circle (both short and long) path between your location and another station is also displayed, as well as the beam heading and distance. The location of the currently transmitting NCDXF/IARU beacon can be displayed on the map as well. \n\nThe propagation map displays the areas of the world where your signal can be heard (or a signal can be heard from), based on the frequency, transmitter power, and current solar flux, date, and time.\n\nMaps showing ionosonde plots of foF2, foEs, and hmF2 data from various locations around the world are available. The MUF and skip zone can be calculated based on foF2 and hmF2 values.\n\nAurora prediction maps for the northern and southern hemisphere are available. \n\nDX Toolbox displays the following important solar and geomagnetic readings: \n\nSolar Flux \nA-Index \nK-Index \nSun Spot Number \nX-Ray Flux levels \nX-Ray flares \nSolar Wind \nEarth's Magnetic Field \nProton and Electron Flux levels \nRadio Blackout conditions \nGeomagnetic Storm conditions \nSolar Radiation Storm conditions \n\nGraphs of x-ray flux readings from the GOES satellites may also be displayed. \n\nThe following radio propagation reports and forecasts are available: \n\nWWV Geophysical Alert \n27 Day Space Outlook \n45 Day AP Forecast \nGeomagnetic Data \nDaily Geomagnetic Data \nDaily Particle Data \nDaily Solar Data \nGEOALERT \nDaily Magnetometer Analysis Reports \nHourly Magnetometer Analysis Reports \nPredicted Sunspot Numbers and Radio Flux \nReport of Solar-Geophysical Activity \nSolar and Geophysical Activity Summary \nSolar Region Summary \nWeekly Highlights and Forecasts \nCurrent Space Weather Indices \nSpace Weather Event Reports \nDaily Space Weather Indices \nSummary of Space Weather Observations \n3-day Space Weather Predictions \nSEC Space Weather Alerts \n\nIn addition, 21 maps of current D Layer Absorption levels are available for display.\n\nFull documentation on how to use the app is available here: http://www.blackcatsystems.com/iphone/dx_toolbox_faq.html\n\nGet your copy of DX Toolbox now, and you’ll always be up to date on current radio propagation conditions."

So, what else could I do but build her a replacement. \n\nAlong the way, we added some features that we think that people raising chickens (and other poultry) might find useful. \n\nThere are three parts to the app:\n\nThe \"Harvest\" tab is designed to be used on a daily basis when you go out and find the latest batch of eggs waiting for you to collect. Sometimes environmental factors such as light or stress can affect egg production. By tracking the egg counts, you can watch for these trends.\n\nThe \"Flock\" tab is for keeping tabs on the members of your flock. If you're like us, sometimes it's hard to keep track of who's who in the coop, so adding a picture and a name goes a long way. For the breeders out there, we added a family tree graph. We haven't done this ourselves yet, so any feedback is welcome.\n\nThe \"Finances\" tab gives you the ability to see (if you want to) just how much your feathered friends are costing you in feed and other expenses. Or, if you sell your eggs or meat, how much money they are making you."

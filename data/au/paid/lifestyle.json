      "label": "The B-hyve Pro App provides landscape irrigation professionals with an easy way to manage and operate B-hyve Pro controllers from anywhere with the convenience of a smart phone or tablet.  With the intuitive layout and design of the app, it is fast and easy to connect to any B-hyve Pro controller through WiFi or, if WiFi is not available, directly through Bluetooth right at the timer location.  Once connected to WiFi, B-hyve can be set up in smart mode to assist in delivering the right amount of water to plants, saving clients water and money.\nThis is the companion App for award-winning B-hyve Pro irrigation controllers. Homeowners can download the non-Pro version of the B-hyve App at no charge.\n\n***KEY FEATURES***\nWIFI and BLUETOOTH – Because WiFi is not always available on a job site, the B-hyve app and controller allow you to set up and operate the controller using Bluetooth. Once a WiFi connection is established at a site, the owner of the WiFi router can provide a permission code that enables off-site management of the controller from anywhere in the world.\n\nEPA- AND SWAT-CERTIFIED – Having passed the rigorous EPA WaterSense and SWAT certifications, the B-hyve Pro Controller with Smart Watering is certified to use water more efficiently and is eligible for rebates in many cities or water districts across the country.\n\nFLEXIBLE SCHEDULING – You can set the controller to water in two basic ways: 1) on a fixed schedule, such as during a new landscape grow-in period; 2) with Smart Watering, and let local weather conditions determine the schedule.\n\nMULTI-SITE MANAGEMENT – You can manage and control an unlimited number of B-hyve controllers from the convenience of one application.  Once the timer is connected to the Internet, secure access can be shared in a number of different combinations using an app-generated code.\n\nCATCH CUPS – With various water savings options integrated right into the app, there are multiple ways to achieve optimum water savings with the B-hyve Pro Timer.  In addition to Smart Watering, it incorporates the award-winning catch-cup feature right into the app to deliver up to 25% more water savings over other smart controllers.\n\nALEXA – Works with Alexa.

      "label": "Break-ups suck, but you needn’t suck at break-ups. Break-Up Boss offers advice and techniques to help the broken-hearted process their hurt, heal, and ultimately, see their break-up as the gift it is. Become the boss of your break-up. Own it.\n \nCreated by the author of Textbook Romance, and long-time relationship columnist at Cosmopolitan, Zoë Foster Blake, and with illustrations by Mari Andrew, Break-Up Boss is a modern, meaningful, big-hearted tool for the broken-hearted.\n \nHow does it differ from other break-up tools? Because Break-Up Boss firmly places YOU in charge of your break-up. Because you ARE in charge of it! And only you are. Stop letting your heartache and your ex take over your life, your diet, your social life, your job and personality, and start seeing your circumstances as an opportunity for growth. Break-ups happen cos something was broken. So fix yourself, love yourself, and move forward. \n\nBreak-Up Boss is the size of a self-help book, but WAY easier to use and digest. (A boss works smart, not hard, after all.) It reveals a no BS, non-waffly, non-naff, real-life strip down of the modern break-up, and enthusiastically encourages an empowered, big-picture, positive view of how to deal with one. \n\nFeatures include:\n\n- Use the Feel Wheel to read the exact advice you need at the exact time you need it…. because no two break-ups follow the same time line or even a reliable pattern, after all. (Are you about to see your ex at a wedding? Are you drunk and about to send them a text? Are you miserable and wanting to get back with them? We’ve got you!)\n\n- Send a fake text to your ex, so you don’t send an ACTUAL text to them, and screw everything up (or your ex)\n\n- Recieve daily pep-peps direct to your phone, so you’ve got some sunshine, power and perspective in your pocket at all times\n\n- SOS quotes that give you the exact advice, just as you need it. Like Goddess cards, only less… Goddessy.\n\nBreak-ups are a normal, inevitable part of life. And yet we are so bad at them. We let them completely hijack our lives, even though they force us to watch rubbish movies, and cry a lot, and forgo sleep, and eat rubbish.\n\nWell no more. Because now you can own your break-up like a boss. And you really, really should.\n\nBreak-Up Boss is proud to donate 10% of every sale to Safe Steps, a family violence response centre in Victoria, Australia.\n\n\"I just broke up with my boyfriend like literally 30 minutes ago and I'm already laughing. Thank you! I am looking forward to going through the shitty range of feelings with this baby beside me!\" - Sandy\n\n\"I love the app! It's so great to feel loved and supported and not feel like you are over relying on friends (who have their own lives of course).\" - Madison, VIC"

You can create Siri shortcuts and then say for example: \"Hey Siri, what's the current power\" - and hear the response.\nTo access Siri Shortcuts, tap the app menu in the top/right, then tap on \"Siri Shortcuts\".\n\nEvery watch complication type is supported, with special attention given to complications that use gauges.\n\nDuring daytime, the complications are displaying current power production, and total daily energy produced. Gauges are color-coded, and show the percentage of current power vs. the maximum.\nDuring night time, total energy produced during last day is shown, and the complication gauges act as a timer that counts down how much time roughly there is until sunrise.\n\nWatch app has a scrollable view with various stats, including daily, monthly and yearly total power, as well as environmental benefits and calculated revenue.\n\nAll this info is also displayed in the iOS notification widget, just a swipe away from the lock screen.\n\nBased on the robust and proven codebase that powers Thermo Watch and Watch Cam apps, enjoyed by tens of thousands of users. The app is extremely quick and efficient, with near-instant launch time, and seamless background updates.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nThe goal was to make a product that would not look out of place next to one of the apps bundled with the Apple Watch.\n\nPlease Note: SolarEdge admin console access is needed to generate the API key that is used to sign into the app.\nSolar Watch does not collect any of your data. Your API Key and any app activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and SolarEdge. Author of Solar Watch does not access any of it, at any point.\nSolar Watch is not affiliated with SolarEdge, but it is created with their approval."

      "label": "Ravit is a fun app that enables you to discover inspirational patterns and yarns, update your projects and stash and browse and post to Ravelry forums from anywhere. It's super quick, and it's friendly. Ravelry on mobile has never been easier.\n\nFIND INSPIRATIONAL PATTERNS\nIf you’re not sure what you’d like to make next, Ravit lets you easily browse patterns, favorite them, download and view pattern PDFs, view project photos and browse a designer’s other patterns and pattern suggestions. \n\nAnd if you want to narrow your search, choose from dozens of filters including craft, availability, category, attributes, needles, weight and more. You can even combine multiple options with AND, NOT or OR. It's powerful, but easy.\n\nThere's so many beautiful patterns on Ravelry, and Ravit helps you find them easily.\n\nTAKE RAVELRY TO YOUR YARN STORE\nFind out which yarns you’ll need for a project. Check what yardage you need. Look in your stash to see if you’ve already got a yarn, or one that’s similar. And because Ravit is designed to work nicely on your iPhone or iPad with readable text and buttons you can tap, you won't be squinting as you find all the info you need when you're at your LYS.\n\n+ Search all yarns by keyword, filter by fiber, weight, attributes and many others, and sort by options including 'Most projects' and 'Highest rating'. Quickly view pattern suggestions and projects for a yarn.\n\n+ Access your stash offline. No wireless or cell signal in your yarn store? No problem! Your stash is cached on your device so you can search, sort and view your stash offline.\n\nSNAP, EDIT AND UPLOAD ON THE SPOT\nPerhaps you're making a project on the train to work, or relaxed on the couch at home - whenever you are inspired to share your WIPs, Ravit makes it easy to snap photos, enhance with powerful photo filters, and upload to Ravelry, all from the one app.\n\n+ Powerful Photo Editing Tools - enhance, crop, and adjust your photos before your upload and show your work in it's best possible light. You can remove blemishes, improve color balance, sharpen images and access many other pro editing tools all from within the app.\n\n+ Optimized for Ravelry - before images are uploaded, they're resized optimally for Ravelry, so you'll upload smaller photos (up to 10x smaller!) more quickly and using less data.\n\n+ More than just photos - you can update notes for your Projects, Queued Projects and Stash, as well as most of the other info such as yarns, yardage, skeins, colorways, and color for your stash, and progress, link to stash, rating, craft, and tags amongst others for your projects.\n\nIT'S ALL THE LITTLE THINGS...\nSo why use Ravit? It's all the the little, sometimes hidden touches which make Ravit shine. Here's a few of them.\n\n+ It's quick - if you tap on something, you go right there. \n\n+ Infinite scroll - smooth, continuous scrolling as you browse to find inspiration.\n\n+ Offline - whether you're commuting underground, or you're off-grid, Ravit lets you access your Projects and Stash offline.\n\n+ Clean, uncluttered interface - we want your work and the beauty of Ravelry.com to shine. \n\n+ Use up to 50%* less data in Ravit compared with your web browser. \n\n+ Squint less - The text in Ravit isn't made super small, and we're fully Dynamic Type compatible, so if you change the font size on your device, it'll change in Ravit.\n\n* Based on tests of browsing patterns, projects, stash and yarns on Ravit and Safari on the same device - YYMV! (Your Yardage May Vary)\n\nTHIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING\nRavit has many features already, but we are constantly enhancing and adding more features. We have an active group on Ravelry and we'd love to hear what you'd like to see next - join in the discussion at http://www.ravelry.com/groups/ravit\n\nRavit is not affiliated with ravelry.com. It is an independent app, developed by a husband and wife team. You can read more about why we made Ravit at http://www.enhancient.com/ravit\n\nDownload Ravit now and hop on to Ravelry."

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

May I rest in our Oneness, dear Divine!\n\nIf you read the lines above and think, Easier said than done, this oracle deck is for you. In 52 beautifully illustrated cards, beloved spiritual teacher and author Tosha Silver uses her accessible, slightly quirky style to convey her key teaching messages of Surrender and Offering to Divine Will.\n\nThese messages, familiar to readers of Tosha’s highly acclaimed books (Outrageous Openness and Change Me Prayers), are, at their essence, about releasing attachment to ego-defined outcomes. Each card addresses a particular situation—Aging, Ambition, Money, Regrets, Solitude, Travel, Truth—with a comment or invocation that encourages you to offer your pain around this situation to the Divine, and to call in Divine Will for the highest outcome. Intentionally non-prescriptive, the deck can be used in a variety of ways: as an oracle where the Divine guides you to a specific card; to carry or put on an altar as a reminder to reflect on a specific issue; or in any other way you are drawn to use it.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Browse The Wild Offering Oracle cards anywhere, anytime on your iOS device*\n- Save cards to review at any time*\n- Email cards to yourself or share with a friend*\n\nAbout the Author:\nTosha Silver - Graduated from Yale with a degree in English-Literature but along the way fell madly in love with yogic philosophy. For the past 30 years, she has taught people around the world ways to align with Inner Love. She's known for finding fresh, humurous, and practical ways of teaching while avoiding cliche's and dogma. Tosha is the author of Outrageous Openness and Change Me Prayers. She lives near San Francisco, where she runs an online forum that engages these ideas, called Living Outrageous Openness: Think Like a Goddess.\nwebsite: www.toshasilver.com\n\nIllustrator Katie Daisy -Found her voice and honed her skills at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design, graduating in 2009 and subsequently beginning an adventurous career as a freelance illustrator and licensed artist.

      "label": "Whether you are a professional Paranormal Investigator, a hobbyist or just want to have some fun, this app works like a \"Spirit Box\" reading data from your sensors and turning it into spoken words.\n\nWith a database of over a thousand commonly used words, Ghostalker will read changes in all of the sensors it can find in your device. This includes sensors for the tiniest amount of vibration, rotation, GPS, gyroscope, light, magnetic fields, proximity etc. and convert them to words which it will display and speak. This app uses the actual raw data from the sensors to determine what to say, rather than picking words at random like some other apps.\n\nLOGGING: This is the full version of the app so it logs the words spoken for you to view, save, email, delete etc. at a later time. There is also a built-in log viewer. The date and time is logged, along with the combined change in sensor readings (so you can see how big a change was picked up) and the word. The log files are in CSV format so you can import them into your favourite spreadsheet (e.g. MS Excel or Google Sheets).\n\nDICTIONARY: You can also manage your own custom dictionary of words so you can make your own special list of replies. You can flick between the in-built dictionary, your own custom dictionary or both combined (from v0.5) at any time.\n\nThis app is not designed to form complete sentences so it is up to you to interpret what it says in your own way. Top end phones and tablets tend to have more sensors than low end ones but the app is designed to work with whatever it can find. The sensitivity of sensors will also vary between devices.\n\nTIP 1: Using the custom dictionary you can have it reply with special limited words, for example 'yes', 'no' and 'maybe' when you ask it questions. Or add a series of digits and get it to pick your lottery numbers. Or add the letters of the alphabet so it can work like a Ouija board. \n\nTIP 2: Paranormal investigators believe that leaving such devices running for as long as possible will allow \"spirits\" to learn what energy is required to trigger certain words.\n\nTIP 3: If it starts to trigger words constantly you may be getting interference from something close by. Try moving the device somewhere else or tap the 'Calibrate' button to get it to tune out background variance (although you will lose some sensitivity).\n\nTIP 4: NEW - Keep lists of custom words in text files. Each word should be on its own line or separated by a space. Select all of the words and copy them to the clipboard. You can then import them into Ghostalker by pasting them from the clipboard. You can also copy word lists from the web, an email, or anywhere you can copy text.\n\nIf the app does not do what you were expecting, or there is an issue with it running on your device, please contact us for help.\n\nThere are no adverts in this software. If you would like to try the free version first (without the logging or custom dictionary functionality), it is listed under \"Ghostalker Lite\"."

      "label": "Susan Miller’s Moonlight App features:\n\n• Know the times Moon is Void of Course at your current location and as you travel. \n\n• Explains the 8 phases of the moon (new moon, quarter moon, full moon, balsamic moon and, so forth), what each phase means, and how to take advantage of each phase by timing your actions accordingly.\n\n• It takes the moon 2.5 days to travel through one sign, so the app’s simple calendar reveals which zodiac sign the moon is traveling in for each day and the exact time it changes signs. Some signs that the moon travels through are especially favorable for certain actions—find out the details.\n\n• This app has no subscription—it is a one-time purchase. You get all the daily information you need through 2050.\n\nYou have heard the buzz on social media about “moon void of course” or a “void moon” (both have the same meaning). You may be curious about whether you should pay attention to when the moon is void of course. By knowing when a void moon is upcoming, you can schedule actions to avoid those periods to create the most successful outcome possible. It is an app you will use quite a bit—you will want to check it every morning. \n\nSome days the moon never goes void, other days the moon will go void for a few minutes, and still other days the moon will be void for several hours—possibly for the entire day or, in rare cases, for several days. Every day is unique, so the void is never repeated in the same way, the reason you need Susan’s Moonlight app. \n\nIf you schedule a meeting when the moon is void, it will either be cancelled, or the meeting will come to nothing. Things will go on as they have before with no change. You should not schedule a first date or a wedding during a moon void period, nor should you sign a contract, have a job interview, or meet with the press during a void moon, as examples. It would not be a good idea to buy an airline ticket during a void moon, for you may have to exchange it later. If your action is vital, avoid the void. \n\nThis is an aspect that affects everyone uniformly, similar to Mercury retrograde.\n\nWith Susan Miller’s new appealing app, Moonlight, void of course periods are easy to find, understand, and navigate. The information is written in Susan Miller’s signature warm, optimistic style, and she uses no astro-babble language to confuse you. Until now, knowing when the moon is void required looking up the moon’s void of course periods on tables that are listed by Greenwich Mean Time and converting to your location. With Moonlight, the answer is a snap on Susan Miller’s app.\n\nWhat is the moon void of course, and when does it happen?\n\nThe void of course period of the moon begins when the moon has finished meeting with the other planets and has made her last EXACT major aspect to a planet or the Sun. Just as importantly, the moon must still be moving within the same zodiac sign as she was when she started receiving the planets. Once she has met with them all and is finished, the moon will go void of course. \n\nTo be precise, the moon may make an aspect to another planet. It could be a conjunction, square, trine, sextile, or opposition. These are the aspects that were outlined by the ancient Egyptian astrologer Ptolemy. Ptolemy is considered the father of the Western astrology we use today, and we call these aforementioned aspects “Ptolemaic” aspects. You need not be concerned about knowing what these aspects mean—Susan Miller does the work for you.\n\nAfter the moon has communicated with other planets each month, the moon rests, and as said, that ushers in the void period. As she rests, the moon cannot lend any of her considerable powers to you. That’s not good for any of us. We need all the help we can get from the graceful moon on a daily basis."

Choose one of three pre-recorded interactive calls to reward nice children, discipline naughty children, or tell Santa anything you want, any time you want!\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\nJust select a call and start speaking with Santa!  Whenever you're done answering a question, tap anywhere on the screen, and he will say his next line of dialogue.  Calls are automatically video recorded!  It’s that easy!\n\n*** #1 USA ***\n*** #1 UK ***\n*** #1 Canada ***\n*** #1 Australia ***\n*** #1 Ireland ***\n*** #1 Barbados ***\n*** #1 Mauritius ***\n*** #2 New Zealand ***\n*** #2 Venezuela ***\n*** #2 Chile ***\n*** #2 Malta ***\n*** TOP 5 Hong Kong ***\n*** TOP 5 Lebanon ***\n*** TOP 5 South Africa ***\n*** TOP 5 Cyprus ***\n*** TOP 10 Argentina ***\n*** TOP 10 Belgium ***\n*** TOP 10 Jamaica ***\n*** TOP 10 Guatemala ***\n*** TOP 10 Vietnam ***\n*** TOP 10 Nicaragua ***\n*** TOP 15 Sweden ***\n*** TOP 15 Norway ***\n*** TOP 15 Brazil ***\n*** TOP 15 Portugal ***\n*** TOP 15 El Salvador ***\n*** TOP 15 Sri Lanka ***\n*** TOP 20 Spain ***\n*** TOP 20 Azerbaijan ***\n*** TOP 20 Indonesia ***\n*** TOP 25 Jordan ***\n*** TOP 30 Mexico ***\n*** TOP 30 Egypt ***\n*** TOP 30 Taiwan ***\n*** TOP 30 Kazakhstan ***\n*** TOP 35 Italy ***\n*** TOP 35 Japan ***\n*** TOP 35 Switzerland ***\n*** TOP 50 France ***\n*** TOP 50 Romania ***\n*** TOP 50 Ecuador ***\n*** TOP 100 in over 50 Countries ***\n\n*** Spanish Language Version now available -- \"Videollamadas Con Santa\"!!! ***\n\nThere are three different calls to choose from:\n\n1) NICE CALL:  Use this any time of year, when your child has done something particularly nice, and you want to reward them by making sure Santa knows just how good they've been!  Kids love it and want to do more nice things, so they can call Santa again!\n\n2) NAUGHTY CALL:  Use this whenever your child has been naughty and you want to get them back in line by letting Santa know that they've been bad!  This really works and immediately gets kids back on track so you won't have to call Santa about them being naughty again!\n\n3) SANTA VOICE MAIL:  Santa answers his video phone with his cheery \"outgoing message\", saying he's sorry he missed your call!  Just wait for the beep, and you and your children can tell Santa anything you want!  Simple, fast, and easy!\n\n*** WATCH YOUR KIDS GO NUTS! ***"

The inspiration in the form of your pattern library is right at your fingertips, wherever you go, and you can easily make sure that you purchase the right fabric in the right quantity - and with the right accessories. The app also helps you find inspiration on how to best make use of your current stash of fabric.\n\nThe app lets you gain the perfect overview in a single place, whether your patterns are purchased, found in magazines, or your own creations entirely. You can categorize your patterns based from standard garment types, or create as many of your own categories as you like. You can have your patterns sorted alphabetically, by most recent usage, or in any particular order you like. Each pattern can be associated with as many categories as you wish.\n\nIt is entirely up to you how many details you want to register for your individual patterns, but the more details you supply, the more help you will find in the built-in filtering function. When browsing your patterns, only the filled-in information is shown, so you won't have to deal with lots of empy fields.\n\nUsing the camera, you can supply your pattern details with pictures of the model, the instructions, or perhaps of the finalized garments.  You can add as many pictures and PDF files as you like, both for your categories, your patterns and your fabric.\n \nUse the Filter function if you need to search for a specific pattern in your pattern library, or just need inspiration for your next project, based on a specific piece of fabric.\n\nIn all aspects, Sewing Patterns is an indispensable app, for the experienced seamstress and the newcomer alike!"

Sick of being frustrated at your beloved friend? Remove this one frustration and love having your dog more! Puddle & Pile will quickly learn your dog's toileting patterns and alert you before accidents happen.\nWhen your dog relieves, simply bring out your phone and record the action. Over just a few days Puddle & Pile will learn when your dog needs to be outside and it will bark, so you can save your floor! Consistently responding to puddles and piles alerts by giving your pooch a garden tour will help you toilet train your dog quickly.  Record every success or accident and see how quickly praise outweighs frustrations.\n\n\n- Or why not just use it to remind you even with older dogs that outside time is needed.\n- Customize the background with your favourite pooch picture. It's your dog's App!\n- Grow together with more positive times\n- Share your dog's history with others who may be looking after them.\n- Share your dog's history with your vet if there are strange patterns for an easy diagnosis.\n- Inspired by a continual puppy raiser for Guide Dogs Victoria.\n- Thank-you for the positive feedback. Please rate this app positively if you find it useful. It helps more than you may think. :-)\n- ENJOY YOUR DOG!\n\nREVIEWS\nIt works - byOttlight - Sep 26, 2015\nI've been having a problem house breaking my 4 1/2 old puppy. I started using this app and she was accident free the first day. It's very accurate nearly to the minute she has to go potty. I emailed the info to the puppy class trainer. It's very easy to use.\n\nFantastic App!  - byHot K - May 6, 2014\nI LOVE this app. I really needed something to help me make heads or tails out of mine & my new puppies day so we could have a smooth, fun house training process. Well, this app provides that! It certainly delivers what it promises & more! The app is easy to use & fun. It sorts out all the patterns of our new Sproodle & I feel less stressed. Def give this app a try if you haven't house trained a dog before, or maybe even if you have :)\n\nGreat tool!  - bymanwdaplan - Apr 24, 2014\nAmazingly accurate at predicting my dogs needs. Also, a very simple and clean (and cute) interface that makes the training process much less frustrating.\nLove this app! \n\nbyJonasfann1 - Apr 20, 2015 - Really very cool for any owner of a new puppy! LOVE using this app!!"

Brilliant!.....highly recommended. Listen to what your dogs have been up too while your out. Very sensitive microphone. Absolutely genius app. Just what I was looking for to help train my dogs to be quiet while I am out and find out if the neighbours are over exaggerating. Picks up every single noise and very long recording time. Hope more quality apps like this to follow. Great tool.\n                          …\n\nWe recently got a rescue dog not used to having his own 'pack' and certainly not to being left alone. We were concerned he might be barking and that this would annoy or worry neighbours. We tried this app for the first time today and it worked perfectly! After an hour in, he started whining and barking a little, enough for the '20 second' criteria to be reached and the prerecorded 'quiet' message to be played. To my amazement listening to the recording afterward, he quietened down, was rewarded with the 'praise' I had recorded, and was quiet for the rest of the time we were out! Just amazing.\n                          …\n\nI would like to say, however, that your App completely solved my \"barking dog\" problem, and in one hit! Our dog is a reasonably well trained golden retriever, but our neighbour informed us in strained tones (so I guess it must have been going on for a while), that whenever we both went out, which was infrequent, the dog barked incessantly until our return. In more desperation than any real hope, I picked up my trusty iPad and googled.  Your App came up, so I installed it and tried it.  I had noted the \"Record reprimand\" and \"Record praise\" bits.  I was looking forward to hearing the result. From its first use, the dog, now, never barks when we go out, even if I don't leave the iPad! I think he's still trying to figure out how I knew, and was able to tell him off when he couldn't see me!\nCongratulations on a fantastic App!\n                          …\nPlease read the other reviews …"

These are: Entry (8-12 years old), Intermediate (13-17 years old), and Advanced (18+).\n\nWhat does this app include?\n- Three sets of 36 simple questions about how you prefer to behave, leading to the identification with a dominant and secondary totem from the four animal personality types that AusIDentities uses\n- In-depth information on how these four personality types communicate with each other and interact within relationships, the classroom and the workplace.\n- Explanations of how personality influences patterns of behaviour in people when stressed, choosing a career, and developing as a child and teenager\n- A promotional code offering a 5% discount on any purchase of AusIDentities resources"

This app shows you how.\n\nThe app details the right ingredients to use - around 40 per cent of the average dustbin contents are suitable for home-composting - and how to make your own compost bins. \n\nThe finished product is rich, dark, crumbly and sweet-smelling. It is made of recycled garden and kitchen waste, and can also include paper products. It is used to feed and condition the soil and in making potting mixes. \n\nHOME COMPOSTING is for use by all levels of gardener, from raw novice to experienced professional. The methods are also relevant for use by children, the gardeners of the future. \n\n\nHOME COMPOSTING is divided into four main sections: \n\nMaking Compost - includes basic principles, how to make compost, what you can and cannot compost and where to make it.\n\nCompost Bins - gives advice on the types of compost bin you can buy and how to make your own.\n\nHints & Tips - gives general advice on best practice, frequently asked questions, composting myths and how to get the best results.\n\nNEW Quiz section - test your knowledge of composting.\n\nBecome familiar with what can and cannot be composted. \n\nSee just what a wide range of materials can be composted. \n\nDispel common misconceptions. \n\nSee that there isn‛t always a clear yes or no answer to ‘can I compost this?’.\n\nPLUS an extra section which includes useful information on how to become a master composter, so you can train others, plus useful links and addresses.\n\n\nAbout Garden Organic\n\nGarden Organic is the UK national charity dedicated to researching and promoting sustainable growing, and has been at the forefront of organic horticulture for over 50 years. Garden Organic has aimed to ensure that this app will be of real practical use and cover every aspect of making compost using organic methods.\n\nOrganic gardening methods harness the natural cycles and processes that promote plant growth. The app will help users care for the environment and to cut their ‘carbon footprint’ by ‘reducing, reusing and recycling’ resources, while creating a flourishing growing space. \n\nWhy organic gardening matters\nGardening and growing offers great benefits for us all – benefits for the environment, for people’s health and wellbeing, for food security and for building stronger communities. Our outdoor growing space, be it the private garden, community garden, allotment, school garden, or just a small space nearby, is a place where we relax and recharge both spiritually and physically. It is also a place where we can learn and reconnect with nature and the food we eat and where we can take practical action to adopt sustainable lifestyles. \n\nUsing the organic approach to gardening and growing, which Garden Organic has been promoting for over 50 years, will ensure that these benefits can be achieved and enjoyed to their full potential."

From Polynesian (Tahitian, Samoan, Tongan, etc.) tatau. In Marquesan, tatu.\" Before the importation of the Polynesian word, the practice of tattooing had been described in the West as pricking, painting, or staining. Sailors on the voyage later introduced both the word and reintroduced the concept of tattooing to Europe.\n\nThis is not to be confused with the origins of the word for the military drumbeat — see military tattoo. In this case, the English word tattoo is derived from the Dutch word taptoe (OED).\n\nThe first written reference to the word tattoo (or tatau), appears in the journal of Joseph Banks (24 February 1743 – 19 June 1820), the naturalist aboard Captain Cook's ship the HMS Endeavour: \"I shall now mention the way they mark themselves indelibly, each of them is so marked by their humor or disposition\".\n\nThe word \"tattoo\" was brought to Europe by the explorer James Cook, when he returned in 1771 from his first voyage to Tahiti and New Zealand. In his narrative of the voyage, he refers to an operation called \"tattaw\". Before this it had been described as scarring, painting, or staining\n\nTattoo enthusiasts may refer to tattoos as \"ink\", \"pieces\", \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"tats\", or \"work\"; to the creators as \"tattoo artists\", \"tattooers\", or \"tattooists\"; and to places where they work as \"tattoo shops\", \"tattoo studios\", or \"tattoo parlors\".\n\n\nA tattooed man's back, Japan, c. 1875\nUsage of the terms \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"pieces\", and work\" is gaining greater support,[citation needed] with mainstream art galleries holding exhibitions of both conventional and custom tattoo designs. Beyond Skin, at the Museum of Croydon, is an example of this as it challenges the stereotypical view of tattoos and who has them. Copyrighted tattoo designs that are mass-produced and sent to tattoo artists are known as \"flash\", a notable instance of industrial design. Flash sheets are prominently displayed in many tattoo parlors for the purpose of providing both inspiration and ready-made tattoo images to customers.\n\nThe Japanese word irezumi means \"insertion of ink\" and can mean tattoos using tebori, the traditional Japanese hand method, a Western-style machine, or for that matter, any method of tattooing using insertion of ink. The most common word used for traditional Japanese tattoo designs is Horimono. Japanese may use the word \"tattoo\" to mean non-Japanese styles of tattooing."

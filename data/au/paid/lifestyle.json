      "label": "Break-ups suck, but you needn’t suck at break-ups. Break-Up Boss offers advice and techniques to help the broken-hearted process their hurt, heal, and ultimately, see their break-up as the gift it is. Become the boss of your break-up. Own it.\n \nCreated by the author of Textbook Romance, and long-time relationship columnist at Cosmopolitan, Zoë Foster Blake, and with illustrations by Mari Andrew, Break-Up Boss is a modern, meaningful, big-hearted tool for the broken-hearted.\n \nHow does it differ from other break-up tools? Because Break-Up Boss firmly places YOU in charge of your break-up. Because you ARE in charge of it! And only you are. Stop letting your heartache and your ex take over your life, your diet, your social life, your job and personality, and start seeing your circumstances as an opportunity for growth. Break-ups happen cos something was broken. So fix yourself, love yourself, and move forward. \n\nBreak-Up Boss is the size of a self-help book, but WAY easier to use and digest. (A boss works smart, not hard, after all.) It reveals a no BS, non-waffly, non-naff, real-life strip down of the modern break-up, and enthusiastically encourages an empowered, big-picture, positive view of how to deal with one. \n\nFeatures include:\n\n- Use the Feel Wheel to read the exact advice you need at the exact time you need it…. because no two break-ups follow the same time line or even a reliable pattern, after all. (Are you about to see your ex at a wedding? Are you drunk and about to send them a text? Are you miserable and wanting to get back with them? We’ve got you!)\n\n- Send a fake text to your ex, so you don’t send an ACTUAL text to them, and screw everything up (or your ex)\n\n- Recieve daily pep-peps direct to your phone, so you’ve got some sunshine, power and perspective in your pocket at all times\n\n- SOS quotes that give you the exact advice, just as you need it. Like Goddess cards, only less… Goddessy.\n\nBreak-ups are a normal, inevitable part of life. And yet we are so bad at them. We let them completely hijack our lives, even though they force us to watch rubbish movies, and cry a lot, and forgo sleep, and eat rubbish.\n\nWell no more. Because now you can own your break-up like a boss. And you really, really should.\n\nBreak-Up Boss is proud to donate 10% of every sale to Safe Steps, a family violence response centre in Victoria, Australia.\n\n\"I just broke up with my boyfriend like literally 30 minutes ago and I'm already laughing. Thank you! I am looking forward to going through the shitty range of feelings with this baby beside me!\" - Sandy\n\n\"I love the app! It's so great to feel loved and supported and not feel like you are over relying on friends (who have their own lives of course).\" - Madison, VIC"

Our algorithm analyses your voice and compares it with data from over 150 celebrities to let you understand your voice and learn how to improve it.\n\nThe Standard version of the app gives you a full analysis of your voice in terms of depth and variety and calculates a set of celebrity matches to give you a grounding of what your results mean.\n\nThe Pro version helps you improve your voice. Currently this includes an on-the-fly pitch tracker - so you can practise different ways of speaking and immediately see their effect - as well as unlimited archive space, celebrity comparison graphs, and a charting tool so you can track your progress over time.\n\nWe’re working to expand Vocular to other areas too. We want to cover things like smoothness, nasality, vocal fry, even creating a rating of how attractive your voice currently is, based on the latest research.

This list ensures that nothing is forgotten when planning the party and, in addition, can be individualized according to your wishes. Based on the date you provide for your party, the system creates a party countdown and helps you complete remaining tasks on time. With this, the App reminds you about the first outstanding task a month before the event. You are informed about the outstanding things easily through Push-Messages. This makes planning easier and ensures that no detail is forgotten.\n\n\nNow use the beloved Party Planner as a universal App (with the help of Dropbox synchronization), even together with your partner. Link your individual planning with one another this way and you stay in constant contact regarding the planning of your family celebration.\n\nThe suggestion as well as the manipulation of the guest list becomes child's play. With this you can not only constantly update your number of guests, but with the three-color classification, you can assign your visitors categories (Ex. Family, Friend, etc.).\n\nThe integrated cost calculator helps you keep an overview of total expenses, paid amounts, deposited amounts, and outstanding costs. Naturally, you can individually expand or minimize the categories of the cost planner.\n As particularly unique, the Party Planner overtakes the calculation of the average number of drinks needed based on your personal drink selection. For this you simply input the expected party duration as well as the drinking behavior of the party guests and what you would like to serve in what circumstance. The number of guests will automatically be transferred from the guest list.\n\nPost the status of the party preparations on Facebook and Twitter (this way your guests can constantly follow the current status of things) and if needed, use the integrated Address Book Import. It is also possible to call up the listed guest by the categories \"Name,\" \"Sex,\" and \"Status.\" \n\n\nThe Party Planer eases the organization of your all-around perfect, individual family celebration. Should you be planning a wedding or a children's birthday, we recommend the specialized Wedding Planner. Just search for \"Wedding Planner\" or \"Children's Birthday\" in the App Store.\n\nOverview of Features:\n• Universal App for Common Use (Dropbox Synchronization)\n• Party Countdown\n• Extensive and Individual Task List for Every Type of Family Celebration (12 Possible Selections)\n• Outstanding Task Overview\n• Changeable Task Planning\n• Push-Messages for Outstanding Tasks\n• Individual Cost Planner\n• Pre-defined, Flexible Cost Lists\n• Link to Facebook and Twitter\n• Flexible Guest Lists with Address Book Import\n• Control Function for Sent/Yet To Be Sent Invitations\n• Accept/Decline Function for Every Guest\n• Usable Guest Categories Such As \"Name,\" \"Meal,\" \"Children,\" And \"Status\"\n• Individual Drink Calculator, Adapted To Number of Guests and Drinking Behavior"

With the intuitive layout and design of the app, it is fast and easy to connect to any B-hyve Pro controller through WiFi or, if WiFi is not available, directly through Bluetooth right at the timer location.  Once connected to WiFi, B-hyve can be set up in smart mode to assist in delivering the right amount of water to plants, saving clients water and money.\nThis is the companion App for award-winning B-hyve Pro irrigation controllers. Homeowners can download the non-Pro version of the B-hyve App at no charge.\n\n***KEY FEATURES***\nWIFI and BLUETOOTH – Because WiFi is not always available on a job site, the B-hyve app and controller allow you to set up and operate the controller using Bluetooth. Once a WiFi connection is established at a site, the owner of the WiFi router can provide a permission code that enables off-site management of the controller from anywhere in the world.\n\nEPA- AND SWAT-CERTIFIED – Having passed the rigorous EPA WaterSense and SWAT certifications, the B-hyve Pro Controller with Smart Watering is certified to use water more efficiently and is eligible for rebates in many cities or water districts across the country.\n\nFLEXIBLE SCHEDULING – You can set the controller to water in two basic ways: 1) on a fixed schedule, such as during a new landscape grow-in period; 2) with Smart Watering, and let local weather conditions determine the schedule.\n\nMULTI-SITE MANAGEMENT – You can manage and control an unlimited number of B-hyve controllers from the convenience of one application.  Once the timer is connected to the Internet, secure access can be shared in a number of different combinations using an app-generated code.\n\nCATCH CUPS – With various water savings options integrated right into the app, there are multiple ways to achieve optimum water savings with the B-hyve Pro Timer.  In addition to Smart Watering, it incorporates the award-winning catch-cup feature right into the app to deliver up to 25% more water savings over other smart controllers.\n\nALEXA – Works with Alexa.

While our users contribute locations of their own, we comb the internet for pre-existing knowledge, seeking to unite the efforts of foragers, foresters, and freegans everywhere. Imported datasets range from small neighborhood foraging maps to vast professionally-compiled tree inventories. So far, this amounts to over 1,200 different edible types (most, but not all, plant species) distributed over nearly one million locations.

When a response is detected by the app the words will show visually in the text box along with audible speech.\n\nWhen you have finished your session just click stop. You can also look back at the responses you received during your session by clicking on the folder button (this only works when the scanner is \"Stopped\").\n\nThe EMF Meter only works if your device has a Magnetometer Sensor.

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

When its wisdom is sought with sincerity and sensitivity, this ancient Chinese oracle will promote success and good fortune and impart balance and perspective to your life. Its lasting popularity lies in the profound lessons it teaches about how reliance on one's higher qualities leads to life's greatest rewards: well-being, understanding, and peace of mind.  \n\nNow available as an elegantly designed and easy to use iOS app, it is both highly accessible to new users and a revelation to those long familiar with the text. Throw your own coins, or let the app cast for you, and make the wisdom of the sages your own. Includes a journal for recording your questions, results, and thoughts.\n\nBrian Browne Walker is the author of celebrated contemporary translations of the I Ching, Tao te Ching, Hua hu Ching, Wei wu Wei Ching, and Art of War which are published by Harper and St. Martin's Press and translated into over a dozen languages around the world. His \"I Ching, or Book of Changes\", long beloved for its clarity and accessibility, has received five star reviews on Amazon consistently for over a decade."

      "label": "Frisky Foreplay is an exciting dice game for intimate lovers. It challenges you to perform erotic activities based on what you roll. Play together through an arousing sequence of foreplay activities that intensify toward a wild, explosive climax. The game encourages you to sample various types and intensities of stimulation for a total sensual experience. The fun comes in how well you perform the foreplay challenges and how far you're willing to go as you both explore your sexual comfort zones.\n\nYou take turns rolling three dice (colored red, white and blue) and performing an activity. The ordered combination of dice maps to one of the hundreds of unique, gender specific foreplay ideas to enjoy. The red die indicates the intensity level and the white/blue combination points to one of 36 sexy activities in each level.\n\nNEW: Up to four players can now be set up in the game in any gender combination. Foreplay ideas include custom sets for threesome, gay, lesbian, and bi-sexual players.\n\nOf course, you don't just jump straight to the hard core, kinky stuff right away (unless you really, really want to). There are six progressively more intense levels of pleasuring to play through:\n\n - Warm and Loving\n - Sensual Sensations\n - Intimate Intentions\n - Explicit, Erotic Passion\n - Sizzling, Sexual Stimulation\n - Wild, Nasty, Kinky, Taboo\n\nAdvance through the levels when you roll a triple or when you've reached the turn limit. After each level change, you both strip an item of clothing and get ready for even more fun.\n\nBefore you begin, mentally prepare yourself and each other for a fun sensual experience. Give yourself time to savor every pleasure filled minute of your adult play. This sexy game is about exploring and enjoying sensual intimacy together. Although great sex is the goal, you're sure to get lucky with every roll of the dice.\n\nWhen you just want a few ideas to spice up your bedroom play, use the Random Foreplay Idea generator to quickly inspire a few new activities to enjoy. You can also use Frisky Foreplay with other regular games and turn them into your own sexy games for two.\n\nNote: Content presented in the Frisky Foreplay Game is of a sexual nature with intentionally suggestive themes appropriate for adult couples. The application is intended for intimate, loving couples who want to enhance their relationship. It contains textual information only with no nudity. You must be of legal age in your region to use this application and view the sexual material it contains. The full Disclaimer and Terms of Use can be found on our support website.\n\nAlways use safer sex practices and common sense when performing or engaging in any sexual activity. The sample activities in the game are designed for couples in a monogamous sexual relationship. All the foreplay and sex play ideas are intended to inspire your own erotic creativity so you can enhance your relationship with more pleasure and intimacy. They are only sexy suggestions for you to adapt and perform at your own risk and discretion."

What a sight!\n\nThe app has Siri Voice shortcuts, and they can be used to set your home into Away or Home state using Siri on your Watch or iPhone, as well as to display the live feeds from your cameras.\n\nThe app supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nWatch Cam lets you monitor all your Nest Cams from the Apple Watch or the iOS Widget.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Watch Cam complication to open the app. Swipe left and right to view life feeds from all your Nest Cams.\n• One of the watch complications shows you the snapshot from the camera of your choice, right on the watch face. The snapshot updates periodically all on its own, so you'll have a recent view of your camera any time you look at the watch. Useful when waiting for that package to arrive.\n• On your iOS device you can swipe to the widget panel to see what's on all of your cameras.\n• View the continuously updated Live Feed from the camera in the watch app, the iOS widget, or the iOS app. The feed updates with a new image approximately every second on the iOS and two seconds on the Watch - may be faster or slower, depending on your network speed.\n• Use the digital crown on the Watch to zoom in and out, or tap the screen to toggle zoom levels.\n• Use the pinch gesture on the camera views in the iOS app to zoom in and out. Single tap toggles the zoom level in the iOS app and the iOS widget.\n• Turn the device to landscape mode to increase the camera views sizes.\n• Double tap on the Live Feed view in the iOS app or the widget to launch the Nest app.\n• Set Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nWatch Face Complications can display the following:\n• Snapshot from the camera of your choice that updates periodically.\n• Status of all the cameras - if the camera icon is green, it means that all your cameras are online and streaming. If it's dimmed, it means that some cameras are off.\n\nYou can long-press the Watch screen for additional functions, like setting the home/away status, or turning the camera streaming on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nPlease Note: Watch Cam does not collect any of your data. Your login information, camera feeds, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Watch Cam does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

      "label": "Are you a ham radio operator or shortwave listener, in need of up to date propagation information and solar conditions? DX Toolbox features several propagation forecasting tools, allowing you to quickly and easily estimate current HF (Shortwave) propagation conditions between any two locations in the world, and is ideal for the ham radio operator, shortwave listener, or other radio enthusiast. \n\nRadio propagation conditions can also be estimated between any two points on the Earth. Graphs of these conditions can be generated for a given frequency or time, and MUF/LUF graphs can also be displayed. \n\nA grayline map of the world is also available. Radio propagation between locations within the grayline region of the world is often greatly enhanced. DX Toolbox's grayline map makes it easy for you to determine where those locations are. Grayline propagation has been used by expert radio operators and DXers for years to catch elusive stations. A plot the great circle (both short and long) path between your location and another station is also displayed, as well as the beam heading and distance. The location of the currently transmitting NCDXF/IARU beacon can be displayed on the map as well. \n\nThe propagation map displays the areas of the world where your signal can be heard (or a signal can be heard from), based on the frequency, transmitter power, and current solar flux, date, and time.\n\nMaps showing ionosonde plots of foF2, foEs, and hmF2 data from various locations around the world are available. The MUF and skip zone can be calculated based on foF2 and hmF2 values.\n\nAurora prediction maps for the northern and southern hemisphere are available. \n\nDX Toolbox displays the following important solar and geomagnetic readings: \n\nSolar Flux \nA-Index \nK-Index \nSun Spot Number \nX-Ray Flux levels \nX-Ray flares \nSolar Wind \nEarth's Magnetic Field \nProton and Electron Flux levels \nRadio Blackout conditions \nGeomagnetic Storm conditions \nSolar Radiation Storm conditions \n\nGraphs of x-ray flux readings from the GOES satellites may also be displayed. \n\nThe following radio propagation reports and forecasts are available: \n\nWWV Geophysical Alert \n27 Day Space Outlook \n45 Day AP Forecast \nGeomagnetic Data \nDaily Geomagnetic Data \nDaily Particle Data \nDaily Solar Data \nGEOALERT \nDaily Magnetometer Analysis Reports \nHourly Magnetometer Analysis Reports \nPredicted Sunspot Numbers and Radio Flux \nReport of Solar-Geophysical Activity \nSolar and Geophysical Activity Summary \nSolar Region Summary \nWeekly Highlights and Forecasts \nCurrent Space Weather Indices \nSpace Weather Event Reports \nDaily Space Weather Indices \nSummary of Space Weather Observations \n3-day Space Weather Predictions \nSEC Space Weather Alerts \n\nIn addition, 21 maps of current D Layer Absorption levels are available for display.\n\nFull documentation on how to use the app is available here: http://www.blackcatsystems.com/iphone/dx_toolbox_faq.html\n\nGet your copy of DX Toolbox now, and you’ll always be up to date on current radio propagation conditions."

Notifications will remind you when it is time to put out each type. Use the Apple Watch App or Widgets to quickly see your next collection.\n\nUse Siri shortcuts to ask when the next collection dates are for all bin schedules, which bin schedules are due on the next collection date, or when the next collection date is for an individual schedule. Manage shortcuts in Bin Day Alert's settings screen, the Shortcuts app, or in the Siri & Search section of Apple's Settings app.\n\nThe app supports a wide range of collection schedules, making it suitable for use at home or business premises: a specific day each week; multiple days each week; a specific day every 2, 3, 4 or 5 weeks; or a specific day on one or more weeks of the month.\n\nEach schedule can have up to two alerts. Each alert can either be for the day before or the day of the bin collection. Snooze an alert notification by 15 minutes if you're busy right now, or by 1 day/week if a public holiday has temporarily changed the bin schedule.\n\nGoing on vacation? There's a single setting to quickly disable all alerts.\n\nBack up your bin schedules to iCloud Drive, Dropbox etc. for safekeeping. Easily share your bin schedules with neighbors so they don't have to configure the app themselves."

Infant sleep trainer. \nIn the last 10 year’s, I have helped between 450 to 500 babies, with sleep coaching, weaning and working with parents on routine.\n\n\nYOUR PERSONAL SAM\n\nThe app is easy to use and intuitive, it is for parents who would like help in getting their little one to sleep in their crib or cot. I teach you my tried and tested methods with an easy to use simple app, with emojis and animations. \nAlso, voice commands, so that you can listen to me when you are busy.\n\n\nRESPONSIVE INTERACTIVE PROGRAMME\n\nIt is a responsive sleep coaching app, an interactive, detailed step by step guide, which gives you real time help, responsive to your babies’ reaction to sleep coaching. Helping little ones learn how to settle themselves independently to sleep without the need to feed be rocked or a dummy replaced every time it falls out. So that when they wake in the night or early from a nap they are able to go back to sleep themselves. \nA personalised graph showing your baby’s sleep progress by day.\n\n\nFULL OF ADVICE \n    • Bedtime routine \n    • Naps how many and for what ages \n    • What to do when teething or poorly \n    • When not to start sleep coaching \n    • How long does sleep training take \n    • What to do when away from home \n    • How soon will I see progress \n\n\nONCE DOWNLOADED THE APP CAN BE USED AT ANY TIME, SO IF THINGS SLIP AND OLD HABITS OR NEW HABITS START, THEN LOG BACK IN AND HAVE THE SUPPORT AND TOOLS TO GET THINGS BACK ON TRACK. GETTING THAT ALL IMPORTANT GOOD NIGHT’S SLEEP AGAIN FOR ALL. \n\n\nTWO METHODS FOR DIFFERENT AGES \n    • 4 – 6 months \n    • 6 months plus\n\n\nNB: Only use the programme if your little one is fit and healthy.\n\n*****************************************************************\n\nMore About Sam - Background\n\nSam Saunders - The Baby Guru, has been in midwifery and helping parents for over several years in the NHS and Private Sector.\n    • Sam the mother of 4, saw a need for a bespoke service to help parents with their babies, in their formative months, from thebabyguru.co.uk, was born.\n    • Being the go -to advisor and building up a fan base of parents around the world, Sam realised that she could not be in several places at once \n    • One day when she was in Switzerland she had a eureka moment, when clients were “whatsapping“ her in the middle of the night , and so due to popular demand the baby guru app was born \n\n\nWhat parents are saying \n\n    • Sam Silver – Co Founder -  Thisismothership.com  \n      “Sam’s help and guidance was invaluable in helping me get my three year old to go to sleep independently and sleep through the night \nHer tips worked fast, were efficient, yet still warm.” \n\n    • Sam genuinely listens to your concerns and provides practical advice and next steps tailored to your individual needs – she got my baby sleeping through the night within 7 days of contacting her. A good night’s sleep is invaluable. KR\n\n    • Sam’s work is truly amazing , she can make a massive contribution to a happy family life ."

Use the Tarot, Lenormand or Oraclecards in a selection of readings - or in a custom pattern according to your individual needs.\n\nDaily Card\nDraw a card for the day and get an outlook into the very near future. A daily card can also be understood as a hint or motto.\n\nYes or No?\nThe cards illustrate both possibilities and help making a choice between two options. This can be a yes or a no, but also something similar like join or stay at home, buy or save money, and all other decisions between A or B.\n\nThe Cross\nHow do I reach my goal? Five cards show which steps are helpful. They give suggestions by applying their general interpretation to one' s personal situation.\n\nFuture Reading\nA card reading that looks from the near to the far future. It also points to possible surprises.\n\nOracle of Love\nSelectable for singles or for relationships. Six cards look at both partners They show what unites and what separates. They give advice on how couples solve their problems or how two singles get together.\n\nOwn Reading\nDraw between one and nine cards. For a spread of your choice. You can create the pattern yourself or use an already existing reading, like the ones you can find in books or on the internet.\n\nThree card decks are available for selection. The Tarot and Lenormand are well known and have been around for centuries. The oracle cards in this app are more or less newly designed. The mysterious Kipper cards served as inspiration, although there is also a lot of creative freedom noticeable.\n\nAdvice for using this app and cartomancy in general\nBasically, the cards do not know the future by themselves, and their answers do not portray anything that will occur with certainty. They also do not show assured facts. Rather, it is a kind of game, which helps users to approach the truth through their own intuition and reason. It plays through possible developments and one one can also hope a little for a hint of fate."

If you move the device after it has been calibrated you will need to recalibrate, simply click the \"Back\" button, move the device to a new area, then click \"Calibrate\" again.\n\nThere are 12 music box songs that his app randomly chooses from when it calibrates.\n\nThe sensors used are:\n\nMagnetometer - This senses Magnetic and Electromagnet fields around the device\nAccelerometer - This senses any device movement and the slightest vibrations around the device\nBarometer - Detects any change in the Ambient Air Pressure around the device\nCompass - Detects the slightest change in magnetic interference to Magnetic North\nGyroScope - Detects the slightest movement of the device\nOrientation - Detects the slightest movement to the position of the device\n\nIf your device is missing any sensors, the app will still work perfectly well without them.\n\n\n** Disclaimer **\n\nUse at your own risk, I cannot be held personally responsible for you or any outcome (paranormal or otherwise) from using this app!"

So you just take a photo and do your routine work like washing your face or preparing breakfast. \n\nAnother alternative is using the step counter, which simplifies this process into just nothing. You wake up and go to wherever you want with the device. After reaching enough number of steps, the alarm will automatically turn off. It’s simply a smarter alarm with no additional action., You’ll love using it from the very first time. \n\nFEATURES IN DETAIL\n\n- MUSIC ALARM \no Wake up with your favorite songs\no Listen to them when moving\n\n- FULLY FUNCTIONAL ALARM \no Easy setup with hand-drawn mini-game\no Repeating rule for daily, weekly alarms \no Built-in alarm sounds \no Snooze, Vibrate, Fade-in & Volume for the perfect experience \n\n- MOTION TRACKING \no Innovative motion tracking system to sense your steps\no Smart anti-cheat system to make sure that you are stepping\n\n**IMPORTANT: We do not encourage our users to step so fast when you are not totally awake, this app will just recognize the steps when you aren’t walking too fast.\n\n- IMAGE RECOGNITION\no State-of-the-art image recognizing engine\no Can match both horizontal and vertical pictures\no Strict image comparison to assure you’re leaving your bed and your eyes opened wide enough to take the right picture.\n\n**HINT: Choose a scene that has a stable light condition for better matching results.\n\n- SLEEP TIMER \no Fall asleep with music \no Auto-lock and ready for next alarm \n\n- FLASHLIGHT \no Easy to find way through the dark when you are stepping\n\n- CLOCK \no Full feature clock \no Show/hide seconds, 24 hour format, …"

      "label": "The Dreams of Gaia Tarot is for those who desire unity within themselves, their relationships, and with heaven and earth.  It is for those who wish to explore, and develop a keener understanding of “self,” as well as those who seek to commune with the spirit realms and the Divine.\n\nThe philosophy of the cards is simple - to seek, to feel, to grow, and to heal.\n \nSeek – reveal the answers to the questions within.  Learn who you were, who you are, and who you wish to become. The tarot will help you communicate with the Divine, and your inner self; know your conscious mind, and explore the unconscious forces – the hard-wired beliefs and patterns that influence your behavior and choices.  Knowledge is power.  Self-knowledge and awareness are the keys to empowerment.\n \nFeel – delve into the watery realms of emotion, and begin to understand why you feel and react as you do. The tarot will help you shine a light on your emotions. It will allow you to explore their depths, and embrace the beautiful and powerful awareness that your responses and reactions are a natural part of who you are, but also within your power to control and change.\n​\nGrow – you are in a constant, cyclic state of growth and change. Growth and evolution are both inevitable and unavoidable, yet so many fear them, despite the fact that life itself is both a transformative and transmutative process. The tarot will help you to recognize and respond when a time of growth and change approaches, and to face it with increased confidence. You are here to live and experience life; to fear less and meet your fullest potential.\n \nHeal – there are experiences in your past that can do harm in your present because you have bound them to you by holding on to the emotions and beliefs they have fostered.  These bonds are the foundation of all that limits and restricts you in the present, and prevents you from moving forward with confidence and trust. Awareness will help you heal and let go.\n \nThe Dreams of Gaia Tarot will help you to rediscover your ancient and eternal connection with Gaia and the Great Spirit.  Regular use of the deck will bring insight and understanding.\n\nOfficial Blue Angel Publishing licensed app"

      "label": "Have you ever tried going on a shopping spree for new fabrics (in physical stores or online), only to feel completely lost by not knowing exactly how you would use that nice-looking piece of fabric, and end up purchasing the wrong thing - or purchasing the right thing, but in the wrong quantity - or worse, still: Leaving empty-handed?\n\nIf your answer is \"yes\", then Sewing Patterns will be your indispensable companion in the future. The inspiration in the form of your pattern library is right at your fingertips, wherever you go, and you can easily make sure that you purchase the right fabric in the right quantity - and with the right accessories. The app also helps you find inspiration on how to best make use of your current stash of fabric.\n\nThe app lets you gain the perfect overview in a single place, whether your patterns are purchased, found in magazines, or your own creations entirely. You can categorize your patterns based from standard garment types, or create as many of your own categories as you like. You can have your patterns sorted alphabetically, by most recent usage, or in any particular order you like. Each pattern can be associated with as many categories as you wish.\n\nIt is entirely up to you how many details you want to register for your individual patterns, but the more details you supply, the more help you will find in the built-in filtering function. When browsing your patterns, only the filled-in information is shown, so you won't have to deal with lots of empy fields.\n\nUsing the camera, you can supply your pattern details with pictures of the model, the instructions, or perhaps of the finalized garments.  You can add as many pictures and PDF files as you like, both for your categories, your patterns and your fabric.\n \nUse the Filter function if you need to search for a specific pattern in your pattern library, or just need inspiration for your next project, based on a specific piece of fabric.\n\nIn all aspects, Sewing Patterns is an indispensable app, for the experienced seamstress and the newcomer alike!"

      "label": "Pleasure Machine is a simple erotic game for couples with slot machine interface, and is ideal for heating up your foreplay.\n \nThe erotic slot machine features three rotating reels with displayed parts of the human body, erotic activities and time limits. By starting the slot machine, the first partner sets all three reels in motion. After the reels come to a halt, he/she can already look forward to the sweet prize - a random erotic experience being the combination of the activity, at which bodypart to be performed, and for how long. The partners take turns and so after the activity is over the other partner pushes the SPIN button and awaits his/her erotic price.\n \nBut be careful, because it is not always clear who is going to please whom. Each turn is a thrilling experience right to the last moment thanks to the negative time values on the time limit reel. When the negative time limit appears, the partner who spun the reels will treat his/her partner.\n \nIn this game, you can either use the provided slot machines or create your own. You can change the slot machines during the game to accommodate your taste for the softer or more daring tasks.   \n \nFor the quick start, there are five predefined erotic slot machines available, carefully created to avoid unreal combinations. You can adjust each slot machine to suit your preferences, and also to create your own.  There are many possibilities to think of and it’s up to you and your imagination which stimulating combinations you will create.\n \nThis erotic game is suitable for all couples regardless of their sexual orientation. Thus, each couple can spice-up their love life.  \n \nPleasure Machine is a game with erotic content and is for adults only. PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL IF YOU’RE UNDER 18.\n\nGame is also translated in Slovak, Czech and Polish language. You can set those languages directly in the game global settings."

These skills help children develop a sense of self-reliance and capability that will serve them throughout their lives. \n\nYou’ll notice that none of these tools include any kind of punishment, rewards, or praise (all extrinsic motivators that research keeps showing over and over again do not work). These are tools that provide intrinsic motivation to develop self-reliant children that become happy, successful, contributing members of society. Every tool meets all of the Five Criteria for Positive Discipline: \n\n1. Helps children feel a sense of connection? (Belonging and Significance) \n2. Is kind and firm at the same time (Respectful and Encouraging) \n3. Is effective long-term, (See the following two criteria) \n4. Teaches valuable social and life skills for good character?

      "label": "\"These unique runic interpretations reflect a depth of knowledge of this ancient divination system. Each rune is masterfully written and clearly communicated with powerful descriptions that allow the essence of the runes to be learned with ease. Working with this specific app is my morning ritual and a favorite way to start the day. I often use it for a quick guide to the day or when I'm searching for a specific answer to a question. The potential for the different layouts and the ability to read the meanings separately makes this app a must have for those into these sacred oracle stones.\"\n\nCeline Germain\nwww.forthebodyandspirit.com\n\n\"Runic Oracle is by far my favourite rune app!  Even though I have actual runes, I find myself turning to the app instead. I love the options for different spreads, and the descriptions for each rune are fantastic! Runic Oracle is eerily accurate.\"\n\nStacey Jenkins\nwww.everyonedreams.ca\n\nAt major turning points in our lives, we often benefit from advice to encourage us, warn of possible pitfalls, and show us the way of good fortune. Some people say that the world is so mysterious, that when something very important is happening for us, everything around us speaks about it, if only we could hear. We can even open any book at random and receive the advice we need from wherever our eye falls.\n\nBut isn't it better to use a vehicle especially designed for this purpose, one which has been used for divination for many centuries? Through divination, the will of the Divine, or perhaps something deeply hidden inside us, speaks the truth which we need to hear at the time.\n\nThis program has been carefully devised to make it conform with traditional Runic Divination. The Runic Oracle has been used successfully for many years, and has consistently worked well. The important point to remember when using it is that, somehow, it is deeply connected with our inner selves. If you approach the Oracle seriously and sincerely, its advice will be revealing. If you treat it like a joke, you'll get a joke response."

The app is a combination of the use of digital art and effects techniques created by Sensory over the years, alongside the influence of abstract expressionist artists.\n\nThe concept for this app is to create a calm, visual experience, with slow emerging shapes. There is a vast combination of layouts and colours to enjoy, and a range of styles pressing the left/right arrows. Sensory Abstract #2 is a moving display of unique digital effects combinations.\n\nThe projection capabilities of the phone or tablet gives the option for galleries, sensory rooms, theatres and relaxing environments to run the app on large screens. Just choose the effect you prefer, using the on screen buttons and let it flow. Tap the screen (or press 5) and the on screen buttons will disappear.\n\nYou can control the app with the bluetooth keyboard characters 1,2,3,4,5, +, - , space bar and enter key.  This also allows any bluetooth access switch systems that can deliver the above characters to the computer.\n\nKeyboard 1 (button 1) or Space Bar changes the background effect\nKeyboard 2 (button 2) changes color of the main effect\nKeyboard 3 (button 3) or Return/Enter key changes style of the main effect\nKeyboard 4 (button 4) changes symmetry of the main effect\nKeyboard 5 (screen tap)) hides and shows control buttons\n+ & - change to the next or last abstract visual if available\n\nSensory Abstract#3 contains no adverts and does not require a login. \n\nPlease view the app store or our website to explore our other abstract and sensory apps.\n\nAny queries please contact support@sensoryapphouse.com"

On Mac, Fliqlo has long been popular as a screensaver module with the same design since its first release in 2002, and this iOS/iPadOS app is also made with exactly the same design. With its large, highly visible font, you can check the time even from a distance. Also, in everyday life and at work, its modest matt black presence does not distract you or disrupt your productivity, even when using the app for extended periods of time. Its full-screen appearance integrates with the iPhone/iPad device body and blends into your living space ambience, as if it were a minimalist home decor item.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Switch between 12/24 hour clock\n- Switch between portrait and landscape mode\n- Option to show seconds when tapping screen\n- Brightness/dimness control inside the app\n- Show/hide background tiles\n- Enlarge/reduce to any size\n\nNOTES:\n- Your device’s Auto-Lock is disabled while this clock is active in the foreground.\n- This app does not start automatically like the Mac screensaver.\n- You cannot replace your device’s Lock Screen with this clock."

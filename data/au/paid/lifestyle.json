      "label": "Break-ups suck, but you needn’t suck at break-ups. Break-Up Boss offers advice and techniques to help the broken-hearted process their hurt, heal, and ultimately, see their break-up as the gift it is. Become the boss of your break-up. Own it.\n \nCreated by the author of Textbook Romance, and long-time relationship columnist at Cosmopolitan, Zoë Foster Blake, and with illustrations by Mari Andrew, Break-Up Boss is a modern, meaningful, big-hearted tool for the broken-hearted.\n \nHow does it differ from other break-up tools? Because Break-Up Boss firmly places YOU in charge of your break-up. Because you ARE in charge of it! And only you are. Stop letting your heartache and your ex take over your life, your diet, your social life, your job and personality, and start seeing your circumstances as an opportunity for growth. Break-ups happen cos something was broken. So fix yourself, love yourself, and move forward. \n\nBreak-Up Boss is the size of a self-help book, but WAY easier to use and digest. (A boss works smart, not hard, after all.) It reveals a no BS, non-waffly, non-naff, real-life strip down of the modern break-up, and enthusiastically encourages an empowered, big-picture, positive view of how to deal with one. \n\nFeatures include:\n\n- Use the Feel Wheel to read the exact advice you need at the exact time you need it…. because no two break-ups follow the same time line or even a reliable pattern, after all. (Are you about to see your ex at a wedding? Are you drunk and about to send them a text? Are you miserable and wanting to get back with them? We’ve got you!)\n\n- Send a fake text to your ex, so you don’t send an ACTUAL text to them, and screw everything up (or your ex)\n\n- Recieve daily pep-peps direct to your phone, so you’ve got some sunshine, power and perspective in your pocket at all times\n\n- SOS quotes that give you the exact advice, just as you need it. Like Goddess cards, only less… Goddessy.\n\nBreak-ups are a normal, inevitable part of life. And yet we are so bad at them. We let them completely hijack our lives, even though they force us to watch rubbish movies, and cry a lot, and forgo sleep, and eat rubbish.\n\nWell no more. Because now you can own your break-up like a boss. And you really, really should.\n\nBreak-Up Boss is proud to donate 10% of every sale to Safe Steps, a family violence response centre in Victoria, Australia.\n\n\"I just broke up with my boyfriend like literally 30 minutes ago and I'm already laughing. Thank you! I am looking forward to going through the shitty range of feelings with this baby beside me!\" - Sandy\n\n\"I love the app! It's so great to feel loved and supported and not feel like you are over relying on friends (who have their own lives of course).\" - Madison, VIC"

From Polynesian (Tahitian, Samoan, Tongan, etc.) tatau. In Marquesan, tatu.\" Before the importation of the Polynesian word, the practice of tattooing had been described in the West as pricking, painting, or staining. Sailors on the voyage later introduced both the word and reintroduced the concept of tattooing to Europe.\n\nThis is not to be confused with the origins of the word for the military drumbeat — see military tattoo. In this case, the English word tattoo is derived from the Dutch word taptoe (OED).\n\nThe first written reference to the word tattoo (or tatau), appears in the journal of Joseph Banks (24 February 1743 – 19 June 1820), the naturalist aboard Captain Cook's ship the HMS Endeavour: \"I shall now mention the way they mark themselves indelibly, each of them is so marked by their humor or disposition\".\n\nThe word \"tattoo\" was brought to Europe by the explorer James Cook, when he returned in 1771 from his first voyage to Tahiti and New Zealand. In his narrative of the voyage, he refers to an operation called \"tattaw\". Before this it had been described as scarring, painting, or staining\n\nTattoo enthusiasts may refer to tattoos as \"ink\", \"pieces\", \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"tats\", or \"work\"; to the creators as \"tattoo artists\", \"tattooers\", or \"tattooists\"; and to places where they work as \"tattoo shops\", \"tattoo studios\", or \"tattoo parlors\".\n\n\nA tattooed man's back, Japan, c. 1875\nUsage of the terms \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"pieces\", and work\" is gaining greater support,[citation needed] with mainstream art galleries holding exhibitions of both conventional and custom tattoo designs. Beyond Skin, at the Museum of Croydon, is an example of this as it challenges the stereotypical view of tattoos and who has them. Copyrighted tattoo designs that are mass-produced and sent to tattoo artists are known as \"flash\", a notable instance of industrial design. Flash sheets are prominently displayed in many tattoo parlors for the purpose of providing both inspiration and ready-made tattoo images to customers.\n\nThe Japanese word irezumi means \"insertion of ink\" and can mean tattoos using tebori, the traditional Japanese hand method, a Western-style machine, or for that matter, any method of tattooing using insertion of ink. The most common word used for traditional Japanese tattoo designs is Horimono. Japanese may use the word \"tattoo\" to mean non-Japanese styles of tattooing."

      "label": "The B-hyve Pro App provides landscape irrigation professionals with an easy way to manage and operate B-hyve Pro controllers from anywhere with the convenience of a smart phone or tablet.  With the intuitive layout and design of the app, it is fast and easy to connect to any B-hyve Pro controller through WiFi or, if WiFi is not available, directly through Bluetooth right at the timer location.  Once connected to WiFi, B-hyve can be set up in smart mode to assist in delivering the right amount of water to plants, saving clients water and money.\nThis is the companion App for award-winning B-hyve Pro irrigation controllers. Homeowners can download the non-Pro version of the B-hyve App at no charge.\n\n***KEY FEATURES***\nWIFI and BLUETOOTH – Because WiFi is not always available on a job site, the B-hyve app and controller allow you to set up and operate the controller using Bluetooth. Once a WiFi connection is established at a site, the owner of the WiFi router can provide a permission code that enables off-site management of the controller from anywhere in the world.\n\nEPA- AND SWAT-CERTIFIED – Having passed the rigorous EPA WaterSense and SWAT certifications, the B-hyve Pro Controller with Smart Watering is certified to use water more efficiently and is eligible for rebates in many cities or water districts across the country.\n\nFLEXIBLE SCHEDULING – You can set the controller to water in two basic ways: 1) on a fixed schedule, such as during a new landscape grow-in period; 2) with Smart Watering, and let local weather conditions determine the schedule.\n\nMULTI-SITE MANAGEMENT – You can manage and control an unlimited number of B-hyve controllers from the convenience of one application.  Once the timer is connected to the Internet, secure access can be shared in a number of different combinations using an app-generated code.\n\nCATCH CUPS – With various water savings options integrated right into the app, there are multiple ways to achieve optimum water savings with the B-hyve Pro Timer.  In addition to Smart Watering, it incorporates the award-winning catch-cup feature right into the app to deliver up to 25% more water savings over other smart controllers.\n\nALEXA – Works with Alexa.

Purchasing the app is itself a tax deductible donation, and we greatly appreciate your support in keeping Falling Fruit online!\n\nOur global map of edible plants is not the first of its kind, but it aspires to be the world's most comprehensive. While our users contribute locations of their own, we comb the internet for pre-existing knowledge, seeking to unite the efforts of foragers, foresters, and freegans everywhere. Imported datasets range from small neighborhood foraging maps to vast professionally-compiled tree inventories. So far, this amounts to over 1,200 different edible types (most, but not all, plant species) distributed over nearly one million locations. Beyond the cultivated and commonplace to long-forgotten native plants and the exotic flavors of foreign plants, foraging in your neighborhood is a journey through time and across cultures.\n\nFalling Fruit is not associated with Fallen Fruit. Fallen Fruit can be found at fallenfruit.org."

The Aura Soma color-care-system® is a non intrusive, self selective, soul system.\n\n“Aura” means light, “Soma” means the body (Greek), or the being (Aramaic), or living energies (Sanskrit).　The Aura-Soma color care system connects the light to the body; it speaks of the being of light within and the living energies of light that surround us.\n\nCONSULTATION: Tap to make your selection of four Equilibrium bottles from a displayed set. Tap the bottles you’ve chosen and a message will appear.\nIn each bottle there are two color fractions. The messages of the colors are the doorways through which we understand the choice of bottles that has been made. Each color selection speaks of the superconscious recognition of the soul’s evolution, unique to that moment. – a recognition of the color code through time. \nThere is no difference between the consciousness that chooses, and the colors that are chosen.\n- First bottle: The Mission and Purpose\n- Second Bottle: The Gifts and Talents Bottle\n- Third bottle: Here and Now\n- Fourth bottle: Present Future\n\nNUMEROLOGY: Life Path Number (sometimes called the goal or lesson number) adding the birth date - relates to the subject’s circumstances rather than the person themselves. As this number is found from our birthdate, we can see how it can represent our circumstances, and what we can learn to express.\n\nLIBRARY: Includes 111 Equilibrium bottles and AURA-SOMA® New Aeon Tarot. Each bottle is compatible with numerology and tarot cards. The color therapy mode which reacts to the acceleration sensor will provide relaxation.\n\nThe Aura-Soma color-care-system® is continually being re-framed. It is about consciousness growth, bringing balance, ease and awareness to all levels of the body, mind and spirit, a means of moving towards positive well being and personal growth.\n\nLANGUAGE: English / Japanese / French / German / Italian / Spanish"

      "label": "Nothing is more exhausting than endlessly working on “yourself.” When you offer your whole Being fully to Love, self-acceptance arises spontaneously. May I rest in our Oneness, dear Divine!\n\nIf you read the lines above and think, Easier said than done, this oracle deck is for you. In 52 beautifully illustrated cards, beloved spiritual teacher and author Tosha Silver uses her accessible, slightly quirky style to convey her key teaching messages of Surrender and Offering to Divine Will.\n\nThese messages, familiar to readers of Tosha’s highly acclaimed books (Outrageous Openness and Change Me Prayers), are, at their essence, about releasing attachment to ego-defined outcomes. Each card addresses a particular situation—Aging, Ambition, Money, Regrets, Solitude, Travel, Truth—with a comment or invocation that encourages you to offer your pain around this situation to the Divine, and to call in Divine Will for the highest outcome. Intentionally non-prescriptive, the deck can be used in a variety of ways: as an oracle where the Divine guides you to a specific card; to carry or put on an altar as a reminder to reflect on a specific issue; or in any other way you are drawn to use it.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Browse The Wild Offering Oracle cards anywhere, anytime on your iOS device*\n- Save cards to review at any time*\n- Email cards to yourself or share with a friend*\n\nAbout the Author:\nTosha Silver - Graduated from Yale with a degree in English-Literature but along the way fell madly in love with yogic philosophy. For the past 30 years, she has taught people around the world ways to align with Inner Love. She's known for finding fresh, humurous, and practical ways of teaching while avoiding cliche's and dogma. Tosha is the author of Outrageous Openness and Change Me Prayers. She lives near San Francisco, where she runs an online forum that engages these ideas, called Living Outrageous Openness: Think Like a Goddess.\nwebsite: www.toshasilver.com\n\nIllustrator Katie Daisy -Found her voice and honed her skills at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design, graduating in 2009 and subsequently beginning an adventurous career as a freelance illustrator and licensed artist.

      "label": "Many people have watched or read The Secret and believe that you can ask the Universe for any material thing you would like and the Law of Attraction will deliver it to you. But of course it's not as simple as that. \n\nYou have to change the way that you think if you want to change your world, and in this special deck, Esther & Jerry Hicks help you learn how to align yourself and focus your energy to manifest prosperity.\n\nLearn how to create abundance by:\n\n· Focusing on what you want in your life and not on what you don't have\n· Seeing yourself as wealthy not poor\n· Visualizing yourself as enjoying the object or lifestyle that you dream of\n\nAbraham's powerful techniques will teach you what prosperity truly is and enable you to use the Law of Attraction to bring this energy into your own life. \n\n\nFEATURES:\n- Browse Money, and the Law of Attraction Cards anywhere, anytime on your iOS device*\n- Save cards to review at any time*\n- Email cards to yourself or share with a friend*\n\n\nAbout the Author:\nExcited about the clarity and practicality of the translated word from the Beings who call themselves Abraham, Esther and Jerry Hicks began disclosing their amazing Abraham experience to a handful of close business associates in 1986.\nRecognizing the practical results being received by themselves and by those people who were asking practical questions and then applying Abraham’s answers to their own situations, Esther and Jerry made a deliberate decision to allow the teachings of Abraham to become available to an ever-widening circle of seekers of how to live a happier life.\n\nUsing their San Antonio, Texas, conference center as their base, Jerry and Esther have traveled to approximately 50 cities a year since 1989, presenting interactive Law of Attraction workshops to those leaders who gather to participate in this expanding stream of progressive thought. And although worldwide attention has been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading Edge thinkers and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham’s Law of Attraction concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures, and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person to person—as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences.\n\nIn November 2011, Jerry made his transition into Non-Physical, and now Esther continues to conduct the Abraham workshops with the help of her physical friends and co-workers and, of course, with the Non-Physical help of Abraham and Jerry.\nPeople are able to access Abraham directly by attending the seminars in person or by participating in the online live streaming of most events. There is also an extensive YouTube library of Abraham videos.\nAbraham—a group of uplifting Non-Physical teachers—present their Broader Perspective through Esther Hicks. And as they speak to our level of comprehension through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant, yet comprehensively simple essays in print and in sound, they guide us to a clear connection with our loving Inner Being, and to uplifting self-empowerment from our Total Self.\n\nOfficial Hay House licensed iOS App: www.HayHouse.com®"

The app will analyse the colour or colours and tell you if they are likely to match your colour type. For example, you can  take a screenshot of a piece of clothing that you want to buy online and check if its colours will be a good match.\n\nYou will be able to share the results of your colour analysis on social media, by email, message, or save to your photo library.\n\n A note of caution: the colour type determined by the app is quite sensitive to the light conditions. The tone of the colour of your skin, your hair, etc. changes depending on the intensity and the temperature of the light. Please do not expect 100% consistency between the result you get in full sunshine, or on a cloudy, rainy dull day. Ideally, take photos in full daylight, avoiding direct sunshine. Also see how  your colour type can be affected by different lighting conditions - perhaps in the evening, in artificial, you look better in a different choice of colours than at daylight?"

      "label": "The pH – Alkalinity Adjustment Tool is an incredibly accurate tool for adjusting pH and total alkalinity up or down in swimming pools. In the past, you had four choices for making adjustments to pH and alkalinity:\r\n\n1. Guess an amount of chemical to add, wait for thorough mixing and retest the water in 1-4 hours to see what it did\r\n2. Make an Acid or Base Demand Test to determine the amount of acid or base by counting drops, looking up the amount in a table, and then adding it. But this only makes the pH 7.5 and does not tell you what the new alkalinity will be after the addition\r\n3. Calculate the amount of alkalinity increase or decrease, add the chemical dose, wait for mixing, and then see what the new pH is\r\n4. Use an app or water analyzer that supposedly gives correct chemical amounts but only gives an amount for pH or alkalinity adjustment\r\n\r\nNone of these methods are acceptable or accurate and they require waiting and retesting.\r\n\r\nNow with the pH – Alkalinity Adjustment Tool, you input the pool volume and water conditions and it calculates the exact amount of chemicals to add to reach either a Target Alkalinity (and it provides you with a new pH) or to reach a Target pH (and it provides a new Alkalinity). We call this pH Priority and Alkalinity Priority. \r\n\r\nYou enter Pool Volume and levels for CYA, Borate, Calcium Hardness, Salt or TDS, and Temperature on the first screen. Then on the second screen, you enter Current pH and Current Alk in the yellow cells near the top and then enter Target pH in the yellow cell in the red pH Priority Section and Target Alkalinity in the yellow cell in the green Alkalinity Priority section. You instantly see the chemical amounts needed for obtaining either pH Priority (red section) or Alkalinity Priority (green section).\r\n\r\nThere is also a note below the green section stating that when alkalinity is on Target and pH is less than 7.5, aerate and cause turbulence to only raise pH. By doing this you can get pH 7.5 and Alkalinity of 90 ppm.\r\n\r\nSo, you can choose whichever Priority you want – pH or alkalinity. You can also change Targets to see what it will do. The Conditions on the first screen can be changed also to see what effect they will have on pH and alkalinity. Changing any condition on the first screen will change dose amounts and New pH and New Alk on screen 2.\r\n\r\nChanging Target pH will change the chemical dose amounts and the New Alk.\r\n\r\nChanging Target Alk will change the chemical dose amounts and the New pH.\r\n\r\nThe pH – Alkalinity Adjustment Tool is an accurate and easy way to know what chemicals are needed to achieve perfect water balance. You can decide what Targets you want for pH and alkalinity and it will calculate everything for you. No more guessing and testing to see what changed. No more under or over-dosing. Save money by knowing the exact doses of chemicals and what they will do to pH and alkalinity.\r\n\r\nThe pH – Alkalinity Adjustment Tool is different from the Pool Acid Dose Calculator because the Pool Acid Dose Calculator only works for lowering pH and alkalinity and only from Current pH 7.6 to 8.2, Current Alkalinity from 70 to 220 ppm with a Desired pH from 6.0 to 8.1 and CYA of 0, 30, 50 or 100 ppm and Borate of 0, 30 and 50 pm. It also has 0.1 limits for all conditions. \r\n\r\nThe pH – Alkalinity Adjustment Tool works for any current or starting pH and alkalinity, any CYA, any borate, any calcium hardness, any TDS, any temperature with any Target pH or alkalinity, and it works for raising or lowering both with an accuracy of 0.01. It is also much more accurate than the Pool Acid Dose Calculator because it uses all sources of hydrogen ion (H+) in the water.\r\n\r\nThere is no other tool like this available for the pool and spa industry."

Depending on your location, the application choose the appropriate calculation method and Fiqhi school. \n\nFor an accurate location, please ensure that your location settings and your Internet connection or your GPS are enabled!\n\nNote about App features :\n-------------------------------\nIf you are familiar with Salatuk in other platforms please note that this version DOESN'T SUPPORT some features like \"Turn Phone to Silent after Athan\". Other features like \"Full Athan\" and \"Custom Athan\" are supported only when the app is ope. This is because of technical limitations. We will try to fix it once iOS system allows it.\n\nNote about Athan :\n-----------------\nSalatuk remind you that it's time for prayer with a \"4 takbeerats\" instead of full Athan. Because of technical limitations, it's possible to play full Athan only if the app is open. \n\nAlso, if you have problems to hear the notifications, please make sure to enable the following parameters in your device :\n\n1) Settings>Sounds>Alerts \n2) Settings>Notifications>Salatuk \n3) Your phone is not on mute and volume is correct\n\nNote about Prayers times :\n-----------------------------------\nPlease note that we pay attention to ensure that the prayer times of Salatuk are accurate. However, in some countries those times may be not exact. In this case, please refer to the official islamic institutions or mosques in your country and adjust manually the prayer times in the application settings.\n\nSalatuk supports currently 3 languages : Arabic, English and French.\n\nTips for a better usage\n-----------------------------\n\n1- In order to refresh the prayer alarms, make sure to open the application once a week. Please do so also when you change your location or timing (summer time).\n\n2- The prayer alarms corresponds to 2 or 4 Takbeerats. If you want to hear the complete Athan you should open the app at the moment of the Athan.\n\n**********************************************************************************\n\nتطبيق صلاتك رفيقك للحفاظ على صلاتك.\nعن طريق تحديد موقعك  تلقائيا، بإمكان هذا التطبيق أن يعلمك بأوقات الصلاة وكذلك تحديد اتجاه القبلة. تطبيق صلاتك يستعمل عددا مهما من الطرق الحسابية  المعتمدة في أغلب العالم الإسلامي. اعتمادا على موقعك، يختار التطبيق طريقة الحساب والمدرسة الفقهية المناسبة. \n\nحول خصائص التطبيق \n---------------------\nإذا كنت ممن يستعمل صلاتك على أنظمة أخرى، المرجو الانتباه إلى أن هذه النسخة لا تحتوي على بعض الخصائص مثل \"التحويل إلى الصامت\" كما أن بعض الخصائص الأخرى مثل \"الأذان الكامل\" و\"إضافة أذان من الذاكرة\" لا تشتغل إلا إذا كان التطبيق مفتوحا. يرجع ذلك إلى بعض القيود التقنية الموجودة حاليا في نظام أبل وسنحاول دعمها حالما ترفع هذه القيود.\n\n\nحول سماع الأذان \n---------------\nمن ناحية  أخرى إذا كان عندك مشكل في سماع التنبيهات، المرجو التاكد من أن الإعدادات التالية مفعلة في هاتفك : \n1) الإعدادات > الأصوات > تنبيهات التذكير\n2) الإعدادات >التنبيهات > صلاتك   \n3) هاتفك ليس في الوضع الصامت والصوت في مستوى جيد\n\nحول مواقيت الصلاة:\n-----------------\nننوه إلى أنه رغم المجهودات لتدقيق مواقيت الصلاة التي يقوم بها فريق صلاتك، إلا أنه في بعض البلدان قد تكون المواقيت غير مضبوطة بشكل تام، في هذه الحالة نرجو منكم الاعتماد على المواقيت الرسمية في بلدكم أو المسجد القريب منكم، مع العلم أنه يمكنكم تعديل الأوقات يدويا في نافذة الإعدادات.\n\nنصائح من أجل استعمال أفضل \n-------------------------\n\n1- حتى يتم تحديث إشعارات الأذان إحرص على فتح التطبيق مرة كل أسبوع على الأقل أو عندما تغير مكانك أو يتغير التوقيت في بلدك (التوقيت الصيفي)\n\n2- تطبيق صلاتك يشعرك بدخول وقت الصلاة على شكل تكبيرتين أو 4 تكبيرات. إذا أردت أن تستمع إلى الأذان كاملا المرجو أن تفتح التطبيق أثناء الأذان."

      "label": "Whether you are a professional Paranormal Investigator, a hobbyist or just want to have some fun, this app works like a \"Spirit Box\" reading data from your sensors and turning it into spoken words.\n\nWith a database of over a thousand commonly used words, Ghostalker will read changes in all of the sensors it can find in your device. This includes sensors for the tiniest amount of vibration, rotation, GPS, gyroscope, light, magnetic fields, proximity etc. and convert them to words which it will display and speak. This app uses the actual raw data from the sensors to determine what to say, rather than picking words at random like some other apps.\n\nLOGGING: This is the full version of the app so it logs the words spoken for you to view, save, email, delete etc. at a later time. There is also a built-in log viewer. The date and time is logged, along with the combined change in sensor readings (so you can see how big a change was picked up) and the word. The log files are in CSV format so you can import them into your favourite spreadsheet (e.g. MS Excel or Google Sheets).\n\nDICTIONARY: You can also manage your own custom dictionary of words so you can make your own special list of replies. You can flick between the in-built dictionary, your own custom dictionary or both combined (from v0.5) at any time.\n\nThis app is not designed to form complete sentences so it is up to you to interpret what it says in your own way. Top end phones and tablets tend to have more sensors than low end ones but the app is designed to work with whatever it can find. The sensitivity of sensors will also vary between devices.\n\nTIP 1: Using the custom dictionary you can have it reply with special limited words, for example 'yes', 'no' and 'maybe' when you ask it questions. Or add a series of digits and get it to pick your lottery numbers. Or add the letters of the alphabet so it can work like a Ouija board. \n\nTIP 2: Paranormal investigators believe that leaving such devices running for as long as possible will allow \"spirits\" to learn what energy is required to trigger certain words.\n\nTIP 3: If it starts to trigger words constantly you may be getting interference from something close by. Try moving the device somewhere else or tap the 'Calibrate' button to get it to tune out background variance (although you will lose some sensitivity).\n\nTIP 4: NEW - Keep lists of custom words in text files. Each word should be on its own line or separated by a space. Select all of the words and copy them to the clipboard. You can then import them into Ghostalker by pasting them from the clipboard. You can also copy word lists from the web, an email, or anywhere you can copy text.\n\nIf the app does not do what you were expecting, or there is an issue with it running on your device, please contact us for help.\n\nThere are no adverts in this software. If you would like to try the free version first (without the logging or custom dictionary functionality), it is listed under \"Ghostalker Lite\"."

      "label": "The MOST WANTED features in all drones: Course Lock & Home Lock.\nNow available for your DJI Spark & Mavic Air!\nAlso works on all DJI drones that use DJI Go 4. \n\nThe new DJI Mavic Mini will be supported as soon as DJI allow developers to build apps for it. Get ELIT now so you don't miss it.\n\n\"Now your drone can face any direction while moving.\"\n\n\"No more mentally switching left-right & front-back when the drone is flying towards you.\"\n\n ●●● Features that are already available ●●●\n• Course Lock - Any forward input will bring it towards the current heading & any reverse input will bring it away from that heading. No matter where the drone is facing after that.\n• Home Lock - Allows the drone to face any direction, pulling back on the stick will always move it towards the home point.\n• Normal Mode - Moving the stick forward will bring the drone to wherever it’s facing. If the direction of the drone is changed, the heading will change accordingly.\n• Elit works perfectly with iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch. Purchase once for all your devices.\n• Fully supports landscape orientation. Works seamlessly with your DJI Go 4 app.\n\nOh yes, it's a one-time purchase, FREE future updates forever. We have planned some big updates for Elit. You'll like it!\n\n●●● How to use? ●●●\nAs easy as 1-2-3.\n1. Connect your device to DJI controller & aircraft.\n2. Launch this app. Tap \"Apply & Fly\".\n3. DONE! You will be redirected to DJI Go 4 app. Continue flying your drone with the newly unlocked control mode.\n\n\n●●● What is Course Lock? ●●●\nThe other drones manufacturers call it \"Headless Mode\". It allows new pilots to control the input of a drone. They can set and handle the orientation of the drone without changing its direction. No matter where your drone’s front side is pointing, moving the stick forward will always make the drone go forward in your current point of view.\n\nFor kids & even adults who use drones for fun, flying a drone with Course Lock feature is the best option they can have. This feature minimises the chances of drone crashes thus avoids damage. Entry-level drones (such as DJI Spark & DJI Mavic Air) are the ones which most require the Course Lock & Home Lock mode.\n\nAny questions, request, etc. can be addressed to elit [at] danielvw [dot] com.\nAnd if you like Elit, please share your love by rating & reviewing it on the App Store. Thank you!\n\nHappy Droning!"

The inspiration in the form of your pattern library is right at your fingertips, wherever you go, and you can easily make sure that you purchase the right fabric in the right quantity - and with the right accessories. The app also helps you find inspiration on how to best make use of your current stash of fabric.\n\nThe app lets you gain the perfect overview in a single place, whether your patterns are purchased, found in magazines, or your own creations entirely. You can categorize your patterns based from standard garment types, or create as many of your own categories as you like. You can have your patterns sorted alphabetically, by most recent usage, or in any particular order you like. Each pattern can be associated with as many categories as you wish.\n\nIt is entirely up to you how many details you want to register for your individual patterns, but the more details you supply, the more help you will find in the built-in filtering function. When browsing your patterns, only the filled-in information is shown, so you won't have to deal with lots of empy fields.\n\nUsing the camera, you can supply your pattern details with pictures of the model, the instructions, or perhaps of the finalized garments.  You can add as many pictures and PDF files as you like, both for your categories, your patterns and your fabric.\n \nUse the Filter function if you need to search for a specific pattern in your pattern library, or just need inspiration for your next project, based on a specific piece of fabric.\n\nIn all aspects, Sewing Patterns is an indispensable app, for the experienced seamstress and the newcomer alike!"

These are: Entry (8-12 years old), Intermediate (13-17 years old), and Advanced (18+).\n\nWhat does this app include?\n- Three sets of 36 simple questions about how you prefer to behave, leading to the identification with a dominant and secondary totem from the four animal personality types that AusIDentities uses\n- In-depth information on how these four personality types communicate with each other and interact within relationships, the classroom and the workplace.\n- Explanations of how personality influences patterns of behaviour in people when stressed, choosing a career, and developing as a child and teenager\n- A promotional code offering a 5% discount on any purchase of AusIDentities resources"

He believes passionately that once the physical body dies, our spirit lives on. He has dedicated his life to his own spiritual development and teaching, as well as offering peace and comfort during times of loss and bereavement. “To see a group of students walk out of one of my workshops inspired, awakened, motivated, and energized is all the gratitude that I need,” John says. “If I somehow help them to start their own journey, then I’ve done my job.” \n\nAuthor of the bestsellers Power of the Soul, Born Knowing, Psychic Navigator, and 101 Ways to Jump-Start Your Intuition, John also hosted his own weekly radio show on Hay House Radio, Spirit Connections. He has become a familiar face on TV on programs such as the A&E special Mediums—We See Dead People, as well as appearing as a psychic authority on the History Channel’s Psychic History. John’s story was originally profiled on CBS’s Unsolved Mysteries. \n\nFor further information about John, to find out about his series of workshops and other events, or to sign up for his free email newsletter, visit: www.johnholland.com"

When its wisdom is sought with sincerity and sensitivity, this ancient Chinese oracle will promote success and good fortune and impart balance and perspective to your life. Its lasting popularity lies in the profound lessons it teaches about how reliance on one's higher qualities leads to life's greatest rewards: well-being, understanding, and peace of mind.  \n\nNow available as an elegantly designed and easy to use iOS app, it is both highly accessible to new users and a revelation to those long familiar with the text. Throw your own coins, or let the app cast for you, and make the wisdom of the sages your own. Includes a journal for recording your questions, results, and thoughts.\n\nBrian Browne Walker is the author of celebrated contemporary translations of the I Ching, Tao te Ching, Hua hu Ching, Wei wu Wei Ching, and Art of War which are published by Harper and St. Martin's Press and translated into over a dozen languages around the world. His \"I Ching, or Book of Changes\", long beloved for its clarity and accessibility, has received five star reviews on Amazon consistently for over a decade."

Secret Santa Matcher is a very simple yet elegant application that will guarantee no one has his or her name inserted twice and no one gets assigned his or her name!!\nIt is extremely simple to use, just enter all the names of the participants and the emails of participants who wish to receive an email either for the sake of being reminded of who they got or if they’re simply not around. Then hit next and the application will summon each person who’s around to discover whose secret Santa he or she is. For those who are not around the app will send emails to them.\nThe app will let you add constraints to prohibit sharing between 2 or more participants before it generates the results, so if you live in the same house with someone and it’s hard for you to keep it a secret, to forget to use Constraints.\nHave a blessed Christmas!"

Graphs of these conditions can be generated for a given frequency or time, and MUF/LUF graphs can also be displayed. \n\nA grayline map of the world is also available. Radio propagation between locations within the grayline region of the world is often greatly enhanced. DX Toolbox's grayline map makes it easy for you to determine where those locations are. Grayline propagation has been used by expert radio operators and DXers for years to catch elusive stations. A plot the great circle (both short and long) path between your location and another station is also displayed, as well as the beam heading and distance. The location of the currently transmitting NCDXF/IARU beacon can be displayed on the map as well. \n\nThe propagation map displays the areas of the world where your signal can be heard (or a signal can be heard from), based on the frequency, transmitter power, and current solar flux, date, and time.\n\nMaps showing ionosonde plots of foF2, foEs, and hmF2 data from various locations around the world are available.

Break-Up Boss offers advice and techniques to help the broken-hearted process their hurt, heal, and ultimately, see their break-up as the gift it is. Become the boss of your break-up. Own it.\n \nCreated by the author of Textbook Romance, and long-time relationship columnist at Cosmopolitan, Zoë Foster Blake, and with illustrations by Mari Andrew, Break-Up Boss is a modern, meaningful, big-hearted tool for the broken-hearted.\n \nHow does it differ from other break-up tools? Because Break-Up Boss firmly places YOU in charge of your break-up. Because you ARE in charge of it! And only you are.

Break-ups happen cos something was broken. So fix yourself, love yourself, and move forward. \n\nBreak-Up Boss is the size of a self-help book, but WAY easier to use and digest. (A boss works smart, not hard, after all.) It reveals a no BS, non-waffly, non-naff, real-life strip down of the modern break-up, and enthusiastically encourages an empowered, big-picture, positive view of how to deal with one. \n\nFeatures include:\n\n- Use the Feel Wheel to read the exact advice you need at the exact time you need it…. because no two break-ups follow the same time line or even a reliable pattern, after all. (Are you about to see your ex at a wedding? Are you drunk and about to send them a text? Are you miserable and wanting to get back with them? We’ve got you!)\n\n- Send a fake text to your ex, so you don’t send an ACTUAL text to them, and screw everything up (or your ex)\n\n- Recieve daily pep-peps direct to your phone, so you’ve got some sunshine, power and perspective in your pocket at all times\n\n- SOS quotes that give you the exact advice, just as you need it. Like Goddess cards, only less… Goddessy.\n\nBreak-ups are a normal, inevitable part of life. And yet we are so bad at them. We let them completely hijack our lives, even though they force us to watch rubbish movies, and cry a lot, and forgo sleep, and eat rubbish.\n\nWell no more. Because now you can own your break-up like a boss. And you really, really should.\n\nBreak-Up Boss is proud to donate 10% of every sale to Safe Steps, a family violence response centre in Victoria, Australia.\n\n\"I just broke up with my boyfriend like literally 30 minutes ago and I'm already laughing. Thank you! I am looking forward to going through the shitty range of feelings with this baby beside me!\" - Sandy\n\n\"I love the app! It's so great to feel loved and supported and not feel like you are over relying on friends (who have their own lives of course).\" - Madison, VIC"

      "label": "The B-hyve Pro App provides landscape irrigation professionals with an easy way to manage and operate B-hyve Pro controllers from anywhere with the convenience of a smart phone or tablet.  With the intuitive layout and design of the app, it is fast and easy to connect to any B-hyve Pro controller through WiFi or, if WiFi is not available, directly through Bluetooth right at the timer location.  Once connected to WiFi, B-hyve can be set up in smart mode to assist in delivering the right amount of water to plants, saving clients water and money.\nThis is the companion App for award-winning B-hyve Pro irrigation controllers. Homeowners can download the non-Pro version of the B-hyve App at no charge.\n\n***KEY FEATURES***\nWIFI and BLUETOOTH – Because WiFi is not always available on a job site, the B-hyve app and controller allow you to set up and operate the controller using Bluetooth. Once a WiFi connection is established at a site, the owner of the WiFi router can provide a permission code that enables off-site management of the controller from anywhere in the world.\n\nEPA- AND SWAT-CERTIFIED – Having passed the rigorous EPA WaterSense and SWAT certifications, the B-hyve Pro Controller with Smart Watering is certified to use water more efficiently and is eligible for rebates in many cities or water districts across the country.\n\nFLEXIBLE SCHEDULING – You can set the controller to water in two basic ways: 1) on a fixed schedule, such as during a new landscape grow-in period; 2) with Smart Watering, and let local weather conditions determine the schedule.\n\nMULTI-SITE MANAGEMENT – You can manage and control an unlimited number of B-hyve controllers from the convenience of one application.  Once the timer is connected to the Internet, secure access can be shared in a number of different combinations using an app-generated code.\n\nCATCH CUPS – With various water savings options integrated right into the app, there are multiple ways to achieve optimum water savings with the B-hyve Pro Timer.  In addition to Smart Watering, it incorporates the award-winning catch-cup feature right into the app to deliver up to 25% more water savings over other smart controllers.\n\nALEXA – Works with Alexa.

      "label": "Many people have watched or read The Secret and believe that you can ask the Universe for any material thing you would like and the Law of Attraction will deliver it to you. But of course it's not as simple as that. \n\nYou have to change the way that you think if you want to change your world, and in this special deck, Esther & Jerry Hicks help you learn how to align yourself and focus your energy to manifest prosperity.\n\nLearn how to create abundance by:\n\n· Focusing on what you want in your life and not on what you don't have\n· Seeing yourself as wealthy not poor\n· Visualizing yourself as enjoying the object or lifestyle that you dream of\n\nAbraham's powerful techniques will teach you what prosperity truly is and enable you to use the Law of Attraction to bring this energy into your own life. \n\n\nFEATURES:\n- Browse Money, and the Law of Attraction Cards anywhere, anytime on your iOS device*\n- Save cards to review at any time*\n- Email cards to yourself or share with a friend*\n\n\nAbout the Author:\nExcited about the clarity and practicality of the translated word from the Beings who call themselves Abraham, Esther and Jerry Hicks began disclosing their amazing Abraham experience to a handful of close business associates in 1986.\nRecognizing the practical results being received by themselves and by those people who were asking practical questions and then applying Abraham’s answers to their own situations, Esther and Jerry made a deliberate decision to allow the teachings of Abraham to become available to an ever-widening circle of seekers of how to live a happier life.\n\nUsing their San Antonio, Texas, conference center as their base, Jerry and Esther have traveled to approximately 50 cities a year since 1989, presenting interactive Law of Attraction workshops to those leaders who gather to participate in this expanding stream of progressive thought. And although worldwide attention has been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading Edge thinkers and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham’s Law of Attraction concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures, and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person to person—as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences.\n\nIn November 2011, Jerry made his transition into Non-Physical, and now Esther continues to conduct the Abraham workshops with the help of her physical friends and co-workers and, of course, with the Non-Physical help of Abraham and Jerry.\nPeople are able to access Abraham directly by attending the seminars in person or by participating in the online live streaming of most events. There is also an extensive YouTube library of Abraham videos.\nAbraham—a group of uplifting Non-Physical teachers—present their Broader Perspective through Esther Hicks. And as they speak to our level of comprehension through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant, yet comprehensively simple essays in print and in sound, they guide us to a clear connection with our loving Inner Being, and to uplifting self-empowerment from our Total Self.\n\nOfficial Hay House licensed iOS App: www.HayHouse.com®"

The app will take a photo of you, it will analyse the colour palette, classify your type according to the four seasons with three subtypes each), and return a palette of colours in which you are likely to look best.\n\nYou can then take or upload a photo of something you might want to buy, but perhaps are not sure if the colour is good for you. The app will analyse the colour or colours and tell you if they are likely to match your colour type. For example, you can  take a screenshot of a piece of clothing that you want to buy online and check if its colours will be a good match.\n\nYou will be able to share the results of your colour analysis on social media, by email, message, or save to your photo library.\n\n A note of caution: the colour type determined by the app is quite sensitive to the light conditions. The tone of the colour of your skin, your hair, etc. changes depending on the intensity and the temperature of the light. Please do not expect 100% consistency between the result you get in full sunshine, or on a cloudy, rainy dull day. Ideally, take photos in full daylight, avoiding direct sunshine. Also see how  your colour type can be affected by different lighting conditions - perhaps in the evening, in artificial, you look better in a different choice of colours than at daylight?"

From Polynesian (Tahitian, Samoan, Tongan, etc.) tatau. In Marquesan, tatu.\" Before the importation of the Polynesian word, the practice of tattooing had been described in the West as pricking, painting, or staining. Sailors on the voyage later introduced both the word and reintroduced the concept of tattooing to Europe.\n\nThis is not to be confused with the origins of the word for the military drumbeat — see military tattoo. In this case, the English word tattoo is derived from the Dutch word taptoe (OED).\n\nThe first written reference to the word tattoo (or tatau), appears in the journal of Joseph Banks (24 February 1743 – 19 June 1820), the naturalist aboard Captain Cook's ship the HMS Endeavour: \"I shall now mention the way they mark themselves indelibly, each of them is so marked by their humor or disposition\".\n\nThe word \"tattoo\" was brought to Europe by the explorer James Cook, when he returned in 1771 from his first voyage to Tahiti and New Zealand. In his narrative of the voyage, he refers to an operation called \"tattaw\". Before this it had been described as scarring, painting, or staining\n\nTattoo enthusiasts may refer to tattoos as \"ink\", \"pieces\", \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"tats\", or \"work\"; to the creators as \"tattoo artists\", \"tattooers\", or \"tattooists\"; and to places where they work as \"tattoo shops\", \"tattoo studios\", or \"tattoo parlors\".\n\n\nA tattooed man's back, Japan, c. 1875\nUsage of the terms \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"pieces\", and work\" is gaining greater support,[citation needed] with mainstream art galleries holding exhibitions of both conventional and custom tattoo designs. Beyond Skin, at the Museum of Croydon, is an example of this as it challenges the stereotypical view of tattoos and who has them. Copyrighted tattoo designs that are mass-produced and sent to tattoo artists are known as \"flash\", a notable instance of industrial design. Flash sheets are prominently displayed in many tattoo parlors for the purpose of providing both inspiration and ready-made tattoo images to customers.\n\nThe Japanese word irezumi means \"insertion of ink\" and can mean tattoos using tebori, the traditional Japanese hand method, a Western-style machine, or for that matter, any method of tattooing using insertion of ink. The most common word used for traditional Japanese tattoo designs is Horimono. Japanese may use the word \"tattoo\" to mean non-Japanese styles of tattooing."

Depending on your location, the application choose the appropriate calculation method and Fiqhi school. \n\nFor an accurate location, please ensure that your location settings and your Internet connection or your GPS are enabled!\n\nNote about App features :\n-------------------------------\nIf you are familiar with Salatuk in other platforms please note that this version DOESN'T SUPPORT some features like \"Turn Phone to Silent after Athan\". Other features like \"Full Athan\" and \"Custom Athan\" are supported only when the app is ope. This is because of technical limitations. We will try to fix it once iOS system allows it.\n\nNote about Athan :\n-----------------\nSalatuk remind you that it's time for prayer with a \"4 takbeerats\" instead of full Athan. Because of technical limitations, it's possible to play full Athan only if the app is open. \n\nAlso, if you have problems to hear the notifications, please make sure to enable the following parameters in your device :\n\n1) Settings>Sounds>Alerts \n2) Settings>Notifications>Salatuk \n3) Your phone is not on mute and volume is correct\n\nNote about Prayers times :\n-----------------------------------\nPlease note that we pay attention to ensure that the prayer times of Salatuk are accurate. However, in some countries those times may be not exact. In this case, please refer to the official islamic institutions or mosques in your country and adjust manually the prayer times in the application settings.\n\nSalatuk supports currently 3 languages : Arabic, English and French.\n\nTips for a better usage\n-----------------------------\n\n1- In order to refresh the prayer alarms, make sure to open the application once a week. Please do so also when you change your location or timing (summer time).\n\n2- The prayer alarms corresponds to 2 or 4 Takbeerats. If you want to hear the complete Athan you should open the app at the moment of the Athan.\n\n**********************************************************************************\n\nتطبيق صلاتك رفيقك للحفاظ على صلاتك.\nعن طريق تحديد موقعك  تلقائيا، بإمكان هذا التطبيق أن يعلمك بأوقات الصلاة وكذلك تحديد اتجاه القبلة. تطبيق صلاتك يستعمل عددا مهما من الطرق الحسابية  المعتمدة في أغلب العالم الإسلامي. اعتمادا على موقعك، يختار التطبيق طريقة الحساب والمدرسة الفقهية المناسبة. \n\nحول خصائص التطبيق \n---------------------\nإذا كنت ممن يستعمل صلاتك على أنظمة أخرى، المرجو الانتباه إلى أن هذه النسخة لا تحتوي على بعض الخصائص مثل \"التحويل إلى الصامت\" كما أن بعض الخصائص الأخرى مثل \"الأذان الكامل\" و\"إضافة أذان من الذاكرة\" لا تشتغل إلا إذا كان التطبيق مفتوحا. يرجع ذلك إلى بعض القيود التقنية الموجودة حاليا في نظام أبل وسنحاول دعمها حالما ترفع هذه القيود.\n\n\nحول سماع الأذان \n---------------\nمن ناحية  أخرى إذا كان عندك مشكل في سماع التنبيهات، المرجو التاكد من أن الإعدادات التالية مفعلة في هاتفك : \n1) الإعدادات > الأصوات > تنبيهات التذكير\n2) الإعدادات >التنبيهات > صلاتك   \n3) هاتفك ليس في الوضع الصامت والصوت في مستوى جيد\n\nحول مواقيت الصلاة:\n-----------------\nننوه إلى أنه رغم المجهودات لتدقيق مواقيت الصلاة التي يقوم بها فريق صلاتك، إلا أنه في بعض البلدان قد تكون المواقيت غير مضبوطة بشكل تام، في هذه الحالة نرجو منكم الاعتماد على المواقيت الرسمية في بلدكم أو المسجد القريب منكم، مع العلم أنه يمكنكم تعديل الأوقات يدويا في نافذة الإعدادات.\n\nنصائح من أجل استعمال أفضل \n-------------------------\n\n1- حتى يتم تحديث إشعارات الأذان إحرص على فتح التطبيق مرة كل أسبوع على الأقل أو عندما تغير مكانك أو يتغير التوقيت في بلدك (التوقيت الصيفي)\n\n2- تطبيق صلاتك يشعرك بدخول وقت الصلاة على شكل تكبيرتين أو 4 تكبيرات. إذا أردت أن تستمع إلى الأذان كاملا المرجو أن تفتح التطبيق أثناء الأذان."

It also provides a description for each phase, sign and mansion. You can navigate through the information in various ways — say, phase-by-phase, day-by-day or month-by-month - whatever is more convenient for you. \n\nPhases show you the energy of the day, signs — the mood of the day, while the void-of-course periods might tell you when it is better not to do certain things. Mansions were used by different cultures from the time immemorial, they tell for what a particular day is good or not so good.\n\nTo calculate the times, iLuna uses the time zone of the device on which it runs, so if your iPhone or iPod touch shows your current time correctly, iLuna's information is precise too.\n\nOnce any of the events reported by iLuna happens, you will get a notification, provided you allowed the app to send you notifications."

      "label": "Whether you are a professional Paranormal Investigator, a hobbyist or just want to have some fun, this app works like a \"Spirit Box\" reading data from your sensors and turning it into spoken words.\n\nWith a database of over a thousand commonly used words, Ghostalker will read changes in all of the sensors it can find in your device. This includes sensors for the tiniest amount of vibration, rotation, GPS, gyroscope, light, magnetic fields, proximity etc. and convert them to words which it will display and speak. This app uses the actual raw data from the sensors to determine what to say, rather than picking words at random like some other apps.\n\nLOGGING: This is the full version of the app so it logs the words spoken for you to view, save, email, delete etc. at a later time. There is also a built-in log viewer. The date and time is logged, along with the combined change in sensor readings (so you can see how big a change was picked up) and the word. The log files are in CSV format so you can import them into your favourite spreadsheet (e.g. MS Excel or Google Sheets).\n\nDICTIONARY: You can also manage your own custom dictionary of words so you can make your own special list of replies. You can flick between the in-built dictionary, your own custom dictionary or both combined (from v0.5) at any time.\n\nThis app is not designed to form complete sentences so it is up to you to interpret what it says in your own way. Top end phones and tablets tend to have more sensors than low end ones but the app is designed to work with whatever it can find. The sensitivity of sensors will also vary between devices.\n\nTIP 1: Using the custom dictionary you can have it reply with special limited words, for example 'yes', 'no' and 'maybe' when you ask it questions. Or add a series of digits and get it to pick your lottery numbers. Or add the letters of the alphabet so it can work like a Ouija board. \n\nTIP 2: Paranormal investigators believe that leaving such devices running for as long as possible will allow \"spirits\" to learn what energy is required to trigger certain words.\n\nTIP 3: If it starts to trigger words constantly you may be getting interference from something close by. Try moving the device somewhere else or tap the 'Calibrate' button to get it to tune out background variance (although you will lose some sensitivity).\n\nTIP 4: NEW - Keep lists of custom words in text files. Each word should be on its own line or separated by a space. Select all of the words and copy them to the clipboard. You can then import them into Ghostalker by pasting them from the clipboard. You can also copy word lists from the web, an email, or anywhere you can copy text.\n\nIf the app does not do what you were expecting, or there is an issue with it running on your device, please contact us for help.\n\nThere are no adverts in this software. If you would like to try the free version first (without the logging or custom dictionary functionality), it is listed under \"Ghostalker Lite\"."

      "label": "The MOST WANTED features in all drones: Course Lock & Home Lock.\nNow available for your DJI Spark & Mavic Air!\nAlso works on all DJI drones that use DJI Go 4. \n\nThe new DJI Mavic Mini will be supported as soon as DJI allow developers to build apps for it. Get ELIT now so you don't miss it.\n\n\"Now your drone can face any direction while moving.\"\n\n\"No more mentally switching left-right & front-back when the drone is flying towards you.\"\n\n ●●● Features that are already available ●●●\n• Course Lock - Any forward input will bring it towards the current heading & any reverse input will bring it away from that heading. No matter where the drone is facing after that.\n• Home Lock - Allows the drone to face any direction, pulling back on the stick will always move it towards the home point.\n• Normal Mode - Moving the stick forward will bring the drone to wherever it’s facing. If the direction of the drone is changed, the heading will change accordingly.\n• Elit works perfectly with iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch. Purchase once for all your devices.\n• Fully supports landscape orientation. Works seamlessly with your DJI Go 4 app.\n\nOh yes, it's a one-time purchase, FREE future updates forever. We have planned some big updates for Elit. You'll like it!\n\n●●● How to use? ●●●\nAs easy as 1-2-3.\n1. Connect your device to DJI controller & aircraft.\n2. Launch this app. Tap \"Apply & Fly\".\n3. DONE! You will be redirected to DJI Go 4 app. Continue flying your drone with the newly unlocked control mode.\n\n\n●●● What is Course Lock? ●●●\nThe other drones manufacturers call it \"Headless Mode\". It allows new pilots to control the input of a drone. They can set and handle the orientation of the drone without changing its direction. No matter where your drone’s front side is pointing, moving the stick forward will always make the drone go forward in your current point of view.\n\nFor kids & even adults who use drones for fun, flying a drone with Course Lock feature is the best option they can have. This feature minimises the chances of drone crashes thus avoids damage. Entry-level drones (such as DJI Spark & DJI Mavic Air) are the ones which most require the Course Lock & Home Lock mode.\n\nAny questions, request, etc. can be addressed to elit [at] danielvw [dot] com.\nAnd if you like Elit, please share your love by rating & reviewing it on the App Store. Thank you!\n\nHappy Droning!"

The inspiration in the form of your pattern library is right at your fingertips, wherever you go, and you can easily make sure that you purchase the right fabric in the right quantity - and with the right accessories. The app also helps you find inspiration on how to best make use of your current stash of fabric.\n\nThe app lets you gain the perfect overview in a single place, whether your patterns are purchased, found in magazines, or your own creations entirely. You can categorize your patterns based from standard garment types, or create as many of your own categories as you like. You can have your patterns sorted alphabetically, by most recent usage, or in any particular order you like. Each pattern can be associated with as many categories as you wish.\n\nIt is entirely up to you how many details you want to register for your individual patterns, but the more details you supply, the more help you will find in the built-in filtering function. When browsing your patterns, only the filled-in information is shown, so you won't have to deal with lots of empy fields.\n\nUsing the camera, you can supply your pattern details with pictures of the model, the instructions, or perhaps of the finalized garments.  You can add as many pictures and PDF files as you like, both for your categories, your patterns and your fabric.\n \nUse the Filter function if you need to search for a specific pattern in your pattern library, or just need inspiration for your next project, based on a specific piece of fabric.\n\nIn all aspects, Sewing Patterns is an indispensable app, for the experienced seamstress and the newcomer alike!"

These are: Entry (8-12 years old), Intermediate (13-17 years old), and Advanced (18+).\n\nWhat does this app include?\n- Three sets of 36 simple questions about how you prefer to behave, leading to the identification with a dominant and secondary totem from the four animal personality types that AusIDentities uses\n- In-depth information on how these four personality types communicate with each other and interact within relationships, the classroom and the workplace.\n- Explanations of how personality influences patterns of behaviour in people when stressed, choosing a career, and developing as a child and teenager\n- A promotional code offering a 5% discount on any purchase of AusIDentities resources"

He believes passionately that once the physical body dies, our spirit lives on. He has dedicated his life to his own spiritual development and teaching, as well as offering peace and comfort during times of loss and bereavement. “To see a group of students walk out of one of my workshops inspired, awakened, motivated, and energized is all the gratitude that I need,” John says. “If I somehow help them to start their own journey, then I’ve done my job.” \n\nAuthor of the bestsellers Power of the Soul, Born Knowing, Psychic Navigator, and 101 Ways to Jump-Start Your Intuition, John also hosted his own weekly radio show on Hay House Radio, Spirit Connections. He has become a familiar face on TV on programs such as the A&E special Mediums—We See Dead People, as well as appearing as a psychic authority on the History Channel’s Psychic History. John’s story was originally profiled on CBS’s Unsolved Mysteries. \n\nFor further information about John, to find out about his series of workshops and other events, or to sign up for his free email newsletter, visit: www.johnholland.com"

When its wisdom is sought with sincerity and sensitivity, this ancient Chinese oracle will promote success and good fortune and impart balance and perspective to your life. Its lasting popularity lies in the profound lessons it teaches about how reliance on one's higher qualities leads to life's greatest rewards: well-being, understanding, and peace of mind.  \n\nNow available as an elegantly designed and easy to use iOS app, it is both highly accessible to new users and a revelation to those long familiar with the text. Throw your own coins, or let the app cast for you, and make the wisdom of the sages your own. Includes a journal for recording your questions, results, and thoughts.\n\nBrian Browne Walker is the author of celebrated contemporary translations of the I Ching, Tao te Ching, Hua hu Ching, Wei wu Wei Ching, and Art of War which are published by Harper and St. Martin's Press and translated into over a dozen languages around the world. His \"I Ching, or Book of Changes\", long beloved for its clarity and accessibility, has received five star reviews on Amazon consistently for over a decade."

DX Toolbox features several propagation forecasting tools, allowing you to quickly and easily estimate current HF (Shortwave) propagation conditions between any two locations in the world, and is ideal for the ham radio operator, shortwave listener, or other radio enthusiast. \n\nRadio propagation conditions can also be estimated between any two points on the Earth. Graphs of these conditions can be generated for a given frequency or time, and MUF/LUF graphs can also be displayed. \n\nA grayline map of the world is also available. Radio propagation between locations within the grayline region of the world is often greatly enhanced. DX Toolbox's grayline map makes it easy for you to determine where those locations are. Grayline propagation has been used by expert radio operators and DXers for years to catch elusive stations. A plot the great circle (both short and long) path between your location and another station is also displayed, as well as the beam heading and distance. The location of the currently transmitting NCDXF/IARU beacon can be displayed on the map as well. \n\nThe propagation map displays the areas of the world where your signal can be heard (or a signal can be heard from), based on the frequency, transmitter power, and current solar flux, date, and time.\n\nMaps showing ionosonde plots of foF2, foEs, and hmF2 data from various locations around the world are available. The MUF and skip zone can be calculated based on foF2 and hmF2 values.\n\nAurora prediction maps for the northern and southern hemisphere are available. \n\nDX Toolbox displays the following important solar and geomagnetic readings: \n\nSolar Flux \nA-Index \nK-Index \nSun Spot Number \nX-Ray Flux levels \nX-Ray flares \nSolar Wind \nEarth's Magnetic Field \nProton and Electron Flux levels \nRadio Blackout conditions \nGeomagnetic Storm conditions \nSolar Radiation Storm conditions \n\nGraphs of x-ray flux readings from the GOES satellites may also be displayed. \n\nThe following radio propagation reports and forecasts are available: \n\nWWV Geophysical Alert \n27 Day Space Outlook \n45 Day AP Forecast \nGeomagnetic Data \nDaily Geomagnetic Data \nDaily Particle Data \nDaily Solar Data \nGEOALERT \nDaily Magnetometer Analysis Reports \nHourly Magnetometer Analysis Reports \nPredicted Sunspot Numbers and Radio Flux \nReport of Solar-Geophysical Activity \nSolar and Geophysical Activity Summary \nSolar Region Summary \nWeekly Highlights and Forecasts \nCurrent Space Weather Indices \nSpace Weather Event Reports \nDaily Space Weather Indices \nSummary of Space Weather Observations \n3-day Space Weather Predictions \nSEC Space Weather Alerts \n\nIn addition, 21 maps of current D Layer Absorption levels are available for display.\n\nFull documentation on how to use the app is available here: http://www.blackcatsystems.com/iphone/dx_toolbox_faq.html\n\nGet your copy of DX Toolbox now, and you’ll always be up to date on current radio propagation conditions."

      "label": "Pull a Messages From Shadow Oracle card in this app and tune into the truth and vibration of the shadow for transformation.  \n\nWhether you are looking for a shift in your experience of anxiety, depression, fear,  anger or grief, this spiritual resource allows you to connect with the spirit of any pattern hiding out of your awareness that is ready for support. This deck of 34 energetically activated oracle cards were intuitively channeled and designed to reflect you back to shadow patterns and themes asking for presence, attention, and healing. A reading from this cosmic resource answers the divine question: What is it about the presence of certain people, places, relationships, and circumstances that consistently wake up powerful behaviors and feelings in you that you don’t always understand? The oracle cards in this app are not meant to predict the future nor tell the story of the past, rather they hold the vibration of each present moment and are intended to hold up a mirror for you to meet your whole self. Then you are able to remember the Truth you’ve been hiding from yourself so you can return to a space of peace, love, abundance, and joy. Similar to meditation, these oracle cards allow you to focus deeply on the dark side of symptoms and experiences that are often in your blind spot so that you can choose to welcome healing. With the way the law of attraction works, if you are unaware of your shadow you continue to attract realities unconsciously and life can begin to feel out of your control. When you allow yourself to use psychic resources like the Messages From Shadow oracle cards, you fine tune your own intuition and begin to develop a deeper self-trusting relationship within that can be relied upon in your daily life for support. Like angel cards you may have seen, this collection of subtle energies, gently and directly show you any old wounds or abuse asking for witnessing and help you unlock the healing potential in the cellular memory. Use this app to tune into questions about what is keeping you stuck in love, money, health, purpose, and relationships including insight into past life interferences and ancestral patterns."

This is an attempt in which I don’t think would have been possible with my own effort and intellect but could do it by the Grace of Sri Sri Radha Madhava and offer this creation in the Lotus feet of Sri Radha Madhava with the hope that it will help Vaishnavas observe fast in the different locations of this globe.\nI know with all the work that has gone into it there must be still shortcomings and mistakes for which I seek apologies in the feet of Vaishnava jans and request to verify these dates with your local temples from where you have been already referring for these times and dates. \n\nThis app is based on the rules put forth by Goswamis for deciding the dates of Ekadasi and Mahadvadasi fast.\nOnly Vaishnava Ekadashi is Supported!\n\nTechnical Features of the app :\n*The app is designed to show the Upcoming Ekadashi Vrat Observing date & Parana timings as soon as you open the app.\n*Katha for the Ekadashi’s are also available\n*Selection of current location can be done manually (latitude, longitude) or by using GPS or web database.\n*Notification support is available with different frequency settings\n*Home-screen widget helps to know the Upcoming Ekadashi Fast on the go\n*Year Calendar View is available wherein all the Ekadasi Fasts are sorted by months\n*Rules of observing Ekadashi fast are included\n*Sunrise time and Brahma Muhurta Timings for the selected locations are also displayed\n*Easy to use UI\n\nYou can feel free to contact us at - contact@itsraghav.com for any suggestions. \n\nDownload Ekadasi App Now\n\nHare Krishna"

      "label": "OSHO Bardo is a meditation, and the metaphysical dying or ‘letting go’ that happens when we move into meditation is similar in many ways to physical death. Meditation is a way to rehearse – and so become more at ease with – the process of dying before it actually happens. \n\nTo benefit from OSHO Bardo you don’t need to wait for the final moments of death; regularly practicing the process can create this freedom in your life and at the same time dispel the fear of death. \n\nIn dying, as in meditating, we can... \n\n⁕ Shift from the outer world to the inner \n⁕ Relax, letting go of all tension \n⁕ Move from doing to being   \n⁕ Let go of all the various roles with which we have been identified \n  ⁕ Enter our own journey, however many other people might be around us  \n\nOSHO Bardo can be used by anyone, of any or no religious or spiritual affiliation. It is for: \n\n⁕ Anyone who would like to live and die consciously\n  ⁕ Anyone who would like to be able to relax while remaining present and alert \n⁕ Anyone who has a fear around living or dying \n⁕ Those already familiar with meditation as well as those who would like to learn how to meditate \n⁕ Carers of those who are ill or dying \n\nThe term BARDO means ‘a transitional time’ and, as such, it offers a heightened potential for inner transformation. The original Bardo Thödol was an ancient method used in Tibet to support the transition of dying.\n\nOsho has asked that a new, more contemporary version be created which supports people who want to die consciously and in a spirit of celebration. OSHO Bardo can be used as a regular meditation to help us to relax and know more awareness and joy in our everyday lives. It is also a preparation for the crescendo of life and the greatest experience of letting go that we will encounter – letting go of life itself.\n\nOver two thousand years ago Tibetan Buddhists created a practice of dying and being reborn. Central to this is the scripture called the Bardo Thödol – Liberation in the Intermediate State through Hearing (aka The Tibetan Book of the Dead). The term, ‘bardo’,’means ‘a transitional time’ and as such it is a time of a heightened potential for inner transformation. Meditation is used as a method to enter this ‘Intermediate State’ consciously and so become free of attachments. \n\nOsho praises the Bardo Thödol as Tibet’s most valuable contribution to the world. However, he also says that a more contemporary version of the Bardo, or a process like it, is needed. \n\nThe Bardo Thödol was created for a specific time, culture, and religion and for people for whom the practice of meditation was intrinsic to daily living. \n\nOsho’s vision is global, encompassing the diversity of those who are new to meditation as well as contemporary and even future meditators. This is reflected in the text of OSHO Bardo, with its easily understandable suggestions that are free of any cultural or religious references. \n\n* Available in English, 中文, Dansk, Ελληνικά, हिन्दी, Italiano, Español, 日本語, Русский & Nederlands language.\n\n\nABOUT OSHO\n\nOsho is a contemporary mystic whose life and teachings have influenced millions of people of all ages, and from all walks of life.  His often provocative and challenging teachings generate today more and more interest and his readership is dramatically expanding around the world in more than fifty languages. People can easily recognize the wisdom of his insights, and their relevance to our lives and to the issues we are facing today.  \n\nThe Sunday Times in London named Osho as one of the \"1,000 Makers of the 20th Century\". He is known around the world for his revolutionary contribution to meditation – the science of inner transformation – with the unique approach of his \"OSHO Active Meditations\" acknowledging the accelerated pace of contemporary life and bringing meditation into modern life."

In Settings, you can adjust the vibration strength and the volume separately (for example, if you want alerts to vibrate but not play sound).\n- The training session lasts 1 hour in the background. Navigate back to the App and touch the screen to extend the session. \n- If the App is not detecting enough of your face-touches, you can increase the sensitivity. \n- For clarity, the app does not notify you before your hand touches your face, but typically after.

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

It's super quick, and it's friendly. Ravelry on mobile has never been easier.\n\nFIND INSPIRATIONAL PATTERNS\nIf you’re not sure what you’d like to make next, Ravit lets you easily browse patterns, favorite them, download and view pattern PDFs, view project photos and browse a designer’s other patterns and pattern suggestions. \n\nAnd if you want to narrow your search, choose from dozens of filters including craft, availability, category, attributes, needles, weight and more. You can even combine multiple options with AND, NOT or OR. It's powerful, but easy.\n\nThere's so many beautiful patterns on Ravelry, and Ravit helps you find them easily.\n\nTAKE RAVELRY TO YOUR YARN STORE\nFind out which yarns you’ll need for a project. Check what yardage you need. Look in your stash to see if you’ve already got a yarn, or one that’s similar. And because Ravit is designed to work nicely on your iPhone or iPad with readable text and buttons you can tap, you won't be squinting as you find all the info you need when you're at your LYS.\n\n+ Search all yarns by keyword, filter by fiber, weight, attributes and many others, and sort by options including 'Most projects' and 'Highest rating'. Quickly view pattern suggestions and projects for a yarn.\n\n+ Access your stash offline. No wireless or cell signal in your yarn store? No problem! Your stash is cached on your device so you can search, sort and view your stash offline.\n\nSNAP, EDIT AND UPLOAD ON THE SPOT\nPerhaps you're making a project on the train to work, or relaxed on the couch at home - whenever you are inspired to share your WIPs, Ravit makes it easy to snap photos, enhance with powerful photo filters, and upload to Ravelry, all from the one app.\n\n+ Powerful Photo Editing Tools - enhance, crop, and adjust your photos before your upload and show your work in it's best possible light. You can remove blemishes, improve color balance, sharpen images and access many other pro editing tools all from within the app.\n\n+ Optimized for Ravelry - before images are uploaded, they're resized optimally for Ravelry, so you'll upload smaller photos (up to 10x smaller!) more quickly and using less data.\n\n+ More than just photos - you can update notes for your Projects, Queued Projects and Stash, as well as most of the other info such as yarns, yardage, skeins, colorways, and color for your stash, and progress, link to stash, rating, craft, and tags amongst others for your projects.\n\nIT'S ALL THE LITTLE THINGS...\nSo why use Ravit? It's all the the little, sometimes hidden touches which make Ravit shine. Here's a few of them.\n\n+ It's quick - if you tap on something, you go right there. \n\n+ Infinite scroll - smooth, continuous scrolling as you browse to find inspiration.\n\n+ Offline - whether you're commuting underground, or you're off-grid, Ravit lets you access your Projects and Stash offline.\n\n+ Clean, uncluttered interface - we want your work and the beauty of Ravelry.com to shine. \n\n+ Use up to 50%* less data in Ravit compared with your web browser. \n\n+ Squint less - The text in Ravit isn't made super small, and we're fully Dynamic Type compatible, so if you change the font size on your device, it'll change in Ravit.\n\n* Based on tests of browsing patterns, projects, stash and yarns on Ravit and Safari on the same device - YYMV! (Your Yardage May Vary)\n\nTHIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING\nRavit has many features already, but we are constantly enhancing and adding more features. We have an active group on Ravelry and we'd love to hear what you'd like to see next - join in the discussion at http://www.ravelry.com/groups/ravit\n\nRavit is not affiliated with ravelry.com. It is an independent app, developed by a husband and wife team. You can read more about why we made Ravit at http://www.enhancient.com/ravit\n\nDownload Ravit now and hop on to Ravelry."

With six children between them they have first-hand experience of the power that self-hypnosis and positive affirmations have on pregnancy and birth. They believe that women deserve positive, empowered birth experiences and have created this app to equip them with the skills to achieve this. The effectiveness of hypnosis and relaxation on positive birth outcomes (shorter labour, lower rates of medical intervention, less medication use) is well documented in a number of research studies. \n\niHypnobirth teaches you that birth does not have to be full of fear, instead it will equip you with tools that can create a positive birthing experience, helping you to prepare both physically and emotionally.\n\nBy listening to the relaxation and positive affirmations regularly during pregnancy, this app will enable you to practice deep relaxation, effective breathing and positive visualisations to help you to have a calm, controlled, and empowered birth experience. If you learn to condition your body now it will be much easier to slip into a relaxed state during your labour and birth - and even after your baby is born these techniques will serve you well.\n\nBenefits of using hypnotherapy for birth \n\n-Positive approach birth\n-Calmer pregnancy\n-Creates feeling of empowerment \n-Reduce anxiety \n-Helps bonding with baby  \n-Reduces labour pains* \n-Shorter labour* \n-Less likely to have c-section* \n-Less likely to have pain relief* \n\n\n* Statistics from the American HypnoBirthing Institute 2008"

With its large, highly visible font, you can check the time even from a distance. Also, in everyday life and at work, its modest matt black presence does not distract you or disrupt your productivity, even when using the app for extended periods of time. Its full-screen appearance integrates with the iPhone/iPad device body and blends into your living space ambience, as if it were a minimalist home decor item.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Switch between 12/24 hour clock\n- Switch between portrait and landscape mode\n- Option to show seconds when tapping screen\n- Brightness/dimness control inside the app\n- Show/hide background tiles\n- Enlarge/reduce to any size\n\nNOTES:\n- Your device’s Auto-Lock is disabled while this clock is active in the foreground.\n- This app does not start automatically like the Mac screensaver.\n- You cannot replace your device’s Lock Screen with this clock."

Currently this includes an on-the-fly pitch tracker - so you can practise different ways of speaking and immediately see their effect - as well as unlimited archive space, celebrity comparison graphs, and a charting tool so you can track your progress over time.\n\nWe’re working to expand Vocular to other areas too. We want to cover things like smoothness, nasality, vocal fry, even creating a rating of how attractive your voice currently is, based on the latest research.

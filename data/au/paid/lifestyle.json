      "label": "Break-ups suck, but you needn’t suck at break-ups. Break-Up Boss offers advice and techniques to help the broken-hearted process their hurt, heal, and ultimately, see their break-up as the gift it is. Become the boss of your break-up. Own it.\n \nCreated by the author of Textbook Romance, and long-time relationship columnist at Cosmopolitan, Zoë Foster Blake, and with illustrations by Mari Andrew, Break-Up Boss is a modern, meaningful, big-hearted tool for the broken-hearted.\n \nHow does it differ from other break-up tools? Because Break-Up Boss firmly places YOU in charge of your break-up. Because you ARE in charge of it! And only you are. Stop letting your heartache and your ex take over your life, your diet, your social life, your job and personality, and start seeing your circumstances as an opportunity for growth. Break-ups happen cos something was broken. So fix yourself, love yourself, and move forward. \n\nBreak-Up Boss is the size of a self-help book, but WAY easier to use and digest. (A boss works smart, not hard, after all.) It reveals a no BS, non-waffly, non-naff, real-life strip down of the modern break-up, and enthusiastically encourages an empowered, big-picture, positive view of how to deal with one. \n\nFeatures include:\n\n- Use the Feel Wheel to read the exact advice you need at the exact time you need it…. because no two break-ups follow the same time line or even a reliable pattern, after all. (Are you about to see your ex at a wedding? Are you drunk and about to send them a text? Are you miserable and wanting to get back with them? We’ve got you!)\n\n- Send a fake text to your ex, so you don’t send an ACTUAL text to them, and screw everything up (or your ex)\n\n- Recieve daily pep-peps direct to your phone, so you’ve got some sunshine, power and perspective in your pocket at all times\n\n- SOS quotes that give you the exact advice, just as you need it. Like Goddess cards, only less… Goddessy.\n\nBreak-ups are a normal, inevitable part of life. And yet we are so bad at them. We let them completely hijack our lives, even though they force us to watch rubbish movies, and cry a lot, and forgo sleep, and eat rubbish.\n\nWell no more. Because now you can own your break-up like a boss. And you really, really should.\n\nBreak-Up Boss is proud to donate 10% of every sale to Safe Steps, a family violence response centre in Victoria, Australia.\n\n\"I just broke up with my boyfriend like literally 30 minutes ago and I'm already laughing. Thank you! I am looking forward to going through the shitty range of feelings with this baby beside me!\" - Sandy\n\n\"I love the app! It's so great to feel loved and supported and not feel like you are over relying on friends (who have their own lives of course).\" - Madison, VIC"

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

What a sight!\n\nThe app has Siri Voice shortcuts, and they can be used to set your home into Away or Home state using Siri on your Watch or iPhone, as well as to display the live feeds from your cameras.\n\nThe app supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nWatch Cam lets you monitor all your Nest Cams from the Apple Watch or the iOS Widget.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Watch Cam complication to open the app. Swipe left and right to view life feeds from all your Nest Cams.\n• One of the watch complications shows you the snapshot from the camera of your choice, right on the watch face. The snapshot updates periodically all on its own, so you'll have a recent view of your camera any time you look at the watch. Useful when waiting for that package to arrive.\n• On your iOS device you can swipe to the widget panel to see what's on all of your cameras.\n• View the continuously updated Live Feed from the camera in the watch app, the iOS widget, or the iOS app. The feed updates with a new image approximately every second on the iOS and two seconds on the Watch - may be faster or slower, depending on your network speed.\n• Use the digital crown on the Watch to zoom in and out, or tap the screen to toggle zoom levels.\n• Use the pinch gesture on the camera views in the iOS app to zoom in and out. Single tap toggles the zoom level in the iOS app and the iOS widget.\n• Turn the device to landscape mode to increase the camera views sizes.\n• Double tap on the Live Feed view in the iOS app or the widget to launch the Nest app.\n• Set Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nWatch Face Complications can display the following:\n• Snapshot from the camera of your choice that updates periodically.\n• Status of all the cameras - if the camera icon is green, it means that all your cameras are online and streaming. If it's dimmed, it means that some cameras are off.\n\nYou can long-press the Watch screen for additional functions, like setting the home/away status, or turning the camera streaming on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nPlease Note: Watch Cam does not collect any of your data. Your login information, camera feeds, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Watch Cam does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

You can lock the lists (to save accidental changes) and these lists can be set as stock lists (you have these paints).\n\nYou can make notes against the list itself or the individual colours and you can sort the lists and colours any way you want.\n\nPaints you have added to any of your stock lists are indicated in the ranges, the equivalents and the search results so you can see what paints you have when you do a search.

Gauges are color-coded, and show the percentage of current power vs. the maximum.\nDuring night time, total energy produced during last day is shown, and the complication gauges act as a timer that counts down how much time roughly there is until sunrise.\n\nWatch app has a scrollable view with various stats, including daily, monthly and yearly total power, as well as environmental benefits and calculated revenue.\n\nAll this info is also displayed in the iOS notification widget, just a swipe away from the lock screen.\n\nBased on the robust and proven codebase that powers Thermo Watch and Watch Cam apps, enjoyed by tens of thousands of users. The app is extremely quick and efficient, with near-instant launch time, and seamless background updates.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nThe goal was to make a product that would not look out of place next to one of the apps bundled with the Apple Watch.\n\nPlease Note: SolarEdge admin console access is needed to generate the API key that is used to sign into the app.\nSolar Watch does not collect any of your data. Your API Key and any app activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and SolarEdge.

He believes passionately that once the physical body dies, our spirit lives on. He has dedicated his life to his own spiritual development and teaching, as well as offering peace and comfort during times of loss and bereavement. “To see a group of students walk out of one of my workshops inspired, awakened, motivated, and energized is all the gratitude that I need,” John says. “If I somehow help them to start their own journey, then I’ve done my job.” \n\nAuthor of the bestsellers Power of the Soul, Born Knowing, Psychic Navigator, and 101 Ways to Jump-Start Your Intuition, John also hosted his own weekly radio show on Hay House Radio, Spirit Connections. He has become a familiar face on TV on programs such as the A&E special Mediums—We See Dead People, as well as appearing as a psychic authority on the History Channel’s Psychic History. John’s story was originally profiled on CBS’s Unsolved Mysteries. \n\nFor further information about John, to find out about his series of workshops and other events, or to sign up for his free email newsletter, visit: www.johnholland.com"

Brilliant!.....highly recommended. Listen to what your dogs have been up too while your out. Very sensitive microphone. Absolutely genius app. Just what I was looking for to help train my dogs to be quiet while I am out and find out if the neighbours are over exaggerating. Picks up every single noise and very long recording time. Hope more quality apps like this to follow. Great tool.\n                          …\n\nWe recently got a rescue dog not used to having his own 'pack' and certainly not to being left alone. We were concerned he might be barking and that this would annoy or worry neighbours. We tried this app for the first time today and it worked perfectly! After an hour in, he started whining and barking a little, enough for the '20 second' criteria to be reached and the prerecorded 'quiet' message to be played. To my amazement listening to the recording afterward, he quietened down, was rewarded with the 'praise' I had recorded, and was quiet for the rest of the time we were out! Just amazing.\n                          …\n\nI would like to say, however, that your App completely solved my \"barking dog\" problem, and in one hit! Our dog is a reasonably well trained golden retriever, but our neighbour informed us in strained tones (so I guess it must have been going on for a while), that whenever we both went out, which was infrequent, the dog barked incessantly until our return. In more desperation than any real hope, I picked up my trusty iPad and googled.  Your App came up, so I installed it and tried it.  I had noted the \"Record reprimand\" and \"Record praise\" bits.  I was looking forward to hearing the result. From its first use, the dog, now, never barks when we go out, even if I don't leave the iPad! I think he's still trying to figure out how I knew, and was able to tell him off when he couldn't see me!\nCongratulations on a fantastic App!\n                          …\nPlease read the other reviews …"

From Polynesian (Tahitian, Samoan, Tongan, etc.) tatau. In Marquesan, tatu.\" Before the importation of the Polynesian word, the practice of tattooing had been described in the West as pricking, painting, or staining. Sailors on the voyage later introduced both the word and reintroduced the concept of tattooing to Europe.\n\nThis is not to be confused with the origins of the word for the military drumbeat — see military tattoo. In this case, the English word tattoo is derived from the Dutch word taptoe (OED).\n\nThe first written reference to the word tattoo (or tatau), appears in the journal of Joseph Banks (24 February 1743 – 19 June 1820), the naturalist aboard Captain Cook's ship the HMS Endeavour: \"I shall now mention the way they mark themselves indelibly, each of them is so marked by their humor or disposition\".\n\nThe word \"tattoo\" was brought to Europe by the explorer James Cook, when he returned in 1771 from his first voyage to Tahiti and New Zealand. In his narrative of the voyage, he refers to an operation called \"tattaw\". Before this it had been described as scarring, painting, or staining\n\nTattoo enthusiasts may refer to tattoos as \"ink\", \"pieces\", \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"tats\", or \"work\"; to the creators as \"tattoo artists\", \"tattooers\", or \"tattooists\"; and to places where they work as \"tattoo shops\", \"tattoo studios\", or \"tattoo parlors\".\n\n\nA tattooed man's back, Japan, c. 1875\nUsage of the terms \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"pieces\", and work\" is gaining greater support,[citation needed] with mainstream art galleries holding exhibitions of both conventional and custom tattoo designs. Beyond Skin, at the Museum of Croydon, is an example of this as it challenges the stereotypical view of tattoos and who has them. Copyrighted tattoo designs that are mass-produced and sent to tattoo artists are known as \"flash\", a notable instance of industrial design. Flash sheets are prominently displayed in many tattoo parlors for the purpose of providing both inspiration and ready-made tattoo images to customers.\n\nThe Japanese word irezumi means \"insertion of ink\" and can mean tattoos using tebori, the traditional Japanese hand method, a Western-style machine, or for that matter, any method of tattooing using insertion of ink. The most common word used for traditional Japanese tattoo designs is Horimono. Japanese may use the word \"tattoo\" to mean non-Japanese styles of tattooing."

The Aura Soma color-care-system® is a non intrusive, self selective, soul system.\n\n“Aura” means light, “Soma” means the body (Greek), or the being (Aramaic), or living energies (Sanskrit).　The Aura-Soma color care system connects the light to the body; it speaks of the being of light within and the living energies of light that surround us.\n\nCONSULTATION: Tap to make your selection of four Equilibrium bottles from a displayed set. Tap the bottles you’ve chosen and a message will appear.\nIn each bottle there are two color fractions. The messages of the colors are the doorways through which we understand the choice of bottles that has been made. Each color selection speaks of the superconscious recognition of the soul’s evolution, unique to that moment. – a recognition of the color code through time. \nThere is no difference between the consciousness that chooses, and the colors that are chosen.\n- First bottle: The Mission and Purpose\n- Second Bottle: The Gifts and Talents Bottle\n- Third bottle: Here and Now\n- Fourth bottle: Present Future\n\nNUMEROLOGY: Life Path Number (sometimes called the goal or lesson number) adding the birth date - relates to the subject’s circumstances rather than the person themselves. As this number is found from our birthdate, we can see how it can represent our circumstances, and what we can learn to express.\n\nLIBRARY: Includes 111 Equilibrium bottles and AURA-SOMA® New Aeon Tarot. Each bottle is compatible with numerology and tarot cards. The color therapy mode which reacts to the acceleration sensor will provide relaxation.\n\nThe Aura-Soma color-care-system® is continually being re-framed. It is about consciousness growth, bringing balance, ease and awareness to all levels of the body, mind and spirit, a means of moving towards positive well being and personal growth.\n\nLANGUAGE: English / Japanese / French / German / Italian / Spanish"

May I rest in our Oneness, dear Divine!\n\nIf you read the lines above and think, Easier said than done, this oracle deck is for you. In 52 beautifully illustrated cards, beloved spiritual teacher and author Tosha Silver uses her accessible, slightly quirky style to convey her key teaching messages of Surrender and Offering to Divine Will.\n\nThese messages, familiar to readers of Tosha’s highly acclaimed books (Outrageous Openness and Change Me Prayers), are, at their essence, about releasing attachment to ego-defined outcomes. Each card addresses a particular situation—Aging, Ambition, Money, Regrets, Solitude, Travel, Truth—with a comment or invocation that encourages you to offer your pain around this situation to the Divine, and to call in Divine Will for the highest outcome. Intentionally non-prescriptive, the deck can be used in a variety of ways: as an oracle where the Divine guides you to a specific card; to carry or put on an altar as a reminder to reflect on a specific issue; or in any other way you are drawn to use it.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Browse The Wild Offering Oracle cards anywhere, anytime on your iOS device*\n- Save cards to review at any time*\n- Email cards to yourself or share with a friend*\n\nAbout the Author:\nTosha Silver - Graduated from Yale with a degree in English-Literature but along the way fell madly in love with yogic philosophy.

But of course it's not as simple as that. \n\nYou have to change the way that you think if you want to change your world, and in this special deck, Esther & Jerry Hicks help you learn how to align yourself and focus your energy to manifest prosperity.\n\nLearn how to create abundance by:\n\n· Focusing on what you want in your life and not on what you don't have\n· Seeing yourself as wealthy not poor\n· Visualizing yourself as enjoying the object or lifestyle that you dream of\n\nAbraham's powerful techniques will teach you what prosperity truly is and enable you to use the Law of Attraction to bring this energy into your own life. \n\n\nFEATURES:\n- Browse Money, and the Law of Attraction Cards anywhere, anytime on your iOS device*\n- Save cards to review at any time*\n- Email cards to yourself or share with a friend*\n\n\nAbout the Author:\nExcited about the clarity and practicality of the translated word from the Beings who call themselves Abraham, Esther and Jerry Hicks began disclosing their amazing Abraham experience to a handful of close business associates in 1986.\nRecognizing the practical results being received by themselves and by those people who were asking practical questions and then applying Abraham’s answers to their own situations, Esther and Jerry made a deliberate decision to allow the teachings of Abraham to become available to an ever-widening circle of seekers of how to live a happier life.\n\nUsing their San Antonio, Texas, conference center as their base, Jerry and Esther have traveled to approximately 50 cities a year since 1989, presenting interactive Law of Attraction workshops to those leaders who gather to participate in this expanding stream of progressive thought. And although worldwide attention has been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading Edge thinkers and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham’s Law of Attraction concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures, and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person to person—as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences.\n\nIn November 2011, Jerry made his transition into Non-Physical, and now Esther continues to conduct the Abraham workshops with the help of her physical friends and co-workers and, of course, with the Non-Physical help of Abraham and Jerry.\nPeople are able to access Abraham directly by attending the seminars in person or by participating in the online live streaming of most events. There is also an extensive YouTube library of Abraham videos.\nAbraham—a group of uplifting Non-Physical teachers—present their Broader Perspective through Esther Hicks. And as they speak to our level of comprehension through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant, yet comprehensively simple essays in print and in sound, they guide us to a clear connection with our loving Inner Being, and to uplifting self-empowerment from our Total Self.\n\nOfficial Hay House licensed iOS App: www.HayHouse.com®"

The app will take a photo of you, it will analyse the colour palette, classify your type according to the four seasons with three subtypes each), and return a palette of colours in which you are likely to look best.\n\nYou can then take or upload a photo of something you might want to buy, but perhaps are not sure if the colour is good for you. The app will analyse the colour or colours and tell you if they are likely to match your colour type. For example, you can  take a screenshot of a piece of clothing that you want to buy online and check if its colours will be a good match.\n\nYou will be able to share the results of your colour analysis on social media, by email, message, or save to your photo library.\n\n A note of caution: the colour type determined by the app is quite sensitive to the light conditions. The tone of the colour of your skin, your hair, etc. changes depending on the intensity and the temperature of the light. Please do not expect 100% consistency between the result you get in full sunshine, or on a cloudy, rainy dull day. Ideally, take photos in full daylight, avoiding direct sunshine. Also see how  your colour type can be affected by different lighting conditions - perhaps in the evening, in artificial, you look better in a different choice of colours than at daylight?"

      "label": "The pH – Alkalinity Adjustment Tool is an incredibly accurate tool for adjusting pH and total alkalinity up or down in swimming pools. In the past, you had four choices for making adjustments to pH and alkalinity:\r\n\n1. Guess an amount of chemical to add, wait for thorough mixing and retest the water in 1-4 hours to see what it did\r\n2. Make an Acid or Base Demand Test to determine the amount of acid or base by counting drops, looking up the amount in a table, and then adding it. But this only makes the pH 7.5 and does not tell you what the new alkalinity will be after the addition\r\n3. Calculate the amount of alkalinity increase or decrease, add the chemical dose, wait for mixing, and then see what the new pH is\r\n4. Use an app or water analyzer that supposedly gives correct chemical amounts but only gives an amount for pH or alkalinity adjustment\r\n\r\nNone of these methods are acceptable or accurate and they require waiting and retesting.\r\n\r\nNow with the pH – Alkalinity Adjustment Tool, you input the pool volume and water conditions and it calculates the exact amount of chemicals to add to reach either a Target Alkalinity (and it provides you with a new pH) or to reach a Target pH (and it provides a new Alkalinity). We call this pH Priority and Alkalinity Priority. \r\n\r\nYou enter Pool Volume and levels for CYA, Borate, Calcium Hardness, Salt or TDS, and Temperature on the first screen. Then on the second screen, you enter Current pH and Current Alk in the yellow cells near the top and then enter Target pH in the yellow cell in the red pH Priority Section and Target Alkalinity in the yellow cell in the green Alkalinity Priority section. You instantly see the chemical amounts needed for obtaining either pH Priority (red section) or Alkalinity Priority (green section).\r\n\r\nThere is also a note below the green section stating that when alkalinity is on Target and pH is less than 7.5, aerate and cause turbulence to only raise pH. By doing this you can get pH 7.5 and Alkalinity of 90 ppm.\r\n\r\nSo, you can choose whichever Priority you want – pH or alkalinity. You can also change Targets to see what it will do. The Conditions on the first screen can be changed also to see what effect they will have on pH and alkalinity. Changing any condition on the first screen will change dose amounts and New pH and New Alk on screen 2.\r\n\r\nChanging Target pH will change the chemical dose amounts and the New Alk.\r\n\r\nChanging Target Alk will change the chemical dose amounts and the New pH.\r\n\r\nThe pH – Alkalinity Adjustment Tool is an accurate and easy way to know what chemicals are needed to achieve perfect water balance. You can decide what Targets you want for pH and alkalinity and it will calculate everything for you. No more guessing and testing to see what changed. No more under or over-dosing. Save money by knowing the exact doses of chemicals and what they will do to pH and alkalinity.\r\n\r\nThe pH – Alkalinity Adjustment Tool is different from the Pool Acid Dose Calculator because the Pool Acid Dose Calculator only works for lowering pH and alkalinity and only from Current pH 7.6 to 8.2, Current Alkalinity from 70 to 220 ppm with a Desired pH from 6.0 to 8.1 and CYA of 0, 30, 50 or 100 ppm and Borate of 0, 30 and 50 pm. It also has 0.1 limits for all conditions. \r\n\r\nThe pH – Alkalinity Adjustment Tool works for any current or starting pH and alkalinity, any CYA, any borate, any calcium hardness, any TDS, any temperature with any Target pH or alkalinity, and it works for raising or lowering both with an accuracy of 0.01. It is also much more accurate than the Pool Acid Dose Calculator because it uses all sources of hydrogen ion (H+) in the water.\r\n\r\nThere is no other tool like this available for the pool and spa industry."

Depending on your location, the application choose the appropriate calculation method and Fiqhi school. \n\nFor an accurate location, please ensure that your location settings and your Internet connection or your GPS are enabled!\n\nNote about App features :\n-------------------------------\nIf you are familiar with Salatuk in other platforms please note that this version DOESN'T SUPPORT some features like \"Turn Phone to Silent after Athan\". Other features like \"Full Athan\" and \"Custom Athan\" are supported only when the app is ope. This is because of technical limitations. We will try to fix it once iOS system allows it.\n\nNote about Athan :\n-----------------\nSalatuk remind you that it's time for prayer with a \"4 takbeerats\" instead of full Athan. Because of technical limitations, it's possible to play full Athan only if the app is open. \n\nAlso, if you have problems to hear the notifications, please make sure to enable the following parameters in your device :\n\n1) Settings>Sounds>Alerts \n2) Settings>Notifications>Salatuk \n3) Your phone is not on mute and volume is correct\n\nNote about Prayers times :\n-----------------------------------\nPlease note that we pay attention to ensure that the prayer times of Salatuk are accurate. However, in some countries those times may be not exact. In this case, please refer to the official islamic institutions or mosques in your country and adjust manually the prayer times in the application settings.\n\nSalatuk supports currently 3 languages : Arabic, English and French.\n\nTips for a better usage\n-----------------------------\n\n1- In order to refresh the prayer alarms, make sure to open the application once a week. Please do so also when you change your location or timing (summer time).\n\n2- The prayer alarms corresponds to 2 or 4 Takbeerats.

It also provides a description for each phase, sign and mansion. You can navigate through the information in various ways — say, phase-by-phase, day-by-day or month-by-month - whatever is more convenient for you. \n\nPhases show you the energy of the day, signs — the mood of the day, while the void-of-course periods might tell you when it is better not to do certain things. Mansions were used by different cultures from the time immemorial, they tell for what a particular day is good or not so good.\n\nTo calculate the times, iLuna uses the time zone of the device on which it runs, so if your iPhone or iPod touch shows your current time correctly, iLuna's information is precise too.\n\nOnce any of the events reported by iLuna happens, you will get a notification, provided you allowed the app to send you notifications."

They are based on the work of topographer Sylvain Pitiot and on the expertise of Pierre Poupon, a great connoisseur of Burgundy.\n\nIn Atlas Bourgogne you can see our maps which cover the 1463 climates of Burgundy. These localities are the mark of the terroir and the personality of the wine you taste.\n\nWhether you are a Chablis, Aloxe-Corton, Gevrey-Chambertin or Vougeot lover, you will find the climate from which your glass of wine comes! These climates represented on our exclusive maps, which cover the Côte de Beaune and the Côte des Nuits, but also the rest of Burgundy. You can directly search the terroir of your bottle and view it on our maps.\n\nYou can also keep a logbook, as you explore the vineyards of Burgundy.

The 60 cards in this beautifully illustrated deck give Mike Dooley’s fans a new way to experience his signature Notes from the Universe, quirky, funny messages that remind readers to love their lives and trust their dreams.

The Notes in this deck, set off by photographs of nature’s own gorgeous and richly varied abundance, are brief passages designed to remind us that we could not possibly be more loved, more powerful, or more deserving of all that our hearts desire. “Today, you are a magnet for infinite abundance, divine intelligence, and unlimited love,” the Universe tells us. “Actually, this has always been true.” \n\nFEATURES: \n- Browse Notes from The Universe on Abundance cards anywhere, anytime on your iOS device* \n- Save cards to review at any time* \n- Email cards to yourself or share with a friend* \n\nOfficial Hay House licensed iOS App: www.HayHouse.com®\n\nAbout the Author: Mike Dooley is a New York Times best-selling author, metaphysical teacher, and creator of the wildly popular “Notes from the Universe” whose acclaimed books—including Life on Earth: Understanding Who We Are, How We Got Here, and What May Lie Ahead; Leveraging the Universe: 7 Steps to Engaging Life’s Magic; and Infinite Possibilities: The Art of Living Your Dreams—have been published worldwide in 25 languages.

      "label": "Whether you are a professional Paranormal Investigator, a hobbyist or just want to have some fun, this app works like a \"Spirit Box\" reading data from your sensors and turning it into spoken words.\n\nWith a database of over a thousand commonly used words, Ghostalker will read changes in all of the sensors it can find in your device. This includes sensors for the tiniest amount of vibration, rotation, GPS, gyroscope, light, magnetic fields, proximity etc. and convert them to words which it will display and speak. This app uses the actual raw data from the sensors to determine what to say, rather than picking words at random like some other apps.\n\nLOGGING: This is the full version of the app so it logs the words spoken for you to view, save, email, delete etc. at a later time. There is also a built-in log viewer. The date and time is logged, along with the combined change in sensor readings (so you can see how big a change was picked up) and the word. The log files are in CSV format so you can import them into your favourite spreadsheet (e.g. MS Excel or Google Sheets).\n\nDICTIONARY: You can also manage your own custom dictionary of words so you can make your own special list of replies. You can flick between the in-built dictionary, your own custom dictionary or both combined (from v0.5) at any time.\n\nThis app is not designed to form complete sentences so it is up to you to interpret what it says in your own way. Top end phones and tablets tend to have more sensors than low end ones but the app is designed to work with whatever it can find. The sensitivity of sensors will also vary between devices.\n\nTIP 1: Using the custom dictionary you can have it reply with special limited words, for example 'yes', 'no' and 'maybe' when you ask it questions. Or add a series of digits and get it to pick your lottery numbers. Or add the letters of the alphabet so it can work like a Ouija board. \n\nTIP 2: Paranormal investigators believe that leaving such devices running for as long as possible will allow \"spirits\" to learn what energy is required to trigger certain words.\n\nTIP 3: If it starts to trigger words constantly you may be getting interference from something close by. Try moving the device somewhere else or tap the 'Calibrate' button to get it to tune out background variance (although you will lose some sensitivity).\n\nTIP 4: NEW - Keep lists of custom words in text files. Each word should be on its own line or separated by a space. Select all of the words and copy them to the clipboard. You can then import them into Ghostalker by pasting them from the clipboard. You can also copy word lists from the web, an email, or anywhere you can copy text.\n\nIf the app does not do what you were expecting, or there is an issue with it running on your device, please contact us for help.\n\nThere are no adverts in this software. If you would like to try the free version first (without the logging or custom dictionary functionality), it is listed under \"Ghostalker Lite\"."

As you journey through life, the Spirit Guides and Totem Animals in this card deck will give you guidance about relationships, romance, career and all of life’s challenges.\n\nThe Spirit Guides in this app appear when you require answers. Their advice is as varied as nature itself. They may remind you about the importance of cooperation and unity, or tell you to walk your own path.

Your Spirit Guides are much more complex than that. They can help you face challenges and answer your questions when it is most needed.\n\nThe Spirit Guides in this Beauty Everywhere oracle app can help you connect with your own inner wisdom. The messages within these cards can magnify your natural intuitive abilities and aid you in navigating the twisting, and often surprising, paths of life.  These supportive and truth-telling guides will help you understand, clarify or see your situations and questions in an insightful way.  \n\nFEATURES:\n \n- Give readings anywhere, anytime\n- Choose between different types of readings\n- Save your readings to review at any time\n- Email readings to friends\n- Browse the entire deck of cards\n- Flip cards over to read each card's meaning\n- Get the most out of your deck with the complete guidebook\n- Set a daily reminder for a reading"

      "label": "The MOST WANTED features in all drones: Course Lock & Home Lock.\nNow available for your DJI Spark & Mavic Air!\nAlso works on all DJI drones that use DJI Go 4. \n\nThe new DJI Mavic Mini will be supported as soon as DJI allow developers to build apps for it. Get ELIT now so you don't miss it.\n\n\"Now your drone can face any direction while moving.\"\n\n\"No more mentally switching left-right & front-back when the drone is flying towards you.\"\n\n ●●● Features that are already available ●●●\n• Course Lock - Any forward input will bring it towards the current heading & any reverse input will bring it away from that heading. No matter where the drone is facing after that.\n• Home Lock - Allows the drone to face any direction, pulling back on the stick will always move it towards the home point.\n• Normal Mode - Moving the stick forward will bring the drone to wherever it’s facing. If the direction of the drone is changed, the heading will change accordingly.\n• Elit works perfectly with iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch. Purchase once for all your devices.\n• Fully supports landscape orientation. Works seamlessly with your DJI Go 4 app.\n\nOh yes, it's a one-time purchase, FREE future updates forever. We have planned some big updates for Elit. You'll like it!\n\n●●● How to use? ●●●\nAs easy as 1-2-3.\n1. Connect your device to DJI controller & aircraft.\n2. Launch this app. Tap \"Apply & Fly\".\n3. DONE! You will be redirected to DJI Go 4 app. Continue flying your drone with the newly unlocked control mode.\n\n\n●●● What is Course Lock? ●●●\nThe other drones manufacturers call it \"Headless Mode\". It allows new pilots to control the input of a drone. They can set and handle the orientation of the drone without changing its direction. No matter where your drone’s front side is pointing, moving the stick forward will always make the drone go forward in your current point of view.\n\nFor kids & even adults who use drones for fun, flying a drone with Course Lock feature is the best option they can have. This feature minimises the chances of drone crashes thus avoids damage. Entry-level drones (such as DJI Spark & DJI Mavic Air) are the ones which most require the Course Lock & Home Lock mode.\n\nAny questions, request, etc. can be addressed to elit [at] danielvw [dot] com.\nAnd if you like Elit, please share your love by rating & reviewing it on the App Store. Thank you!\n\nHappy Droning!"

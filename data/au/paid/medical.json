      "label": "Researchers at Monash University have developed the low FODMAP diet and a corresponding app to assist in the management of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The Monash University FODMAP diet works by swapping foods high in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs), with low FODMAP alternatives. Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

      "label": "Meet Freya, your virtual birth partner from The Positive Birth Company! Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth.

      "label": "IC@N is a troubleshooting 'survival' guide and introductory handbook for healthcare staff new to the exciting world of critical care medicine.\n\nThe information provided here focuses upon and succinctly addresses common, important, and urgent clinical problems that may arise without warning in any patient. Many of the topics covered here are practical questions for which the simple and safe solution is not always apparent or accessible from medical texts or obscure hospital policy documents. \n\nIC@N is based on a problem-oriented and practical approach: What should I do now? The information contained in IC@N is deliberately simple, direct, and specific. Some will think it too specific. It assumes a basic level of medical knowledge and clinical experience, plus a degree of common sense. It does not contain detailed or comprehensive treatment guides for specific diagnostic conditions nor definitive long-term treatment, that is available elsewhere from other sources. IC@N is not intended to be exhaustive nor comprehensive text book, rather a guidebook.\n\nThe guidelines in IC@N have been developed, trialled, and revised over several years by the medical and nursing staff at Northern Health and Eastern Health (Melbourne, Australia). \n\nOur motto: soins intensifs sans frontieres (critical care without borders). The skills of critical care can be taken outside of the Intensive Care Ward (or ICU/ITU)  to other areas of acute health care with the intention of preventing and treating serious illness before it becomes irreversible."

      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

Inside this colorful app, you will find easy to follow suggestions on how to improve your health through nutrition and the food choices you make every day. This app provides comprehensive and actionable nutrition guidelines for how to reduce your risk, prevent and combat Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, its symptoms and complications.\r\n\r\nRecent research shows that there are a number of nutrients and natural food items that play a significant role in dealing with NAFLD. If you rather tackle health issues and risks through proper nutrition and lifestyle changes then this app is for you!\r\n\r\nA number of powerful, unique and interactive features make this app so different and superior to others in the market:\r\n\r\n• Separate dietary guidance for NAFLD AND its combination with the following most likely health issues: diabetes type 2, excess weight or obesity, high cholesterol, high triglycerides, metabolic syndrome, PCOS, prediabetes and stress. \r\n\r\n• Is this food good for me? This feature answers the common question if a food of your choice is helpful or harmful to your personal situation. And it does so in an easy to understand and colorful graphic form.\r\n\r\n• Top-5 recommendations on what to eat/do, and what not to.\r\n\r\n• Food Suggestions. The best food choices within a food group, based on your personal profile. An extremely valuable tool when at restaurants or when grocery shopping. Over 850 natural food items and growing number of recipes are included. \r\n\r\n• Suggestions on appropriate life style choices, alternative therapies and herbal remedies, when such options are promising and available to you.\r\n\r\n• ACTIONABLE information on what is good, what is bad, and what is neutral for your condition(s). We don't just point you to a food group. We single out specific food items, and give you an ordered list of helpful and harmful foods within each food group. \r\n\r\nThe primary sources used by this app are US government agencies such as USDA, NIH (National Institute of Health), PubMed, and leading clinics & universities.\r\n\r\nPersonal Remedies is the producer of the world's first e-dietitian and publisher of the largest collection of health and nutrition apps for chronic conditions. Based in metro-Boston, home to the highest ranking healthcare providers and academic institutions in the world.\r\n\r\nThis app is updated by our team on an ongoing basis. Updates happen seamlessly, and do NOT require frequent inconvenient downloads.\r\n\r\n“This technology was developed using the most current clinical evidence-based information that is available in the US. Behind this technology there is a team of expert clinicians, scientists, endocrinologists, oncologists, and other specialists who are passionate about bridging the gap between expert knowledge and the patient.“ \r\nKatya Tsaioun, PhD, Nutrition, Tufts University; L.D.N.\r\n\r\n“Proper nutrition and other alternative treatments show great promise in preventing and treating many of the illnesses that we deal with every day. I encourage all my patients to follow appropriate nutrition and research other options for themselves. The Choose This Not That series are an excellent step towards improving people’s knowledge in this area.”\r\nShahin Tabatabaei, MD\r\nMass General Hospital; Harvard Medical School\r\n\r\n“The Choose This Not That series of apps provide dietary recommendations focused on common chronic health problems. They are easy to understand and thus easy to implement into daily life. Most doctors would find it difficult to discuss dietary recommendations at the level of detail found in the series. They should serve as a valuable complement in helping people manage chronic illnesses through dietary and lifestyle modifications.”\r\nAndrew S. Lenhardt, MD \r\nLahey Clinic, Beverly, MA"

When managing these patients you need the convenience of quick reliable information. What is more convenient than your phone in your pocket or your tablet?\n\nThis is where the KIMBA Veterinary Emergency Medicine Small Animal app comes in.\n \nGot a dog in hypovolaemic shock from acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea syndrome? Need a quick reminder of cardiovascular perfusion assessment? What about guidelines on fluid resuscitation and a fluid dose calculator?\n\nGot a tomcat with urethral obstruction (“blocked cat”)? Need a quick reminder of management priorities? What about how to treat clinically significant hyperkalaemia including drug doses and a dose calculator?\n\nWHAT FEATURES DOES THE APP OFFER?\n \nDrug dose calculators:\n•\tSingle doses\n•\tSingle agent infusions\n•\tMultiagent infusions, including separate morphine-lidocaine-ketamine (MLK) calculator\n \nFluid therapy calculators:\n•\tBolus calculator\n•\tInfusion calculator\n \nDrug formularies:\n•\tMost commonly used emergency medicine drugs with doses, routes and extra comments\n•\tSeparate searchable canine and feline formularies\n \nOther features: \n•\tExtensive ‘5-minute consult’ style information on a variety of emergency complaints and disorders – including all the classics!\n•\tQuick check data including e.g. physiological parameters, potassium and glucose supplementation charts, and CPR drug doses\n•\tSeparate sections on transfusion medicine and on neonates\n•\tClinical image gallery including radiographs and ECG strips\n \nThe app is downloaded to work offline offering guaranteed reliability irrespective of your practice’s internet connection.\n \nWHO IS THE APP FOR?\n \nThis app is for veterinary surgeons and nurses/techs working in small animal/mixed practice. It will be most valuable to those dealing with emergency patient. But oh wait, isn’t that all veterinary practices?! The calculators and formularies are especially useful regardless of how many emergency patients you see.\n \nThe app will also be very helpful for veterinary students (doctors, nurses/techs) as a learning resource and clinical tool. Including in those stolen moments between seeing a case and having someone quiz you on it. We’ve got your back!\n \nWHO CREATED THE CONTENT?\n \nShailen Jasani created the app. He is a small animal veterinary Emergency and Critical Care (ECC) specialist (Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care). He has extensive experience in both primary care and referral practice (www.shailenjasani.com, www.veteccsmalltalk.com). Shailen also has considerable teaching experience, especially with primary care vets and nurses/techs and with students.\n \nBased on this experience, Shailen has created an app that provides practical help to colleagues working in clinical practice.\n \nPlease note that Shailen is very happy for you to contact him (see below). With questions about the educational information provided or queries about small animal ECC in general. But please do not get in touch with urgent questions about active cases as Shailen may not be able to respond in a suitable timeframe.\n \nCONTACT INFORMATION and OTHER RESOURCES\n \nIf you have any problems with or comments about this app please get in touch with Shailen via email at shailenjasani@gmail.com or on Twitter @VetEmCC.\n \nFor more veterinary ECC resources, check out: the FREE Veterinary ECC Small Talk podcast available in Apple Podcasts, SoundCloud and on the Veterinary ECC Small Talk website (www.veteccsmalltalk.com/ecc-resources/).

You will discover if it has become melanoma, that’s a malignant mole, or if it’s benign.\nA skin cancer self exam is used to identify suspicious moles or lesions that may be cancer or growths that may develop into skin cancer (precancers). Individuals who are at a high risk of skin cancer are encouraged to perform frequent skin self exams. It is explained, within the app, how to track and review the moles and lesions.\nWhen it comes to Skin Cancer, there is a lot of information out there and it's very hard to be sure you're making the right decisions. That's where this app becomes more and more useful. By using Artificial Intelligence, we can help take some of the guesswork out of your condition. \n\nSkin cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer. Melanoma, specifically, is responsible for 75% of skin cancer deaths, despite being the least common skin cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates over 100,000 new melanoma cases were diagnosed in 2020.\n\nSource datasets: \nAs the leading healthcare organization for informatics in medical imaging, the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM)'s mission is to advance medical imaging informatics through education, research, and innovation in a multi-disciplinary community.

There is an initial Word Prediction list loaded on startup, and ClaroCom can learn new words as they are typed if desired. \n\n• Phrase Prediction\nUse Phrase Prediction when typing into the Message Window. The phrases are loaded from the contents of the visible categories and ClaroCom stores new phrases that are typed or added. The predicted phrases appear on a Phrase bar above the keyboard. Phrases can be easily searched for, and bulk phrases can be easily added.\nPrediction works with acronyms, so as 'awn' is typed, 'Are We Nearly There Yet?' appears instantly. This is a very fast way to build up and learn a collection of phrases.\nSpeak a predicted word or phrase immediately with a ‘touch and hold’ instead of composing into a message – another faster way to get speech out. \n\nA swipe brings up more phrases and words that can be easily scanned through. \n\nFlexible phrases include fillable prompts so ClaroCom will know, when the 'I would like ___' phrase is selected, that immediately the user will be asked for the word(s) to complete the phrase. \n\nWith ClaroCom Pro phrases and words can be easily imported from files to quickly build complex phrase vocabularies from existing text resources, including files transferred via iTunes.\n\n• Dictionary\nChoose from a range of Word Prediction dictionaries.\n\n• High-Quality Voices\nAlong with the iOS system voices, 2 high-quality Nuance Vocalizer voices are included in this edition:\n◆ Tom - English (USA)\n◆ Samantha - English (USA)\n\nThe voice can be made to speak faster or slower you suit your needs. The voice is installed within ClaroCom, so will work when not online.\n\nAdditional Vocalizer Expressive and Acapela voices in other accents are available through in-app purchase in ClaroCom.\n\n• Font and Color\nChange the font size, color or use a more-readable font to maximize ease-of-reading, making ClaroCom easily adaptable to different users' needs.\n\n• Personalize information\nClaroCom can be personalized to suit your individual needs, basic personal information is easily added and will appear in Phrases. ClaroCom Pro can be personalized by setting your name, so many phrases will detect and use it, saving time. \n\nFor the latest news, tips and advice follow @ClaroComApp on Twitter."

      "label": "SleepCheck is more than a sleep or snore recorder, it assesses your risk of sleep apnoea by analysing your breathing and snoring sounds while you sleep. \n\n**Why should I take the test?**\nSleep apnoea (or apnea) is a serious medical condition that can have a major impact on your life. If you have sleep apnoea, air stops flowing to your lungs for ten seconds or longer during sleep. In some cases, this can happen more than 30 times per hour all night. \n\nSleep apnoea affects more than three in every ten men, and nearly two in every ten women. Studies have shown that 80% of people with sleep apnoea are undiagnosed. \n\n**How the SleepCheck app works**\nSleepCheck records your breathing and snoring sounds while you sleep. SleepCheck then uses clinically proven machine-learning algorithms to assess your risk of sleep apnoea. \n\nIn just a few steps, you can find out if there is more to your snore.\n\n1.\tMake sure you are the only person sleeping in the room\n2.\tAnswer a few questions on your age, gender and neck size\n3.\tBefore you sleep, place your phone on your bedside table, press record and go to sleep\n4.\tWhen you wake up, stop the recording \n5.\tSee your results and understand next steps\n\n- Your privacy and data is protected. No account setup required. - \n\nYour sleep recording never leaves your iPhone. Once analysed, it is deleted. \n\nYour age, gender, sleep duration and risk assessment will be collected by ResApp Health and used to improve our products and services. This will not include any data that will identify you. To find out more, please read our privacy policy.\n\nFor use on adults aged 18 years and above.\n\nAlways read and follow the Instructions before Use.

A separate device is required.\n\nWhat kind of analysis does iBP provide?\n\niBP uses color icons to indicate when your blood pressure values are normal, high, or hypertension. It also provides interactive graphs that allow you to display your values by weeks, months, year and time of day. The graphs display lows, highs, averages, and trend lines using statistical analysis.\n\nWhy iBP vs. other blood pressure apps?\n\niBP is a universal app designed to work on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, which means you only pay for the app once and you get all versions! iBP is the only blood pressure app with a built in transfer capability to sync all your iOS devices.\n\nWhat are the key features?\n\n* Reads and writes Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data (details below)\n* Easy data input using dials instead of keyboard\n* Transfer capability to sync all of your iOS devices\n* Calculates Mean Arterial Pressure and Pulse Pressure\n* Track one personal item (blood glucose, stress level, medication dosage, exercise time)\n* Backup / Restore capability\n* Multiple users\n* Multiple email addresses (you and doctor)\n* Multiple email formats (PDF, HTML, CSV, Plain Text)\n* Passcode to protect your data\n* Touch Id for passcode on devices that support it\n* Snapshot of the graphs can be saved\n* User configurable color ranges\n* Weight units (lb or kg)\n* Withings Blood Pressure Monitor & Wireless Scale\n\nApple Health\niBP is now able to read and write Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data. If your blood pressure monitor (i.e., Omron, iHealth, Withings) adds data to Apple Health then you can easily import that data into this app. If you manually input your data into this app, then it will write that data to Apple Health.\n\nWithings + iBP = No more data entry!\niBP can retrieve your blood pressure and weight data directly from your Withings account.  The Blood Pressure Monitor and wireless Body Scale automatically record and send the data to your account.  There is no data entry required and you can view the data anywhere using a web browser or a variety of mobile apps.\n\n\nDisclaimer: iBP is intended to be used as a means to collect data to be shared with your doctor.

      "label": "What is All the Feelzzz?\r\n\r\n\nAll the Feelzzz is designed specifically for and with input from the autistic community.  Autistic individuals often experience sensations (e.g., pain and discomfort) differently than neurotypical people do.  As such, All the Feelzzz is designed to represent these differences by providing graphical representations that attempt to capture a more complex, subtle, and/or multidimensional experience of feels that may resonate more with autistic people and people who process sensory input differently in general.  These complexities, and the multidimensional nature of feels for autistic people, must be accounted for in any tool or strategy that aims to support the challenges that can come with attempting to heal or minimize unwanted feels, seek help, or simply express oneself in ways that are authentic and unmasked.  Thus, qualities such as texture, intensity, imagery, color, and a  full range of tactile qualities are represented in All the Feelzzz graphics! \n\nThe images have been carefully conceptualized and developed in hopes that one or many qualities of a Feelz card will resonate with a person, and therefore, help them to name, understand, and express their experience in ways that are not forced by external sources (e.g., traditional pain scales; “How much does it hurt?”, which often pose problems for autistic people).  Indeed, there may be others outside of the autistic community that may find this way of communicating supportive of their needs.  We hope it will be a tool used widely by those for whom it resonates.\n\nWho is this App for? \n•\tAutistic people on their own, in collaboration with their partners and carers, or with partners guiding and facilitating the process. All the Feelzzz is designed to provide autistic individuals with an alternative means of communicating “pain, discomfort, and perceived difference” in their bodies.  This system is most appropriate for individuals who use symbols (e.g., spoken words, pictures, signs, augmentative systems, etc.) to communicate, although the graphics are intended to provide access to those who may not be reading or be able to express themselves in the middle of a Feelz.\n•\tFamily members and carers-  All the Feelzzz is designed to support the ability of someone to be a Responsive Partner to an autistic person experiencing “pain, discomfort and perceived difference in their body.”   It is also designed to help the partner be a Supportive Partner / Facilitator who has tools and strategies for helping autistic people use the Feelz as a means of expressing their experiences.\n•\tTeachers-  All the Feelzzz is a differentiated approach that teachers will find useful to support and empower their autistic learners’ authentic voice in educational settings.\r\n•\tHealth care professionals and staff in clinical and hospital settings who are supporting autistic patients- All the Feelz can be used to support patients who are not able to accurately use standard pain scales to communicate their dynamic experiences with difference in their bodies.  It utilizes accessible sensory based / visual formats accessible to individuals who have a wide range of communication styles,\r\n\nNote: Although it has been specifically crafted by and for autistic experiences, it can be used for anyone who might experience feels differently and/or find it challenging to describe what’s going on inside their body to others when the need to do so arises.\n\nThe Feelz cards are intended to assist in the identification of bodily feels, but there is much power in the fact that no words are needed to show the card, or cards, selected to partners! After all, being able to communicate clearly when you need someone to be aware of what is going on in your body can be massively beneficial to your health, safety, and general well-being.  \n\nMay the FeelZzz be with you... literally... in your pocket... in your palm... whenever you need them :)\n\n- Amy and Jacquelyn\nAutism Level UP! ©"

The model is based on data derived from women found to have at least one adnexal tumor that was judged not to be physiological, underwent a standardized ultrasound examination, and was later selected for surgery. \n\nThe ADNEX model contains nine predictors: age, serum CA-125 (U/ml), type of center (oncology vs other), maximum lesion diameter, proportion of solid tissue, number of papillary projections, the presence of >10 cyst locules, acoustic shadows, and ascites. An oncology center is defined as a tertiary referral center with a specific gynecological oncological unit. \n\nThe model was developed by clinicians and statisticians from the International Ovarian Tumour Analysis (IOTA) group, and is based on clinical and ultrasound data from almost 6000 women recruited at 24 centers in 10 countries (Italy, Belgium, Sweden, Czech Republic, Poland, France, UK, China, Spain, and Canada).\n\nA full description of model development and validation is given in Van Calster B, Van Hoorde K, Valentin L, Testa AC, Fischerova D, Van Holsbeke C, Savelli L, Franchi D, Epstein E, Kaijser J, Van Belle V, Czekierdowski A, Guerriero S, Fruscio R, Lanzani C, Scala F, Bourne T, Timmerman D.

It gives you immediate information on acid-base status and allows to graphically display the trend of the patients’ multiple evaluations. \n• For more exhaustive information on metabolic disorders, the anion gap (AG) can be calculated with an intuitive visual method.\n• Serial evaluations of both Gas Exchange and Acid-Base balances can be saved and are available on a table. \n• You can export data in pdf format and print or send via email the pdf.\n• A detailed diagnosis of the Acid-Base disorder is provided according to the Acid-Base balance and Sodium and Chloride values. \n• For each Acid-Base disorder a list of potential causes is provided.\n• Your personal evaluations can be saved on a patients list.\n• In the settings tab, you can choose the unit of measure for O2 and CO2 partial pressure (i.e., mmHg vs kPa)."

Based on extensive literature review, Ortho Traumapedia compiles the current standard of care in a high-yield, easy to use format including dozens of original images to help visualize fracture patterns and radiologic findings. \n\nOriginally developed by orthopedic surgeons for orthopedic surgeons, practitioners of all levels and specialties who encounter adult skeletal trauma will find Ortho Traumapedia useful as a condensed reference and educational tool. Whether you’re a primary care or emergency physician, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, resident or medical student, Ortho Traumapedia provides highly pertinent information regarding skeletal trauma right at your fingertips. \n\nOrtho Traumapedia is organized into chapters by bone (for fractures) and joint (for dislocations). Each chapter is divided into four sections: Facts, Imaging, Classification and Treatment: \n\nFacts begins with epidemiology and common injury mechanisms. This is followed by an outline of pertinent anatomy, eponyms and variants. Finally, patient presentation, examination and management tips are presented. \n\nImaging begins with the standard radiographic examinations for each anatomic region. This is followed by injury-specific views, relevant metrics and findings as well as supplemental modalities. \n\nClassification outlines the most common classification systems used to describe the selected injury. \n\nTreatment begins with general treatment principles and reviews treatment in the acute setting. This is followed by standard of care options grouped by injury pattern. Common complications associated with the injury are included at the end of this section. \n\nSimply select the bone or joint you’re interested in from the main menu and navigate between the four sections with the buttons on the bottom of the screen. Return to the main menu by pressing the left arrow in the title bar. There's never been a simpler, more mobile skeletal trauma reference!"

He or she can view it within the email or add it to their own copy of Medical Mnemonics with a single click.\n\nUpdates will be free for life and will include new mnemonics submitted by users (that's you!) and added as we all continue learning together.\n\nEvery mnemonic is physician-reviewed, but we're only human. If you find a mistake, email us; we will pay a $5 bounty per substantive mistake found to the first reporter of that mistake!"

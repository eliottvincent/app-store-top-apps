The Monash University FODMAP diet works by swapping foods high in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs), with low FODMAP alternatives. Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

The relevant dB values are displayed while the thresholds are being set. \n\nThe Current, Maximum and Peak dB values are displayed on the main screen, these can be switched ON/OFF as required. The Peak value can be reset at any time by simply tapping on it.\n\nThe app can also be calibrated, to take into account local environmental conditions.\n\nThe \"Voice Volume Meter Pro\" can be useful if you are giving a speech, or presenting publically, by providing visual feedback on the volume of your voice. Making sure you are heard….but without shouting!\n\nYou can adjust various settings, (in addition to the Upper and Lower thresholds), such as a calibration slider, a slider to adjust the sampling rate, you can even select a different graphical theme….with more themes to come in future updates.\n\nYou have direct access to the developers (from inside the app) if you have any issues with it or can think of any ways in which it can be improved, we would love to hear from you. \n\nOur hope is that this app provides real value to all those people who need to control the volume of their voice."

Simply enter the known variable and the data is instantly calculated. \n\nDeveloped by an Emergency Physician, this app minimizes the risk of medical errors allowing the provider to spend more time caring for the patient, and less time looking up and calculating doses.  \n\nIt is a critical companion for any physician, nurse, paramedic, or medical trainee involved in the care of critically ill pediatric patients."

You will discover if it has become melanoma, that’s a malignant mole, or if it’s benign.\nA skin cancer self exam is used to identify suspicious moles or lesions that may be cancer or growths that may develop into skin cancer (precancers). Individuals who are at a high risk of skin cancer are encouraged to perform frequent skin self exams. It is explained, within the app, how to track and review the moles and lesions.\nWhen it comes to Skin Cancer, there is a lot of information out there and it's very hard to be sure you're making the right decisions. That's where this app becomes more and more useful. By using Artificial Intelligence, we can help take some of the guesswork out of your condition. \n\nSkin cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer. Melanoma, specifically, is responsible for 75% of skin cancer deaths, despite being the least common skin cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates over 100,000 new melanoma cases were diagnosed in 2020.\n\nSource datasets: \nAs the leading healthcare organization for informatics in medical imaging, the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM)'s mission is to advance medical imaging informatics through education, research, and innovation in a multi-disciplinary community. SIIM is joined by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), an international effort to improve melanoma diagnosis.

Why not be able to choose based on how you are holding the phone and what else you are doing at the same time?\n    • Use the numeric entry pad (0 3 3 0 2 0 0 8) and immediately see the results, OR\n    • Spin the date wheel at the bottom of the screen and tap Next.\n\n 3) Thorough results: All the information you would expect from a classic wheel, plus more:\n   • Estimated Due Date\n   • LMP Date\n   • Conception Date\n   • 1st Trimester End Date\n   • 2nd Trimester End Date\n   • Gestational Age\n   • Conceptional Age\n   • Expected Fetal Length based on standard fetal growth curves\n   • Expected Fetal Weight based on standard fetal growth curves (\"How much does my baby weigh, doctor?\")\n\nResults are relative to 'today' by default; this can be quickly changed to reflect any date by tapping the 'today' button and selecting a new date.\n\n 4) Accurate results: Perfect OB Wheel provides exact dates and accounts for all calendar variance, including leap years. \n\n 5) Persistence: Perfect OB Wheel remembers the date and date type you last used and restores them when launched to streamline your workflow.\n\n 6) Perfect OB Tracker upgrade: Available as an in-app purchase update, the Perfect OB Tracker lets you track any number of pregnancies, with at-a-glance due date and gestational age and one-tap access to all the data Perfect OB Wheel provides.  A  picture and text notes can be kept on each patient. Postpartum tracking is also available. Passcode locking is available for HIPAA compliance."

      "label": "The way we think determines both how we feel and how we behave. The way we think about ourselves, other people and our place in the world has a direct influence on our emotional state and our behaviour. Consequently by changing the way we think we can positively influence our mood and how we respond to situations.  This is the premise behind Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) which has become the most effective psychological treatment available for a range of emotional and behavioural problems including depression and anxiety. \n\nA thought diary is designed to help people record the thoughts that cause emotional and psychological distress. By recording our unhelpful thoughts, we can learn to identify thinking errors (also known as ‘negative’, ‘automatic’ or ‘dysfunctional’ thoughts). It is a common tool used in CBT to assist individuals in identifying unhelpful thinking patterns, which will then provide the opportunity to challenge and change these thoughts and thereby reducing psychological distress.  \n\nThis Thought Diary is designed to be the first step in changing our thoughts by helping individuals identify the trigger situations for their negative thoughts and the emotional and behavioural consequences of experiencing these negative thoughts. It was designed by an experienced clinical psychologist and CBT therapist who believed that these tools should be available in the most accessible form for individuals to use in today’s fast technological world. It can be used by people either in therapy as a useful adjunct to the treatment, and there is a feature that allows the Thought Diary to be emailed straight to their therapist. However, it can also be used by those individuals who are embarking on a self-guided course of CBT.\n\nWhen the Thought Diary is emailed it takes the traditional format of a CBT thought record.\n\nHow to Use:\nThe Thought Diary should be used when you experience a negative emotional state or engage in unhelpful or self destructive behaviour (Consequences). \n\nStep one: record what you were doing and where you were at that time (date, time and situation). This can help identify whether there is a particular pattern present in the emotional distress or behaviour problem. \n\nStep two:  note down what you were thinking at the time (thought), and how much you believed this thought (belief rating). The belief rating is useful to determine the degree to which we believe the thoughts, and can indicate whether the conviction in these thoughts changes when we challenge these thoughts in the next step of CBT. \n\nStep three: record how you felt and what you did in response (consequences). It can sometimes be easier to write down the consequences as the first step as they are primary indicators of distress, and then work through the other categories. There are usually both emotional and behavioural consequences, and sometime another thinking pattern is activated which is why we have provided a category for ‘thoughts’. \n\nHowever, it may not be necessary to complete all these categories in the consequences step if only emotional and/or behavioural disturbance is obvious."

If you have sleep apnoea, air stops flowing to your lungs for ten seconds or longer during sleep. In some cases, this can happen more than 30 times per hour all night. \n\nSleep apnoea affects more than three in every ten men, and nearly two in every ten women. Studies have shown that 80% of people with sleep apnoea are undiagnosed. \n\n**How the SleepCheck app works**\nSleepCheck records your breathing and snoring sounds while you sleep. SleepCheck then uses clinically proven machine-learning algorithms to assess your risk of sleep apnoea. \n\nIn just a few steps, you can find out if there is more to your snore.\n\n1.\tMake sure you are the only person sleeping in the room\n2.\tAnswer a few questions on your age, gender and neck size\n3.\tBefore you sleep, place your phone on your bedside table, press record and go to sleep\n4.\tWhen you wake up, stop the recording \n5.\tSee your results and understand next steps\n\n- Your privacy and data is protected.

Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

Using this app is the equivalent to spending hours with the world’s most experienced doctors teaching you about your calcium, parathyroid, osteoporosis, and vitamin D issues. Your tests results are analyzed to determine if a problem exists, what risks are associated, and what to do about it. Beautiful graphs make understanding these problems simple!\n\nBlood tests and bone density scans can be difficult to interpret—even many doctors do not diagnose calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid problems correctly or timely. Hyperparathyroidism is a disease that affects 1 in 800 people and 1 in 250 women over 50 and is very often overlooked while patients suffer from chronic fatigue, memory loss, depression, osteoporosis, bone pain and many other symptoms. Calcium Pro is a powerful software program that will analyze your calcium health and provide you guidance about the status of your bones, kidneys, parathyroid glands, vitamin D, and other related health issues.\n\nYou start by entering your test results for calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D. Then we look at your bone density (osteoporosis levels). CalciumPro will analyze and graph your tests making them easy to understand. It will let you know the status of your parathyroid glands and your chance of having hyperparathyroidism. Suggested next steps are given. Tracking tools will show your calcium and vitamin D levels over time, and will show if your bones are losing density (worsening osteoporosis), or gaining bone density. There are important learning tools on every page, and an extensive video and reading library at the end. The app will provide guidance about talking to your physician regarding the possible need for surgery and other important steps.\n\nA Risk Assessment Tool shows your relative risk for conditions associated with high blood calcium: Osteoporosis, Heart Disease, Heart Arrhythmias and Palpitations, High Blood Pressure, Kidney Stones and Kidney Failure, GERD, several Cancers, and others. Watch your risk assessment graphs change as you address your calcium problems. \n\nThis app was developed by doctors at the Norman Parathyroid Center, the world’s leading parathyroid and calcium treatment center using over 4,000,000 data points from over 30,000 patients. Let the world’s leading doctors help you understand these problems so you and your doctor can make important, informed decisions. Take control of your own health!"

We all know that the patient is the best doctor for himself and now it's up to you!\"\n\nHow? Well, Egyptian, Chinese, Indian, Tibetan doctors and even the Nazis used this alternative medicine technique called iridology. And \"Health Test\" app is an automated iris diagnostics system that will match your iris photo to the iris chart, which divide the iris into zones that corresponds to specific parts of the human body. You wouldn’t believe how much your eyes can tell about your health, it’s all connected. Try and see it for your self! It’s amazing when you can read your self from your eyes.\n\nHealth Test results are automatically generated by doing a three-step process. After analyzing you can run a catalog of the results by date, view them in details and even share it. Eventually you can take actions in your life by doing further investigation with your doctor’s recommendation."

      "label": "Bilateral Stimulation Therapy (BLST) is a neuropsychological treatment adapted from a treatment called EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). EMDR is a gold standard treatment according to the World Health Organisation for the psychological treatment of trauma. Bilateral Stimulation is a key therapeutic tool used in EMDR. \n\nBilateral Stimulation simply means stimulation of both sides of the brain using eye movements, sound or tactile stimulation. Typically, it may involve moving your eyes from left to right whilst following a target or paying attention to sound in your left ear then to your right. Bilateral stimulation is referred to as a ‘bottom – up’ approach as it works on the emotion engine of the brain, the limbic system. This approach reduces emotional distress which allows the cortical areas of the brain (thinking, reasoning, planning) to become more active and effective. The effect of this approach is often experienced more quickly and easily.\n\nBecause this therapy uses one element of EMDR, it is called BLST so as to not confuse or give the user a wrong impression about the complete standard EMDR therapy. BLST uses one part of EMDR, and therefore 2can be practiced at home, work or any quiet environment where you can spend five minutes or so undisturbed much like meditation. For more information about BLST and EMDR please visit www.mromeopsych.com/blst\n\nThis minimal app uses bilateral click which, when activated, sounds alternately in each ear. The speed, tone and length of the practice can be set by the user. The App has two options: 1. BLST mode (bilateral stimulation with sound) and 2. FLASH (an adaption of Dr Phillip Manfield’s FLASH technique. Please visit https://www.flashtechnique.com for more information).\n\nThis app is a clinical tool for psychologists, psychiatrists, EMDR therapists and their patients. While information is provided at www.mromeopsych.com/blst, you should consult your EMDR therapist before using it. Please note: Persons suffering with complex PTSD Dissociative Identity Disorder, Borderline Personality, Schizophrenia or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without consultation with your therapist.\n\nAs we are frequently updating this app to improve it’s functionality and increase its features, we ask that any comments or suggestions that you have, please contact us at admin@mromeopsych.com. Thank you."

Record or import photos and videos to create a visual record of tantrums or their aftermath.\n\nAn overview of the features provided by the app are:\n\n- Track multiple individuals, or import them from your Contacts list, and track their tantrums on an incident by incident basis through visual selection of simple information points.\n\n- Track the locations of tantrums, the types of behavior, the causes  (precipitators), responses taken, what mitigated the tantrums and the resolutions of an incident.\n\n- Track daily gluten, casein and medication details.\n\n- Add and remove your own user defined categories for behaviors, locations, precipitators, mitigators, responses and resolutions.\n\n- Record videos (up to 10 minutes), or take photos, for each tantrum incident, or its aftermath, from within the app or import existing photos or videos from your Photo Library. The photos or videos are tracked along with the tantrum data and made available through a media gallery for viewing and playback on your device.\n\n- Multiple ways to view your data, either in a calendar view or in a table view.\n\n- Provides a full \"notes\" system, which is available for providing text annotations (up to 25,000 characters)  on tantrum incidents, or for general notes and observations related to the individual.\n\n- Both media and notes data may be shared through e-mail, and photos and videos may be exported to your Photo Library.\n\n- Statistics for any individual may be viewed through a visual charting/graphing interface right on your device.\n\n- Export tantrum data as a CSV (comma separated values) file. Data is made available for download to your computer through iTunes for import into a any spreadsheet application where it may be viewed through more detailed charts and templates.\n\n- Built in documentation, for help while off-line.\n\n- Internationalized for most English speaking countries."

Just download this app.\n\n\nDo not mistake this app for other color blind apps. Color De Blind not only shows you what it is like to be color blind, but it also modifies live video to help color blind people see the real world in ways they haven't before.\n\n\nColor De Blind harnesses the graphics processor within your cell phone to run advanced color manipulation algorithms. These algorithms have existed on computers for some time, but have had limited utility to color blind people in the real world. Now, Color De Blind allows you to go anywhere your iPhone can go while experiencing colors in live, full-motion video.\n\n\nRunning these algorithms is no easy task, but finally the iPhone is able to make sense of a colorful, yet confusing environment. For every pixel your camera can see, the algorithms have to do 30 to 40 advanced algebraic problems. Just imagine taking 40 math tests for each one of the millions of pixels from your camera. Then imagine that Color De Blind is doing all those tests 30 times per second to show you a live video. \n\n\n\"This app will change the lives of color blind people in ways that no medical advancement has ever been able to. It's convenient, practical, and more importantly, useful to people who had previously been unable to distinguish between various colors. Aside from it's medical implications, it's also really helpful in showing people who are not color blind how debilitating and frustrating the condition can be.\" -Samantha Harris, M.D. \n\n\n\"Holy crap.

The aim of this app is to increase the intensity of treatment for people with apraxia, combining J. Rosenbek's integral stimulation approach with B. Hill's carrier phrase facilitation drills.  \n\nThis is the original Australian version of the application, with all audio and video recorded by the Australian speech pathologist Carol Bishop. The voice is suitable for countries like Great Britain but for speakers with an American accent we recommend the US version instead.\n\nThis application shows how to produce speech sounds and words and encourages speech, even in people with severe speech difficulties. This easy to use iPad application contains over 500 videos, sound clips and colour photos designed to help adults and children to produce the consonant speech sounds in isolation, in words and in sentences. Now includes recording, playback, rhyming words and randomisation. \n\nThis software is especially helpful to those who need to hear and see a sound made, for example, patients with motor speech difficulty due to speech apraxia (verbal or oral apraxia affecting speech). \n\nProvides multimedia full-motion video cues, for independent speech practice. Cues are for individual phonemes (sounds) as well as full words. \n\nEach exercise targets one word, divided into 20 consonant \npositions. For each exercise it provides: \n\n* Color photo \n* Auditory and written trigger phrase \n* Written word \n* Video clip of a speaker \n* Records and plays back patient's voice with model sound for comparison. \n\nThis app enables intensive independent practice for Motor Speech Disorders, with immediate auditory feedback."

Inside this colorful app, you will find easy to follow suggestions on how to improve your health through nutrition and the food choices you make every day. This app provides comprehensive and actionable nutrition guidelines for how to reduce your risk, prevent and combat Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, its symptoms and complications.\r\n\r\nRecent research shows that there are a number of nutrients and natural food items that play a significant role in dealing with NAFLD. If you rather tackle health issues and risks through proper nutrition and lifestyle changes then this app is for you!\r\n\r\nA number of powerful, unique and interactive features make this app so different and superior to others in the market:\r\n\r\n• Separate dietary guidance for NAFLD AND its combination with the following most likely health issues: diabetes type 2, excess weight or obesity, high cholesterol, high triglycerides, metabolic syndrome, PCOS, prediabetes and stress. \r\n\r\n• Is this food good for me? This feature answers the common question if a food of your choice is helpful or harmful to your personal situation. And it does so in an easy to understand and colorful graphic form.\r\n\r\n• Top-5 recommendations on what to eat/do, and what not to.\r\n\r\n• Food Suggestions. The best food choices within a food group, based on your personal profile. An extremely valuable tool when at restaurants or when grocery shopping. Over 850 natural food items and growing number of recipes are included. \r\n\r\n• Suggestions on appropriate life style choices, alternative therapies and herbal remedies, when such options are promising and available to you.\r\n\r\n• ACTIONABLE information on what is good, what is bad, and what is neutral for your condition(s). We don't just point you to a food group. We single out specific food items, and give you an ordered list of helpful and harmful foods within each food group. \r\n\r\nThe primary sources used by this app are US government agencies such as USDA, NIH (National Institute of Health), PubMed, and leading clinics & universities.\r\n\r\nPersonal Remedies is the producer of the world's first e-dietitian and publisher of the largest collection of health and nutrition apps for chronic conditions. Based in metro-Boston, home to the highest ranking healthcare providers and academic institutions in the world.\r\n\r\nThis app is updated by our team on an ongoing basis.

I encourage all my patients to follow appropriate nutrition and research other options for themselves. The Choose This Not That series are an excellent step towards improving people’s knowledge in this area.”\r\nShahin Tabatabaei, MD\r\nMass General Hospital; Harvard Medical School\r\n\r\n“The Choose This Not That series of apps provide dietary recommendations focused on common chronic health problems. They are easy to understand and thus easy to implement into daily life. Most doctors would find it difficult to discuss dietary recommendations at the level of detail found in the series. They should serve as a valuable complement in helping people manage chronic illnesses through dietary and lifestyle modifications.”\r\nAndrew S. Lenhardt, MD \r\nLahey Clinic, Beverly, MA"

A separate device is required.\n\nWhat kind of analysis does iBP provide?\n\niBP uses color icons to indicate when your blood pressure values are normal, high, or hypertension. It also provides interactive graphs that allow you to display your values by weeks, months, year and time of day. The graphs display lows, highs, averages, and trend lines using statistical analysis.\n\nWhy iBP vs. other blood pressure apps?\n\niBP is a universal app designed to work on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, which means you only pay for the app once and you get all versions! iBP is the only blood pressure app with a built in transfer capability to sync all your iOS devices.\n\nWhat are the key features?\n\n* Reads and writes Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data (details below)\n* Easy data input using dials instead of keyboard\n* Transfer capability to sync all of your iOS devices\n* Calculates Mean Arterial Pressure and Pulse Pressure\n* Track one personal item (blood glucose, stress level, medication dosage, exercise time)\n* Backup / Restore capability\n* Multiple users\n* Multiple email addresses (you and doctor)\n* Multiple email formats (PDF, HTML, CSV, Plain Text)\n* Passcode to protect your data\n* Touch Id for passcode on devices that support it\n* Snapshot of the graphs can be saved\n* User configurable color ranges\n* Weight units (lb or kg)\n* Withings Blood Pressure Monitor & Wireless Scale\n\nApple Health\niBP is now able to read and write Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data. If your blood pressure monitor (i.e., Omron, iHealth, Withings) adds data to Apple Health then you can easily import that data into this app. If you manually input your data into this app, then it will write that data to Apple Health.\n\nWithings + iBP = No more data entry!\niBP can retrieve your blood pressure and weight data directly from your Withings account.  The Blood Pressure Monitor and wireless Body Scale automatically record and send the data to your account.  There is no data entry required and you can view the data anywhere using a web browser or a variety of mobile apps.\n\n\nDisclaimer: iBP is intended to be used as a means to collect data to be shared with your doctor. This application is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

If you find a mistake, email us; we will pay a $5 bounty per substantive mistake found to the first reporter of that mistake!"

      "label": "Researchers at Monash University have developed the low FODMAP diet and a corresponding app to assist in the management of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The Monash University FODMAP diet works by swapping foods high in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs), with low FODMAP alternatives. Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

      "label": "Meet Freya, your virtual birth partner from The Positive Birth Company! Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

We can provide an always available, highly accurate replacement for a much more affordable price. Doctors and other medical professionals looking for a simple, fast and elegant way to measure the curvature of the spine can use this accurate tool. Doctors have used scoliometers as an effective tool in screening scoliosis for many years, and now with you can also have one conveniently on your phone. \n\nUnlike the physical one our digital scoliometer increases the range from 30 degrees to 50 degrees. This means you can screen higher scoliosis curves than ever before. It’s adapted for mild to severe scoliosis and suited to a wider range of uses.

      "label": "Naming Toolbox is a professional speech therapy app, designed for adults with aphasia due to stroke or cognitive-communication difficulties after brain injury. It targets word-finding, a common speech and language therapy target for people with aphasia. \n\n*** Fantastic value for money!\n*** Love the custom naming test\n*** Guess activity is wonderful for aphasia group therapy\n\n\"I have used Naming Toolbox with several patients who have aphasia and word-finding difficulties. It works great and I've definitely noted improvements in naming. I love the Guess activity and my clients have a lot of fun using it in our stroke communication group.  I also like the Describe activity - semantic feature analysis is something I work on a lot! The custom test is a really helpful way to informally assess word-finding and it also allows me measure progress by doing it again after a block of speech therapy. Thank you for this app! It has helped many people with aphasia improve their word-finding and practice useful strategies such as talking around words in conversation.\" ~Neuro Rehab SLT\n\nNaming Toolbox has 4 parts:\n\nTest: This allows you to create your own non-standardised naming test in order to screen a person’s word-finding ability. You can choose the items you wish to include in the naming test in Settings. Repeating the test after a period of naming therapy practice is a great way of monitoring client progress and their improved ability to name practiced vocabulary items. \n\nDescribe: This word-finding activity in Naming Toolbox is based on an evidence-based aphasia treatment approach called Semantic Feature Analysis. The user is shown a picture and is asked to describe each feature of the target word by answering a set of questions. Each of the buttons at the bottom of the screen in this word-finding activity have symbols that represent each question (category, appearance, function, location and more).\n\nGuess: This naming activity is based on an aphasia evidence-based treatment approach called Naming from Description. The person with aphasia is shown a question mark behind which there is a picture. There are buttons at the bottom of the screen with symbols representing each clue. The adult with aphasia can listen to and or read the clues and then guess the word. If they know the word but have difficulty retrieving or saying it, they could practise strategies such as gesturing, or drawing to help the other person know what it is. \n\nRepeat: The final word-finding activity in the Naming Toolbox app is Repeat. This activity is based on an evidence-based aphasia treatment approach called Errorless Learning. When doing this activity, the person with aphasia does not have to struggle to name an item. Instead they are given the spoken and written word and asked to listen and repeat three times. This aphasia treatment approach is often preferred by people with more severe aphasia and word-finding difficulties. \n\nFEATURES\n\n- 30 categories of vocabulary items\n- Clear and uncluttered user interface\n- Over 500 high-quality real-life photos of items for naming therapy \n- Create individual user profiles \n- Adjustable settings allowing you to choose the items you wish to test and/or practice in speech and language therapy sessions and at home\n- Easy tracking of naming test scores\n- The option to email a results summary\n- The automated iOS voice of Siri\n\nNaming Toolbox is perfect for use in speech therapy clinics and home practice. The engaging word-finding activities can help people with aphasia after stroke and cognitive-communication difficulties after brain injury. Download now to get started. \n\nAre you looking for a different kind of speech and language therapy app for aphasia? Find the one you need at http://www.aptus-slt.com/.

      "label": "What is ZeroPhobia Fear of Flying?\n\nZeroPhobia helps people to conquer their fear of flying. Developed by a team of psychologists and therapists from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, ZeroPhobia offers an evidence-based treatment program. All you need is your smartphone, a virtual reality viewer (e.g., Google Cardboard), some time, and a little dedication. Our goal is to make evidence-based treatment simple, accessible, and affordable.\n\nWhat you will get\n\nZeroPhobia is a complete treatment program to help you overcome your fear of flying. Six modules provide you with information about the nature of your fear, relaxation exercises, setting goals, getting through difficult moments, tackling negative thoughts, and practicing with challenging situations. Besides the modules, seven virtual reality levels allow you to practice with handling your fear during check-in, waiting for your flight, take off, turbulence, and landing. Tara, ZeroPhobia’s virtual therapist, guides you through every step of the way.\n\nFor whom?\n\nZeroPhobia is intended for anyone who suffers from fear of flying and wants to do something about it. You can follow ZeroPhobia by yourself, in your own time, and from the comfort of your own home. \n\nResearch and scientific background\n\nZeroPhobia is based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). This type of therapy is very effective in treating fears, like fear of flying. The effectiveness of ZeroPhobia has been tested by a team of researchers from VU University Amsterdam. In total, 153 people suffering from fear of flying recently participated in this randomized controlled trial. See our website (https://www.zerophobia.app/science/) for more information about our research.\n\nMedical Disclaimer\n\nZeroPhobia is intended for information and skill development purposes only. ZeroPhobia is not intended to replace personal consultation with a qualified healthcare professional or to provide medical treatment or advice. If you need more help than this program can offer, contact your doctor or an institution for professional healthcare in your area. You should always obtain professional or medical advice, appropriate to your own circumstances, with any questions you may have regarding a health or medical condition. ZeroPhobia cannot be used for diagnosis. People seeking a diagnosis for fear of heights or another mental condition should consult a medical practitioner or mental health professional. Consult your doctor or therapist before using this ZeroPhobia if you suffer from a heart condition, mood disorder, epilepsy, or a psychiatric or neurological condition."

      "label": "Excellent visual tool to aid professionals in educating patients and families about swallowing disorders. This app features custom-designed animations derived from MBSImP™ research on swallowing physiology and impairment. The animations accurately depict normal swallow physiology and provide clear examples of varying physiologic impairments of the swallow. Controls allow for zoom, slow motion, pause, and frame-by-frame scroll. Includes an overview of normal swallow function, and links to other educational resources. \n\nAnimations are of adult physiology and include:\n\n• Normal Swallow, Lateral View\n• Normal Swallow, A/P View\n• Example of Penetration with Aspiration\n• Impairment of Anterior Hyoid Excursion\n• Impairment of Bolus Hold \n• Impairment of Bolus Transport\n• Impairment of Epiglottic Movement\n• Impairment of Esophageal Clearance\n• Impairment of Initiation of Pharyngeal Swallow\n• Impairment of Laryngeal Elevation\n• Impairment of Laryngeal Vestibular Closure\n• Impairment of Lip Closure\n• Impairment of Mastication\n• Impairment of PES Opening\n• Impairment of Pharyngeal Contraction\n• Impairment of Pharyngeal Stripping Wave\n• Impairment of Soft Palate Elevation\n• Impairment of Tongue Base Retraction\n\n\nUser Notes: \n\n• Animations depict adult physiology, including normal swallow. \n\n• Animations do not include narration. Visual tool only. \n\n• The animations included in this app accurately represent the anatomy and physiology of normal and impaired swallowing function. They were developed in conjunction with the evidence-based \"Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile,\" or MBSImP.\n\n• Rarely does one physiologic swallow impairment exist alone. This app highlights primary impairments, but co-existing impairments typically occur and the examples shown here are no exception.  \n\n• Available for iPhone and iPad."

See for yourself why SLPs around the world are raving about Dysphagia Therapy!\n\nThis handy pocket reference will help you select the right treatments to address the impairments you’ve diagnosed in your dysphagia patients. You’ll have easy access to information about anatomy, cranial nerves, treatment procedures, and patient handouts, making it easier to know what you’re treating and how. \n\nNovice and experienced clinicians alike will benefit from knowing they’ve thought of all the options. You’ll love having all this information at your fingertips!\n\n\nKey Features:\n\n** Personalized options for therapy based on assessment results\n\n** Customized home programs for patients\n\n** Clinician & patient education tools built-in for quick reference\n\n\nThree top dysphagia clinicians have teamed up with Tactus Therapy, the leader in adult rehab apps, to bring you up-to-date information to help simplify your life and get your patients participating in an active swallowing rehab program.\n\n\nThe app has 4 parts:\n\n** Therapy Finder: input the impairments identified in your patients to see the therapy options that match best\n\n** Assessment: learn about 9 components of the swallow with helpful information on anatomy, how to assess, and the clinical relevance \n\n** Treatment: get the details on 45 different swallowing management techniques including exercises, sensory treatments, compensatory strategies, and therapy protocols\n\n** Resources: information on cranial nerves, patient handouts, and anatomical drawings for education\n\n\n“This app is so useful for the SLP in any setting who works with dysphagia patients. It is well-organized and easy to find what you are after. I appreciate the cranial nerve section and have used it in acute care to confirm my assessment and make sure I was not missing something. In the \"Therapy Finder\" the exercises, compensatory strategies, and maneuvers are all research-based and include clear instructions for both the SLP and the patient.”\n- Brenda M. Arend, MA, CCC-SLP\n\n\nApp Authors: Yvette McCoy, MS, CCC-SLP, BCS-S; Tiffani Wallace, MA, CCC-SLP, BCS-S; Rinki Varindani Desai, MS, CCC-SLP\n\nNOTE: This app is intended for use by trained dysphagia clinicians and students only. It is NOT a tool for people with swallowing disorders to self-diagnose or set their own therapy program.

Using this app is the equivalent to spending hours with the world’s most experienced doctors teaching you about your calcium, parathyroid, osteoporosis, and vitamin D issues. Your tests results are analyzed to determine if a problem exists, what risks are associated, and what to do about it. Beautiful graphs make understanding these problems simple!\n\nBlood tests and bone density scans can be difficult to interpret—even many doctors do not diagnose calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid problems correctly or timely. Hyperparathyroidism is a disease that affects 1 in 800 people and 1 in 250 women over 50 and is very often overlooked while patients suffer from chronic fatigue, memory loss, depression, osteoporosis, bone pain and many other symptoms. Calcium Pro is a powerful software program that will analyze your calcium health and provide you guidance about the status of your bones, kidneys, parathyroid glands, vitamin D, and other related health issues.\n\nYou start by entering your test results for calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D. Then we look at your bone density (osteoporosis levels). CalciumPro will analyze and graph your tests making them easy to understand. It will let you know the status of your parathyroid glands and your chance of having hyperparathyroidism. Suggested next steps are given. Tracking tools will show your calcium and vitamin D levels over time, and will show if your bones are losing density (worsening osteoporosis), or gaining bone density. There are important learning tools on every page, and an extensive video and reading library at the end. The app will provide guidance about talking to your physician regarding the possible need for surgery and other important steps.\n\nA Risk Assessment Tool shows your relative risk for conditions associated with high blood calcium: Osteoporosis, Heart Disease, Heart Arrhythmias and Palpitations, High Blood Pressure, Kidney Stones and Kidney Failure, GERD, several Cancers, and others. Watch your risk assessment graphs change as you address your calcium problems. \n\nThis app was developed by doctors at the Norman Parathyroid Center, the world’s leading parathyroid and calcium treatment center using over 4,000,000 data points from over 30,000 patients. Let the world’s leading doctors help you understand these problems so you and your doctor can make important, informed decisions. Take control of your own health!"

      "label": "This is the successor the the popular, award-winning, best selling, doctor recommended pain tracking app, My Pain Diary: Chronic Pain & Symptom Tracker.\n\nThis version, My Pain Diary: GOLD EDITION, strikes a delicate balance between ease-of-use and a broad feature-set. This is a truly USEFUL app, and the newest member of the My Pain Diary family, which has helped over 90,000 chronic pain sufferers better manage their pain, improve communication with their doctors, and gain insights that would be hard attain through other means.\n\nUseful and popular features include automatic weather fetching, iCloud sync, basic medication tracking, photo attachments, graphs and PDF doctor's reports.\n\nThis app is highly customizable. Everyone tracks pain differently, and this is a framework that supports just about any tracking strategy.\n\nCreated by a chronic pain patient to track, manage, and report on chronic pain and symptoms, chronic illness, and mental health.\n\nThat means there is no big company with deep pockets supporting this project. I am just one man with a chronic pain condition, a demanding day job, and a young family to care for. I just happen to be formally trained in design, self-taught in programming, experienced at marketing and customer relations, and am a chronic pain patient myself. That's a very rare combination of traits that is hard to come by, so I'm making the most of it, and holding my own against the big players.\n\nEnough about me, back to the app!\n\nFeatures:\n+   iCloud Sync Support\n+   Universal App\n+   Highly Customizable\n+   Easy to use \n+   Track unlimited conditions\n+   Track multiple/unlimited times per day\n+   Add past entries (change entry timestamp)\n+   Edit past entries\n\nANATOMY OF A PAIN DIARY ENTRY\n\nTRACKERS: Trackers can be thought of as labels or folders that categorize and differentiate your entries. These are the key to tracking more than one condition and comparing conditions to each other.\n\nA common strategy is to name the Trackers after the diseases/conditions that you will be tracking. I.e. Migraines, Anxiety, Fibromyalgia, etc. These are just examples. \n\nMETRICS: Each entry is composed of one or more optional pieces of information called 'Metrics'. For example, two commonly used metrics are 'Pain Intensity' and 'Pain Duration'. Metrics are associated with and shared amongst your Trackers. This means that you can set it up to use different metrics for different Trackers, keeping your entry pages clean and the cognitive load low.\n\n -- MEDICATION TRACKING --\n+   Basic medication tracking.\n\n -- IMPORTANT EVENTS --\n+   Record important events that aren't suited for a Pain Diary entry. i.e. Medical Procedures, Therapy Sessions, A slip and fall, etc.\n\n -- HISTORY --\n+    Color-Coded Calendar - Spot patterns and trends at a glance. Calendar days are colored based on the day's highest recorded Intensity.\n+   Fully searchable.\n+   Day View\n\n -- GRAPHS --\n+   Visualize and compare intensity over time with this interactive graph. Plot and compare up to 3 'Trackables' at once and one optional Weather Metric.\n+   Email, print and share a PDF of the Graph.\n\n -- REPORTS --\n+   Create a PDF Report for your Doctors or for archival purposes. Share the Report via email and other standard methods.\n+   Include Graph\n+   Include Pain Scale Descriptions\n+   Include Color-Coded-Calendar\n+   Include Medication Log\n+   Include Important Events\n\n -- TOOLS --\n+   Automatic Weather Fetching\n+   Pain Scale Editor\n+   Units preference - US/Imperial or XUS/Metric\n\n\nWant to see the app in action?

      "label": "Cognitive Bias Modification allows individuals to improve their unconscious decision making processes. The CBM Helper tool has been designed to give people the opportunity to apply this methodology in an easy to use way.\n\nHow To Use The App\n\nWhen a user presses the PLAY button they are presented with a grid of images, their task is to identify and touch the most positive image as quickly as possible. They are then presented with a new set of images and the process repeats until the timer expires.\n\nThe application will allow the user to alter their natural bias and look for more favourable outcomes.\n\nCognitive Bias Modification (CBM) helps patients to make better choices at an unconscious level by increasing their ability to automatically identify a more positive outcome. By continual practice over time the patient becomes more predisposed to finding the good things in life rather than searching out negativity.\n\nJust as when we buy a new car and subsequently see everyone driving them, a persons brain is wired to look for a particular set of stimuli. For example, people who are highly negative and suffering from stress are often looking for the worst case scenario or 'catastrophizing'; these individuals are constantly watching for, and processing possible instigators of disaster.\n\nCBM works by having the patient consciously look for the positives, to find the silver lining in the clouds, in a controlled manner. Over time this help realign the unconscious processes along more positive and productive lines, and eventually will allow the patient to automatically evaluate situations with greater balance.\n\nCognitive Bias Modification has been found to be an effective exercise for individuals suffering from anxiety based disorders such as Stress, Depression and PTSD."

The concentrations in the suspensions and critical care sections can edited and concentrations stored for future use. The default units for each data item can be set to match you needs.\n\nWhy is Dose Chex required? Errors in the administration of medications are commonplace and can result in significant harm to patients. The 2009 NPSA report ‘Safety in Doses’ identified 72,482 medication incident reports in one year. Of these 100 had resulted in death or severe harm. In addition, such errors can have a significant effect on the person administering the medication\n\nIn acute care settings there can be many distractions, making it difficult to concentrate on the often complex calculations required when administering medicines. Removing as many potential points of human error helps make the process safer."

AlphaTopics includes 3 AAC communication boards loaded with features:\n\n1) Letter Board\n- 26 letters in alphabetical order or 2 variations of frequency order\n- 10 single digits allow you to express any number \n- Vowels highlighted and aligned for faster navigation\n- Natural or automated speech reads out the name of each letter or number\n- Yes, no, question, smiley, space, and backspace buttons for prosody and function\n\n2) Topic Board \n- Fully customizable text you can re-order \n- Voice output with adjustable speech rate\n- Two sizes of grid to display 12 or 24 topics\n- Pre-filled with functional topics for adults\n\n3) Whiteboard\n- Write or draw on the screen\n- 6 colors and 4 widths\n- Export to Photos or e-mail\n\nWhen used together, alphabet and topic boards have been scientifically shown to make the speech of people with motor speech disorders far more understandable. Combined with the whiteboard, these tools help people with aphasia express themselves more clearly with self-cueing and strategy use.\n\nStroke, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, Parkinson’s disease, ALS, and motor neuron disease are all conditions that can impair speech production.\n\nPointing to the first letter in each word not only gives the listener more information about the word, it also encourages the speaker to slow down and separate words, actually making the words clearer! Using alphabet supplementation, studies show intelligibility of sentences improves 25% on average.\n\nPointing to the topic before speaking narrows the range of possibilities for the listener, giving context. Studies show using a topic cue improves word understanding by an average of 28%. Topics can also be used by people with aphasia, a language disorder, to help pinpoint the intended message.\n\nAdditional Features:\n*Adjustable settings for visual, physical, language, and cognitive impairments\n*Works with built-in scanning and guided access\n*4 color schemes\n*Pick which board comes up when you start the app\n*Export any board you've customized to print or share\n\n\"People whose speech is hard to understand often just want to provide extra clues to their listener and don’t require all the features of a comprehensive AAC app.  It’s terrific that we now have an app that provides this level of support on a mobile platform.” - Lois Turner, SLP & AAC specialist\n\nVisit tactustherapy.com for more information on how to use this app, the evidence to support this form of AAC, and a day-by-day account of how this app was made."

A separate device is required.\n\nWhat kind of analysis does iBP provide?\n\niBP uses color icons to indicate when your blood pressure values are normal, high, or hypertension. It also provides interactive graphs that allow you to display your values by weeks, months, year and time of day. The graphs display lows, highs, averages, and trend lines using statistical analysis.\n\nWhy iBP vs. other blood pressure apps?\n\niBP is a universal app designed to work on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, which means you only pay for the app once and you get all versions! iBP is the only blood pressure app with a built in transfer capability to sync all your iOS devices.\n\nWhat are the key features?\n\n* Reads and writes Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data (details below)\n* Easy data input using dials instead of keyboard\n* Transfer capability to sync all of your iOS devices\n* Calculates Mean Arterial Pressure and Pulse Pressure\n* Track one personal item (blood glucose, stress level, medication dosage, exercise time)\n* Backup / Restore capability\n* Multiple users\n* Multiple email addresses (you and doctor)\n* Multiple email formats (PDF, HTML, CSV, Plain Text)\n* Passcode to protect your data\n* Touch Id for passcode on devices that support it\n* Snapshot of the graphs can be saved\n* User configurable color ranges\n* Weight units (lb or kg)\n* Withings Blood Pressure Monitor & Wireless Scale\n\nApple Health\niBP is now able to read and write Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data. If your blood pressure monitor (i.e., Omron, iHealth, Withings) adds data to Apple Health then you can easily import that data into this app. If you manually input your data into this app, then it will write that data to Apple Health.\n\nWithings + iBP = No more data entry!\niBP can retrieve your blood pressure and weight data directly from your Withings account.  The Blood Pressure Monitor and wireless Body Scale automatically record and send the data to your account.  There is no data entry required and you can view the data anywhere using a web browser or a variety of mobile apps.\n\n\nDisclaimer: iBP is intended to be used as a means to collect data to be shared with your doctor.

Many of the topics covered here are practical questions for which the simple and safe solution is not always apparent or accessible from medical texts or obscure hospital policy documents. \n\nIC@N is based on a problem-oriented and practical approach: What should I do now? The information contained in IC@N is deliberately simple, direct, and specific. Some will think it too specific. It assumes a basic level of medical knowledge and clinical experience, plus a degree of common sense. It does not contain detailed or comprehensive treatment guides for specific diagnostic conditions nor definitive long-term treatment, that is available elsewhere from other sources. IC@N is not intended to be exhaustive nor comprehensive text book, rather a guidebook.\n\nThe guidelines in IC@N have been developed, trialled, and revised over several years by the medical and nursing staff at Northern Health and Eastern Health (Melbourne, Australia). \n\nOur motto: soins intensifs sans frontieres (critical care without borders). The skills of critical care can be taken outside of the Intensive Care Ward (or ICU/ITU)  to other areas of acute health care with the intention of preventing and treating serious illness before it becomes irreversible."

      "label": "SleepCheck is more than a sleep or snore recorder, it assesses your risk of sleep apnoea by analysing your breathing and snoring sounds while you sleep. \n\n**Why should I take the test?**\nSleep apnoea (or apnea) is a serious medical condition that can have a major impact on your life. If you have sleep apnoea, air stops flowing to your lungs for ten seconds or longer during sleep. In some cases, this can happen more than 30 times per hour all night. \n\nSleep apnoea affects more than three in every ten men, and nearly two in every ten women. Studies have shown that 80% of people with sleep apnoea are undiagnosed. \n\n**How the SleepCheck app works**\nSleepCheck records your breathing and snoring sounds while you sleep. SleepCheck then uses clinically proven machine-learning algorithms to assess your risk of sleep apnoea. \n\nIn just a few steps, you can find out if there is more to your snore.\n\n1.\tMake sure you are the only person sleeping in the room\n2.\tAnswer a few questions on your age, gender and neck size\n3.\tBefore you sleep, place your phone on your bedside table, press record and go to sleep\n4.\tWhen you wake up, stop the recording \n5.\tSee your results and understand next steps\n\n- Your privacy and data is protected. No account setup required. - \n\nYour sleep recording never leaves your iPhone. Once analysed, it is deleted. \n\nYour age, gender, sleep duration and risk assessment will be collected by ResApp Health and used to improve our products and services. This will not include any data that will identify you. To find out more, please read our privacy policy.\n\nFor use on adults aged 18 years and above.\n\nAlways read and follow the Instructions before Use.

      "label": "The \"Voice Meter Pro\" app for the iPad, iPhone and iPod touch, is a simple, but effective app that helps children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD's), voice disorders, or any other child (or adult) monitor the volume of their own voice in a Fun and Engaging way.\n\nChildren with Asperger’s and other ASD’s often have difficulties producing the appropriate voice volume in different settings.  Some children on the autism spectrum speak too quietly.  Others speak too loudly.  Still others do not compensate adequately for the social milieu or ambient noise level. \n\nUnderstanding abstract concepts, such as the volume of one’s voice, can be difficult for children with ASD's.  It’s well understood that adding a visual component to the otherwise abstract concept can often be very helpful for individuals with ASD.\n\nOK so how does the app work?\n\nWell….if a child is talking to quietly a blue background with a cartoon character struggling to hear is displayed. If a child is talking too loudly the background changes to red and the character puts it’s fingers in its ears. If the volume level is acceptable a green background with a smiling happy character is displayed.\n\n• The on screen “volume thermometer” dynamically displays the volume level as it changes. \n\n• There’s a \"Sensitivity\" slider so the adult can adjust the volume sensitivity to suit both the user and the environment.\n\n• There’s also a \"Dampening\" slider. This helps avoid the meter bouncing around in between words by introducing a slight delay before any movement is shown on the “volume\" thermometer.\n\n• To give the user total control over the app the Upper and Lower limits of the \"Green\" (acceptable volume area) can now be adjusted by the user.\n\n• For convenience the app works in both portrait and landscape modes on all the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad.\n\n•  the iPhone version of the app has a switch to enable the iPhone to vibrate should the upper threshold level be exceeded for longer than 4 seconds.\n\nWe want to make this app the very best it can be and to this end we have included a feedback form inside the app for users to submit any issues or suggestions as to how it can be improved. \n\nWhy not download the app and give it a try?...... you might find it a very useful tool."

      "label": "\"Love This App!\" \"Very Useful!\" \"Perfect!\" \"So Easy to Use!\" \"Great for my patients!\"\nSee why thousands of users around the world are raving about this app!\n\nPeople with memory impairments can become worried when they don't remember where they are or other important information. They may be unsafe when they forget to use a walker or apply the wheelchair breaks before standing. All of these facts and procedures can be engrained into memory using a repetitive and effective memory training procedure.\n\nThis Spaced Retrieval Therapy app uses the scientifically-proven method of spaced retrieval training to help people with dementia or other memory impairments to recall important information. Recalling an answer over multiplying intervals of time, such as 1 minute, 2 minutes, 8 minutes, and so on, helps to cement the information in memory.\n\nSpaced Retrieval Therapy is an enhanced interval timer with independent data tracking and prompts. It automatically increases the time between prompts with correct responses and decreases it with incorrect ones. This app will help clinicians, family members, and students keep track of the intervals and performance as they practice up to 3 memory targets.\n\n*Put away your stopwatch and paper - this app is all you need!\n\n*Keeps track of expanding intervals and data so you don't have to\n\n*Works in the background while doing other therapy exercises or using other apps\n\n*Subtle sound and visual prompts let you know it’s time to ask again\n\n*Tracks accuracy and data automatically, & emails you the finished report\n\n\n\"5 Stars - This app is a fantastic inclusion into my therapy toolbox. It is very useful in therapy and helps me keep track patient progress more efficiently.\" - App Store Review\n\n\nSpeech-Language Pathologists, Occupational Therapists, Neuropsychologists, Teachers, Social Workers, and families can all use this simple technique & app to help clients and loved ones remember important information (names, safety procedures, orientation information, etc).\n\nRecommended by top experts in memory training and dementia therapy, Spaced Retrieval Therapy will make your life easier and your therapy more efficient.\n\n\n\"***** Very Useful!  I found this app to be extremely useful during therapy sessions. When juggling multiple activities it can be difficult to remember to cue a patient for each specific interval. This app makes spaced retrieval an easy way to incorporate prospective and short term memory tasks into treatment.\" - SLP on App Store Review\n\n\nVisit our website at http://tactustherapy.com/app/srt/ to link to several articles about this technique and its proven efficacy with dementia, aphasia, normal learners, and more. \n\n\nThis app is also available as part of the Tactus Complete Therapy Toolkit and Tactus Cognitive Therapy Toolkit discount bundles for iPad users.\n\n\nPlease note: This app is a timer and tracks data.  Targets should be individually selected for the memory-impaired person to be relevant and meaningful.  This app is not intended to be used alone by the memory-impaired person, but as a therapy tool by a clinician or family member trained in this technique."

The video includes an overview of relevant cardiac anatomy, a step by step presentation of all Transducer Positions, and the sequential transducer movements to acquire standard echo images needed to complete a Transthoracic Echocardiographic Study.\n\nThe cardiac anatomy section visualizes relationships of the heart, ribs, axis of the heart, planes of the heart and aorta, chambers, valves and annuli, and blood flow through the heart.\n\nThe transducer position menu allows the user to view the anatomical landmarks and the transducer positions for left parasternal, apical, subcostal, suprasternal and right parasternal image acquisition.\n\nThe views and imaging menu allows the user to navigate from a particular transducer position menu, such as left parasternal long to specific images acquired within that window, such as PLAX high depth, PLAX low depth, and PLAX Zoom of the Aortic and Mitral Valves. Each animated loop shows a finder image in the upper left that depicts the transducer position, an illustration of the sectional anatomy of the heart on the left, and the echo image with labels on the right."

      "label": "Please read this entire description! \n\nNOTE: We are aware of the bug that causes the app to shut down when the device goes to sleep. We are working on this problem and will have a patch applied this week. Thank you for your patience!\n\nCPR Metronome was written by a paramedic for EMS personnel to solve two common problems with CPR resuscitation by EMS providers: compressions which are too slow and ventilating the patient too fast. \n\nTo address these problems, CPR Metronome plays a sound at 110 beats per minute (to coincide with the currently-recommended guidelines for compressions) to give an audible cue to the correct compression rate; it's pretty simple... when the app clicks, compress the chest. To solve the problem of over-bagging the patient, a gong sounds 12 times per minute to indicate when to ventilate. \n\nBoth sounds are combined into a single audio track that loops indefinitely until the app is stopped. The best practice is to open the app when you're enroute to a call, then as you approach the patient, tap \"Start CPR\", clip the phone back on your belt, and go to work just like normal. CPR Metronome will begin a stopwatch from the time you begin so you know exactly how long CPR has been in progress and will play the audible signal to keep time for you to ensure an optimal compression and ventilation rate. In addition to providing a timer for the optimal rate of compressions and ventilations, having the sound playing as you're working the patient provides an audible cue to remind you that the patient has no blood flow when you stop compressions, and reminds you that compressions need to be resumed as quickly as possible. \n\nCPR Metronome cost me a bundle to develop, but I truly believe in high quality CPR, so its priced as low as I can make it to get it in as many providers' hands as possible. The only thing I ask is that you check out my other apps, OmniMedix, EasyECG, and OmniFire, and consider purchasing one or more of them; by doing so, you can help me offset my development costs for CPR Metronome, as well as help me out in sort of a \"crowdfunding campaign\" as I currently try to pay for the very expensive process of applying to and interviewing for medical school, with the goal of some day being a paramedic-turned-EMS Medical Director. \n\nI would also ask you to check out my webpage at http://www.omnimedicsolutions.com and visit us on Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/omnimedicsolutions for more educational tools and teachings. I'm a working street medic just like you guys are, and all of my apps were developed from seeing a need that hadn't been addressed yet by any other apps. I believe that \"we\" know what we need more than someone who isn't actually out there on the street running calls every day. \n\nThis app is not a substitute for formal CPR training, but is intended to supplement proper training, and is only intended for use by professional healthcare providers. After you have tried the app, please be sure to return to the app store and give us a feedback rating and comments. \n\nContent created by:\nCody Blount, BS, NREMT-P, FP-C\n\nSend feedback to:\nomnimedicsolutions@hotmail.com"

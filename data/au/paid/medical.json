The Monash University FODMAP diet works by swapping foods high in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs), with low FODMAP alternatives. Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

However, we are traditionally less exposed to apparently easy problems like pain, nausea or hypokalemia.  Quite often, those issues are brought to the attention of the nursing staff in the evening.  At that time, the treating team is away and you're on call, running all over the hospital.  \n\nMD on Call gives you tips on how to QUICKLY assess and manage (acutely) common problems so you can go on assessing the next patient, or to your room to get some well deserved sleep.  -- it is NOT meant to replace a textbook --\n \n\n\nFEATURES\nMD on call is divided into 5 main sections:\n\n• Issues •  26 frequent on call situations (including management of some specific conditions)\n\nAbdominal Pain*\nAcute Coronary Syndrome*\nAgitation / Violence\nAnaphylaxis\nBleeding\nBradycardia*\nChest Pain\nConstipation\nDeath (Pronouncing)\nDecreased LOC\nDysuria / UTI*\nDyspnea\nFever\nFebrile neutropenia\nHeadache\nHypertension\nHypotension\nInsomnia\nMeningitis\nNausea / Vomiting\nPain\nPalliation\nPneumonia\nSeizure\nTachycardia\nWound Dehiscence\nWound Infection\n\n• Labs •  Common electrolytes abnormalities (including management)\n\nHypo Ca, K, Mg, Na, PO4, glycemia\nHyper Ca, K, Na, glycemia\n\n• ECG •  Normal and abnormal ECG values, now with examples\n\n• Misc •  Suggestions on how to write orders for admission, \"comfort measures only\", \"on call\" notes, OR and procedure notes.  \nTransfusions:  general information and common reactions\nMisc:  CSF values, opioid conversion...\n\n• Lines and Tubes • How to manage common problems, such as a blocked NG tube.\n\n• Search •  Search using acronyms or keywords\n\n\n****************\n\nFeedback is more than welcome :  visit the website for more details\n\n**************** \n\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThis publication (application) is to be used as a guide only.

Inside this colorful app, you will find easy to follow suggestions on how to improve your health through nutrition and the food choices you make every day. This app provides comprehensive and actionable nutrition guidelines for how to reduce your risk, prevent and combat Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, its symptoms and complications.\r\n\r\nRecent research shows that there are a number of nutrients and natural food items that play a significant role in dealing with NAFLD. If you rather tackle health issues and risks through proper nutrition and lifestyle changes then this app is for you!\r\n\r\nA number of powerful, unique and interactive features make this app so different and superior to others in the market:\r\n\r\n• Separate dietary guidance for NAFLD AND its combination with the following most likely health issues: diabetes type 2, excess weight or obesity, high cholesterol, high triglycerides, metabolic syndrome, PCOS, prediabetes and stress. \r\n\r\n• Is this food good for me? This feature answers the common question if a food of your choice is helpful or harmful to your personal situation. And it does so in an easy to understand and colorful graphic form.\r\n\r\n• Top-5 recommendations on what to eat/do, and what not to.\r\n\r\n• Food Suggestions. The best food choices within a food group, based on your personal profile. An extremely valuable tool when at restaurants or when grocery shopping. Over 850 natural food items and growing number of recipes are included. \r\n\r\n• Suggestions on appropriate life style choices, alternative therapies and herbal remedies, when such options are promising and available to you.\r\n\r\n• ACTIONABLE information on what is good, what is bad, and what is neutral for your condition(s). We don't just point you to a food group. We single out specific food items, and give you an ordered list of helpful and harmful foods within each food group. \r\n\r\nThe primary sources used by this app are US government agencies such as USDA, NIH (National Institute of Health), PubMed, and leading clinics & universities.\r\n\r\nPersonal Remedies is the producer of the world's first e-dietitian and publisher of the largest collection of health and nutrition apps for chronic conditions. Based in metro-Boston, home to the highest ranking healthcare providers and academic institutions in the world.\r\n\r\nThis app is updated by our team on an ongoing basis. Updates happen seamlessly, and do NOT require frequent inconvenient downloads.\r\n\r\n“This technology was developed using the most current clinical evidence-based information that is available in the US. Behind this technology there is a team of expert clinicians, scientists, endocrinologists, oncologists, and other specialists who are passionate about bridging the gap between expert knowledge and the patient.“ \r\nKatya Tsaioun, PhD, Nutrition, Tufts University; L.D.N.\r\n\r\n“Proper nutrition and other alternative treatments show great promise in preventing and treating many of the illnesses that we deal with every day. I encourage all my patients to follow appropriate nutrition and research other options for themselves. The Choose This Not That series are an excellent step towards improving people’s knowledge in this area.”\r\nShahin Tabatabaei, MD\r\nMass General Hospital; Harvard Medical School\r\n\r\n“The Choose This Not That series of apps provide dietary recommendations focused on common chronic health problems. They are easy to understand and thus easy to implement into daily life. Most doctors would find it difficult to discuss dietary recommendations at the level of detail found in the series. They should serve as a valuable complement in helping people manage chronic illnesses through dietary and lifestyle modifications.”\r\nAndrew S. Lenhardt, MD \r\nLahey Clinic, Beverly, MA"

      "label": "Blood calcium, vitamin D, and osteoporosis are important health issues. The consequences of abnormal levels are often life-changing and occasionally life-threatening. Using this app is the equivalent to spending hours with the world’s most experienced doctors teaching you about your calcium, parathyroid, osteoporosis, and vitamin D issues. Your tests results are analyzed to determine if a problem exists, what risks are associated, and what to do about it. Beautiful graphs make understanding these problems simple!\n\nBlood tests and bone density scans can be difficult to interpret—even many doctors do not diagnose calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid problems correctly or timely. Hyperparathyroidism is a disease that affects 1 in 800 people and 1 in 250 women over 50 and is very often overlooked while patients suffer from chronic fatigue, memory loss, depression, osteoporosis, bone pain and many other symptoms. Calcium Pro is a powerful software program that will analyze your calcium health and provide you guidance about the status of your bones, kidneys, parathyroid glands, vitamin D, and other related health issues.\n\nYou start by entering your test results for calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D. Then we look at your bone density (osteoporosis levels). CalciumPro will analyze and graph your tests making them easy to understand. It will let you know the status of your parathyroid glands and your chance of having hyperparathyroidism. Suggested next steps are given. Tracking tools will show your calcium and vitamin D levels over time, and will show if your bones are losing density (worsening osteoporosis), or gaining bone density. There are important learning tools on every page, and an extensive video and reading library at the end. The app will provide guidance about talking to your physician regarding the possible need for surgery and other important steps.\n\nA Risk Assessment Tool shows your relative risk for conditions associated with high blood calcium: Osteoporosis, Heart Disease, Heart Arrhythmias and Palpitations, High Blood Pressure, Kidney Stones and Kidney Failure, GERD, several Cancers, and others. Watch your risk assessment graphs change as you address your calcium problems. \n\nThis app was developed by doctors at the Norman Parathyroid Center, the world’s leading parathyroid and calcium treatment center using over 4,000,000 data points from over 30,000 patients. Let the world’s leading doctors help you understand these problems so you and your doctor can make important, informed decisions. Take control of your own health!"

This is the premise behind Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) which has become the most effective psychological treatment available for a range of emotional and behavioural problems including depression and anxiety. \n\nA thought diary is designed to help people record and change the thoughts that cause emotional and psychological distress. The Thought Diary Pro is the advanced version of the Thought Diary, and allows the  identification of thinking errors (also known as 'cognitive distortions'), and the the modification of our unhelpful thoughts into more productive ways of thinking. By challenging the thoughts and beliefs that cause discontentment, dissatisfaction and other emotional and behavioural distress, we can improve our mental health and can change the destructive or adverse behaviours we may engage in as a result of our negative thoughts. \n\nThought Diary Pro is designed to be the second step in changing our thinking patterns by helping individuals identify the thinking errors that they engage in, and thereby helping change these thoughts. The effect of modifying these thought can reduce the negative emotional and behavioural consequences of experiencing these negative thoughts. Similar to the Thought Diary, the Pro version was designed by an experienced clinical psychologist and CBT therapist who believed that these tools should be available in the most accessible form for individuals to use in today’s fast technological world. It can be used by people either in therapy as a useful adjunct to the treatment, and there is a feature that allows the Thought Diary to be emailed straight to their therapist. However, it can also be used by those individuals who are embarking on a self-guided course of CBT."

      "label": "Bilateral Stimulation Therapy (BLST) is a neuropsychological treatment adapted from a treatment called EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). EMDR is a gold standard treatment according to the World Health Organisation for the psychological treatment of trauma. Bilateral Stimulation is a key therapeutic tool used in EMDR. \n\nBilateral Stimulation simply means stimulation of both sides of the brain using eye movements, sound or tactile stimulation. Typically, it may involve moving your eyes from left to right whilst following a target or paying attention to sound in your left ear then to your right. Bilateral stimulation is referred to as a ‘bottom – up’ approach as it works on the emotion engine of the brain, the limbic system. This approach reduces emotional distress which allows the cortical areas of the brain (thinking, reasoning, planning) to become more active and effective. The effect of this approach is often experienced more quickly and easily.\n\nBecause this therapy uses one element of EMDR, it is called BLST so as to not confuse or give the user a wrong impression about the complete standard EMDR therapy. BLST uses one part of EMDR, and therefore 2can be practiced at home, work or any quiet environment where you can spend five minutes or so undisturbed much like meditation. For more information about BLST and EMDR please visit www.mromeopsych.com/blst\n\nThis minimal app uses bilateral click which, when activated, sounds alternately in each ear. The speed, tone and length of the practice can be set by the user. The App has two options: 1. BLST mode (bilateral stimulation with sound) and 2. FLASH (an adaption of Dr Phillip Manfield’s FLASH technique. Please visit https://www.flashtechnique.com for more information).\n\nThis app is a clinical tool for psychologists, psychiatrists, EMDR therapists and their patients. While information is provided at www.mromeopsych.com/blst, you should consult your EMDR therapist before using it. Please note: Persons suffering with complex PTSD Dissociative Identity Disorder, Borderline Personality, Schizophrenia or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without consultation with your therapist.\n\nAs we are frequently updating this app to improve it’s functionality and increase its features, we ask that any comments or suggestions that you have, please contact us at admin@mromeopsych.com. Thank you."

Inside this colorful app, you will find easy to follow suggestions on how to improve your health through nutrition and the food choices you make every day. This app provides comprehensive and actionable nutrition guidelines for how to reduce your risk, prevent and combat Breast Cancer. If you rather tackle health issues and risks through proper nutrition and lifestyle changes then this app is for you! \n\nA number of powerful, unique and interactive features make this app so different and superior to others in the market:\n\n• Is this food good for me? This feature answers the common question about suitability of various food items for your personal situation. And it does so in an easy to understand and colorful graphic form.\n\n• Health issues often come our way in groups of two or more. They are often caused by other health complications or result in other illnesses and risks. It is for that reason, that we have included separate guidelines for those who might be at risk with any of the following common conditions along with breast cancer: depression, gout, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, stress and Vitamin D deficiency. Also included are separate guidelines for detoxification, anti-inflammation, alkaline and Mediterranean diets.\n\n• Top-5 recommendations on what to eat/do, and what not to.\n\n• Food Suggestions. The best food choices within a food group, based on your personal profile. An extremely valuable tool when at restaurants or when grocery shopping. Also included are suggestions on appropriate life style choices, alternative therapies and herbal remedies, when such options are promising and available to you.\n\n• ACTIONABLE information on what is good, what is bad, and what is neutral for your condition(s). We single out specific food items, and give you an ordered list of helpful and harmful foods within each food group. \n\nSuggestions presented in this app are based on the content licensed from Personal Remedies, LLC. The primary sources used by Personal Remedies are US government sources such as USDA (US Department of Agriculture), NIH (National Institute of Health) agencies, and leading clinics & universities.\n\nPersonal Remedies is the publisher of the largest collection of health and nutrition apps for chronic conditions in the market. It is based in metro-Boston, home to the highest ranking healthcare providers and academic institutions in the world.\n\nThis app is updated by our team on an ongoing basis. Updates happen seamlessly, and do NOT require frequent inconvenient downloads.\n\n“This technology was developed using the most current clinical evidence-based information that is available in the US. Behind this technology there is a team of expert clinicians, scientists, endocrinologists, oncologists, and other specialists who are passionate about bridging the gap between expert knowledge and the patient.“ \nKatya Tsaioun, PhD, Nutrition, Tufts University; L.D.N.\n\n “Proper nutrition and other alternative treatments show great promise in preventing and treating many of the illnesses that we deal with every day. I encourage all my patients to follow appropriate nutrition and research other options for themselves. The Choose This Not That series are an excellent step towards improving people’s knowledge in this area.”\nShahin Tabatabaei, MD\nMass General Hospital; Harvard Medical School\n\n“The Choose This Not That series of apps provide dietary recommendations focused on common chronic health problems. They are easy to understand and thus easy to implement into daily life. Most doctors would find it difficult to discuss dietary recommendations at the level of detail found in the series. They should serve as a valuable complement in helping people manage chronic illnesses through dietary and lifestyle modifications.”\nAndrew S. Lenhardt, MD \nLahey Clinic, Beverly, MA"

Covering over 80 muscles with more than 150 trigger points.\n\nMyofascial trigger points are one of the most common sources of pain, and are often overlooked by health professionals. \n\nThis app strives to help you find the source of pain via intuitive interface: tap the body where your pain is and see which trigger points refer pain to that area. Over 50 distinct pain areas are covered.\n\nYou can also find trigger points by by tapping a muscle on the muscle model, by choosing a muscle from the alphabetized list, or by using the search bar. If you don't know exactly what you're looking for, you can search using keywords such as \"elbow\", which will show the muscles of the elbow as well as any pain areas or conditions related to the elbow (e.g. \"lateral elbow pain\", \"tennis elbow\").\n\nTrigger points can cause or mimic a variety of conditions such as \"Tendinitis\" and \"Tennis Elbow\". More than 40 conditions are covered. Choose a condition and see a list of muscles whose trigger points can cause or mimic that condition.\n\nIn each trigger point illustration, an \"x\" marks the location of the point, while the area of referred pain is colored in blue.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: this app does not include treatment information; its aim is to help find the source of specific pain. Once you've identified a trigger point please consult a massage therapist or otherwise trained professional. There are also myriad self-treatment resources available both in book and video format should you choose to treat yourself.\n\n4520c652df"

Based on extensive literature review, Ortho Traumapedia compiles the current standard of care in a high-yield, easy to use format including dozens of original images to help visualize fracture patterns and radiologic findings. \n\nOriginally developed by orthopedic surgeons for orthopedic surgeons, practitioners of all levels and specialties who encounter adult skeletal trauma will find Ortho Traumapedia useful as a condensed reference and educational tool. Whether you’re a primary care or emergency physician, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, resident or medical student, Ortho Traumapedia provides highly pertinent information regarding skeletal trauma right at your fingertips. \n\nOrtho Traumapedia is organized into chapters by bone (for fractures) and joint (for dislocations). Each chapter is divided into four sections: Facts, Imaging, Classification and Treatment: \n\nFacts begins with epidemiology and common injury mechanisms. This is followed by an outline of pertinent anatomy, eponyms and variants. Finally, patient presentation, examination and management tips are presented. \n\nImaging begins with the standard radiographic examinations for each anatomic region. This is followed by injury-specific views, relevant metrics and findings as well as supplemental modalities. \n\nClassification outlines the most common classification systems used to describe the selected injury. \n\nTreatment begins with general treatment principles and reviews treatment in the acute setting. This is followed by standard of care options grouped by injury pattern. Common complications associated with the injury are included at the end of this section. \n\nSimply select the bone or joint you’re interested in from the main menu and navigate between the four sections with the buttons on the bottom of the screen. Return to the main menu by pressing the left arrow in the title bar. There's never been a simpler, more mobile skeletal trauma reference!"

A person with HCU cannot breakdown the methionine in food, which causes methionine, and in turn homocystine, to build up in the blood. High levels of homocystine and methionine build up in the body and lead to progressive disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), ocular, skeletal, and cardiovascular system.  Symptoms include mental retardation, dislocation of the lens of the eye resulting in blindness if untreated, seizures, osteoporosis, heart attack and stroke.  As a whole, the complications of the disease lead to a reduced quality of life and significantly shorter life expectancy.\n\nAccuGo for HCU is sponsored by HCU Network Australia.\n\nFeatures:\n - track Methionine or Protein by changing mode in Options\n - online synchronization of food records between multiple devices\n - track up to four different individuals\n - continues to work offline, anywhere regardless of wifi or cellular availability\n - overview of day's running total of protein or methionine and calories at a glance\n - groups foods eaten together by selectable time periods (15mins, 1 hour, etc)\n - copy/move/delete entries with ease\n - built in calendar for easy navigation\n - jump to the past to see historical entries\n - Historical graph shows totals over the past month\n - jump to the future to plan menus in advance\n - supports inline math calculations (eg. 1/3 + 1/8)\n - round values up or down with a simple swipe\n - automatic real-time calculation of quantity/methionine/Protein/calories as you type\n - includes pre-loaded & searchable hand-picked USDA-based food items\n - add your own foods and values to the database\n - Community Food List provides shared items you can add to your personal food list, or share yours with the community\n - email daily food records by date range, includes summary of average over the range"

      "label": "In a review by Gordon Christensen Clinicians Report, here is what doctors say about our app:\n\"Great review for CT anatomy\", \"Outstanding resource to accelerate interpretation\", \"Easy to use\",\"Great graphics!\", and \"Price!\"\n\n\nCone Beam CT has revolutionized diagnosis and treatment planning. Clinicians can use a Cone Beam CT volume to view patient’s head in 3 dimensions using multi-planar reformatted views (MPR), known as: axial, coronal, and sagittal. The volumetric data set has no magnification and no superimposition. \n\nCBCT has become “the standard of care” for implant placement. CBCT is used for detection of vertical root fractures and periapical pathology, 3D cephalometric analysis, oral surgery planning, and pathology diagnosis.\n\nCBCT app allows clinicians, residents, and dental students to learn anatomical landmarks as if they were looking at a CBCT data set through the CBCT viewing software but with all the landmarks visible and animated through all MPR views.\n\nThe level of interactivity and visualization is unprecedented. This amazing app covers hundreds of anatomical landmarks visible on CBCT data sets from small to medium to large field of views (FOVs). It also allows you to test your knowledge through the quiz mode, which is very cool. You can also search for a landmark or pick it up from an alphabetical list and the app fly you there. \n\nCBCT is the coolest app to learn anatomy on Cone Beam CT, designed and tested by oral and maxillofacial radiologists to ensure highest quality learning and user experience.\n\nFeatures:\n- 3 high quality data sets from CBCT Carestream Dental and Sirona, in small, medium, and large field of views (FOV).\n- Axial, coronal and sagittal view planes.\n- Two finger scrolling to navigate through the data sets.\n- Two finger pinch in and out for zooming.\n- Quiz mode. Tap ‘?’ to reveal the answer.\n- Search mode: pick from a list or start typing in the search field.\n- Thumbnail references to aid you in orientation while navigating.\n- iPhone optimized layout, iPad-optimized layout both in portrait and landscape."

      "label": "This is the successor the the popular, award-winning, best selling, doctor recommended pain tracking app, My Pain Diary: Chronic Pain & Symptom Tracker.\n\nThis version, My Pain Diary: GOLD EDITION, strikes a delicate balance between ease-of-use and a broad feature-set. This is a truly USEFUL app, and the newest member of the My Pain Diary family, which has helped over 90,000 chronic pain sufferers better manage their pain, improve communication with their doctors, and gain insights that would be hard attain through other means.\n\nUseful and popular features include automatic weather fetching, iCloud sync, basic medication tracking, photo attachments, graphs and PDF doctor's reports.\n\nThis app is highly customizable. Everyone tracks pain differently, and this is a framework that supports just about any tracking strategy.\n\nCreated by a chronic pain patient to track, manage, and report on chronic pain and symptoms, chronic illness, and mental health.\n\nThat means there is no big company with deep pockets supporting this project. I am just one man with a chronic pain condition, a demanding day job, and a young family to care for. I just happen to be formally trained in design, self-taught in programming, experienced at marketing and customer relations, and am a chronic pain patient myself. That's a very rare combination of traits that is hard to come by, so I'm making the most of it, and holding my own against the big players.\n\nEnough about me, back to the app!\n\nFeatures:\n+   iCloud Sync Support\n+   Universal App\n+   Highly Customizable\n+   Easy to use \n+   Track unlimited conditions\n+   Track multiple/unlimited times per day\n+   Add past entries (change entry timestamp)\n+   Edit past entries\n\nANATOMY OF A PAIN DIARY ENTRY\n\nTRACKERS: Trackers can be thought of as labels or folders that categorize and differentiate your entries. These are the key to tracking more than one condition and comparing conditions to each other.\n\nA common strategy is to name the Trackers after the diseases/conditions that you will be tracking. I.e. Migraines, Anxiety, Fibromyalgia, etc. These are just examples. \n\nMETRICS: Each entry is composed of one or more optional pieces of information called 'Metrics'. For example, two commonly used metrics are 'Pain Intensity' and 'Pain Duration'. Metrics are associated with and shared amongst your Trackers. This means that you can set it up to use different metrics for different Trackers, keeping your entry pages clean and the cognitive load low.\n\n -- MEDICATION TRACKING --\n+   Basic medication tracking.\n\n -- IMPORTANT EVENTS --\n+   Record important events that aren't suited for a Pain Diary entry. i.e. Medical Procedures, Therapy Sessions, A slip and fall, etc.\n\n -- HISTORY --\n+    Color-Coded Calendar - Spot patterns and trends at a glance. Calendar days are colored based on the day's highest recorded Intensity.\n+   Fully searchable.\n+   Day View\n\n -- GRAPHS --\n+   Visualize and compare intensity over time with this interactive graph. Plot and compare up to 3 'Trackables' at once and one optional Weather Metric.\n+   Email, print and share a PDF of the Graph.\n\n -- REPORTS --\n+   Create a PDF Report for your Doctors or for archival purposes. Share the Report via email and other standard methods.\n+   Include Graph\n+   Include Pain Scale Descriptions\n+   Include Color-Coded-Calendar\n+   Include Medication Log\n+   Include Important Events\n\n -- TOOLS --\n+   Automatic Weather Fetching\n+   Pain Scale Editor\n+   Units preference - US/Imperial or XUS/Metric\n\n\nWant to see the app in action?

      "label": "SleepCheck is more than a sleep or snore recorder, it assesses your risk of sleep apnoea by analysing your breathing and snoring sounds while you sleep. \n\n**Why should I take the test?**\nSleep apnoea (or apnea) is a serious medical condition that can have a major impact on your life. If you have sleep apnoea, air stops flowing to your lungs for ten seconds or longer during sleep. In some cases, this can happen more than 30 times per hour all night. \n\nSleep apnoea affects more than three in every ten men, and nearly two in every ten women. Studies have shown that 80% of people with sleep apnoea are undiagnosed. \n\n**How the SleepCheck app works**\nSleepCheck records your breathing and snoring sounds while you sleep. SleepCheck then uses clinically proven machine-learning algorithms to assess your risk of sleep apnoea. \n\nIn just a few steps, you can find out if there is more to your snore.\n\n1.\tMake sure you are the only person sleeping in the room\n2.\tAnswer a few questions on your age, gender and neck size\n3.\tBefore you sleep, place your phone on your bedside table, press record and go to sleep\n4.\tWhen you wake up, stop the recording \n5.\tSee your results and understand next steps\n\n- Your privacy and data is protected. No account setup required. - \n\nYour sleep recording never leaves your iPhone. Once analysed, it is deleted. \n\nYour age, gender, sleep duration and risk assessment will be collected by ResApp Health and used to improve our products and services. This will not include any data that will identify you. To find out more, please read our privacy policy.\n\nFor use on adults aged 18 years and above.\n\nAlways read and follow the Instructions before Use.

      "label": "INTRODUCTION\neOpioid™ is a sophisticated application with a suite of different functions that can perform complicated opioid pain medication dose calculations.  It can assist healthcare professionals determine proper doses of different opioid pain medicines for patients who may already be using opioids or are opioid tolerant.\n\n(Opioids are sometimes also referred to as opiates or narcotics.)\n\nPOWER\nOther conventional opioid dose calculators may use the traditional method of simply converting the number of milligrams of one opioid to the number of milligrams of another opioid using a single conversion factor.\n\neOpioid™, however, is able to produce more complicated calculations for opioids such as methadone or levorphanol, in which the equianalgesic dose is actually not a single value, but a relatively large range of possible values.\n\nVERSATILITY\neOpioid™ not only calculates the number of milligrams for the new, replacement opioid of interest, but searches its database for the replacement opioid's available different sizes of tablets or patches and available dosing time intervals.  It can then display the new opioid dose in terms of a potentially more useful output, such as “morphine ER 30 mg tablet, 1 orally q 8 hours”, rather than just stating “morphine 90 mg”.\n\nAn almost unlimited number of separate opioids that a patient may be using can be entered for consideration.  If a patient is simultaneously using many different opioids such as morphine, oxycodone, hydromorphone, etc, these can all be entered.\n\nEXTENSIVE\neOpioid™ has additional functionality to assist clinicians choose appropriate settings for Patient-Controlled Analgesia devices for IV opioids, such as for morphine, hydromorphone, and fentanyl for patients who may be opioid-tolerant.\n\neOpioid™ has an extensive database of both long-acting and short-acting opioids.  It can assist you in determining the doses for a regimen consisting of a long-acting opioid to be given around-the-clock with a short-acting opioid to be given on an as-needed basis (i.e. “PRN”).\n\nFORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION\nEven with the multitude of different features offered with eOpioid™, its interface is refreshingly clean and logical.  It was designed to be intuitive and is a true example of form following function.\n\n\n\nPlease note that this software is not capable of performing medical consultations.  eOpioid™ is an informational tool only and should only be used by specialized healthcare professionals.  You are required to read the extensive help documentation within eOpioid™ to ensure a thorough understanding of the Software's capabilities and limitations.\n\n© SentientWare, LLC, 2009.

      "label": "Congratulations on your pregnancy! With this app we would like to give you a helpful tool, which will make food safety and good nutrition as simple as possible for you for the next nine months. What types of fish contain the least amount of mercury? Which types of cheese should you first strike off of your shopping list? And attending your next business lunch; what can you eat without worrying whether you’ll get toxoplasmosis? This app features a traffic light food labelling system of almost 1000 foodstuffs – they are categorized according to the level of danger to the unborn baby. Due to the background information and advice, you will feel more secure in the complex evaluation of the safety of unknown foods.\n\nHow the app works:\nAt first there is a theoretic part, which informs you in a nutshell about the most common foodborne diseases (toxoplasmosis, listeriosis, and salmonella.)\nThe core of the app is the food search. Here you can initially choose between an alphabetic or a filtered search. At first glance you can see whether a foodstuff is classified as green, orange or red.\nGreen-labelled food means that pregnant women can generally consume it safely - even if it is not necessarily healthy. Of course calories and nutritional value are another matter. On the same note, the permitted foods are always allowed in moderation. This applies especially to spices, herbs, and nuts. If you have a varied and balanced diet, you don't have to worry anymore. Orange let's you know that the safe consumption of the foodstuff depends on several factors (time of pregnancy, personal situation, the art of preparation, quantity, ...) But do not worry at first about the quantity of the orange entries, but do note the advice. Just click on the corresponding food label. You should absolutely avoid all red-labelled foodstuffs. They affect the development of your baby and damage it in the long-term.\n\nUsing the filtered search, however, you can adapt the list of the various risks and food categories to your individual situation. You can easily browse all accessible foods. Or you can filter through food categories and find out which cheese from your favourite camemberts you can replace during the pregnancy.\n\nBy clicking the star you can finally add the desired food to your personal shopping list.\nBy the way, with the help of our hints and advice you will also get guidelines for specific food categories and several more ideas for everyday use. That way you can ensure even greater food safety without getting hysterical.\n\nWe wish you a relaxed pregnancy. All the best!\n\nKirstin & Roman"

      "label": "\"Love This App!\" \"Very Useful!\" \"Perfect!\" \"So Easy to Use!\" \"Great for my patients!\"\nSee why thousands of users around the world are raving about this app!\n\nPeople with memory impairments can become worried when they don't remember where they are or other important information. They may be unsafe when they forget to use a walker or apply the wheelchair breaks before standing. All of these facts and procedures can be engrained into memory using a repetitive and effective memory training procedure.\n\nThis Spaced Retrieval Therapy app uses the scientifically-proven method of spaced retrieval training to help people with dementia or other memory impairments to recall important information. Recalling an answer over multiplying intervals of time, such as 1 minute, 2 minutes, 8 minutes, and so on, helps to cement the information in memory.\n\nSpaced Retrieval Therapy is an enhanced interval timer with independent data tracking and prompts. It automatically increases the time between prompts with correct responses and decreases it with incorrect ones. This app will help clinicians, family members, and students keep track of the intervals and performance as they practice up to 3 memory targets.\n\n*Put away your stopwatch and paper - this app is all you need!\n\n*Keeps track of expanding intervals and data so you don't have to\n\n*Works in the background while doing other therapy exercises or using other apps\n\n*Subtle sound and visual prompts let you know it’s time to ask again\n\n*Tracks accuracy and data automatically, & emails you the finished report\n\n\n\"5 Stars - This app is a fantastic inclusion into my therapy toolbox. It is very useful in therapy and helps me keep track patient progress more efficiently.\" - App Store Review\n\n\nSpeech-Language Pathologists, Occupational Therapists, Neuropsychologists, Teachers, Social Workers, and families can all use this simple technique & app to help clients and loved ones remember important information (names, safety procedures, orientation information, etc).\n\nRecommended by top experts in memory training and dementia therapy, Spaced Retrieval Therapy will make your life easier and your therapy more efficient.\n\n\n\"***** Very Useful!  I found this app to be extremely useful during therapy sessions. When juggling multiple activities it can be difficult to remember to cue a patient for each specific interval. This app makes spaced retrieval an easy way to incorporate prospective and short term memory tasks into treatment.\" - SLP on App Store Review\n\n\nVisit our website at http://tactustherapy.com/app/srt/ to link to several articles about this technique and its proven efficacy with dementia, aphasia, normal learners, and more. \n\n\nThis app is also available as part of the Tactus Complete Therapy Toolkit and Tactus Cognitive Therapy Toolkit discount bundles for iPad users.\n\n\nPlease note: This app is a timer and tracks data.  Targets should be individually selected for the memory-impaired person to be relevant and meaningful.  This app is not intended to be used alone by the memory-impaired person, but as a therapy tool by a clinician or family member trained in this technique."

      "label": "WHY DID WE MAKE THIS?\nYou hurt. Your pain is chronic and complicated. You can’t remember everything. You want your doctors to understand, but you don’t know how to explain what you feel.\n\nPAIN IS LIFE-CHANGING. HELP IS HERE.\nNanolume® developed the Pain Tracker & Diary to help you record the daily textures, intensities, and locations of what you feel, so you and your care team can better understand what you are suffering with and follow how your pain responds to medications and treatments.\n\nTRACK IT BETTER. TREAT IT BETTER.\nPain is a complex experience. It often includes multiple pain types (layers), each with its own unique texture, intensity, location, and surface area.\n\nBy keeping a diary that integrates complex information, you can show your doctors what you are experiencing to help them make a better diagnosis, choose more appropriate medications and treatments, and monitor if your treatments are beneficial. In addition, by keeping such an integrated record, trends might emerge that would otherwise go unnoticed.  \n\nPAIN IS DIFFERENT.\nPain is a subjective (not objective) sensation that you cannot measure. Its assessment relies on each person’s ability to communicate what they feel. Nanolume® developed this digital diary to help you record what you feel every day. \n\nINCLUDED FEATURES.\nFor each diary entry you create:\n• Choose a Pain Type. Choose from a list of predefined pain types or create a customized pain type. Next, tap the icon of the pain type you feel is most intense (you can come back and add more types later).\n• Select the Intensity. Select the intensity of your pain type using a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS).\n• Draw an Outline. Use your finger to draw an “outline” of the type of pain you are experiencing on the front and back sides of a generalized map of your body.\n• Calculated Surface Areas. The app displays the percent [%] of your body surface affected by each (or all) of the pain types you draw.\n• Zoom. Need to see a larger image of your hand or foot? Double-tap: \"once\" to zoom x2; \"twice\" to zoom x4; \"a third time\" to restore the image to its original size.  We also offer pinch-to-zoom.\n• Notes. Tap the “Notepad” icon located in the top-left corner of each opened diary entry to record any details of your medications or treatment results.\n• Tap \"Add Pain.\" Choose another pain type (layer) to draw.\n• Save Your Diary Entry. Tap \"Done\" to create a snapshot of all the pain type layers you drew. The app attaches the date and time your entry was saved.\n• Open a Saved Entry. Tap on the date and time of the entry you want to review. Look at the intensity, location, and surface area of each distinct pain type you experienced (by touching the icon of the pain type you want to see) or see all the pain types at once and see how they overlap (tap the \"All Layers\" icon). Swipe the picture left or right to check how your other saved pain entries compare over time.\n• Charts. View a summary of your data in \"Charts.\"\n• Forget to Save an Entry? Go back and recreate a \"pain picture\" from the past; then, use the \"Calendar\" icon to backdate the recreated entry.\n• Calendar Backdating. Touch the \"Calendar\" icon to backdate any pain-picture you draw to create a record of what you remember from the past.\n• Copy/Edit. Copy or edit a copy of a previous entry.\n• CSV Export. Email or save a numeric file of your data, then open that data in a spreadsheet.\n• Interactive Summary & Animation. Play an animation of your data to see how each or all of your pain types change within any period you choose by selecting the corresponding start/stop dates.\n• PDF Export. Export your charts, drawings, and notes as a PDF file.\n\nPRIVACY IS IMPORTANT.\nYour data is stored on your device only and is not collected or stored by Nanolume® LLC.

The icons are from individual apps by the developer, each covering a single nutrient corresponding to the nutrients in this app.\n\nThis app utilizes information taken from the entire USDA National Nutrient Database for each of these two nutrients, unlike the individual apps, which cover approximately 10% of what's available.\n\nYou will find the Search functionality extremely fast as all needed infromation from the USDA database is local to the app — no internet connectivity is required.\n\nFrom the Search functionality you can save information for the foods you eat each day. You are able to pick a serving size and then either record a multiple of 0.1 – 9.9 servings; or optionally create a custom serving size from 1 to 500 grams. As you change the serving size you can graphically see the the effect on the various nutrients via color coding ranging from white to black (think burnt), and gray indicates data is not available:\n\n- Black — Extremely High\n- Dark Red — Very High\n- Red — High\n- Orange — Moderately High\n- Yellow — Moderate\n- Light Green — Moderately Low\n- Green — Low\n- Light Blue — Very Low\n- White — Extremely Low\n\n- Gray — Unknown\n\nThe My Data section allows you to access up to a full year's worth of Food Serving Intake Items stored in your Personal iNutrients Database. For each day there is an Action button which allows you to copy all Food Servings to today's list.\n\nFrom the My Data section, select any Intake Item to get the complete information available. From this display you can tap the Action button in the upper right corner to:\n\n- Delete — Delete the current Food Serving.  \n\n- Change Number of Servings — Change the number of Servings for the current Food Intake Item.\n\n- Change the Intake Date — Move the current Food Serving to another day. — This is extremely useful if you haven't been able to enter what you've eaten on the day it occurred; just simply enter it and then use this function to change to the date needed.\n\n- Copy Intake Item to Today — Copy the current Food Serving to today. \n\nThe Customize section provides a means for you to create your own Custom Color Scale for each nutrient if desired.\n\nThe rotating images occasionally seen on the right, on the iPad only, are representative of the 25 different Food Groups designated by the USDA.

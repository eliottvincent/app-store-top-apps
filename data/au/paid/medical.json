      "label": "Researchers at Monash University have developed the low FODMAP diet and a corresponding app to assist in the management of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The Monash University FODMAP diet works by swapping foods high in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs), with low FODMAP alternatives. Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

Very cool.\" Craig Laws, Beta Tester and his Border Collie, Storm. \n\n\nHELPING DOG HEART MURMURS / CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE (CHF)\nOver 60% of all dogs who are 5 years old or more have a dog heart murmur. Snoopy helps track and monitor your dog's health by regularly recording their heart rate and rhythm. Ideal for those at risk of dog heart murmur.\n\n- Irregular heartbeat or racing pulse\n- Hacking, persistent cough\n- Excessive panting even when resting\n- Lack of energy or appetite\n- Collapsing or fainting\n- Gums and/or tongue are bluish in color\n- Severe water retention\n\nSnoopy allows you to:\n- Listen to, record and share your dog's heartbeat\n- Log data about your dog over time\n- Share data and recordings with your vet for them to check your dog remotely\n\nDeveloped with pet owners like you in mind: A trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record the dog heart beat regularly to share with your vet online - thus saving on expensive trips.\n\nThe quality of the recordings are unrivalled. Snoopy has been extensively tested on various dog breeds of all shapes and sizes from border collies to black labradors and spaniels, including those with congestive heart failure and using cardalis app.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Mike and his dog, Freddie.\n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work on all dog breeds?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the dog's heartbeat sounds and, using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear. It takes time, technique and patience.\n\nThe app will work on all breeds including puppy heart rates! Ideal for owners concerned about their dog's heart health or dogs with CHF (congestive heart failure) or using cardalis.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Snoopy. If you are struggling DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use your phone's internal microphone to attempt to listen to and record your dog's heart rate. We recommend the use of Bluetooth headphones for better sound and generally dog's prefer this but it isn't required to use the app.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Snoopy Dog Heartbeat has been precisely engineered to listen to dog heartbeat sounds, then record and amplify them. \n2. It works best when the dog is lying down and with Airpods or Bluetooth headphones.\n3. Wet your dog's hair around the heart to ensure a good connection with the skin. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room.\n4. Our simple recording management makes it easy.\n5. Take a dog selfie if you wish and share.\n6. Track and monitor your dog's health weekly.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nYou can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email to send over to your vet.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Snoopy to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super-sensitive in the heartbeat range. Snoopy doesn't fake the heartbeat. \n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13, 13 Max, 12, 12 Max, X, Xs, XR, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+. We don't support iPad. Use the device on Airplane mode.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo. Under no circumstances is Snoopy a substitute for veterinary consultation. Please consult a professional for any advice. \n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/snoopydoghealth\n\nDog heart murmurs can be found in all breeds of dog."

Many of the topics covered here are practical questions for which the simple and safe solution is not always apparent or accessible from medical texts or obscure hospital policy documents. \n\nIC@N is based on a problem-oriented and practical approach: What should I do now? The information contained in IC@N is deliberately simple, direct, and specific. Some will think it too specific. It assumes a basic level of medical knowledge and clinical experience, plus a degree of common sense. It does not contain detailed or comprehensive treatment guides for specific diagnostic conditions nor definitive long-term treatment, that is available elsewhere from other sources. IC@N is not intended to be exhaustive nor comprehensive text book, rather a guidebook.\n\nThe guidelines in IC@N have been developed, trialled, and revised over several years by the medical and nursing staff at Northern Health and Eastern Health (Melbourne, Australia). \n\nOur motto: soins intensifs sans frontieres (critical care without borders). The skills of critical care can be taken outside of the Intensive Care Ward (or ICU/ITU)  to other areas of acute health care with the intention of preventing and treating serious illness before it becomes irreversible."

The method has been used in more than 30 international clinical studies in the past 20 years. \n\nIt gives you the ability to assess and quantify your tremor and to keep track of your values. You can upload your results as Text Files to your iCloud Drive for further visualization, or to share and import them to personal EHR apps. \n\nFor more information, visit www.studymyhealth.com\n\nTremor is the notion for the trembling of a limb. Most prominent is the trembling of the outstretched hand, that everyone is aware of in special situations like excitement or strenuous workouts. Whereas a light trembling of the hand is present in all humans, increased amplitude of the trembling can lead to serious problems in daily life. Increased trembling could be a symptom of a wide variety of diseases, as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor disease, hypothyroidism, or various psychiatric conditions.\n\nTHIS APP IS NOT INTENDED TO DIAGNOSE, TREAT, OR CURE ANY DISEASE.\n\nNote: Tremor severity and frequency are not supported by iHealth; as soon as these values are available we will connect the App to the iHealth ecosystem. \n\niPad Users: Note that the App is not working on the iPad; it does NOT make sense to measure hand tremor using an iPad, the device is too large and heavy to perform the measurements."

      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

Now there is a way, the “IQ test for children – Draw a Man test”.\n\nBack in 1926, Florence Goodenough introduced the Draw a Man test, detailed in her book “Measurement of Intelligence by Drawings”. Based on Goodenough’s work our programming group developed the “IQ test for children – Draw a Man test”.\n\nThe child is asked to draw a person, taking all the time (s)he needs. Most of the children don’t take more than 10-15 minutes to complete their drawing. The child should be encouraged to start drawing and to remain focused, without any pressure or other kind of guidance.\n\nWhen the painting is complete start the evaluation answering a set of standard questions regarding shape, proportions and other details to describe the picture. Just press on the appropriate text boxes to make your selections and press again to deselect. Use the “Back” and “Next” clouds to go back and forth. \n\nKeep in mind that above anything else the results have to do with your child’s ability to focus and the drawing experience gained so far. Don’t be disappointed, try again another day when (s)he is more focused and it’s very possible that the results will amaze you.\n\nThe “IQ test for children – Draw a Man test” is appropriate for the evaluation of children aged 3 to 13 years."

It is hard for one, who has no comparison, to describe what he is seeing and how it is different from what you see. \n\nWe developed iSee to raise awareness on vision impairments and hope to help for better understanding in what it means to have a sight limitation. \nISee is a simulator using the rear camera of your phone or tablet, displays the captured live image and adds one of the most common sight illnesses. The intensity of the sight loss can be regulated. It is possible to chose among Macular degeneration, Retinitis Pigments, Glaucoma or Cataract. \nBesides the simulation iSee includes to each illness information on treatments, causes and a description on its impact on the sight. \n\niSee was developed in cooperation with ophthalmologists. IRIFOR Macerata and the Italian Blind Union in Macerata is working close together with hundreds of persons with vision limitations and the experiences can be found in this application. \n\nIMPORTANT: Advices and information provided by this app are for personal orientation and no medical advice. Each person experiences the disease differently. Please, when you experience any symptoms, contact a professional physician. \n\nIncluded Eye diseases:\n\n- Macular degeneration -\nMacular Degeneration usually occurs at people over 60. There are two types of macular degeneration: atrophic (\"dry\") and exudative (\"wet\"). As people age, parts of the retina may deteriorate.\nAlthough the cause of this condition is not clear, possible causes and risk factors may include: lack of certain vitamins and minerals, breakdown in circulation to the retina, untreated health conditions such as high blood pressure, excessive exposure to ultraviolet light from the sun, heredity, and smoking.\nThe eye care doctor can diagnose macular degeneration during a comprehensive eye examination. Ophthalmoscopy is a procedure that allows the doctor to view the back of the eye, including the macula. If macular degeneration is suspected, a fluorescein angiogram may be performed. In this procedure, dye is injected into the arm and travels to the eye. Damaged areas become highlighted to help determine which type of macular degeneration is present, wet or dry.\n\n- Retinitis Pigments -\nRetinitis pigmentosa is a group of inherited eye diseases that affect the retina. RP causes the breakdown of photoreceptor cells and the patient experience progressive vision loss.\nThe first signs of retinitis pigmentosa in affected children are identifiable by a doctor as early as age 10. In most cases, the disorder is linked to a recessive gene, a gene that must be inherited from both parents in order to cause the disease. But dominant genes and genes on the X chromosome also have been linked to retinitis pigmentosa. In these cases, only one parent has passed the disease gene. In some cases, a new mutation causes the disease to occur.\n\n- Cataract -\nA cataract is a clouding of the lens in the eye leading to a decrease in vision. They may affect one or both eyes and often develop slowly over time.\nCataracts are commonly appearing while aging. They may also occur due to trauma or radiation exposure. In some cases they also can be present from birth or occur following eye surgery. Risk factors are diabetes, smoking, extensive exposure to sunlight, and alcohol. \nEither clumps of protein or yellow-brown pigment may be deposited in the lens reducing the transmission of light to the retina at the back of the eye.\n\n- Glaucoma -\nGlaucoma is the name of group of several diseases that damage the eye’s optic nerve and can result in vision loss and blindness. However, with early detection and treatment, you can often protect your eyes against serious vision loss."

      "label": "SleepCheck is more than a sleep or snore recorder, it assesses your risk of sleep apnoea by analysing your breathing and snoring sounds while you sleep. \n\n**Why should I take the test?**\nSleep apnoea (or apnea) is a serious medical condition that can have a major impact on your life. If you have sleep apnoea, air stops flowing to your lungs for ten seconds or longer during sleep. In some cases, this can happen more than 30 times per hour all night. \n\nSleep apnoea affects more than three in every ten men, and nearly two in every ten women. Studies have shown that 80% of people with sleep apnoea are undiagnosed. \n\n**How the SleepCheck app works**\nSleepCheck records your breathing and snoring sounds while you sleep. SleepCheck then uses clinically proven machine-learning algorithms to assess your risk of sleep apnoea. \n\nIn just a few steps, you can find out if there is more to your snore.\n\n1.\tMake sure you are the only person sleeping in the room\n2.\tAnswer a few questions on your age, gender and neck size\n3.\tBefore you sleep, place your phone on your bedside table, press record and go to sleep\n4.\tWhen you wake up, stop the recording \n5.\tSee your results and understand next steps\n\n- Your privacy and data is protected. No account setup required. - \n\nYour sleep recording never leaves your iPhone.

At that time, the treating team is away and you're on call, running all over the hospital.  \n\nMD on Call gives you tips on how to QUICKLY assess and manage (acutely) common problems so you can go on assessing the next patient, or to your room to get some well deserved sleep.  -- it is NOT meant to replace a textbook --\n \n\n\nFEATURES\nMD on call is divided into 5 main sections:\n\n• Issues •  26 frequent on call situations (including management of some specific conditions)\n\nAbdominal Pain*\nAcute Coronary Syndrome*\nAgitation / Violence\nAnaphylaxis\nBleeding\nBradycardia*\nChest Pain\nConstipation\nDeath (Pronouncing)\nDecreased LOC\nDysuria / UTI*\nDyspnea\nFever\nFebrile neutropenia\nHeadache\nHypertension\nHypotension\nInsomnia\nMeningitis\nNausea / Vomiting\nPain\nPalliation\nPneumonia\nSeizure\nTachycardia\nWound Dehiscence\nWound Infection\n\n• Labs •  Common electrolytes abnormalities (including management)\n\nHypo Ca, K, Mg, Na, PO4, glycemia\nHyper Ca, K, Na, glycemia\n\n• ECG •  Normal and abnormal ECG values, now with examples\n\n• Misc •  Suggestions on how to write orders for admission, \"comfort measures only\", \"on call\" notes, OR and procedure notes.  \nTransfusions:  general information and common reactions\nMisc:  CSF values, opioid conversion...\n\n• Lines and Tubes • How to manage common problems, such as a blocked NG tube.\n\n• Search •  Search using acronyms or keywords\n\n\n****************\n\nFeedback is more than welcome :  visit the website for more details\n\n**************** \n\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThis publication (application) is to be used as a guide only.

      "label": "The OB Wheel Pro 7 is the most complete, powerful, and easiest-to-use tool for healthcare professionals providing prenatal care. In just ONE app there is 1) a gestational age calculator, 2) an ultrasound biometric calculator, 3) a fetal weight calculator, 4) a list of key weeks and trimesters, 5) an age-adjusted risk table for trisomy 21 and aneuploidy, 6) a BMI calculator, and NOW 7) an Apple Watch app is included with your purchase!\n\nThe OB Wheel Pro 7 is a state-of-the-art gestational age calculator (also known as an obstetric or pregnancy wheel) that is used every day by doctors, obstetricians, midwives, nurses, and pregnant women. The OB Wheel Pro 7 is a professional tool that replaces the need for multiple apps and it greatly enhances the functionality of those worn-out cardboard wheels without compromise. \n\nThe OB Wheel Pro 7 accurately determines the estimated delivery date (EDD), or due date, of a pregnancy based on the first day of a woman's last menstrual period (LMP), or from the date of conception, or from a known gestational age (GA) on a known date, e.g. from an ultrasound measurement, or from fetal biometry like Crown-Rump Length (CRL), Femur Length (FL), and BiParietal Diameter (BPD). Additionally, for appropriate gestational ages, The The OB Wheel Pro 7 estimates fetal weight and displays the number of days completed and remaining. \n\nThe OB Wheel Pro 7, besides calculating GA from fetal ultrasound biometrics, enables clinicians to also calculate Estimated Fetal Weight (EFW) from FL, BPD, Head Circumference (HC), and Abdominal Circumference (AC) using the most appropriate published reference formula using the maximum and most appropriate parameters.\n\nPrenatal care providers know that there are key gestational ages where testing or interventions are needed. The OB Wheel Pro 7 lets providers see at a glance when these items should be scheduled.\n\nFEATURES\n• Includes Apple Watch app! \n• Gestational Age Calculator from LMP, EDD, Conception Date for any reference date\n• Gestational Age calculated from specific date and gestational age (e.g. ultrasound)\n• Gestational Age Calculator using fetal biometrics (CRL, FL, BPD)\n• Fetal Weight Calculator using HC, AC, FL, BPD\n• Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator\n• Age-Adjusted Risk Table for Trisomy 21 and aneuploidy\n• List of key completed weeks during pregnancy\n• Pregnancy days completed and remaining, and dates for each trimester\n• Remembers last-used EDD\n\n\nPRO TIPS: \n• To enter Gestational Age, CRL, FL, or BPD for a specific date (like for an ultrasound exam), tap \"Today\", enter the desired date, then tap on the button displaying the gestational age to change that button to display options for entering a specific GA, CRL, FL, and BPD. \n• When using the GA calculator, double-tap a date to change the value to the current date.\n• When using the EFW calculator, double-tap a value to clear the value of the selected parameter."

Peflog understands bronchodilatation and it creates comprehensive reports.\n\nI'm a father of four and found traditional PEF monitoring boring, time consuming and error prone. I tried to use pen and paper with my children but it didn't really work out. I creating snappy Peflog app for myself and for my children in order to make asthma tracking as easy and fast as possible for everybody.\n\nFeatures\n\n- Save Peak Flow readings with ease\n- Edit readings and monitoring periods\n- A timer reminds about the next puff after having medication\n- Comprehensive report and charts\n- Daily variation\n- Bronchodilatation (impact of the medication)\n- Reference PEF (calculated based on age, height and gender)\n- Personal best (calculated or manual)\n- Colour zones (green, yellow, red)\n- Alarming variations indicated in red\n- The PDF report is easy to send out\n- Dark and light themes and color options\n- Languages: English, Finnish, Norwegian, German, Spanish\n- Available for other platforms too\n\nIMPORTANT! This applications is not a medical device nor its substitute. You must use your own certified peak flow meter and consult a healthcare professional about its correct usage. This application provides information as is and should not be treated as a medical advice. You should always consult your healthcare professional in your health related issues and appropriate usage of the information.\n\nThank you for these kind words and five stars!\n\n*****Mar 8, 2019\nFor me is the best app for tracking my daughter's asthma. It's tell me when her asthma is going worst before she notice it. Very easy to use and you can send the peak flow chart directly to the doctor.\n\n*****Mar 4, 2019\nI'm completely satisfied with the app, I can store everything exactly as my doctor asks me. Top App.\n\n*****Feb 1, 2019 A Must Have Peak Flow App\nLove this app does what it says on the tin. Easy to use, so glad of this app, worth every penny. Nice one developer\n\n*****Dec 12, 2018 Simple to use\nTried a few apps before settling on this. Easy to use with nice, clear, graphs. Does all I need.\n\n*****Aug 11, 2018 Brilliant app and so easy to use\nI’ve tried a few asthma PEF diary apps and this is by far the best. Nice graphics, easy to use and easy to understand.\n\n*****May 5, 2018 Excellent for those under assessment\nI wanted an easy to use app that just plotted readings before and after meds and this fits the bill perfectly. It’s very easy to use and has room for notes if you want to add them. It’s much better than the basic sheet I was given by the nurse and shows up plainly how effective the meds are. Well worth paying for, thank you!"

      "label": "The Airway Triage App can be used by all health care professionals in any clinical situation in which airway management is needed.\nWith the easy to use PHASE and HELP-ET checklists the airway of your patient can be triaged within minutes into basic or advanced. This is the best airway assessment tool to clearly define basic airways that can be managed with basic airway management techniques by a trained person. Advanced airways should be managed by medical personnel with advanced airways skills and special equipment may be needed.  Complexity factors that may make airway management very challenging can be found and used to make an airway management plan. This is the first airway assessment tool that implements human factors, vital signs and the surgical procedure. The app can be used in pre-assessment clinics, in the operating room environment, in the ICU and emergency department for patients > 12 years old or prior to procedural sedation.\nWith the Circles of Life airway approach you can check  if you are “fit-to-fly with this patient for this airway management procedure”.\nThe Circles of Life approach can be used by trainees to evaluate the progress of skills and training and can also be used by experienced airway managers to seek help or assistance for specific highly complex procedures.\nThe Airway Triage App can also be used for prospective airway management studies. A direct link with description of your airway plan and an audit of adverse events can be emailed that will be used to validate this innovative triage tool. The Airway Triage App is developed by the founder of the Airway Management Academy.\nUse this airway assessment tool and please provide feedback to improve global patient safety during airway management.\nThis app is available in 10 languages, the default language is English."

The DST very effectively detects early dementia stages, and can reliably distinguish between the different dementia severity levels. It is therefore suitable for dementia screening, as well as for severity monitoring / therapy control over time.\n\nAdditional functions include:\n- a reminder to redo the test after 3-6 months, for medical monitoring \n- continued engagement for prevention, through regular Dementia News \n- tracking of the dementia risk over time, visualized in a graphic\n- option to e-mail and/or print the test results (e.g., for discussion with a physician) \n\nTo date, there is no effective treatment for advanced dementia stages. Therefore, effective screening is essential to begin treatment before the brain damages become irreversible. Because for early dementia stages, there are already effective treatment options that can significantly delay or even prevent the progression of the disease. \n\nWith special tests, dementia can be detected 18 years prior to the first symptoms. The Dementia Screening Test (DST) is the only such test which has been certified by Health Authorities as a Medical Device for dementia screening.\n\nThe good news is: for most people the test can give the all-clear!\n \nThe DST in short:\n- Easy to perform, also for medical laypersons.\n- Reliable: more than 96% sensitivity proven in clinical trials, probably the highest value worldwide for such tests.\n- Safe: no registration required, no storage of personal data, works without internet connection, no advertising.\n- Recognized as a medical device by Health Authorities.\n- Works with all dementia subtypes (Alzheimer's dementia, vascular dementia, fronto-temporal dementia, Lewy-body dementia, secondary dementia, hybrids / other forms).\n- Engaging: provides you with the latest research results on a regular basis, and reminds to retake the test regularly.\n- Documents changes in dementia risk over time.\n- Supports research and public awareness for dementia patients and relatives.\n\nTake the test now, and become a superager!"

After the first, fifth and tenth minutes, a reminder is given to assess the clinical condition of the newborn in the form of the standardized Apgar score. When all three values are recorded, the birth is automatically saved for later consultation.\n\nSIMPLE & CLEAR\n\nThe usage is designed to be simple and clear. The criteria to be measured and the possible score are large and clear and displayed in distinct colors. Reminders have a special alert tone and are displayed even when the device is in \"do not disturb\" mode or on silent.\n\nSAFE & RELIABLE\n\nStored births can be deleted with a simple swipe when no longer needed.\n\nAll recorded data and inputs are completely anonymous, i.e. without any reference to a person, and are stored exclusively on the device.\n\nDuring birth, there is an emergency call function enabling to call the emergency services at any time and without detours."

      "label": "What is iBP?\n\niBP is a blood pressure tracking and analysis tool. Please note, it is not possible to measure your blood pressure by touching the screen. A separate device is required.\n\nWhat kind of analysis does iBP provide?\n\niBP uses color icons to indicate when your blood pressure values are normal, high, or hypertension. It also provides interactive graphs that allow you to display your values by weeks, months, year and time of day. The graphs display lows, highs, averages, and trend lines using statistical analysis.\n\nWhy iBP vs. other blood pressure apps?\n\niBP is a universal app designed to work on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, which means you only pay for the app once and you get all versions! iBP is the only blood pressure app with a built in transfer capability to sync all your iOS devices.\n\nWhat are the key features?\n\n* Reads and writes Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data (details below)\n* Easy data input using dials instead of keyboard\n* Transfer capability to sync all of your iOS devices\n* Calculates Mean Arterial Pressure and Pulse Pressure\n* Track one personal item (blood glucose, stress level, medication dosage, exercise time)\n* Backup / Restore capability\n* Multiple users\n* Multiple email addresses (you and doctor)\n* Multiple email formats (PDF, HTML, CSV, Plain Text)\n* Passcode to protect your data\n* Touch Id for passcode on devices that support it\n* Snapshot of the graphs can be saved\n* User configurable color ranges\n* Weight units (lb or kg)\n* Withings Blood Pressure Monitor & Wireless Scale\n\nApple Health\niBP is now able to read and write Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data. If your blood pressure monitor (i.e., Omron, iHealth, Withings) adds data to Apple Health then you can easily import that data into this app. If you manually input your data into this app, then it will write that data to Apple Health.\n\nWithings + iBP = No more data entry!\niBP can retrieve your blood pressure and weight data directly from your Withings account.  The Blood Pressure Monitor and wireless Body Scale automatically record and send the data to your account.  There is no data entry required and you can view the data anywhere using a web browser or a variety of mobile apps.\n\n\nDisclaimer: iBP is intended to be used as a means to collect data to be shared with your doctor. This application is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

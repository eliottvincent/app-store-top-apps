      "label": "Built for Live performance and hands free use, Quantiloop recreates the simplicity of a hardware loop pedal in an iOS app. Attach a MIDI foot controller and control it the way you want. No MIDI controller at hand; just preset your loop length, enable auto–record or a count–in and your loops will automatically close, no hands or feet required. Big onscreen controls allow for easy configuration and tactile control by vocalists or beat boxers. Focus on your performance instead of fiddling with dip switches or complex menu’s.\n\nBe Creative\n\nCreate 4 tracks with endless layers of overdubs to build your performance. Record a Chorus, Verse and Bridge and switch between them seamlessly or create a 1 bar percussie loop on track one, a 4 bar chord progression on track two and layer a bass line on top, all in perfect synchronisation.\n\nRhythm Guide\n\nThe builtin rhythm guide provides a rhythmic backing. Use the internal metronome for practice, import drum loops from virtually anywhere or host and control your favourite rhythm apps to enhance your performance. MIDI master lets you control MIDI hardware, and MIDI slave lets Quantiloop follow it. Ableton Link lets you even play in time over WiFi with external apps and devices. Quantisation aligns your actions to the nearest measure or beat so you stay in time, and real-time tempo control sets the pace. Prefer setting your own pace, disable quantisation and Quantiloop will react to your actions with minimum latency to create tight synchronised recordings.\n\nFX\n\nAssign up to 3 simultaneous effects to the input. Use the built-in transpose to covert your guitar into a bass, or host your guitar amp sim directly in Quantiloop. The results will be recorded into your loops.\nOr assign up to 3 simultaneous track effects to the output. Use the tape stop to add drama, introduce a key change to build up your performance, or host an Inter-App audio/AU reverb processor. Track FX may be assigned to a single track, all tracks or the combined output.\n\nFeatures\n\n•\tFree, Synced and Paralel,Serial, Mixed Playing Styles\n•\tMultiple Quantise Modes\n•\tMultiple Stop Modes\n•\tUnique Dub Mode and Mute Mode\n•\tUnlimited Overdubs\n•\tOverdub Decay\n•\tUndo / Redo\n•\tAuto Record\n•\tHigh quality stereo audio\n•\tClear loop status display\n•\tRhythm guide with optional auto-start, auto-stop and count-in\n•\tAudible and Visual Metronome\n•\tSend start, stop and host sync to hosted rhythm apps.\n•\tSync to host when embedded in an Inter-App-Audio host\n•\tReal-time Tempo Control\n•\tExtensive MIDI control\n•\tMultiple Assignments per MIDI controller (tap, hold, double tap)\n•\tMIDI Program Change support for changing presets\n•\tSupports Audiobus and Inter-App-Audio and Audio Units (AUv3)\n•\tIndividual outputs for each track and rhythm\n•\tSynchronise to other apps and devices with Ableton Link\n•\tMIDI clock sync (both slave and master)\n•\t4 physical/iaa/au/audiobus inputs routable to any track\n•\t8 outputs (main, monitor, track 1-4, rhythm, input out)\n•\t3 assignable input Fx, including transpose, reverb and IAA, AUv3\n•\t3 assignable track Fx, including transpose, reverse, tape stop, fade and IAA, AUv3\n•\tCloud (iCloud, Dropbox, Audioshare …) import / export\n•\tAudioCopy/Paste\n•\tOpen In\n•\tStore Phrase Presets in unlimited banks with 100 presets each\n•\tIndividual Volume and panning controls for each track"

On the first and second pairs, the notes are the same octave and each string in the pair should sound exactly the same to it's other string in the pair. This is eEaAdDgGBBEE tuning. The lowercase letters means that it is one octave higher then it's counterpart. \n\nTouch the note for the string you want to tune and then turn the tuning pegs on your guitar and match it up with the note that is being played.\n\nTip: Make several passes tuning each of the strings. For example you might have noticed that if you have tuned all the strings once, and then back to the first one you tuned, it might be off a little bit. This is because you are increasing or decreasing the tension on each of the strings as you tune it and the instrument's body might bend ever so slightly due to this difference in tension. This causes the other strings to slightly change in pitch. So make sure you keep on checking and tuning the strings until all are in tune, so make several passes.\n\nAlso you can use this simple tuner for your standard 6-String Guitar, it is the same tuning, only the strings on the 6-String Guitar are EADGBBEE, which is right part of this 12-String Guitar Tuner. So use just right part of this tuner to tune up your 6-String Guitar.\n\nAny questions using the App?

A crucial figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras in Western art music, he remains one of the most famous and influential of all composers.\nBeethoven is acknowledged as one of the giants of classical music; occasionally he is referred to as one of the \"three Bs\" (along with Bach and Brahms) who epitomise that tradition. He was also a pivotal figure in the transition from the 18th century musical classicism to 19th century romanticism, and his influence on subsequent generations of composers was profound.\n\n\nPlaylist:\n\nPiano Concerto 1:1 Allegro con brio\nPiano Concerto 1:2 Largo\nPiano Concerto 1:3 Rondo.

There is no time-based pressure and Solo reduces the cognitive load of having to choose which ‘notes/intervals’ to play. As you get quicker at finding these ‘notes’ you will conversely get better at choosing them whilst improvising. Players of all ability levels will reap huge benefits from practicing with Solo.\n\n\n‣ Using common progressions, Solo presents you with one chord symbol or scale at a time and asks you to find and play a series of notes based on their intervallic function.\n\n‣ Solo listens to the notes you play, analyzes them in real time, and doesn’t move on until you’ve correctly found each note by its intervallic function in the specified order.\n\n‣ This process builds strong fretboard visualization for the most powerful, efficient and malleable way to KNOW your way around the fretboard no matter how difficult the chord changes are. \n\n\nAs a unique and powerful ear training tool, Solo also develops your ability to not only visualize what you’re playing, but hear it in real time too.\n\nIf you know your note names but struggle to learn new scales, play through chord changes or find yourself stuck in pattern based playing, practicing diligently with Solo will be transformational for your knowledge of the fretboard and subsequently your ability to outline harmony when you improvise. \n\n\n‣ CHANGES PLAYING TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions over a series of chord changes based on common and popular chord progressions. Solo is programmed with all the knowledge behind the scenes to understand jazz and popular music harmony and will always pick appropriate intervallic functions based on the harmony of the progression. \n \n‣ SCALE TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions within scales on the fretboard. Solo includes all the modes of the Major, Melodic Minor, Harmonic Minor and Harmonic Major scales, plus pentatonic and symmetrical scales. Seeing and finding scale tones as intervallic functions will transform your ability to manipulate and improvise with scales in real time.    \n\n‣ TUTORIALS\nSolo also includes video tutorials to get you started with intervallic functions, how to find them on the fretboard, using Solo for ear training and how to get the most from your practice time with the app.\n\n\nNo registration or account required."

Doppi (pronounced doh-pie) raises the bar in iOS app design in an essentially simple music player, built just for your local music files.\n\nEnjoy your music with: \n\n• A beautifully simple interface\n• Fluid gesture-based navigation\n• Always-reachable search and playback controls\n\nSupports MP3, M4A, FLAC, and more. Browse and play music:\n\n• Received via AirDrop\n• Copied from the Files app\n• Shared from other apps (selecting \"Copy to Doppi\")\n• Added to the Doppi folder in Files or via iTunes File Sharing\n• Synced from iTunes\n• Downloaded from Cloud Music Library\n\n————\nImportant: \nDoppi does not support Apple Music offline downloads outside of Cloud Music Library.\n————\n\nWith Doppi:\n\nBig, Beautiful Artwork\nYour music's artwork takes center stage on the Now Playing screen and throughout your library.\n\nMake It Your Own\nChoose from 6 highlight colors and 32 beautiful icons, switch between 4 light and dark themes, rearrange your library tabs, and more—all from Preferences.\n\nSearch From Anywhere\nPull down from anywhere in your library to invoke Search. Hit Return to instantly trigger the top result.\n\nPlay and Add Quickly\nPlay an album or artist right from the library using their embedded Play buttons, and add songs to Up Next using the Add (+) buttons.\n\nMark Your Likes\nTap the heart on the player (or choose Like from a menu) to Like tracks. Liked music appears in the Liked Songs playlist, Liked Albums on Search, and is more likely to play in Shuffle All.\n\nMake Playlists\nCreate all-new playlists, duplicate them, or copy them from Apple Music. Tap and hold on anything to add those songs to a list.\n\nAdd Lyrics\nSearch for lyrics on the web right from the app and add them to your songs. Enjoy them on Doppi's beautiful player interface.\n\nManage Your Music\nEverything in your library has useful actions — just tap and hold to reveal a menu. For example, if you're not feeling some of your music, you can exclude it from Shuffle All, hide it from your library, or delete it (if it's from imported files).\n\nLess, But Better\nEvery screen in Doppi has been carefully designed with clean typography, pleasing contrast, and elegant motion. Enjoy your music without unnecessary distractions.\n\nEasily Readable\nDoppi fully supports Dynamic Type and includes high contrast themes, so your eyes won't get in the way of your ears.\n\nContinue Album\nEver shuffled your music, found a song you loved, and wished you could keep playing the album without stopping the song? Doppi can make it happen — just navigate to the album and press Play.\n\nGive your music the lovely home it deserves.\n\n————\nImportant:\nDoppi does not include any music.

Tuner T1 Pro also comes with a handy Tone Generator that plays any musical note as reference for tuning. A must-have tool for musicians.\n\n• Simple to use with all the essential features.\n• Live pitch graph displays the exact pitch, note and deviation in realtime.\n• Extremely accurate (can be tuned to an accuracy of ±0.1 cents).\n• Tone generator that can generate reference tones over a note-range of 3 octaves.\n• Ability to set the frequency of A₄ (for tunings where A₄ is not 440 hertz).\n• Option to visualize pitch on piano keys.\r\n• Option to set detection latency - By setting a lower latency value, pitch detection will be faster. This works great for cases like vocal practice. By using a higher latency, pitch detection will not respond to momentary unintended sounds and noise (works great for instrument tuning).\r\n• Smart Detection - Use machine learning to enable pitch detection only when certain instruments or vocal sounds are detected."

      "label": "BeatMirror uses your device's built-in microphone to detect musical tempo in real-time. Set a target tempo with the special tempo keyboard and then start the music. A real-time graph of your tempo will appear right away, allowing you to scroll through your tempo history and see trends. Perfect for musicians looking to build their internal rhythm, or to see the tempo of their favorite songs in real-time!  \n\nTESTIMONIALS:\n\"BeatMirror truly is simplicity at its finest. That quality is missing from most apps who try to cram too many features into one app thus making it difficult to use and many times buggy. We feel like your app is VERY good. We're reviewing BeatMirror and it will be a part of the next show. It's got nothing but thumbs up!\" - Phil Smith of \"Drummer's Weekly Groovecast\" (podcast)\n\n\"When I first heard about BeatMirror, I was kind of skeptical but after trying it out for weeks now and playing with it everyday, I'm mindblown. Alex really wanted to put a focus on helping drummers improve their internal clock and I really think he's done so.\" - Richard Ducat of \"Drummers I Like\" (podcast)\n\n\"Overall, this app is so quick and simple to use, there's not really an excuse as to why you wouldn't use it during practice sessions, just to see how you’re improving. If you're a drummer, having an app on your phone or tablet like BeatMirror just makes sense.\" - Laura Barnes of MI-PRO (mi-pro.co.uk)\n\nFEATURES:\nGood music needs good rhythm. But learning to stay on beat—learning to groove—isn't always easy. Build your inner metronome with BeatMirror and catch yourself when you're speeding up or slowing down. Here’s what BeatMirror has to offer:\n- Wide tempo range. Tempo detection between 40 bpm and 208 bpm.\n- Fast. Detects tempo quickly and accurately.\n- Flexible. Accurate across time signatures (e.g., 4/4, 6/8) and rhythm styles (e.g., swing).\n- Real-time, scrollable graph. Displays current tempo and tempo history in real-time.\n- Zoom features. Choose tight, loose, or full zoom—or double-tap the graph for easy toggling.\n- Easy sharing. Share your tempo graph with a tap.\n- Easy-to-read interface. Optimized for various light environments, such as stages and practice spaces.\n- Tempo keyboard. A special tempo keyboard (with tap pad) lets you set a target tempo easily and intuitively.\n- Visual feedback. If you drift from your target tempo, BeatMirror shows a red (slow down!), blue (speed up!), or green (perfect!) indicator.\n- Custom count-in. BeatMirror gives you an optional count-in before you start playing.\n- Versatile. Perfect for solo practice, band rehearsals, recorded music, and you can even use it at concerts! \n- Tutorial. An in-app tutorial gets you up and running in a flash.\n\nTIPS FOR BEST PERFORMANCE:\n- Avoid handling your device during tempo measurement.\n- Be mindful of competing noise near the device's microphone (e.g., conversation, typing).\n- Unplug any headphones with a built-in microphone.\n\nNOTES ON USAGE:\n- \"Target Tempo.\" BeatMirror is aimed at musicians and bands looking to build their internal rhythm and musical skills. With that in mind, you are prompted for a \"target tempo\" (the tempo you're aiming for) prior to tempo detection. To ensure highly accurate results, the detection range is limited to roughly ±20% of your target tempo. (Tempos outside of this range will not be detected.)\n- Recorded music. To detect the tempo of recorded music using BeatMirror, follow these steps:\n1) Play a song from your favorite music player app using the device speaker (i.e., unplug your headphones). Or, play the song from a different device altogether.\n2) Open BeatMirror and set a rough target tempo by tapping along.\n3) The song's precise tempo will then be displayed in real-time.\n\nQuestions about BeatMirror? Please don't hesitate to get in touch at alex[at]tenkettles[dot]com. Happy practicing! -Alex"

As seen on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\n\nhttps://loopyapp.com\n\n-- “This is the best loop station on the iPhone” -- Dub FX (dubfx.net) \n-- “I pretty much own every mobile looper out there and Loopy is HANDS DOWN the best. Super simple interface with powerful features.” -- J. Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support. Please contact me with questions, bug reports, feature ideas, and other feedback at support@atastypixel.com or https://forum.loopyapp.com.

      "label": "Bebot is a musical instrument that anyone can play. Instead of a keyboard, it has an easy-to-use touch control system. And it's all built into a friendly animated robot, who performs your music while you play.\n\nAlthough it looks simple on the outside, inside is a powerful synth engine which lets you create and edit your own sounds and apply effects. The controls are easy to use, making it fun to tinker and experiment with sound. If you just want to get playing, there's also a wide selection of preset sounds.\n\nThe touch control system lets you lock in a scale so that you'll never play a wrong note, which makes it easy to play, even on your iPhone. It's polyphonic, which means you can use multiple fingers at once to play chords and harmonies. Plus, you can perform sweeping slides and expressive gestures that would be practically impossible on a regular keyboard.\n\nWhile it's designed to be simple and fun, that doesn't mean it's only for beginners. Bebot has been used both on stage and in the studio by accomplished musicians and performers including Dream Theater, How To Destroy Angels and The Flaming Lips.\n\nTo see and hear Bebot in action, check out the demo videos at normalware.com, including a walkthrough demo by keyboard wizard Jordan Rudess.\n\nNow with Audiobus and Inter-App Audio, you can connect Bebot to other apps such as GarageBand to record, multitrack and add effects, making Bebot more versatile and useful than ever.

It's an incredible tool for all audio engineers and musicians ... My mixing has improved by leaps and bounds after just a few weeks with Quiztones.”\n\n- Austin McAllister\n\n\nA professional Audio Engineer of 10 years, I've come across many ear training devices, blind tests, and software. This app is TOPS! Highly recommended! The developers are serious about what they do. You will not be disappointed!\n\n- Joel Avery\n\n——\n\nWhy We Created Quiztones EQ Ear Training Apps ...\n\nWe thought there should be an easier way to learn how to use EQ, train your ears and expedite the path to getting professional quality mixes, recordings and productions.\n\nWhen I was at music school ten years ago studying audio engineering and music production, my teacher turned an iMac around, pulled up an EQ in Pro Tools and started quizzing the class on which audio frequencies he was boosting or cutting in a mix. That's when it hit me — this should be an app, with various difficulty levels, a scoring system and the ability to import your own source material for quizzes that will teach you how to use EQ like a pro.\n\nFast forward to today — 50k app downloads later — and we're still just as excited to keep evolving Quiztones to help you take the quality of your mixes, recordings and productions to the next level."

Minimise the friction for endless bouncing motion, as an innovative substitute for traditional LFOs and modulation. There was never a better reason for using a touchscreen for music.\n\nShimmer Feedback effect\nLike a shimmer reverb, except it feeds the processed audio back into the grain engine. This lets you create an endless loop of pitch-shifting spaciousness, turning even the simplest of sounds into massive woolly mammoths. \n\n- 3 Voice grain engine, each with an independent playhead\n- Filter inspired by the Oberheim Xpander, including its resonant Phase filter\n- Kinetic sliders and pads for playful interaction with the sound\n- Universal design (iPhone and iPad; iPad Air 2 or higher recommended)\n- Custom scales, unquantised mode and even Scala-import for microtonal experiments\n- Use WAVs (or other audio files), record audio or load the app as a live-processing audio effect\n- Real world tested as an instrument in numerous live performances by Hainbach\n- Offers light mode and dark mode UI"

      "label": "Benny Greb, well known for his contributions to the drumming education community, shared the approach that he has taken personally to develop his sense of groove and improve his own timing on his instrument in his course “The Art and Science of Groove”. Now with the Gap Click app, everyone can practice his method easily with a simple-to-use app! \n\nUnlike standard metronomes which simply state the time, Gap Click helps you improve your sense of time. Gap Click is more than a metronome with a focus on improving your ability to keep tempo, become more aware and comfortable with off beat clicks and by that, become bullet proof and accurate with all notes of the subdivision.\n\nGAP CLICK\nBy scrolling through the numbers of bars and patterns you can quickly configure a “gap” of time in which the metronome drops out. When the “one” comes back around, will your playing still be in time? How long of a gap can you play through and still maintain solid tempo?\n\nMOVING CLICK\nNext you can experiment with all kinds of off-beat patterns in the Gap Bar which moves the click from the downbeat position to a different location. Can you still play your instrument and maintain the downbeat internally even when you hear the click sound on an off-beat?\n\nBoth the “click” and the “gap” portion supports a variety of different syncopated patterns allowing you the ability to practice in binary or ternary rhythms - with more or less safety net depending on your settings.\n\nFeatures\n• Ability to choose from a variety of different syncopated patterns and # of measures for both the standard \"click\" as well as the \"gap\"\n• Use the nostalgic click wheel to find the right tempo or tap to set your desired tempo from 10 to 300bpm\n• Standard quarter-note time signatures: 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4\n\nPersonalize\n• See visual feedback for each note or rest that is played\n• Accent beat 1 of each measure or turn accents off for a greater challenge\n• Flash the screen for a visual indication when switching from the \"click\" to the \"gap\"\n• Find your favorite sound from a variety of click samples hand-picked by Benny\n\nBuy Once, Use Forever\n• There are no In-App Purchases - a one time purchase includes all current and future features. \n\nTESTIMONIALS\nWhat professionals are saying about GAP CLICK:\n• \"The skills you can sharpen by using this app are integral for what it takes to be a professional drummer in any genre.\" - Matt Halpern\n• \"When I first opened the app, it made (simple) sense, without a tutorial.\" - Chris Coleman\n• \"This app helps you lock in the pocket on a whole different level.\" - Luke Holland\n• \"The Gap Click app is something that every drummer should have in their toolbox.\" - Jared Falk, Drumeo\n\nWhat our users are saying about GAP CLICK: \n• \"If you think you have good timing, this will really put you in your place.\"\n• \"Gone are the days of programming gap clicks!\"\n• \"I’ve never had so much fun being destroyed in my practice session.\"\n• \"This is by far the best money I’ve ever spent on a practice tool.\"\n\nABOUT BENNY GREB\nBenny Greb is one of the most respected drummers in the world today. Not only has he headlined nearly every major drum festival and toured with his clinics and drum camps worldwide, but he is also recognized as a composer and bandleader in his own band Moving Parts, which won him the renowned “ECHO Jazz” award - the German equivalent to The Grammys in jazz.\n\nBenny Greb published two of the most successful and critically acclaimed educational products, “The Language of Drumming” and “The Art and Science of Groove” and he has helped create many signature products available to drummers today.\n\nFind him online at https://www.bennygreb.de as well as on social media."

When played as a solo instrument, the tabla is accompanied (usually on the harmonium or sarangi) by a continuous cyclical musical phrase or riff called the \"Lehra\" or \"Nagma\" (ostinato in western music) that keeps track of the \"aavartan\" or rythmic cycle in the chosen \"taal\".\n________________________________________\n\n◆ AND NOW PRESENTING - iLehra ◆\niLehra was the first electronic Lehra / Nagma player for the iPhone and iPod Touch, and its now available on the iPad as well! It provides accurate as well as pleasing lehra accompaniment for a wide variety of taals and raags on the Harmonium, Santoor, Violin, or the Flute. Innovative features include tanpura auto-tuned to the chosen lehra/raag, presets, tap-tempo, metronome, and extremely intuitive controls.\n\nSee the iLehra website for a YouTube demo:\n   http://iLehra.com\n________________________________________\n\n◆ KEY FEATURES ◆\n√ Plays 109 Lehras in 55+ raags for 25 taals\n√ Taals included:  Ada Chautaal(14), Basant Taal(9), Chartal-ki-Sawari(11), Chautaal(12), Dadra(6), Deepchandi(14), Dhamar(14), Ektaal(12), Faradost/Firdost(14), Ganesh Taal(21), Jhaptaal(10), Jhoomra(14), Keherva(8), Matta Taal(9), Pancham Sawari(15), Rudra Taal(11), Rupak(7), Sooltaal(10), Teentaal(16), as well as general lehras for 7.5, 8.5, 9.5, 10.5, 13, and 18 beats.\n√ Beautiful, realistic lehras on Harmonium, Violin, Flute, or Santoor!\n√ Full octave of pitch adjustments from C through B\n√ INTEGRATED AUTO-TUNER: Auto-Tune iLehra to your tabla, or use it to tune other instruments (microphone capability required such as iPhone built-in mic or 2nd/3rd generation iPod Touch with external microphone)\n√ BACKGROUND PLAY: Start playing the lehra and switch to another app, or play along with iPod music\n√ TAP TEMPO: just tap the beats on the bottom display and watch iLehra sync up!\n√ PRESETS: save your frequently-used combinations of pitch, taal, lehra, instrument & tempo as named presets.

      "label": "Have you ever struggled to find confidence on stage or inspiration in the studio? AeroPads cues immersive pads and soundscapes that inspire and equip you to perform your very best every time.\n\nENHANCE YOUR SOUND. ENGAGE YOUR AUDIENCE.\nEvery musician has experienced an empty mix or an awkward transition. When using AeroPads, you instantly add more dimension and character to your sound. With a more immersive mix and the ability to perform smooth and seamless transitions, you will feel more confident while your audience will be more engaged.\n\nFOR EVERY MUSICIAN.\nPads and soundscapes are a versatile accompaniment to nearly any style of music. Whether you are a soloist or full band, AeroPads will take your sound to the next level. Rock bands, worship teams, wedding singers, producers, songwriters, and instrumentalists are just a few of the many types of musicians that have loved using AeroPads.\n\nDESIGNED FOR THE STAGE. INSPIRED BY SPACE.\nAeroPads features creative and immersive soundscapes paired with a beautiful and intuitive interface, all inspired by the pinnacle of exploration and inspiration: outer space.\n\nCREATIVITY THAT SPARKS CREATIVITY.\nAeroPads aren't your typical pads. Most pads out there are really boring or insanely obnoxious. However, AeroPads features thoughtfully crafted soundscapes that are meticulously fine-tuned with the perfect amount of harmonic and textural movement. Simply put, AeroPads won't step on the toes of your arrangement or get on the nerves of your sound guy (like most other pads out there).\n\n\nHighlighted Features:\n- A beautiful space-inspired interface with a simple and intuitive design.\n- Live View: Every key and three of your favorite patches are instantly accessible (best suited for experimentation, free-flowing sets, and songwriting).\n- Setlist View: Plan and build a detailed setlist (best suited for structured sets and seamless transitions).\n- The iconic Atmosphere Soundpack which includes five unique patches named after and inspired by the layers of Earth's atmosphere. \n- Three patches can be added to Live View to be made instantly accessible, so there's no need to dig through menus to just to change a patch when performing live.\n- Additional patches and soundpacks available for purchase.\n\n\nHow to Use:\n01. Cue a pad that matches the key of your musical arrangement.\n02. Play overtop of the accompanying pads and soundcapes.\n03. Enjoy the boost of audience engagement, musician confidence, and creative inspiration.\n\nPads and soundscapes are intended as a subtle accompaniment to musical arrangements/performances. They are designed to be cued according to the key of the arrangement. Once cued, you'll hear a droning pad centered around the root note with additional harmonic textures within the major scale. Pads can accompany arrangements of both minor and major scales. To accompany an arrangement within a minor scale, cue the relative major (Example: to accompany an arrangement in the key of A minor, cue \"C\"). A pad's key should not be changed to match chord changes within an arrangement. The only time a pad's key should change within a song is in the instance of a key change. For best results, mix AeroPads appropriately within the overall mix. When mixed too loud, AeroPads may compete with melodies and the arrangement. When mixed too quietly, AeroPads may be less effective. When mixed appropriately, they will sound awesome."

      "label": "Euclidean Sequencer is an alternative incarnation of the classic step sequencer that has become very popular in the modular realm. It is based on Euclidean rhythms developed by computer scientist Godfried Toussaint in 2004. Euclidean rhythms have their roots in Greek mathematician Euclid’s algorithm, which involves using the greatest common divisor of two numbers to place hits in a sequence as evenly as possible across a set timing divisions.\n\nIn practice this is actually simpler than you might think, and Euclidean Sequencer is a great way to auto generate complex musical sequences with no prior knowledge of how it actually works.\n\nEuclidean Sequencer is an AUv3 plugin that can be loaded inside any popular host application that has flexible MIDI routing. \n\nYou can define up to 4 Euclidean rhythm parts, each part is referred to as a band. The bands are labelled A-D and colour coded RED, ORANGE, GREEN and CYAN. Together these 4 bands create a pattern, and you can create up to 16 seperate patterns per song patch.\n\nSince each band can specify its own note sequence and output MIDI channel, you can create some quite sophisticated rythms patterns, driving 4 seperate instruments at once. Even better you can seamlessly switch patterns to create even longer evolving sequences. Patterns follow a specified key, scale, or defined chord.\n\nYou can even use MIDI input to automatically make note sequences conform to the currently playing chords.\n\nPlease note: This is an AUv3 plugin instended to be used inside your favourite host DAW such as AUM, Cubasis, Loopy Pro etc. It will work with any app that has flexible MIDI routing.\n\n\nFeatures\n\n4 Band Sequencer\n16 Patterns per patch.\nUp to 64 events per band.\nSeamless pattern transitions.\nOutput Port and Channel control.\nPer Band and Global speeds.\nRandomize function with varying complexity.\nSupports note Probability.\nReverse and PingPong modes.\nMIDI Chord recognition.\nLatch mode.\n4 Band Velocity Mixer\nController support.\nGate Mode.\nAUv3 Compatible."

      "label": "Interval is the fundamental part of music structures, since all melodies or harmonies can be considered as a sequence or layering of intervals.  This app is to help improve your ability of interval recognition.  More specifically, you can develop the following skills:\n\n•  Ear Training\nWhen you hear a melody, you’ll be able to recognize the intervals by ears.  This will improve your sense of relative pitch which is a powerful skill for any musician to have.\n\n• Music Reading\nWhen you read the music score, you’ll be able to identify the intervals between notes quickly.  This will help improve the speed of your music reading.\n\n•  Singing\nThe app can detect the voice of your singing or the sound of your instrument playing through the microphone.  This can help you sing/play intervals accurately.  \n\n•  Piano Playing\nIf you are learning piano or keyboard, this app can help you identify the intervals between any pair of keys.  This is very useful for chords and scales recognition, and it can even benefit your improvisation. \n\n•  Music Transcription and Intonation\nThe ability to name and reproduce musical intervals, is also an important part of music transcription and musical intonation.\n\n\n\nTo help you acquire all the powerful skills mentioned above, the app provides the following features:\n\n•  Practice Mode\nYou learn at your own pace simply by answering the question, and if you are wrong, the correct answer will be shown for the duration of your choice.\n\n•  View Mode\nYou don’t need to do anything but watching, the questions and answers will be shown automatically after the delay of your choice. Good for lazy people like me. :)\n\n•  Game Mode\nIn this exciting countdown mode, you can challenge yourself and earn as many coins, medals, and trophies as you can. \n\n•  Search Mode\nThis mode allows you to look up the intervals you don’t know.\n\n•  Learning Range Customization\nYou can filter the intervals to learn by interval quality or number.  This is extremely useful when you want to focus on certain interval types or differentiate the similar ones such as Major Third and Minor Third.\n\n•  Question/Answer Approaches Customization\nYou can customize the question and answer approaches flexibly, which allows you to do Reversal Learning.  For example, to practice reading intervals, while you can answer the interval name based on the music notes you see, you can also do it reversely: answer the music notes based on the interval name you see.   This is an effective way to memorize.  \n\n•  Intelligent Questioning\nEach question is generated intelligently based on the statistical information of your performance for each interval, so yes, the app enjoys attacking your weaknesses, but to make you stronger! :)"

Now with Drum Kit Designer feature and detailed online tutorials.\n\nFeatured in Modern Drummer 'New and Notable' - July 2018  \n\n\"an invaluable aid not only for drummers but also studio engineers and producers\" - Sound on Sound Magazine\n\n\"I can’t recommend this app highly enough ... for the money, it is indispensable. It's simple, accurate, looks good, and the tuning information is worth the cost of the app alone.\" - www.mikedolbear.com\n\n“***** I never knew I could have this much fun tuning drums!” – Adamrod (App Store review)\n\n“***** Just tuned my first drum and this app is awesome!” – bburt85 (App Store review)\n\n“***** Buy this app if you are a drummer!!!” Lildrummerboy (App Store review)\n\nThe original and most innovative electronic drum tuning app - iDrumTune Pro brings unrivalled accuracy and features that have never been possible before for assisting with drum tuning. Built by world experts in drums and musical acoustics, and backed up by a detailed online training course on Drum Sound and Drum Tuning.\n\niDrumTune Pro includes the following features:\n\n* Pitch Tuning – to make your drums sing and allow you to play musical phrases around the kit\n\n* Lug Tuning – to ensure that the drumhead is evenly tuned and gives a smooth and warm tone\n\n* Resonant Head Tuning – to allow you to be sure that the two heads are working together and giving rich overtones\n\n* Spectrum Analyzer – so you can really start to understand what frequencies are excited and heard when playing the drums\n\n* Drum Kit Presets – so you can save and load your favourite tunings and share them with the world. Now also includes the interactive Drum Kit Designer feature.\n\n* The Science of Drum Tuning – and extensive manual on the science and art of drum tuning and getting the best out of iDrumTune Pro \n\niDrumTune is the first and by far the most intelligent and accurate system for analyzing drum sounds and assisting tuning – developed by drummers, music producers and acoustics research Professors. iDrumTune provides you with a measurement of the drumhead vibration frequency, much in the same way to an acoustic guitar tuner which measures the vibration frequency of a guitar string. In Pitch Tuning mode, you simply hold the iPhone over the center of a drum, about 2-4 inches away, and strike the drum in the center.\n\nThe iDrumTune readout shows the recorded sound waveform and gives the strongest frequency recorded. There is also a tuning indicator bar which shows the drumhead tuning relative to musical notes, so iDrumTune can be used to ensure that your drums are in key with each other or the song you are playing. A frequency spectrum view also allows more detailed analysis and helps with tuning the drum at the lug positions.\n\niDrumTune provides advanced tuning features including an intelligent filter function, Lug Tuning mode and Resonant Head Tuning mode. The filter allows unwanted frequencies to be ignored by the analysis algorithm, whilst Lug Tuning mode offers the simplest and most innovative method for tuning an even frequency response at the lug positions on the drumhead.\n\nThe Preset Manager allows you to save all your favourite drum tunings and call them up when you are in the middle of the process. Drum kits can also be exported and imported, so you can share your favorite tuning setups and load new ones in from other drummers.\n\nDrum Tuning isn’t easy, and drums don’t respond exactly the same way every time you hit them. For that reason, it's valuable to know a little about the science of drum tuning. iDrumTune includes a comprehensive text on the science of drums and drum tuning in order to help you get the best of iDrumTune and to become an expert drum tuner!\n\nWatch the iDrumTune tutorial videos and read reviews on iDrumTune at www.idrumtune.com"

      "label": "SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps. Studio Six Digital is dedicated to making the iPhone and Touch a professional audio and acoustics test device.\n\nCheck out our full line of professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the professional digital iPhone sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real-time analyzer,  FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the energy-time curve function, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time measurement, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for more great acoustical and audio test apps, have a look at AudioTools, our premier app for audio professionals."

There's also an additional sub-oscillator strapped into the master section for added oomph.\n\nThe internal controllers will bring in the dynamics: an LFO and an envelope, there's a recordable XY field & a sequencer. Use these to modulate any knob – a simple long tap will do.\n\nThe sound springs to life when it hits the filter section. Needless to say, analogue high-pass, low-pass and band-pass varieties are in place, along with a comb filter.\n\nStandards aside, the actual intention behind this project, the Vowel Filter, also became its outstanding feature: string together two or four vowel formants and play them back in a multitude of ways.\n\nOnce you’ve built your sound, there’s tons of sound polish in two chained multi-effect units.\n\nFeatures\n\n•\tSawtooth, Triple Saw, Pulse, Triple FM, Noise with tonal Filter, Sub Sine\n•\t5 Filters with 5 Modulators each\n•\tDuophone Arpeggiator\n•\tVowel Filter\n•\tTwo Effect Sections\n•      Audio Unit v3\n•\tAbleton Link Kit\n•\tMIDI Learn & Host Automation\n•\t300 groovy presets by various artists"

      "label": "The ELECTRIBE reborn in an even smaller form A full-fledged rhythm machine for iPhone\n\n● Featured in \"Best Music Apps\"\n● Featured in \"Best New Apps\"\n\nThis app’s intuitive operation allows anyone to easily create powerful beats on the ELECTRIBE series. The enormously popular ELECTRIBE-R instantly became a must-have item for track-makers around the world, and now it’s been reborn as an app for iPhone.\n\nWith this app, we’ve effectively “put the original hardware chassis into your iPhone,” by faithfully reproducing the sound engine and design of the ELECTRIBE-R. We’ve also included the latest preset patterns and many new functions that are currently featured on the “iELECTRIBE for iPad”, released in 2010. , taking a further evolutionary step in technology. Taking advantage of the ease of use that you expect on iPhone, we have maximized the intuitive nature of the ELECTRIBE to make this new product worthy of its name: the iELECTRIBE mkII.\n\nIt won’t take long for you to enjoy the ultimate experience of the Electribe series. This apps intuitive nature and familiar interface make it easy to create beats with an analog feel that’s like nothing else.\n\n● Amazing rhythm machine that generates powerful grooves\nWe’ve perfectly replicated the thick-sounding synth engine of the ELECTRIBE-R and its intuitive step sequencer. Now you can instantly obtain extreme tonal changes and powerful rhythms with just one touch\nNot only can iELECTRIBE for iPhone be easily enjoyed by anyone, but it also allows detailed beat-making that transcends iPhone specs. In addition to playing back the provided audio data, you can also freely synthesize sounds from a single waveform and combine those sounds into your own original beats. This allows for the true experience of music production that connects all musicians.\n\n● Three hundred built-in rhythm patterns that only this app can produce\nWith 64 of the latest preset patterns, 192 from the first-generation ELECTRIBE-R, and 32 template patterns for various genres, this app successfully draws out the full potential of the thick sounding analog beats. There are approximately 300 inimitable rhythm patterns that you’ll hear only from iELECTRIBE for iPhone. Electro, house, techno, drum'n'bass, dubstep, hip hop, techno pop, and IDM are some of the wide range of electronic music genres that are provided.\n\n● An ELECTRIBE that you can put in your pocket and take anywhere\nWhether you’re on the train or bus while commuting to school or to work, at a coffee shop, or in your bedroom, you can enjoy beat-making anywhere and anytime you like. Your completed beats can be transferred to your DAW software via the audio export function. You can also use the WIST function to play wirelessly with a friend using two devices simultaneously.\n\n● Powerful functions that bring infinite possibilities to your grooves\nWe’ve packed maximum potential into this machine with eight types of powerful master effects featured on the upper-level models of the ELECTRIBE. This includes the ring modulation function of the ELECTRIBE-R and the cross-modulation function of the ELECTRIBE-R mkII. This app allows you to switch back and forth to choose between the two. It also includes the BEAT FLUTTER function that uses a proprietary randomizer to create fresh rhythms and the motion sequence function that remembers your knob movements. In addition, you can use an external USB-MIDI device such as the nanoPAD or nanoKONTROL for performance and control. There’s also support for the latest iOS technologies such as Inter-App Audio, Audiobus, Virtual MIDI, and iCloud.\n\nMore info at korg.com"

Use the StereoEQ setting for that)\n+ Select from over 10 presets or save your own. You can even share them via email and import presets from other people via email.\n+ Full background support including remote control (from docks, headsets, car stereos)\n+ Visualize the music with the spectrum analyzer.\n+ Use AirPlay to listen on your AppleTV, or your Bluetooth headsets and even a dock. \n+ Use the pre-amp slider to adjust the overall boost or cut. Make sure to turn the slider down if you experience distortion. Use the auto-normalizer function to prevent clipping automatically and have the best dynamic range possible with your eq curve.

It allows you to stream and eq music from SoundCloud and your Dropbox account without the need for storage on your device.\n\nFrom the reviews:\n\nEXCELLENT PROGRAM\nI connect my iphone 4 to a car audio system, with the application the music began to sound incomparably better ....\nA little clear interface, but to understand it and understand need no more than 5-10 minutes. -- P_S_B_\n***\nLOVE IT\nThis is the EQ I have been looking for, and because of bad ratings I almost passed on it! I consider myself an aspiring audiophile and have the equipment -- Klipsch, Sunfire, Nottingham, Denon, Paradigim, etc. -- (and debt) to back it up. This EQ performs flawlessly and is very easy to use. It enhanced my music dramatically. Yes, dramatically! Just make sure you are running the recommended IOS, as the developer suggests. -- J. Paul DiMaggio\n***\n\n\nPLEASE if you have concerns or encounter problems with the app: post on http://www.audioforge.ca and we will explain how things work, until you can use all the features of the app to the fullest.

      "label": "Chord! is a chord and scale reference that works with any fretted instrument like guitar, basses, ukulele, banjos,… It computes and analyses all the possible fingerings for chords, scales, and arpeggios.\n\nWith Chord!, you can also write a song by simply dragging and dropping chords, transpose it in any key, compute the fingerings with any tuning and generate a beautiful print-ready PDF, etc.\n\nYou can also import your existing songs in text format (please note that the app does not ship with songs). You can also link audio tracks from your music library and play them at the same time while adjusting their pitch and/or speed.\n\nYou don't even have to know music theory to use it: behind its brute force, the app knows how to handle by itself some subtleties of music to give meaningful results.\n\nIf you don't have to be an advanced player to use the app, you can however take a look under the hood and tweak the parameters if you like! Whatever is your level or your instrument, Chord! will adapt and give you the most precise answer.\n\nYou can search for any chord, split (like D/F#), or not. If you're a beginner, you can choose the chord from a list, but you can also use the intelligent keyboard to enter the chord as it is written. If this keyboard is a great way to enter chords, it is also very useful to discover and understand how the chords are formed. You can also enter some notes on a neck to find which chords it can be. You can hear how each fingering sounds. Chord arpeggios are also supported, as well as drop voicings (drop 2, drop3, etc.).\n\nThe app also ships with the biggest list of named scales (and you can create your own scales). It analyses and presents them with nice interactive views (scale, score, and keyboard). Of course, it can also lay down these scales on a neck (with sound) and compute their fingerings. Like for chords, you can even search for a scale from its fingering!\n\nEach scale can be harmonized (decomposed into chords). You can also enter a sequence of chords to find which scale you can use to improvise onto.\n\nYou can use one of the hundred tunings that ship with the app, or you can add your own ones, for any instrument, with or without a capo, even with broken strings if you want!\n\nThe app uses custom and unique algorithms to generate charts, easily input complex harmonic structures, extract chords from fingerings, determine finger positions, compute keys of scales, generate chords from scales and find scales that go well with some chords.\n\nFor example, Chord! is the right tool in these situations:\n• You want to have your songbook available at any time, in your pocket;\n• You're a beginner and you want to know how to play easily a D/F# chord;\n• One gave you a ukulele and you want to know how to tune it and how to play the G Hawaiian scale;\n• You want to know on what scale you can improvise for some chord sequence (and the answer can be different than the Pentatonic minor!);\n• You want to print your song and share it with your band.\n• You want to experiment with this nice open tuning, moreover with a bottleneck;\n• Your little sister can't make bar chords and you want to show her how she can do without bars, with three (little) fingers only;\n• You want to impress your little sister by showing her how you can play the same chords with two bars!\n• You want to understand how this fingering for C13 is actually a fingering for C13;\n• You broke a string and want to know how to play some chords without;\n• You want to know how Django managed to play with two and a half fingers.\n\nThe app fully supports left-handed instruments.\n\nMain functions of the app:\n- Write, transpose, fingerize, print, and share songs;\n- Search chord fingerings (or chord charts);\n- Search chords from fingerings;\n- Search scale fingerings;\n- Search scales from fingerings;\n- Search chords from scale;\n- Search scales from chords."

      "label": "Simple banjo tuner to tune up your banjo. This is for a standard 5-string Banjo, in gDGBd tuning.\n\nTuning your banjo can be a difficult task for you if you are just beginning banjo. The good news is, the more you do it, the easier it becomes. A nicely tuned banjo can make your music sound a lot better and help you greatly while you're are just getting the hang of finger placement for notes.\n\nTouch the note for the string you want to tune and then turn the tuning pegs on your banjo and match it up with the note that is being played.\n\nNote: For those of you who are beginners and don't understand the tuning of a banjo. The banjo tuning is unique because the last string is actually higher in pitch then the rest of the strings. So for those of you who are wondering whats up with this tuner - it's normal.\n\nTip: Make several passes tuning each of the strings. For example you might have noticed that if you have tuned all the strings once, and then back to the first one you tuned, it might be off a little bit. This is because you are increasing or decreasing the tension on each of the strings as you tune it and the instrument's body might bend ever so slightly due to this difference in tension. This causes the other strings to slightly change in pitch. So make sure you keep on checking and tuning the strings until all are in tune, so make several passes.\n\nFor more information on how to tune Banjo visit:\nhttp://www.tuneinstrument.com/howto/tune/banjo.html\n\nAny questions using the App? Write support@tuneinstrument.com and we we'll get back to you promptly.\n\nIf you need to tune other instruments just simply have a look into our other applications: Cello Tuner Simple, Banjo Tuner Simple, Mandolin Tuner Simple, Double Bass Tuner Simple, 12-String Guitar Tuner Simple, Viola Tuner Simple, Guitar Tuner Simple, Ukulele Tuner Simple, Bass Tuner Simple, Dulcimer Tuner Simple, Dulcimer Tuner Simple Mixolydian, Dulcimer Tuner Ionian, Balalaika Tuner Simple.\n\nFollow us on Twitter: @tuneinstrument\nLike us on Facebook: facebook.com/tuneinstrument\nFollow us on Google+: tuneinstrument\nSubscribe to YouTube channel: www.youtube.com/tuneInstrument\nSign up for newsletter and or visit us: www.tuneinstrument.com"

You can synchronize your analog casio-tron drum machine to any USB compliant MIDI device or virtual MIDI port. Or you can use Ableton Link for its improved precision timing.\nThis particular version takes the analogue drum sounds from the then Casiotone keyboards more specifically this one form the vintage Casiotone MT-70 which although was more modern than the earlier models, it was still analogue as you will be able to tell from the sound which includes the slight noise and hiss as it ducks (this is a genuine replication).\nRemember those bossa-nova and samba beats? Well here they are! Relive the retro sound and those cheesy 80s rhythm beats.\n\nso connect to midi just press the new MIDI options button then detect your device and sync.\nYou can also trigger from MIDI key\nTo connect Ableton Link just enable it.

Note Rush teaches keyboard geography by making sure you're getting the note in the right octave every time.\n\nGreat for Home Practise\n-------------------------\nStudents will rush to their instrument at home every day with NoteRush, chasing stars and high scores! Unlike flash cards, children can drill note identification at home with no music-reading parent required to check if they're getting them correct - Note Rush checks for you! Play every day and you'll be great at reading piano music in no time.\n\nLevels\n-------\nNote Rush has fifteen built-in Levels, from Middle C-Position right through to the full grand staff with 2 ledger lines above and below. There are Levels for Treble Clef, Bass Clef or full Grand Staff! Or make your own levels to practise reading specific notes, with sharps and flats for an added challenge!\n\nBetter Than Flash Cards!\n-------------------------\nUse Note Rush instead of printed flash cards! Note Rush was designed to replace the cards used in One Minute Club - a challenge you can run in your studio where students have to complete a given level in under a minute. Give it a try!\n\n--\nNote Rush is made by Thomas Grayston, a software developer, pianist, and husband to a piano teacher."

Create a new Alarm.\n2. Choose either one song or create a playlist of songs to shuffle.\n3. Lock your screen, relax, and wake up on the right side of the bed!\n\nSupports playing the alarm Bluetooth devices connected to your iOS device.\n\nNotes\n• Click \"Developer Website\" below on this App Store page for the complete FAQ, or email me at iam@willsaid.com\n• A Free Spotify Account works! However, *you need a premium Spotify account to play the entire song in Spotify*\n• The Spotify Mobile App is not needed\n• Internet connectivity is required to find songs and \"set\" an alarm, but not needed when it goes off.\n• Alarms go off for one minute max, but you can always chain multiple alarms together if you are a heavy sleeper. Spotify's API currently only lets the app play 30 seconds of each song, although entire songs are coming soon.\n• As stated above, the app currently plays 30 second snippets of the best parts of songs, which should be more than enough to wake up.\n• Supports Snoozing, Days to Repeat, and the other features you'd expect from an alarm clock\n• The maker of this app is not attached to Spotify in any way. The app simply plays Spotify Content from Spotify's API.\n• Most but not all Spotify songs are currently available on the app. This is outside my control, and up to which artists approve third party app usage of their content. The selection size has improved since Version 1 and is continuing to do so. Artists not on the app include Bob Marley, Ariana Grande, and Frank Ocean. Please email me BEFORE downloading the app if there's a specific song you are looking for and I can quickly check. Email me at iam@willsaid.com and I will get back to you very quickly!"

      "label": "SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps. Studio Six Digital is dedicated to making the iPhone and Touch a professional audio and acoustics test device.\n\nCheck out our full line of professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the professional digital iPhone sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real-time analyzer,  FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the energy-time curve function, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time measurement, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for more great acoustical and audio test apps, have a look at AudioTools, our premier app for audio professionals."

Rhythm section follows you every chord you choose: pick up the style you prefer, adjust BPMs, mute other instrument, change different midi settings, change drums and play them with drum pads. Do arpeggios with different sounds and rhythmic fractions, create different sound environments with delay, reverb and rotation. Record your voice or everything else as a sample, adjust its length, reverse or loop it, make chords and melodies with it and explore other cool features on this 4th version. There's also a tutorial inside!\n\nThanks to everyone who helped me: Giacomo, Virginia, Mattia, Andrea, Giulia, Cristiano, and the others.\nThanks to the masters Suriani, Frankie and Calcutta.\n\nFor every question or suggestion don't hesitate to write to me"

This app is ideal for changing the playback speed or key for song transcriptions, instrumental training like piano, guitar, violine, flute, etc.\n\nReal-Time audio speed and pitch rate, overlap adjustment - An audio speed pitch shifting app designed for musicians & singers. You can easily change the speed and pitch of audio files on your iPhone/iPad device either independently or at the same time. Useful for practicing fast songs, or those that need different tunings.\n\n\nSimple controls and clear visuals make Up Tempo easy to use without compromising accuracy. Modify the frequency or tempo of your sound files by simply moving two sliders.\n\nIf you move the speed slider, your music will play in slow motion or faster. On the other hand, if you move the pitch slider, you will get a high-pitched or low-pitched audio.\n\nApply effects on your audio. By playing with the sliders, you can get a squirrel or evil voice. You can also export your adjusted song & share with friends or listening in another player.\n\nPerform Pitch Shift of Audio Input:\n----------------------------------\nA value smaller than zero means that the resulting key is lower than the original key (and vice-versa). A value of zero means that the key is not changed. One full step corresponds to one semitone. Decimals can be used for fine adjustments (for instance for non-western music styles). Example: a change of -12 semitones means that the song is played one octave lower.\n\nPlayback Speed:\n-----------------\nA value smaller than 1.0 means that the speed is reduced while a value greater than 1.0 means that the playback speed is increased. A value of 1.0 means that the speed is not changed.\n\nFeatures:\n- Alter the pitch- change song pitch up or down\n- Change the Pitch - change audio speed.\n- Support various formats of audio files.\n- Play instantly with real-time audio speed and pitch adjustment.\n- Export adjusted song in m4a format\n- Save settings for use another time.\n- Real-Time audio speed and pitch, rate, overlap adjustment\n- You can also save the adjusted audio file."

So let's get straight to what makes FAC Medusa a new versatile and characterful compressor!\n\nFAC Medusa combines different dynamic processors into a single and easy to use unit, the input signal flows along the following stages:\n\n1) \"Pre-amp with tone control and saturation circuit\" The input signal is split into three bands of frequencies (Low, Mid and High) according two adjustable crossover points. Setting the level and the saturation amount of each frequency band will definitely make the effect more natural or characterful.\n\n2) \"Compression\" In addition to the usual controls you may expect, FAC Medusa also provides two types of compression. Downward compression, which is obviously the most common, decreases the level of audio signal above the threshold. And also Upward compression which is less known, despite powerful, and increases the level of audio signal below the threshold. The compression can operate either on the SUM of the frequency bands (L+M+H) or on each frequency band coming from stage 1.\n\n3) \"Parallel compression and Brickwall limiter\" The master Brickwall limiter is optional and will ensure that the output of stage 2, possibly blended with the original audio signal, remain under control. The limiter comes with threshold and release time controls.\n\nAs you have realized FAC Medusa has many faces: gentle, natural, or aggressive and colorful. Choose the one you want and be prepared for an exciting sound design experience. Whether you are a budding music producer or passionate amateur musician in any genre, you will definitely find a happy use for it!\n\nThe documentation is available at fredantoncorvest.com/FAC_Medusa.html"

It is however possible to edit a single-track tablature with the NotePad tool and export your work into .gpx and .gp formats to finish your composition in Guitar Pro 6 or 7. Editing a drum track is not available with the NotePad tool."

A GPU-powered, fast and advanced integrated editor is part of TouchOSC on all platforms - create the most complex of control layouts with ease and precision.\n\nMIDI, OSC and more...\n\nTouchOSC supports sending and receiving any number of MIDI and OSC messages on many connections simultaneously. On top of OSC over UDP & TCP, we support every type of wired & wireless MIDI connection your device can offer, including MIDI over USB.\n\nCross-Network. Synchronized editing.\n\nMultiple instances of TouchOSC can be connected on the network for synchronized editing. Use the precision of your desktop's mouse and keyboard for fine-grained, detailed editing - test-drive and preview in real-time on all connected touch-screen devices at the same time.\n\nScripting and local messages.\n\nA lightweight and fast scripting engine allows deep access to all aspects of your controller and enables limitless customization and interactivity. For less complex tasks we've added local messages - simply wire up controls to transmit or display values; no need to break out the big (code) guns. Easy.\n\nThis is only the beginning...\n\nWe've supported and updated TouchOSC Mk1 for more than 10 years at this point and we're planning to do the same for this new version. We've already got a whole bunch of features cooking that were just not quite ready yet. There is so much more to come... \n\nWelcome to the next generation!"

      "label": "With SonoSequencr you can create individual sequences to perform recurring tasks with just one click.\n\nIf you have multiple Sonos devices and want to play a radio station on all of them, it takes some time to set this up. With SonoSequencr, all you have to do is open the app and tap your previously created sequence.\nYou can lock your iOS device or use another app while your sequence is running in the background.\nOf course, you can also start it from the widget, Apple Watch or using Flic Buttons.\n\nHere are some examples:\n- Group kitchen and dining room, set volume to 5, start a radio station and set a sleep timer to 2 hours\n- Switch your Playbar in the living room to the TV input, set the volume to 40, add dining room and set the equalizer settings for both devices to neutral\n- Disable the subwoofer and enable voice enhancement + night mode on the Playbar in the living room\n- Set the equalizer settings for all your devices to specific values\n- Disable touch on speaker and enable status light for all your devices\n- Set the volume of the kitchen and living room to the same value as in the dining room\n- Make an announcement with your individual text in the children's room\n- etc...\n\nEach of these examples, created once, requires only one tap in the widget or on your Apple Watch.\n\nSonoSequencr also includes a restricted mode. This allows you to restrict control to specific devices, among other things.\n\n\nUsing an optional in-app purchase, you can also start sequences at specific times or via external triggers like IFTTT. Of course, this requires that the iOS device is on the same network as your Sonos devices at the time. For intensive use of external triggers, it is recommended to run SonoSequencr in 'server mode'. In this mode, SonoSequencr is always running in the foreground on a dedicated iOS device. SonoSequencr still supports iOS9.\n\nThere are many more features like grid view, create dynamic alarms, HTTP requests, launch other apps, automatic battery charging in server mode, transfer sequences between devices, etc....\n\nYou can only use music (radio streams/tracks/albums) for your sequences that are stored in your Sonos Favorites (My Sonos) or in your TuneIn radio stations. You can't search your entire music library in this app. Just add your most used music to my Sonos then it can be used in your sequences.\n\nThe Timed Sequences feature is only available with an optional in-app purchase 'Premium'. With this automatically renewing subscription, up to 20 sequences can be run at freely configurable times. The function is only active as long as a valid subscription exists. The costs are billed via the iTunes account. The subscription will be renewed automatically within 24 hours before expiration (same time and costs), unless it is cancelled before in 'Settings' -> 'Manage Subscriptions' or in the iTunes settings.\n\nTo use this app you must have a working Sonos system. SonoSequencr supports Sonos software 1 and 2.\n\nFor terms and conditions and privacy policy see:\nhttps://celltekk.de/sonosequencr/help/privacy\n\nThis is not an official Sonos app."

Style of pendulum.\n\nMetronome Touch is created with one objective: to design a classic metronome with a unique style, so we combined a precise pendulum, perfected accuracy, and realistic interaction. Made of aluminum and glass, Metronome Touch proves a huge statement: It is as exclusive as your device. Launching Metronome Touch, your device will become a metronome.\n\nAnyone can try to make a metronome app, but success only comes when listening to customers. That's why Metronome Touch centers around functions that musicians are looking for: The ability to tap a beat, use customizable presets to save your favorite sets (bpm, time signature and accentuation), and multiple useful ways of adjusting the bpm. Metronome Touch even goes far beyond that: Neither analog nor digital metronomes can synchronize pendulums. But Metronome Touch can. This opens completely new ways when practicing, performing on stage or doing studio recordings.\n\nShould you be teaching students, they can follow your lesson more accurately while concentrating on their own devices synchronized with Metronome Touch. You will gain your student's attention when using this outstanding technology. If you have ever been on stage with bad acoustics, you will love Metronome Touch: It will provide every single band member with a perfect steady and synchronized rhythm on stage. Even when recording a song in separate soundproofed rooms, Metronome Touch keeps you in perfect sync.\n\nEasily adjust Metronome Touch to your likes and needs with the light or dark design - relying on absolute clear vector-based display graphics  - and many well chosen professional metronome sounds.\n\nMetronome Touch is constantly being developed further to ensure the highest customer satisfaction.\n\nFEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY\n\n• Precise engine \nA completely new developed engine makes this app one of the most precise pendulum metronomes available on the App Store. Highest accuracy is supported on all iOS devices.\n\n• Ableton Link synchronization technology\n Metronome Touch was the first metronome worldwide offering pendulum synchronization on iOS devices. You can keep band members‘ metronomes or a whole orchestra in sync.\nAbleton Link provides new ways of practicing together or in a group. \n\n • Memory function\n There is an infinite number of customizable presets to save your favorite sets of bpm, time signature and accentuation.\n\n • Numerical entry\nUsing bpm display let you directly enter tempo values from 20 up to 999 bpm.\n\n• Tap2bpm \nUse the tap field that will interpret your finger taps as bpm.\n\n• Beat count and accentuation\n Choose a beat count from 1 up to 12 beats and free customizable accentuation.\n\n• Styles and sounds\n Customize Metronome Touch to your likes and needs. Choose between dark and light design as well as chosen professional metronome sounds.\n\n• Retina display\n Metronome Touch comes with a complete set of vector graphics for all display sizes and looks simply perfect on your device.\n\nFor more informations, app videos, faq's and pictures go to » www.cu4uc.com"

      "label": "Chord! is a chord and scale reference that works with any fretted instrument like guitar, basses, ukulele, banjos,… It computes and analyses all the possible fingerings for chords, scales, and arpeggios.\n\nWith Chord!, you can also write a song by simply dragging and dropping chords, transpose it in any key, compute the fingerings with any tuning and generate a beautiful print-ready PDF, etc.\n\nYou can also import your existing songs in text format (please note that the app does not ship with songs). You can also link audio tracks from your music library and play them at the same time while adjusting their pitch and/or speed.\n\nYou don't even have to know music theory to use it: behind its brute force, the app knows how to handle by itself some subtleties of music to give meaningful results.\n\nIf you don't have to be an advanced player to use the app, you can however take a look under the hood and tweak the parameters if you like! Whatever is your level or your instrument, Chord! will adapt and give you the most precise answer.\n\nYou can search for any chord, split (like D/F#), or not. If you're a beginner, you can choose the chord from a list, but you can also use the intelligent keyboard to enter the chord as it is written. If this keyboard is a great way to enter chords, it is also very useful to discover and understand how the chords are formed. You can also enter some notes on a neck to find which chords it can be. You can hear how each fingering sounds. Chord arpeggios are also supported, as well as drop voicings (drop 2, drop3, etc.).\n\nThe app also ships with the biggest list of named scales (and you can create your own scales). It analyses and presents them with nice interactive views (scale, score, and keyboard). Of course, it can also lay down these scales on a neck (with sound) and compute their fingerings. Like for chords, you can even search for a scale from its fingering!\n\nEach scale can be harmonized (decomposed into chords). You can also enter a sequence of chords to find which scale you can use to improvise onto.\n\nYou can use one of the hundred tunings that ship with the app, or you can add your own ones, for any instrument, with or without a capo, even with broken strings if you want!\n\nThe app uses custom and unique algorithms to generate charts, easily input complex harmonic structures, extract chords from fingerings, determine finger positions, compute keys of scales, generate chords from scales and find scales that go well with some chords.\n\nFor example, Chord! is the right tool in these situations:\n• You want to have your songbook available at any time, in your pocket;\n• You're a beginner and you want to know how to play easily a D/F# chord;\n• One gave you a ukulele and you want to know how to tune it and how to play the G Hawaiian scale;\n• You want to know on what scale you can improvise for some chord sequence (and the answer can be different than the Pentatonic minor!);\n• You want to print your song and share it with your band.\n• You want to experiment with this nice open tuning, moreover with a bottleneck;\n• Your little sister can't make bar chords and you want to show her how she can do without bars, with three (little) fingers only;\n• You want to impress your little sister by showing her how you can play the same chords with two bars!\n• You want to understand how this fingering for C13 is actually a fingering for C13;\n• You broke a string and want to know how to play some chords without;\n• You want to know how Django managed to play with two and a half fingers.\n\nThe app fully supports left-handed instruments.\n\nMain functions of the app:\n- Write, transpose, fingerize, print, and share songs;\n- Search chord fingerings (or chord charts);\n- Search chords from fingerings;\n- Search scale fingerings;\n- Search scales from fingerings;\n- Search chords from scale;\n- Search scales from chords."

Among noisy bandmates, set a high Quality threshold so only strong dominant frequencies from your own instrument are reflected. Set a low Level threshold if your instrument output is low. Set both thresholds low for a crazy light show!\n\nKey Features \n\n• Unequaled tuning precision\n• Works with built-in microphone, external mic or direct connection to instrument\n• Octave detection, frequency and cents deviation read-outs\n• Audio pass-through - hear input via headphones or connected speaker\n• Adjustable pitch reference\n• Shortcut buttons to other Frozen Ape apps"

      "label": "A classic is reborn! With its introduction nearly a decade ago, Magellan pushed the boundaries of iOS technology and quickly took its place among the platform’s most popular synths. Continuing this pedigree, Yonac’s flagship Magellan Synthesizer 2 is a new alchemy of pristine sounds, innovative features, and devotion to user friendliness — all the same preserving the wicked soul of the original.\n\nCutting-edge synthesis technology, punchier tones, warmer filters, greater modulation options, AUv3, MPE, brand-new presets: these are just a few of Magellan’s features for a whole new era.\n\nSIGNAL GENERATORS\n\nMagellan’s beating heart is its three realtime virtual-analog oscillators: with their pulse width and blend parameters, the first two connect to a unique Timbre module to derive many additional waveforms. A special Oscillator Unison stage activates additional “secret” oscillators to supply up to 24 oscillators per voice — perfect for supersaws, or true chorus/flange effects obtained right at the synthesis stage. A fully configurable Maximizer module helps create even bigger stereophonic sounds by activating up to 120 simultaneous oscillators per voice. \n\nFM\n\nA powerful yet intuitive FM module gives life to Magellan’s unique hybrid design. With its very own ADSR and variable contour generator (with 3 different envelope shapes), it works as an additional sound source and transforms Magellan 2 into a very capable frequency modulation synthesizer. Combined with other oscillators and modulation features, it generates strong multi-layered textures impossible via subtractive synthesis alone.\n\nFILTERS\n\nTwo independent filter banks, 11 different filters, series/parallel selection with variable balance — these newfangled filters incorporate nonlinearities and analog-derived quirks that impart them hefty servings of aural “sugar”. The addition of “FAT” controls helps give added gravitas and harmonic content. Dedicated ADSRs (with extra long maxes) feature A/B/C contour generators for totally different playing characteristics.\n\nMODULATION\n\nTwin LFOs, modulation envelope, as well as direct control: the backbone of a powerful and versatile modulation system that can take 16 simultaneous targets, each with its own variable amount. In addition, each LFO/Envelope target can be assigned a secondary control (including via MIDI) to dynamically vary or even “piggyback” its modulating signal. The inbuilt XY-pad can hit any pair of 140 parameters for realtime control, while the “EZ Velocity” module helps quickly dial in the right touch for amplitude, filters & FM.\n\nSPAWN2\n\nSecond generation Yonac SPAWN unlocks the power of A.I. to help create countless original presets. Powered with an Expert mode, three different algorithms, and configurable machine autonomy down to module level, you can produce anything from subtle variations on a theme to wild new sounds with unrivaled “hit rate” — all at the touch of a button.\n\nAUv3, MIDI & MPE\n\nThe ultra-efficient synth engine and flexible user interface are specially designed so that you can run many Magellans simultaneously in your favorite AUv3 DAW or Mixer. Along with massively featured MIDI I/O (complete with MIDI learn/recall, program changes, et al.), Magellan 2 is also MPE compatible with full polyphonic pitch control. Aftertouch and even CC74 are assignable through the mod matrices — and the new onscreen MagTOUCH MPE controller provides voice-wise expression not only within Magellan, but to other MPE apps/devices and inside compatible DAWs as well.\n\n...AND MORE\n\nAnalog-inspired 32x4 step/pattern sequencer with gate, velocity and skip; ChordMaker with note matrix that maps one key into a chord; powerful, easy-to-use arp with live & program modes;  FX rack featuring 10 stereo units and configurable signal flow; 360+ factory presets, with a bank custom produced by Sunsine Audio; Ableton Link, YPAT3 preset management, patch translator, app recorder are just a few more of Magellan Synthesizer 2 features."

      "label": "Kauldron is our warmest sounding, punchiest synth yet! A completely new modeling technology, combined with carefully designed features help you create aggressive synth sounds full of rich analog textures with the fewest knob tweaks. The result is a pure, head-on tone that requires little or no FX or post-production to sound big.\n\nKauldron pushes every available iOS technology to the max: it is not only fully universal (you can run it natively on your iPad and iPhone), but also an Audio Unit plugin. In fact, it is one of the first fullscreen AUv3 plugins for iOS: with a compatible DAW, you can enjoy all the great Kauldron features on a nice, big spread.\n\nKauldron debuts the next generation of our Artificial Intelligence preset creation system, SPAWN². Completely reimagining the groundbreaking SPAWN algorithms in our hugely popular Magellan, the new SPAWN² gives you unprecedented control over generating presets. In the expert mode, you can accomplish anything from subtle ‘variations on a theme’ to bold new sounds. In the basic mode, where Kauldron does all the thinking, you get preset after usable preset with just a touch. This is not simple randomization: it is the power of machine learning put to benevolent use!\n\nKauldron is designed with modulation and fine dynamic control in mind. The two fully-featured LFOs and the mod envelope combine with a wide variety of MIDI learnable controls to manipulate multiple parameters. Everything is easily set up in a clearly laid out ‘mod matrix.’ The dual XY-pads can be used for controlling modulation or a wide range of synth parameters. MIDI aftertouch can be routed via the matrix for even greater control over expression and tonality.\n\nPowerful arp with both live & program modes; comprehensive MIDI features with effortless MIDI learn;  over 900 presets; recording, sharing, IAA, Audiobus 3, Ableton Link — these are just some of the features brewing inside Yonac’s Kauldron.\n\nSelected Specs\n\nSYNTH\n\n• 3 analog modeling oscillators w/ multiple waveforms & true PWM\n• FM via Osc 2\n• Maximizer module with drift, spread & voice count for huge, stereophonic all-synth sounds\n• New vAnalog filter design w/ ‘dirt’ overload for even warmer, harmonically complex tones\n• Dedicated filter ADSR envelope\n• Filter tracking, contour & more\n• Pink/white noise generator\n• Osc. phase reset & sync\n• Retro & modern glide algorithms\n• Virtual VCA envelope with 2 attack types\n• Poly/mono operation\n• Legato mode for buttery smooth passages\n• Extensive modulation options via the ‘mod matrix’\n• 2 LFOs w/ BPM sync, keytracking, trigger mode & more\n• Assignable mod envelope\n• 23 mod targets\n• 11 mod controllers, including aftertouch, velocity & keytracking\n• 2 XY-Pads for controlling mod targets or synth parameters\n• Arpeggiator with live & program modes, 11 algorithms, gate, swing, note value, octaving & more\n• Stereo mod effect with chorus & flanger modes\n• BPM-syncable stereo delay\n• Studio quality reverb w/ 7 room types, damping, time & mix\n• 900+ presets in a wide variety of styles & sounds\n\nSPAWN²\n\n• Automatic preset generation via artificial intelligence\n• Generate infinite new, usable presets at the touch of a button\n• Expert mode lets specify Variation & Autonomy for each major synth module\n• 3 unique A.I. algorithms\n• Auto arp programming in any listed scale\n\nPRO FEATURES\n\n• AUv3 - use as Audio Unit plugin on iPad & iPhone\n• Fullscreen AU mode in compatible DAWs & iOS versions\n• Extensive MIDI: MIDI learn, aftertouch, MIDI CC map save/share, KB mapping, program changes & more\n• Inter-App Audio\n• Audiobus 3\n• Ableton Link\n\nAPP\n\n• Universal\n• Powerful YPAT2 preset management system\n• Classic or ribbon key controller\n• Ribbon controller: Poly aftertouch into Kauldron\n• Ribbon controller: Settable musical key & scale\n• Classic KB: Velocity w/ sensitivity setting\n• Tapedeck: Record, loop & share\n• Metronome\n• Tap BPM\n\nSupported Systems\n\n• iOS 11 & newer"

      "label": "Hey, musician!\n\nHaving a strong internal clock is important anytime you’re in charge of the beat. Metronomes, with their perfect time, can help build that strength. But you and your bandmates don’t have perfect time. We’re human. We fluctuate.\n\nHumanome teaches you to hear an irregular tempo and adjust your playing to it, as you must always do to stay in the pocket with other non-metronomic human beings. \n\nHumanome sensitizes you to playing more responsively and accurately – more in the groove – with any external time source, whether it’s precise or not: a metronome, a click, a drummer, a band, a sequence, a track. \n\nHow it works:\n\nHumanome encourages listening. It trains you to react, moment by moment, to a fluctuating external time source. Humanome‘s varying click and limited session time enhances focus and engagement in ways a metronome doesn’t. Humanome stresses the importance of the phrase and allows for odd time signatures.\n\nEach Humanome session is randomly generated and unique. A session is around 3 minutes long and has three parts: an initial 2-phrase segment of straight time, followed by the main body of the session’s shifting tempos, followed by a 1-phrase ending segment of straight time.\n\n\n\nSetting up each session: \n\nSpeed is the Humanome’s initial tempo, from 1 to 5.\n\nIntensity is how frequently the tempo will change. \n\nBeats per measure indicates time signature. By default, Humanome accentuates the first beat of each measure. This can be disabled in More Settings.\n\nSelect INHUMANOME if you want to kick the Humanome into true madness from any Intensity setting. Tempo changes will be much more severe. This gives you four additional intensities. \n\n \n\nMore Settings:\n\nMeasures per phrase. Much of the world’s music comes in 4 or 8 bar phrases and that is Humanome’s default setting. You can change that here.\n\n*2 multiplies each Speed setting by two, from *1 to *5.\n\n \n\nRemember:\n\nIt’s not a metronome.\n\nIt’s a Humanome.\n\nGO!"

      "label": "iDrumTune Pro is the world’s most advanced, accurate and intelligent system for assisting and educating on drum tuning – used by thousands of drummers all over the world. Now with Drum Kit Designer feature and detailed online tutorials.\n\nFeatured in Modern Drummer 'New and Notable' - July 2018  \n\n\"an invaluable aid not only for drummers but also studio engineers and producers\" - Sound on Sound Magazine\n\n\"I can’t recommend this app highly enough ... for the money, it is indispensable. It's simple, accurate, looks good, and the tuning information is worth the cost of the app alone.\" - www.mikedolbear.com\n\n“***** I never knew I could have this much fun tuning drums!” – Adamrod (App Store review)\n\n“***** Just tuned my first drum and this app is awesome!” – bburt85 (App Store review)\n\n“***** Buy this app if you are a drummer!!!” Lildrummerboy (App Store review)\n\nThe original and most innovative electronic drum tuning app - iDrumTune Pro brings unrivalled accuracy and features that have never been possible before for assisting with drum tuning. Built by world experts in drums and musical acoustics, and backed up by a detailed online training course on Drum Sound and Drum Tuning.\n\niDrumTune Pro includes the following features:\n\n* Pitch Tuning – to make your drums sing and allow you to play musical phrases around the kit\n\n* Lug Tuning – to ensure that the drumhead is evenly tuned and gives a smooth and warm tone\n\n* Resonant Head Tuning – to allow you to be sure that the two heads are working together and giving rich overtones\n\n* Spectrum Analyzer – so you can really start to understand what frequencies are excited and heard when playing the drums\n\n* Drum Kit Presets – so you can save and load your favourite tunings and share them with the world. Now also includes the interactive Drum Kit Designer feature.\n\n* The Science of Drum Tuning – and extensive manual on the science and art of drum tuning and getting the best out of iDrumTune Pro \n\niDrumTune is the first and by far the most intelligent and accurate system for analyzing drum sounds and assisting tuning – developed by drummers, music producers and acoustics research Professors. iDrumTune provides you with a measurement of the drumhead vibration frequency, much in the same way to an acoustic guitar tuner which measures the vibration frequency of a guitar string. In Pitch Tuning mode, you simply hold the iPhone over the center of a drum, about 2-4 inches away, and strike the drum in the center.\n\nThe iDrumTune readout shows the recorded sound waveform and gives the strongest frequency recorded. There is also a tuning indicator bar which shows the drumhead tuning relative to musical notes, so iDrumTune can be used to ensure that your drums are in key with each other or the song you are playing. A frequency spectrum view also allows more detailed analysis and helps with tuning the drum at the lug positions.\n\niDrumTune provides advanced tuning features including an intelligent filter function, Lug Tuning mode and Resonant Head Tuning mode. The filter allows unwanted frequencies to be ignored by the analysis algorithm, whilst Lug Tuning mode offers the simplest and most innovative method for tuning an even frequency response at the lug positions on the drumhead.\n\nThe Preset Manager allows you to save all your favourite drum tunings and call them up when you are in the middle of the process. Drum kits can also be exported and imported, so you can share your favorite tuning setups and load new ones in from other drummers.\n\nDrum Tuning isn’t easy, and drums don’t respond exactly the same way every time you hit them. For that reason, it's valuable to know a little about the science of drum tuning. iDrumTune includes a comprehensive text on the science of drums and drum tuning in order to help you get the best of iDrumTune and to become an expert drum tuner!\n\nWatch the iDrumTune tutorial videos and read reviews on iDrumTune at www.idrumtune.com"

      "label": "Create music with Loopy HD by layering looped recordings of singing, beatboxing, or playing an instrument with a savvy, sophisticated, tactile looper that totally reinvents the formula. As seen on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\n\nhttps://loopyapp.com\n\n-- “This is the best loop station on the iPhone” -- Dub FX (dubfx.net) \n-- “I pretty much own every mobile looper out there and Loopy is HANDS DOWN the best. Super simple interface with powerful features.” -- J. Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support.

      "label": "Created by two of the world’s leading vocal trainers - Dr Gillyanne Kayes and Jeremy Fisher, both voice coaches on The Voice UK and authors of the bestselling book \"This Is A Voice\".\n\nThese are the top Vocal WarmUp techniques to help you exercise your voice and keep it in peak condition. With video tutorials, step-by-step vocal exercises and combinations for clear tone, tongue flexibility, excellent diction, releasing tension, and keeping your listeners interested.\n\nChoose a single 1-minute WarmUp just before an important meeting, or build and save your own warmup sequences to improve your voice and keep it in great condition every day.\n\nEvery week you’ll receive a brand new WarmUp of the week, created by Dr Gillyanne Kayes and Jeremy Fisher.\n\nEach 1-minute exercise comes with a video tutorial showing you exactly how to do each technique and why it works.\n\nThe exercises are divided into sections focusing on different techniques to make your voice clear, strong, open and interesting:\n\nBreath Control – do you run out of breath or feel your voice doesn’t have enough “support”? The exercises in this section will show you the MOST efficient way to get breath in and out of your body; how to EXTEND your breath for a consistent, confident sound; how to SUPPORT your voice to the end of every sentence\n\nReleasing Tension – Your body and throat can tighten up when you’re nervous or stressed, which is not ideal for public speaking, teaching, or even talking on the phone. The exercises in this section show you how to release tension in your jaw, lips and tongue; how to loosen the tightness you get in your neck, head and shoulders; and how to combat the fight/flight mechanism that closes your throat up when you get nervous.\n\nTongue Exercises – If your tongue is stiff, inflexible or backed up in your mouth people may have difficulty understanding you. These exercises give you the best techniques for stretching your tongue for easier voicing; releasing tongue root tension to give you a more resonant voice; and a complete tongue workout for gaining fine control (that takes less than a minute).\n\nClear Speech – It doesn’t matter what your accent is, if you don’t have good diction your listeners will struggle to understand you or miss what you have to say. These exercises show you the most efficient way to shape your vowels, whatever accent or dialect you’re using; how to really coordinate your jaw, lips and tongue for the clearest diction; and how to work your consonants without pushing for maximum clarity without volume or strain.\n\nInteresting Voice – You can have the best sound in the world but if you don’t use it properly you’ll lose your listeners’ interest. The techniques in this section show you exactly how to vary your pace to help your listener understand and process what you’re saying; how to find the right volume for the right situation; and how to extend and use your pitch range to keep your listeners interested.\n\nYour vocal muscles are some of the most important muscles in your body, helping you communicate your thoughts, ideas and beliefs to your friends, family and workmates. In a groundbreaking research project in the 1980s the scientist Albert Mehrabian discovered that whether your listeners liked you depended on three main things – your facial expression/body language, your actual words and the sound of your voice. The results indicated that an astonishing 38% was just on the sound of your voice (such as your vocal tone, pitch range and pace). It’s likely to be even higher if you’re talking on the phone or on video-conference. If you don’t want to lose a third of your impact at work, use this app to learn the most effective techniques for your voice and communication.\n\nOne Minute Voice Warmup is GDPR compliant and will not gather any of your personal data without first asking permission.

It also features a Tone Generator just like a pitch pipe with four different wave forms. \n\nWith advanced DSP (Digital Signal Processing) algorithm, it is highly accurate (±1/1000 semitone or ±0.1 cent precision). Rather than providing only one mode like other tuners, insTuner supports different tuning modes applicable to different situations, such as Instant Tuning Mode for quick tune and play, Fine and Strobe Modes for accurate tuning, FFT Mode for sound analysis etc. What's more, many advanced features are provided such as Concert A calibration, historical temperaments and transpositions, which make it more powerful than other tuners. \n\ninsTuner is well-designed and easy to use. It features a unique \"fixed\" note wheel, which helps you to find the position of detected pitch easily. You can also use it as an electronic pitch pipe to tune by ear, matching the generated tones. \n\nIt is suitable for tuning acoustic or electric guitar and bass, ukulele, mandolin, banjo, bouzouki, bowed strings, woodwinds, brass, timpani and more. In fact, almost any instrument that sustains a tone can be tuned using insTuner. It supports Built-in Microphone as well as Line-in and other audio interface such as Apogee One. Clip Microphone is supported too. \n\n\n=== FEATURES === \n* Universal App, purchase once, available on all of your iOS devices: iPhone/iPhone5/iPod/iPad. \n* Supported both Landscape and Portrait mode \n* Precise to ±1/1000 semitone (±0.1 cent) \n* Tuning Range from C0 to B8, covering the range of almost all of musical instruments \n* Instant Tuning Mode\n* Strobe Tuning Mode \n* Fine Tuning Mode with a highly responsive tuning meter for perfect tuning \n* Historical Curve Mode that shows tuning results over time\n* FFT Tuning Mode for frequency analysis with Log, Linear or Note Display options \n* Real-time Spectrogram Mode with Log, Linear, Note and Median Frequency Display options for real-time audio analysis \n* Well-designed \"Fixed\" note wheel display \n* Adjustable A4 (Concert A) calibration in 0.1 Hz increments \n* >30 historical temperaments \n* Customizable temperaments\n* 12 notations \n* Needle damping\n* Customizable transposition options for transposing instruments \n* Tone generator with four wave forms\n* Line-in and Built-in Microphone Modes\n* Customizable Input Channels\n* Supported Apogee One\n* Supported Inter-App Audio\n* Supported Audio Bus\n* Optimized for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus\n\n===About EUMLab=== \nWe make the best music Apps for you!

But as Apple likes to say, there's an app for that.\"\n—iMore\n\nMusic Info features a clean, modern design that’s simple and efficient to use. When you open the app, if a song is playing in the Music app, its info automatically appears and updates when the song changes. You can also browse your library to select a song and view its metadata. Or get a song’s info directly in the Music app from the share sheet — it’s Music’s missing Get Info button.\n\nMore features\n● Select a song using Music Recognition powered by Shazam\n● Use home screen quick actions to quickly select a song\n● Play the selected song in-app\n● Tap and hold text to copy information\n● Drag and drop artwork into other apps\n● Light and dark mode\n● Keyboard shortcuts\n● Split view multitasking and multiple windows on iPadOS\n● Full accessibility support including Dynamic Type, VoiceOver, and Voice Control\n\nHow it works\n● The Music app, like iTunes before it, saves metadata for each song you have in your library. Music Info reveals this information that otherwise isn’t accessible on iOS and iPadOS.\n● All songs in your library can be accessed in the Music Info app, no matter if they were added via Apple Music, purchased, matched, uploaded, or otherwise synced to your device. Songs in Apple Music that haven’t been added to your library cannot be accessed.\n● The share sheet action is available when sharing a song in the Music app. Note that only songs that are available on Apple Music can be shared. Music Info will try to look up that song in your library which may require an internet connection. It’s possible it may not be able to find the right song, for example, if you’ve renamed it. If that is the case, you can still use the app to access its information even without an internet connection.\n\nThings to note\n● Song metadata cannot be edited on iOS and iPadOS.\n● Music Info does not work with any third-party music services.\n\n* All available metadata:\n- Artwork\n- Title\n- Artist\n- Album\n- Album artist\n- Composer\n- Genre\n- Release date\n- Duration\n- Play count\n- Last played\n- Grouping\n- Track\n- Disc number\n- Compilation\n- Explicit\n- Rating\n- BPM\n- Skip count\n- Date added\n- Comments\n- Lyrics"

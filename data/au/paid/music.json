Between them they have warmed up the casts of many mega musicals including Jersey Boys, Wicked, The Book of Mormon, Frozen, Come From Away and Moulin Rouge. \n\nWarm Me Up! is specifically designed to be used by both the amateur and professional singer and can be used to warm up a soloist or larger group. It's a fantastic resource for singing teachers and choir directors who can warm up their ensemble away from the keyboard.\n\nIn the studio, backstage at the concert, in the corridors or in the car on the way to the audition, now you can warm up professionally... anywhere."

      "label": "Bebot is a musical instrument that anyone can play. Instead of a keyboard, it has an easy-to-use touch control system. And it's all built into a friendly animated robot, who performs your music while you play.\n\nAlthough it looks simple on the outside, inside is a powerful synth engine which lets you create and edit your own sounds and apply effects. The controls are easy to use, making it fun to tinker and experiment with sound. If you just want to get playing, there's also a wide selection of preset sounds.\n\nThe touch control system lets you lock in a scale so that you'll never play a wrong note, which makes it easy to play, even on your iPhone. It's polyphonic, which means you can use multiple fingers at once to play chords and harmonies. Plus, you can perform sweeping slides and expressive gestures that would be practically impossible on a regular keyboard.\n\nWhile it's designed to be simple and fun, that doesn't mean it's only for beginners. Bebot has been used both on stage and in the studio by accomplished musicians and performers including Dream Theater, How To Destroy Angels and The Flaming Lips.\n\nTo see and hear Bebot in action, check out the demo videos at normalware.com, including a walkthrough demo by keyboard wizard Jordan Rudess.\n\nNow with Audiobus and Inter-App Audio, you can connect Bebot to other apps such as GarageBand to record, multitrack and add effects, making Bebot more versatile and useful than ever.

      "label": "This app is a speaker polarity tester. Find out if your speakers are wired correctly (in phase or out of phase). Test your surround speakers, stereo speakers, PA speakers, in fact any speaker with wiring terminals on the back.\n\nThis speaker polarity tester was designed by the same people who built the Audio Toolbox, and the polarity tester in that unit was known as the most accurate and reliable polarity tester available. Now that technology is available in your iPhone. \n\nUse this app to test your home speakers, recording studio monitors, or as part of your professional contractor work. Speakers wired backwards are the most common error in sound system setup, cause big problems, and are easily corrected. This app will give you the answers, no matter how difficult the wiring may be to trace. \n\nSpeaker Pop works by watching for a proprietary \"pop\" sound from the speaker, and doing DSP analysis of the sound to determine if the speaker cone is moving in the correct direction.\n\nAs long as you use a standard 1/8\" stereo plug, you can use any normal 1/8\" to RCA adapter to get the signal into your system. You can also to record the \"pop\" test signal to a CD, DVD, or another iPod, and play this signal through your speakers. \n\nWorks with iAudioInterface and iTestMic.\n\nSelect the speaker type filter, Woofer, Midrange, or Tweeter. This selects either a 125Hz, 500-2000Hz, or 8000Hz filter, to make the readings more reliable.\n\nOnce you have the test signal coming out of the speaker, position your phone near the speaker (we suggest you flip it over to point the internal mic directly at the speaker -- the display will flip). In a few seconds you will get the reading on the screen, either a Plus or a Minus. Plus indicates correct speaker polarity, Minus means you need to swap the wires coming into the speaker.\n\nWe also have stereo and surround test signals available for download from our web site which are ready for burning to CD or DVD. See our web site or for more information. Note that iDVD will not burn encoded surround files, a more advanced DVD burning authoring program is required. Some folks have had success with Toast. We also sell test DVDs on our web site.\n\nSee our other audio apps: AudioTools, our premier audio and acoustics test and analysis app, SPL, the professional grade sound level meter for the iPhone, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real time analyzer, FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the Energy Time Curve app, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time analysis, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.

      "label": "SWAM Solo Brass has arrived on iOS! The incredibly powerful Physical Modeling technology is now MOBILE. Extreme Expressivity and Realism delivered in a package of only 46 MB\nThese instruments are NOT sample libraries. Unlike sampling, which uses recordings to replicate the sound of an instrument, physical modeling doesn’t generate a sound as such but creates the conditions for the system to create it according to an external input (like someone playing on a keyboard).\n\nWith our SWAM Trumpet for iOS, you now have the unique ability to express yourself with all the emotions  and subtleties of a natural string instrument sound as played by a real player, in any style — from classical to film scoring and even microtonal music.\n\nSWAM Trumpet for iOS can be used as a standalone instrument for playing in real-time, or as a plug-in for mobile music production. Play with your favorite external controller or directly from your iOS device through our intuitive interface.\n\nWith SWAM Trumpet for iOS you can:\n- Explore our collection of presets, create your own, or import them from your Desktop\n- Play in real-time using the standalone version of the app\n- Play with different instrument bodies\n- Play in a variety of styles like a real player\nControl the instrument’s expressivity in real-time directly through the touch control interface on your iPhone or iPad  including the exclusive virtual bowing touch surface!\n- Play and control the instrument’s expressivity in real-time using your favorite external controller (ROLI Seaboard, Akai EWI, breath controllers, regular keyboards, and more)\n- Use the included AUv3 plugin version to produce music with a mobile setup\n- Use the included AUv3 plugin version in combination with Camelot PRO for live performances\n- Adjust every aspect of the instrument’s sound (timbre, vibrato, amount of air, etc.) through an easy-to-use control panel\n- Micro-tune the instrument through the Pitch Manager (note: MAQAM device is supported with direct integration)\n- Add built-in effects such as Reverb, EQ, and Compressor\n- Have access to easy MIDI control configurations\n\nThe SWAM Trumpet for iOS is for you if:\n- You’re a wind controller player looking for a mobile setup to perform live without needing a computer while still having an incredible sound.\n- You’re a keyboard player and feeling frustrated by the limited expressive capabilities normal sample-based plugins give you.\n- You’re a music producer looking for a mobile setup to produce music from anywhere without having to carry around expensive gear.\n- You’re looking for a virtual instrument that allows you to express the full range of your musicality easily  on your iPhone or iPad.\n\nIMPORTANT: If you choose to play using an external controller, please note that a controller with the ability to continuously control the expression (like an expression pedal, breath controller, MPE device, wind controller, …) is REQUIRED. The same way real players need a bow to express themself on their instrument, SWAM Trumpet needs something to control its expressivity. SWAM instruments do not work with just note-on velocity."

      "label": "Visualize the fretboard, master scales and play through changes like a pro with intervallic functions! \n\n\n‣ Solo is a revolutionary practice tool designed by world renowned fusion guitarists Tom Quayle and David Beebee.\n\n‣ One of the biggest barriers to improvising on guitar is finding and mapping out the relevant chord tones and scales all over on the fretboard in real time.\n\n\nSolo is a highly focussed app for developing your note finding and visualization ability on the guitar. There is no time-based pressure and Solo reduces the cognitive load of having to choose which ‘notes/intervals’ to play. As you get quicker at finding these ‘notes’ you will conversely get better at choosing them whilst improvising. Players of all ability levels will reap huge benefits from practicing with Solo.\n\n\n‣ Using common progressions, Solo presents you with one chord symbol or scale at a time and asks you to find and play a series of notes based on their intervallic function.\n\n‣ Solo listens to the notes you play, analyzes them in real time, and doesn’t move on until you’ve correctly found each note by its intervallic function in the specified order.\n\n‣ This process builds strong fretboard visualization for the most powerful, efficient and malleable way to KNOW your way around the fretboard no matter how difficult the chord changes are. \n\n\nAs a unique and powerful ear training tool, Solo also develops your ability to not only visualize what you’re playing, but hear it in real time too.\n\nIf you know your note names but struggle to learn new scales, play through chord changes or find yourself stuck in pattern based playing, practicing diligently with Solo will be transformational for your knowledge of the fretboard and subsequently your ability to outline harmony when you improvise. \n\n\n‣ CHANGES PLAYING TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions over a series of chord changes based on common and popular chord progressions. Solo is programmed with all the knowledge behind the scenes to understand jazz and popular music harmony and will always pick appropriate intervallic functions based on the harmony of the progression. \n \n‣ SCALE TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions within scales on the fretboard. Solo includes all the modes of the Major, Melodic Minor, Harmonic Minor and Harmonic Major scales, plus pentatonic and symmetrical scales. Seeing and finding scale tones as intervallic functions will transform your ability to manipulate and improvise with scales in real time.    \n\n‣ TUTORIALS\nSolo also includes video tutorials to get you started with intervallic functions, how to find them on the fretboard, using Solo for ear training and how to get the most from your practice time with the app.\n\n\nNo registration or account required."

      "label": "iDrumTune Pro is the world’s most advanced, accurate and intelligent system for assisting and educating on drum tuning – used by thousands of drummers all over the world. Now with Drum Kit Designer feature and detailed online tutorials.\n\nFeatured in Modern Drummer 'New and Notable' - July 2018  \n\n\"an invaluable aid not only for drummers but also studio engineers and producers\" - Sound on Sound Magazine\n\n\"I can’t recommend this app highly enough ... for the money, it is indispensable. It's simple, accurate, looks good, and the tuning information is worth the cost of the app alone.\" - www.mikedolbear.com\n\n“***** I never knew I could have this much fun tuning drums!” – Adamrod (App Store review)\n\n“***** Just tuned my first drum and this app is awesome!” – bburt85 (App Store review)\n\n“***** Buy this app if you are a drummer!!!” Lildrummerboy (App Store review)\n\nThe original and most innovative electronic drum tuning app - iDrumTune Pro brings unrivalled accuracy and features that have never been possible before for assisting with drum tuning. Built by world experts in drums and musical acoustics, and backed up by a detailed online training course on Drum Sound and Drum Tuning.\n\niDrumTune Pro includes the following features:\n\n* Pitch Tuning – to make your drums sing and allow you to play musical phrases around the kit\n\n* Lug Tuning – to ensure that the drumhead is evenly tuned and gives a smooth and warm tone\n\n* Resonant Head Tuning – to allow you to be sure that the two heads are working together and giving rich overtones\n\n* Spectrum Analyzer – so you can really start to understand what frequencies are excited and heard when playing the drums\n\n* Drum Kit Presets – so you can save and load your favourite tunings and share them with the world. Now also includes the interactive Drum Kit Designer feature.\n\n* The Science of Drum Tuning – and extensive manual on the science and art of drum tuning and getting the best out of iDrumTune Pro \n\niDrumTune is the first and by far the most intelligent and accurate system for analyzing drum sounds and assisting tuning – developed by drummers, music producers and acoustics research Professors. iDrumTune provides you with a measurement of the drumhead vibration frequency, much in the same way to an acoustic guitar tuner which measures the vibration frequency of a guitar string. In Pitch Tuning mode, you simply hold the iPhone over the center of a drum, about 2-4 inches away, and strike the drum in the center.\n\nThe iDrumTune readout shows the recorded sound waveform and gives the strongest frequency recorded. There is also a tuning indicator bar which shows the drumhead tuning relative to musical notes, so iDrumTune can be used to ensure that your drums are in key with each other or the song you are playing. A frequency spectrum view also allows more detailed analysis and helps with tuning the drum at the lug positions.\n\niDrumTune provides advanced tuning features including an intelligent filter function, Lug Tuning mode and Resonant Head Tuning mode. The filter allows unwanted frequencies to be ignored by the analysis algorithm, whilst Lug Tuning mode offers the simplest and most innovative method for tuning an even frequency response at the lug positions on the drumhead.\n\nThe Preset Manager allows you to save all your favourite drum tunings and call them up when you are in the middle of the process. Drum kits can also be exported and imported, so you can share your favorite tuning setups and load new ones in from other drummers.\n\nDrum Tuning isn’t easy, and drums don’t respond exactly the same way every time you hit them. For that reason, it's valuable to know a little about the science of drum tuning. iDrumTune includes a comprehensive text on the science of drums and drum tuning in order to help you get the best of iDrumTune and to become an expert drum tuner!\n\nWatch the iDrumTune tutorial videos and read reviews on iDrumTune at www.idrumtune.com"

      "label": "Way more than a metronome, the Time Trainer adds five training tools to help you develop your own internal sense of time!\n\nThis is an accurate and stable metronome (many metronome apps out there are not) and features:\n• tap tempo (to work out tempos by tapping a button),\n• countdown timer (for keeping your practice to schedule!)\n• many different sounds (you like cowbell, wood or xylophone?)\n• accent control (for odd time playing)\n• visual metronome movement with a flash on the beat\n• vibrate option (on each beat or just accent)\n\n...but then we add to that with five training tools which will really help you develop your own time feel - essential for all musicians!\n\n• Bar Breaks • will mute the metronome for a bar or more forcing you to keep your time solid and be perfectly synchronized when the clicks return! This is a superb exercise and will really help develop confidence in holding your tempo. You can adjust how many bars are solid at the start then how many bars are solid and how many bars are muted which will cycle for the duration of the session. You can also select \"random\" mode and a % of bars (that you set) that will be dropped for an even more challenging practice session!\n\n• Random Beat Drop • does exactly what it says on the tin... some of the beats (clicks) will be muted at random, forcing you to be confident with your time and not rely on the click too much. Many people chase the beat or try and anticipate it, and this exercise will help you stop those bad habits! I've personally found that the \"gradual\" setting is most useful, a five minute session starting at 100% with more and more beats muted up to the % that you set.\n\n• Speed Up • is a tool I have wanted for years for my own practice so now I made one. Often when working on scales, arpeggios or licks you want to start at an easy speed where you are playing it 100% correctly and gradually push your technique by playing it faster and faster. With this tool you set a start tempo, end tempo and duration of you practice session and off you go, no more stopping to bump the bpm up a few notches every minute!\n\n• Step Upper • Many people requested that we make a programmable mode, most likely to be used to be able to move from one consistent tempo to another, rather than the gradual increase you get in the Speed Upper. You can program a tempo for X number of bars OR minutes :)\n\n• Subdivisions • Another heavily requested feature was to add in subdivisions for those that need to hear them, and for super slow tempo's where having subdivisions can be really helpful!\n\nI'm sure you will find all of the tools very useful, and of course you will find full support on the justinguitar community forum - please take the time to rate and review it, good things will help promote it and anything negative will help me improve it!\n\nWishing you many happy hours of practice :) Justin"

      "label": "Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers are pleased to announce Bloom: 10 Worlds – a developed, augmented and expanded new edition of 2008’s game-changing original Bloom app, which explored uncharted territory in the realm of applications and was dubbed “The First Great iPhone App” by Gizmodo.\n\nRequiring no musical or technical ability, the egalitarian and user-friendly Bloom app enabled anyone of any age to create music, simply by touching the screen. Part instrument, part composition and part artwork, Bloom’s innovative controls allowed users to create elaborate patterns and unique melodies by simply tapping the screen. A generative music player took over when Bloom was left idle, creating an infinite selection of compositions and their accompanying visualisations.\n\nBloom: 10 Worlds is a reimagining of the original – not simply a remaster. If the original Bloom was a single, then this would be an album. The widely broadened palette of sounds and images can be experienced via 10 new ‘worlds’, each exploring a new direction for Bloom. The first world the user encounters is an echo of the original app, with circles appearing where the user taps. Each subsequent world unlocks automatically, introducing new combinations of sounds, shapes, colours and rules of behaviour.\n\n\nPraise for the original Bloom\n\n“The very first iPhone apps were universally dull. And then Bloom came out. It was immediately obvious that something special was happening. The app was interesting on an artistic level – one that made you reconsider the relationship between technology and music. It raised the bar for musical iPhone apps.” Gizmodo\n\n“Hypnotic and ludicrously addictive.” The Guardian\n\n“A relaxing alternative to just about anything else you can do with an iPhone.” Wired\n\nEno began collaborating with musician / software designer Peter Chilvers on Will Wright’s computer game Spore. Their shared interest in generative music rapidly lead to the development of a prototype for Bloom in 2008. In the intervening decade, they experimented further with the field, expanding their catalogue of apps with Trope, Scape and Reflection. In that time Chilvers has also acted as an engineer and technical advisor to Eno on a number of other projects. A series of multi-speaker installations around the world laid the groundwork for 2016’s The Ship, and they premiered Bloom: Open Space, a mixed reality installation in Amsterdam in 2018.\n\nIn addition to his work with Eno, Chilvers co-founded the Burning Shed label and online store, toured with Underworld’s Karl Hyde as keyboardist and musical director, and has recorded instrumental albums and collaborations with vocalist Tim Bowness."

This is a full featured complete SDA eHymnal lyrics that are ultra sharp and clear. Contains all of the 695 hymns from the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal® plus many more from the \"old\" hymnal and other choruses. Also has all of the responsive readings. No internet connection is needed to use this hymnal after installation. \n\nThe user interface has a clean look with no ads, and very easy to use. You can quickly and easily find the hymn that you want either by selecting from the alphabetical index of hymn titles and first lines, the numerical index of hymn numbers based on the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal®, or your own bookmark list. There is a full featured bookmark list for you to add songs that you need for quick access. Use the search feature to quickly search for words in the title or first line, or just enter a hymn number to jump directly to that hymn. You can also swipe left or right to go to the next or previous song just like turning pages in the printed hymnal. But what is even better is that the swipe turning sequence can either be in numerical hymn number order, alphabetical hymn title order, or bookmark list order. Zoom in for larger texts both in portrait or landscape orientations. \n\nGod has given me two talents-music and computer. I have been a church pianist and organist for several decades, and professionally, I am a computer professor. So putting these two talents together, I have personally written this app to be a blessing to others. I hope that you will like it and be blessed by it. I would love to hear from you to tell me how I can improve this app. \n\nThis app is neither endorsed by nor affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church®. \n\nPlease email support@mygadgets2.com if you have any problems whatsoever in using this app."

It features:\n\n• tanpura (x6)\n• tabla\n• swarmandal\n• harmonium\n• manjeera (x3)\n\nall fully customisable in practice sessions that can then be loaded on demand.

Possible combinations are thus nothing short of endless!\n\nAlong with accompaniment, iShala now also corrects your pitch*! Sing/play freely or over a harmonium melody and iShala will highlight any discrepancy from the correct note. This is an incredible tool to improve your pitch accuracy.\n\niShala has a pay once, use forever policy. A Premium* In-App purchase option gives you additional functionality under the same terms.\n\n* Included with PREMIUM option (In-App Purchase):\n\n• 4 additional tanpuras\n• a low pitch tabla\n• 3 additional manjeeras\n• pitch detection to make sure you sing/play on the right note\n• autotune session by pitch recognition\n\nSome sweet words from our users:\n\n\"Best tanpura app. Concert like.

It can even stream to a PC running Windows Media Player.\n\nIf you've heard all the hype about AirPlay and are missing out because you don't have an AppleTV, this app is for you!\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ HOW TO USE ◆◆◆◆◆\n\n√ Connect your iPod, iPhone or iPad to the same local network as your Xbox, PS3, PS4 or PC.\n\n√ Start AirMusic.\n\n√ For Xbox 360, navigate to the Xbox System Music Player and select your device from the list.\n\n√ For Xbox One, navigate to the Xbox One Media Player under Apps and select your device in the list.\n\n√ For PS3, navigate to the PS3 Music Menu and select your device in the list. If it shows nothing underneath, it probably means you selected the Movie or Photo menu instead.\n\n√ For PS4, locate the Media Player in the Store.\n\n√ When AirMusic detects a Chromecast device, an icon will appear in the AirMusic navigation bar. Tap on it to connect then select the music you want to stream.\n\n√ For a PC running Windows, start Windows Media Player, your iPhone Music will show under 'Other Libraries'.\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ IMPORTANT ◆◆◆◆◆\n\n• AirMusic is not compatible with Apple Music.\n\n• AirMusic is compatible with iCloud as long as songs have been downloaded onto your phone. Tap the little cloud download icon next to each song or album in the Music app to download them.\n\n• If AirMusic is not detecting all songs, try toggling Sync Library under iOS Settings > Music.\n\n• AirMusic requires an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch with a minimum of 50MB of disk space to work effectively. \n\n• AirMusic is not compatible with old DRM songs purchased on iTunes. Newer iTunes DRM free purchases are compatible.\n\n• When using Chromecast, you can choose and change the music directly from within AirMusic. For all other devices, you do it from these devices (ie Xbox, PS3, PC).\n\nIf you are experiencing any other issues, please contact us at airmusic@plutinosoft.com.

Using the buffer effects you can specify the probability of randomly triggering slicer or stutter effects for an extra seasoning of chaos and mayhem.\n\nNote: to use the multi-out effect, this AUv3 plugin requires an AU host which supports multiple outputs. If the host does not support multi-out, only the first channel will work.\n\nAlso note that due to the multi-out nature of the plugin there is no meaningful standalone functionality. You will need a plugin host to make use of this plugin."

Works very well with its proper designed-in control selections.\" - Roblake \n\nSpectrum Analyzer for iOS is a powerful real-time audio analysis app. Designed with musicians and recording engineers in mind, it can also be used by anyone interested in the world of sound. Ideal for room tuning or speaker tuning, the app enables portable, precision audio measurement and visualization. \n\nFeature Highlights: \n● Octave Band Real Time Analyzer \n● FFT Plot (Fast Fourier Transform) \n● Spectrograph module \n● Test Tone and White/Pink Noise Generator \n● Native iPhone X graphics\n\n>>> Check out the demo videos at SpectrumAnalyzerApp.com \n\nAudio input may be acquired via the built-in microphone or an external measurement microphone. For best results we recommend using a calibrated measurement microphone connected via USB audio interface or iPhone dock connector. This allows for high precision and flat frequency response, as well as for stereo input.\n\nAudio credits:\n\"Basement Floor\" and \"Enchanted Journey\" by Kevin MacLeod\n\"Evening Birdsong\" and \"Cuckoo\" by Benboncan"

A GPU-powered, fast and advanced integrated editor is part of TouchOSC on all platforms - create the most complex of control layouts with ease and precision.\n\nMIDI, OSC and more...\n\nTouchOSC supports sending and receiving any number of MIDI and OSC messages on many connections simultaneously. On top of OSC over UDP & TCP, we support every type of wired & wireless MIDI connection your device can offer, including MIDI over USB.\n\nCross-Network. Synchronized editing.\n\nMultiple instances of TouchOSC can be connected on the network for synchronized editing. Use the precision of your desktop's mouse and keyboard for fine-grained, detailed editing - test-drive and preview in real-time on all connected touch-screen devices at the same time.\n\nScripting and local messages.\n\nA lightweight and fast scripting engine allows deep access to all aspects of your controller and enables limitless customization and interactivity. For less complex tasks we've added local messages - simply wire up controls to transmit or display values; no need to break out the big (code) guns. Easy.\n\nThis is only the beginning...\n\nWe've supported and updated TouchOSC Mk1 for more than 10 years at this point and we're planning to do the same for this new version. We've already got a whole bunch of features cooking that were just not quite ready yet. There is so much more to come... \n\nWelcome to the next generation!"

      "label": "Note reading made fun! Note Rush is a game for practising note reading on the music staff to help you learn to play the piano, keyboard, flute, saxophone, violin... you name it! Note Rush shows you one note at a time in random order then uses the microphone to listen as you play through them like you would with note reading flash cards, only these flash cards check that you're playing the right note! \n\nPlay with a bunch of fun themes and race to earn stars and beat your best time! Note Rush is great for teaching keyboard geography by making sure each note is played in the correct octave. An indispensable music theory must-have for learning sight reading at all levels of music education.\n\n\"Great app for learning notes!\" - App Store Review.\n\n\"So much better than flash cards! My son loves using this app and his note reading has improved tremendously since starting. I'm thankful he can do this on his own and it keeps track of his high scores which is highly motivating for him.\" - App Store Review.\n\n\"A blockbuster hit with teachers and students... I especially like using it at group lessons.\" - Leila Viss, 88pianokeys.me \n\n\"Note Rush has quickly become my favorite app for piano teaching.\" - Joy Morin, colorinmypiano.com\n\n\"Note Rush is a motivating app that engages students to improve quickly with their note reading skills. It is definitely one of my top favorites and will be used often!\" - Jennifer Foxx, musiceducatorresources.com\n\n\"Note Rush is a great way to review notes for the One Minute Club.\" - Susan Paradis, susanparadis.com\n\n*** Having trouble? See noterushapp.com/troubleshooting for help. ***\n\nListens to Your Instrument\n------------------------------\nNote Rush helps students learn a strong association between notes on the page and keys on your instrument by using your device's microphone to detect when you play each note. Works with pianos, keyboards, flutes, violins, you name it! (See Q&A below for more about supported instruments.)\n\nStudent-paced\n------------------\nNote Rush goes as fast or as slow as the student, with no time limits, so is suitable for complete beginners right through to being a fun challenge even for teachers!\n\nGrand Staff Context\n-----------------------\nThe whole grand staff is always visible, showing each note in full context and helping students improve their note recognition across the two staves.\n\nOctave-Sensitive Keyboard Geography\n---------------------------------------------\nIt's a \"B\", but which \"B\"?? Note Rush teaches keyboard geography by making sure you're getting the note in the right octave every time.\n\nGreat for Home Practise\n-------------------------\nStudents will rush to their instrument at home every day with NoteRush, chasing stars and high scores! Unlike flash cards, children can drill note identification at home with no music-reading parent required to check if they're getting them correct - Note Rush checks for you! Play every day and you'll be great at reading piano music in no time.\n\nLevels\n-------\nNote Rush has fifteen built-in Levels, from Middle C-Position right through to the full grand staff with 2 ledger lines above and below. There are Levels for Treble Clef, Bass Clef or full Grand Staff! Or make your own levels to practise reading specific notes, with sharps and flats for an added challenge!\n\nBetter Than Flash Cards!\n-------------------------\nUse Note Rush instead of printed flash cards! Note Rush was designed to replace the cards used in One Minute Club - a challenge you can run in your studio where students have to complete a given level in under a minute. Give it a try!\n\n--\nNote Rush is made by Thomas Grayston, a software developer, pianist, and husband to a piano teacher."

You can record up to 6 seconds via microphone or copy samples via iTunes.\n\n\nShare\n\nWith nanoloop for iPhone, you can send your saved projects to other nanoloop users and your own PC via e-mail. If nanoloop is installed on the recipient's iPhone / iPod, she/he can simply tap on the file name in the received e-mail to start nanoloop and import the attached file so that it is available for editing. This makes collaboration very easy, multiple users around the world can work on the same project by simply e-mailing the file.\n\n\nExport\n\nSongs can be exported to a WAV file that is accessible via iTunes (simply drag & drop files in finder). The exported file is also copied to the clipboard so that it can be pasted in other apps that support pasting audio.

      "label": "Sharpen your sense of time! liveBPM is the tempo monitoring tool for drummers, bands and DJs. It detects music and beats via the microphone and continuously displays the current tempo in beats per minute (BPM). It is easy to use and delivers high-quality results while being energy efficient.\n\n\n=== What users said about liveBPM ===\n\n\nJohn Walden, freelance musician and music technology journalist at musicappblog.com:\n\"There are three obvious applications for the app. First, it would make a brilliant practice tool for a drummer, allowing them to monitor just how good they are at keeping a steady tempo without the aid of a click track to guide them. Second, sat beside your kit during a performance, it would allow you to judge just how well you are hitting the ideal tempo for each song in your set. It’s not just drummers that can benefit for liveBPM as the third use is in mapping the tempo – and any tempo changes – in commercial recordings. While this is useful for drummers, it is instructional for almost any musician.\" \n\n\nJonLong:\n\"I used this at my last band practice and wasn't expecting it to work. I couldn't believe how quickly and accurately it started tracking the bpm, even despite the very loud volume of our music.\"\n\n\nPocketDrummer82:\n\"I am a professional drummer and I have been looking for something like this for years! Unless your playing with backing tracks or recording, Playing with a Click is too Mechanical. This app allows the tempo to breathe, and its like a little angel on your shoulder telling you the band is speeding up or slowing down. It is totally worth the money.\"\n\n\nChris Walther:\n\"I have used this about five gigs now and have quit using my previous tempo meter. I used both for a few gigs to test the accuracy. Dead on. Thanks! Every drummer should use this.\"\n\n\nmagrec:\n\"This has been very helpful for recording. thanks!\"\n\n\n\n\n=== Detailed Description ===\n\n\nThis is a tool designed for professional use:\n- Well-tested beat detection engine guarantees trustworthiness\n- Can handle most genres\n- Produces results accurate to within 0.1 BPM under the following conditions:\n-- The tempo is constant or almost constant\n-- Strong impulses are defining the beat (drums, accentuated rhythm instruments like bass/guitar, etc.)\n\n\nFurther features:\n- Tempo curve shows the development of tempo over time \n- Multiple zoom modes to show last 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20 or 30 minutes\n- Advanced audio spectrum analysis via FFT\n- More accessible and usually more accurate than BPM counters that function through tapping\n- Low battery drain thanks to high performance code and efficient algorithms\n\n\nUsing it as a musician:\n- Use it as an objective tempo reference like a metronome\n- It actually has several advantages over a metronome:\n-- You are not tied to a click, giving you more flexibility\n-- Helps you use tempo changes to enhance your musical expression\n-- With blind tests, it can massively improve your timing confidence, which is especially important if you are in a tempo leading role (e.g. drummer)\n- Discover how/whether your favorite artists use tempo changes\n- Measure and improve your time-keeping skills\n- Identify slowdowns and speedups while practicing your instrument\n- Always be in control of the tempo during your live gigs and rehearsals\n\n\nControls:\n- Power Button: For freezing the tempo curve and minimizing battery drain\n- Clear Button: Clears the tempo curve\n- Slider: Adjusts the target tempo range (i.e. 80-160 BPM)\n- Zoom Buttons: Switch between zoom modes for the tempo curve. (2-30 minutes)\n\n\nNote: \n- You can check and improve the detection by clapping loud to the beat. Also, results can be improved by plugging in a suitable external microphone.\n- You can support my work by rating it on the App Store.

Super simple interface with powerful features.” -- J. Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support.

      "label": "Guitar Player Magazine says: \"This ingenious super metronome was developed by funky-as-hell Sco sideman Avi Bortnick. It will leave out beats randomly to force you to strengthen your own inner time-keeping muscles, and it has other cool features for odd meters, drum machine-style patterns, and more... this is an awesome learning, grooving, solidifying tool.\"\n\nStrengthen your inner sense of rhythm! Time Guru is the only metronome with the ability to mute its sound at random, in sequenced patterns, or both, so that you can assess whether you tend to rush or drag or loose your place with odd meters. Time Guru can periodically leave you on your own so that you strengthen your own internal sense of time, rather than relying on the constant, rigid, external time keeping of a metronome. It's like training wheels that sometimes come up off the ground.\n\nTime Guru also features:  \n-the ability to play in different time signatures or sequences of time signatures\n-create rhythmic drum-machine like patterns\n-save presets for tempo, meter, sound and muting-\n-35 loud sound sets; \n-Human or robot voice counting in English, Chinese, French, German or Russian - great for teaching!\n-tap tempo (5 to 300 BPM range)\n-super accurate, rock-solid timing via a customized audio engine. \n\nAnd of course it can function as a normal metronome. \n\nNoTreble.com says: \"I love the aesthetic and layout of Time Guru. It’s very simple and elegant. Time Guru also offers ability to set randomness of your subdivisions (great for testing your internal clock)….There is one thing that Time Guru does that I absolutely love, and for which, this app will always live on my iPhone – at the top of the screen, you will see a series of numbers (1-7). When you press a number, it is set first in a sequence and you can choose a subdivision that will then repeat that number of times (or set it to rest that number of times). Sound confusing? It isn’t, because the layout is so simple. Every time you press a new number, it is set next in the sequence and you choose your continue to choose your subdivisions.\""

      "label": "See music from a new perspective with Rhythm Necklace, the playful yet powerful tool for improvisation and composition. Tap, flip and rotate simple shapes to explore complex polyrhythms. Gestural control of beat distribution algorithms allows for the step-by-step generation of rhythmic shapes. Layer intricate beats in a matter of minutes, then save them for later or export to MIDI.\n\n- Build rhythms on up to four necklaces.\n- Adjust the length of each individual cycle to quickly create complex rhythmic ratios\n- Use a collection of rhythm building algorithms and geometric transformations to create and morph your rhythm.\n-Tap your tempo, use a slider for transitions, or manually type the global speed of your song\n- Choose from a variety of pitched sounds and percussive sample sets.\n- Quickly modulate between notes in four musical modes (pentatonic, major, minor, chromatic) and five octaves.\n- Customize the attack and panning of sounds to suit your composition\n- Save your sessions and export them as midi. \n- E-mail copies of midi sessions to yourself. These can be opened and edited on most DAWs.\n- Midi in/out allows you to fully customize your sounds and record your compositions in real time within an external DAW environment.\n\nThe term ‘rhythm necklace’ is used in music to refer to circular representations of repeating patterns. By thinking about rhythms as shapes rather than a linear timeline, it’s easier to see geometric properties that make them enjoyable, such as evenness and symmetry. Often, even subtle changes to the visual interface can completely transform how a rhythm sounds. Rhythm Necklace is a tool for both advanced and novice musicians alike, as well as anyone who wants to think about rhythms in a new way."

The interface includes many standard oscilloscope controls, such as: triggering, time and voltage per division, signal measurement cursors, and more.\n\nThe app incorporates a signal (function) generator capable of generating sine, square, triangle, and sawtooth waveforms of up to 22 KHz. Calibration to an external reference signal is supported, guaranteeing the accuracy of measurements. \n\nInput can be acquired via the built-in microphone or an external mic/probe connected to the headset connector. For best results, use an external audio interface connected to your device dock. This allows for standard audio equipment to be connected, as well as for dual channel input. Oscilloscope probes also be connected (using a BNC connector). When feeding external signals via probes, you should take care not to exceed 1V AC voltage. Currently iDevices support only AC input. \n\nFor up-to-date information on feeding signals and currently supported audio interfaces, please visit http://oa.onyx3.com\n \n\nFeature Highlights: \n● Real-time waveform display (60 FPS) \n● Triggering modes: Normal, Auto, Single \n● Set trigger level and pre-trigger time \n● Dual channel signal generator \n● Reference signal calibration \n● Pause function to get a screen capture \n● Export traces as text file for further analysis\n● Measure signal data using cursors \n● Use \"finger pinch\" on screen to set voltage and time base \n● Double tap screen to enter Black Panel mode \n● Three color themes to choose from \n● XY mode for viewing Lissajous figures \n● Frequency range 20Hz-22KHz \n● iPhone X ready"

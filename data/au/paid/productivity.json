For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

      "label": "Shift Worker is designed for people who need a quick and easy way to enter and view their shifts.\n\nA traditional calendar is not always ideal for shift workers. Sometimes it's not easy to see your upcoming shift schedule very clearly, especially if your shifts don't fall into the traditional working week. Shift Worker solves this problem and turns the frustrating task of entry into a quick and easy experience.\n\nShift Worker allows you to create your own types of shifts by combining visually-attractive icons with letters/numbers so that they can be easily identified at a glance. By including a range of icons (such as suns and stars for day and night shifts) in a variety of colors, any combination is possible for all types of shifts.\n\nEntering shifts can be done quickly by simply selecting a type of shift and tapping on each date it occurs. An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!\n\nIn addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. \n\nShift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date. Notes can be used anytime additional information needs to be added to a date.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Create a virtually unlimited amount of shift types\n- Enter shifts on the calendar months in advance in seconds\n- Add your rotation and automatically fill the calendar in a few simple steps\n- Show friends and family shifts using multiple calendars\n- View the calendar in timeline format to see your shift flow at a glance\n- Create colored personalized notes for any date on the calendar\n- Include week of year or week 1/2 alternating pattern on calendar\n- Jump to any month by using the \"Goto\" button\n- Save a month's worth of shifts to your background\n- Share your shifts to others via email, MMS, Facebook or Twitter\n- Import other Shift Worker shifts and view them all within the one app\n- No in-app purchases!\n- No ads!"

We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase."

      "label": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

Forget the 'fit by eye' and use this app to get a great fit between pipes.\n\nUsing the simple yet effective interface, you can carry out various calculations to determine the travel / set and run for pipes.\n\nUsing industry standard pipe angles such as 22.5 45 and 60 degrees, you can use any one of the 3 calculator functions to help with your pipe calculations.\n\nFunction 1 - Simple Offset Calculator\nEnter the travel to calculate the run or enter the run to calculate the set all based on industry standard angles.\n\nFunction 2 - Calculate the Set / Travel or Run\nUse this function to calculate the travel , set or run between two pipe fittings. Using this feature allows you to position a pipe fitting precisely or measure a joining pipe precisely.\n\nFunction 3 - Rolling Offset.\nNeed to calculate the offset between two pipes that are on different horizontal and vertical positions? Don;t worry as you can use this feature to calculate the setback and diagonal required for the pipe. Enter the rise and offset and the calculator will determine the diagonal length of pipe required and the setback between the two pipe fittings. Choose from industry standard fitting angles to customise the calculations to your specific needs.\n\n\nWe are always happy to receive feedback to our support email which help to enhance and improve future free updates.

The key is to eat your \"Ugliest\" Frog BEFORE you do anything else, and without taking too much time to think about it.\n\nThe Truth About Frogs\nMark Twain once said that if the first thing you do each morning is eat a live frog, you can go through the day with the satisfaction of knowing that it’s probably the worst thing you'll have to do all day long.\n\nYour \"Frog\" is your biggest, most important task. It's the one you are most likely to procrastinate on, even dread. Yet, it is also the one task that can have the greatest positive impact on your life and create positive results immediately.\n\nWith that in mind, \"Eat That Frog,” the iPhone app, has been specifically designed and developed to ensure that your biggest priorities are handled with the urgency and focus required to make you most effective in your business and personal life. \n\nEach day, you'll be impressed with the momentum created from tackling your most difficult tasks, and at the end of each week and month, you'll be amazed to see just how much you've completed!\n\nWhy use Eat That Frog?  \nThere is no denying that it is our ability to focus on priorities and manage our time effectively which separates the high-achievers. \n\nTo that end, Eat That Frog! helps you to quickly establish and track your most important and impactful tasks throughout the each day.\n\nHOW TO USE:\nYou can create as many tasks/Frogs as you like. However, there is a catch, you can only ACTIVATE ONE FROG AT A TIME. \n\nNOTE: This is NOT a ToDo app - it's a procrastination killer that enables pure focus. \nFind out why this is the methodology used by the most productive people in the world. \n\nLearn more at www.briantracy.com\nFEATURES:\n- Establish as many custom Tasks/Frogs as you like!\n- Track your daily Frog and add required steps to keep you on target\n- Establish estimated completion dates for each Frog!\n- Easy to understand and clean user interface\n- ANIMATION and SOUND! \n- Motivate! Upon setup or each Frog task item, you get to write WHY you must complete the task \n- Track each Frog over multiple days if necessary\n- Chart both completion percentages and status\n- Email chart data!\n- Select up to four unique Frog ribbits\n- Includes Badge reminder!\n\n-----\n\"Eat That Frog! is simple, creative, fun to use and most importantly effective.\"\nChelsea S.\n \nMORE:\nFind other leading personal development apps from Equilibrium Enterprises: The Habit Factor® and Bucket List Pro"

      "label": "Pipe Saddle Layout Calculator is a iPhone app that provides the fitter with the points to make an accurate cut (fish mouth, cope, etc) for piping (cylinder to cylinder) intersections. This app is intended to be used by fitters, welders, fabricators, or anyone who needs to join two metal cylinders at any angle.\n\nAre you still carrying that blue book around? Pipe Saddle Layout Calculator is the modern piping blue book. Confused about how to layout cut lines for joining two pieces of pipe? If you are a pipe fabricator, welder, or fitter who needs to make perfect saddle cuts, then this app is for you. Forget books, calculators, compasses, ancient saddle layout procedures, laptops, expensive CAD programs, mathematics or internet access to figure out how to make that perfect saddle joint.\n\nPipe Saddle Layout Calculator is easy. Pipe Saddle Layout Calculator provides the offset layout dimensions for that perfect pipe joint. This calculator works with any size pipe, any angle of intersection, and any wall thickness of pipe. User enters: main pipe, branch pipe, wall thickness (this app considers wall thickness, you don't want to leave too much metal, or take too much off) and branch angle. The calculator does the rest.\n\nThis calculator produces an on the fly ordinate table of the offsets. The beauty of this app is that it also produces full size pattern templates, so you don't have to measure and layout all of the work points. Now you can print out your pipe pattern templates for any size and any angle intersection. This version outputs patterns configured for an 8.5 X 11 (everyone has access to one of these), 11 X 17, and 24 X 36 printer sizes. So with this app and a 8.5 X 11 printer, the user can still produce any size pipe coping pattern.\n\nThe calculator is very versatile. Presently input and output is US based imperial and/or metric. Output is feet, or feet and inches, decimal or fractions (to 1/32\"). This app has been updated to support metric solutions.\n\nUser can control how much cut line accuracy he/she wants by setting how many control points are desired (infinite amount, user can get 8 control points, i.e. every 45 degrees or 360 control points, i.e every degree, or more). Most books only give 8 or 16 control points. This app allows an infinite amount. For example, a 2\" pipe needs fewer control points than a 48\"."

      "label": "First released in June 2010, CopyIt is the original and most feature rich grid drawing app available anywhere! See why so many artists, teachers and students are using CopyIt as an essential tool in their workflows.\n\nNEW USERS - PLEASE NOTE:\nDue to the large number of features in CopyIt, the toolbars are scrollable.  Try scrolling each toolbar to access all of the available buttons.\n\nUsed by artists such as Vincent Van Gogh and Leonardo da Vinci, the grid drawing method has been brought to digital life with CopyIt. CopyIt assists you in copying, enlarging or reducing your chosen reference image using the grid drawing method. You do not even need to be artistic.\n\nThe grid drawing method has been used for centuries. It breaks images down into smaller work areas allowing you to focus on the actual lines and shapes within each square, rather than trying to draw the whole picture at once. You can't help but achieve with this method.\n\nUsing CopyIt as your reference object, it saves you from having to print your photos and ruin them by drawing grids over them, but unlike a real photo, it gives you the ability to zoom into the fine details.  With a pencil, you then draw up a grid with the same number of squares using a separate medium, such as paper or canvas. Working square by square, you CopyIt!\n\nIf you want to draw an image larger or smaller than the original, the pencil-drawn grid should be drawn larger or smaller than the original grid on the device with the same amount of squares.  All that matters is that the contents of each square are drawn to scale.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Comprehensive Help\n- Portrait or Landscape orientation\n- Universal App, compatible with iPad, iPhone and iPod touch\n- Fullscreen mode (hides toolbars)\n- Built-in Music player\n- Audible feedback (can be turned off)\n- Extra options in the Settings App\n- Set your Maximum Zoom level from x1 to x20\n- CopyIt can resist entering standby while in use\n- TubeMatch™ for approximating paint and pencil colours\n- Mosaic to average surrounding colours into coloured squares\n- Tonal Strip to help identify values\n- Media types (Imperial and Metric)\n\nGrid Options:\n- 6 Grid Types\n- Preset or custom Columns, Rows and Points grid sizing options\n- To maintain the grid visibility regardless of your photo, choose from 9 grid colors, Black (default), Gray, White, Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Orange and Magenta\n- Grid transparency is adjustable in 5% increments \n- 5 different Grid Line thicknesses\n- Grid letters and numbers (now 8 different formats)\n- A center point in each grid square \n- Guidelines: 1/4 and 1/16 to help you copy your subject\n- Solid or Dashed Guidelines\n- Guideline colour can be set independently to Grid colour\n- SmartMove: Just touch a square once to zoom to that square\n- SmartMove: takes advantage of your maximum zoom setting, never zooming in more than that amount\n- Target mode highlights the current square and dims the rest, helping you to focus your attention\n\nFilters and Effects:\n- 12 Primary Filters\n- 6 Secondary Filters\n- Onion Skin Feature: Overlay your reference image above your work to quickly assess your accuracy\n- 12 different image aspects \n- Rotate the image in 90 degree increments\n- Vertical and Horizontal Flip image\n\nImport Options:\n- Cameras are supported - both front and back\n- Load Project\n- Load From Photo Album\n\nExport Options:\n- Save Project\n- Export Photo (AirDrop, email, message, print, export to Facebook, Twitter etc)\n\nFor detailed instructions on how to use CopyIt, a user guide is available within the App and on the Support website.\n\nYou can contact the developer on Facebook or Twitter.\nwww.facebook.com/CopyItTheGridDrawingMethod or @copyitforios\n\nThank you to all our users for their feedback and feature suggestions which have helped make CopyIt what it is today."

      "label": "‘Hand Tuber’ is a simple to use tubing offset calculator, and offers the field tubing specialist a handy tool to accurately place stainless instrument or copper tubing bend offsets in the field, utilising its in-built bender library and specialized calculations for both Metric and Imperial measurements.\n\nThis tool has been specifically developed to calculate for all bend angles, and not just 30°, 45°, 60°, and 90°, for those times where tubes are required to be run between obstacles such as beams, cable ladders, and pipework.\n\n‘Hand Tuber’ also allows you the benefit of being able to add your own specific Rotary Draw Tube Bender to the bender choices in the library.\n\nImperial and metric benders are included in the inbuilt bender library, and the calculator can be used with both inches and millimeters as a unit of measure with a high degree of accuracy.\n\nIn a Nutshell:\n\n•\tSeven common Tubing Offset calculations included in the program.\n•\tCan be used for most Rotary Draw type benders (Center Line Radius)\n•\tAll results are calculated by using the tube center and/or bender radius.\n•\tAll calculations are based on trigonometry formula giving precision.\n•\tHand Tuber can be set up for either inches or millimeters.\n•\tThe most common Imperial and Metric bender profiles are included.\n•\tAdd new benders in ‘Add Benders’, and build a new bender profile.\n•\tMaintains a History of your previous completed bend calculations.\n•\tHelp screens included for all bend offsets and are quickly accessible.\n•\tMost calculations are completed on a single screen.\n•\tHandy graphics show the calculation results as a visual reference.\n•\tAdjustment, Offset, and Seating Allowance reference charts included.\n•\tHandy standard calculator function within the app.\n•\tEase of navigation to switch pages quickly and directly.\n•\tAccess to Online Tubing Manual via a handy link from the app.\n\nSo what’s the bottom line:\n\nFast on screen calculations, no need to use ‘cast offs’ to find that bend position.\nHelps to save wastage and reduce that ‘Bone Pile’ or stock of ‘Future Bends’.\nSaves time in working out those common and tricky offsets quickly.\nFinds the answer when the ‘Measure then Bend’ technique won’t work.\nVery handy, fits in your pocket or bag on your mobile device.\n\nOffsets and Calculations Included in the Current Release:\n\nSimple Offset: \nThe simple offset calculates the position of the second bend in a standard 2 bend offset, based on the previous Pre-Bent angle and the offset required for any angle between 0° and 90°.\n\nPredictive Offset:\nThe predictive offset calculates the second bend in a standard 2 bend offset, based on the previous planned bend angle, and the required offset, before either bend in the offset has been bent for any angle between 0° and 90°.\n\nParallel Offset:\nThe parallel offset calculates the position adjustment of the bend in a parallel tube, by giving the +/- length needed in order to maintain a consistent spacing between tubes with a change in direction.\n\nLong Run Offset:\nThe Long Run Offset calculates the Slope Length and Bend Angle for long runs of tube with a fixed or known Offset and Run length.\n\nBack Bend Offset:\nThe Back Bend Offset calculates the bender 0° position, for a bend that folds back on itself at an angle greater than 90°. This is useful when running tube on beams and cross braces.\n\nJoint Offset:\nThe Joint offset calculates the measurements and offsets to aid in the positioning of an offset tube joint or connecter in a specific location, and gives the measurements to place the center of the joint.\n\nFall Calculation:\nThe Fall Calculator calculates the fall or Offset amount, over a set distance based on a fall ratio.\nThe usual fall minimum for tubing in instrumentation is 1:12 or 8.33%."

If you use other keyboards, no problem! And if you don't, then NumPad has a perfect place in your iDevice, adding that extra bit of typing that'll make adding numbers to anything that much faster.

The pomodoro technique aims to improve your productivity by helping you focus your attention on your work for short intervals (pomdoros), allowing for rest breaks in between to avoid fatigue.\n\nOther pomodoro timer apps may catch your attention with a big countdown timer and flashy colors. Focus Pocus instead opts for a subtle timer design reminiscent of a mechanical wall timer that moves slowly and steadily, with subdued colors that keep the attention on your task at hand. The result is a pomodoro timer that won't distract you while you work.\n\nKey Features\n\n1. Designed to minimize distractions with an unobtrusive and easy-to-use interface. Rotate the control knob at any time to adjust the time remaining, and start/pause/stop the timer with large, accessible buttons.\n\n2. Curated options such as notifications and a metronome sound are available to help you customize your experience.\n\n3. Lightweight and fast: tiny 1MB download and loads in a snap.\n\n4. Privacy conscious: no data collection, tracking, or analytics. No dark patterns designed to keep you hooked to your device."

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nGet Started\n• Interactive tutorial project\n• Keep each manuscript and supporting materials in a self-contained project\n• Import Word, RTF, Final Draft and plain text files\n• Easily split imported text into separate sections\n\nGet Writing\n• Write your manuscript in sections of any size\n• View all sections as a single text using the “Draft Navigator” (iPad only)\n• Quickly navigate sections using the “binder” sidebar\n• Format with fonts and presets\n• Comments, footnotes, links and highlights\n• Simple bullets and lists\n• Insert images\n• Pinch-zoom to resize text\n• Full-screen mode (iPad only)\n• Typewriter scrolling mode keeps typed text center-screen (iPad only)\n• Write a screenplay using scriptwriting mode\n• Live word and character counts\n• Set word and character count targets\n• Find and replace\n• Customizable keyboard row provides quick-access buttons for formatting, navigation and punctuation\n• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for external keyboard users\n• Dark mode\n\nFind Your Structure\n• Write in any order and reorganize later\n• Write a synopsis for any text section and see it in the outline\n• Expand, collapse and drill down into sections of your project\n• Rearrange sections as index cards on the corkboard (iPad only)\n• Project-wide search\n• Track ideas using labels and status\n• Apply custom icons to your sections\n\nRefer to Research\n• Import research material such as image, PDF and media files\n• View research files or other sections right alongside your writing (iPad only)\n• Every section has its own notes area for jotting down ideas\n• Supports multi-tasking split screen mode (supported devices only)\n\nShare Your Work\n• Compile to a single document for sharing or printing\n• Use different formatting in your exported or printed document\n• Export to Word, RTF, Final Draft, PDF or plain text\n• Convert rich text to Markdown for sharing with Markdown apps\n• Create and email zipped backups of your projects\n\nWork Anywhere\n• Use Dropbox to sync between devices and with the macOS and Windows versions of Scrivener*\n• Copy projects between devices via iTunes\n\n* Requires a Dropbox account (not compatible with iCloud).\n\nSUPPORT\nYou can contact us at ios.support@literatureandlatte.com, visit our forums at http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum, or find us @scrivenerapp on Twitter."

Well, with Anchor Alarm you've the ability to set your swing shape in advance as individually as specific for each situation!\n\nAll feature at a glance:\n§ Individual shapes instead of a fix swing arc\n§ Alarm sound which will wake you\n§ Ship dimensions in true-to-scale representation in the map\n§ Optional alarm on low battery or other power supply issues\n§ Optional alarm on poor GPS accuracy\n§ Optional alarm on low volume / silent mode\n§ Optional alarm if headset is connected\n§ All alarms are active in the background and even if you lock your iPhone.\n\nApple Disclaimer\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.

      "label": "iConcrete: Design of Reinforced Concrete Beams.\nFor all structural engineers and reinforced concrete designers: This engineering application for the iPhone or the iPod Touch calculates the dimensions and area steel reinforcement for rectangular and Tee beams (T-Beams) of reinforced concrete members. That includes single and double reinforced beams.\nThe program calculates the strength of singly reinforced and  doubly reinforced T and Rectangular concrete beams. It calculates positive moment, negative moment and shear. Based on given positive and negative moments the program calculates the balanced depth and balanced area of steel reinforcement.  It also calculates the weight of concrete and steel and the total weight of the section.\nThe program is based on ACI 318. Other codes will be added in  future revisions. The balanced section and reinforcement and the strength is calculated in two methods: Working Stress Design (WSD) and Ultimate Strength Design (USD) which is also called Limit State Design (LSD) or Strength Design Method (SDM).\n\nThe input is beam width, beam depth, areas of tension reinforcement and compression reinforcement, steel yield strength, concrete ultimate strength, size and spacing of sterrups, and for the T-Beam, width and depth of flange slab. to find the balanced section dimensions, you need to input the positive and negative moments and to find the strength you need to input the depth and areas of steel. The modular ratio (N)  for working stress design can be input or calculated.\n\nThe input can be in mm or inch units, the output is in mm or inch units. The weight can be displayed in kg/m or Lb/ft and the moments and shears are in kN, Lb, kN.m and Lb.ft. The input data can also be converted between the two unit systems.\n\nSee also iSection in the App Store.\n\nKeywords: Reinforced Concrete, خرسانة مسلحة, Béton Armé,  คอนกรีตเสริมเหล็ก, 钢筋混凝土, Beton Arme, Stahlbeton, Cemento Armato, חיזק בטון, Железобетонных конструкций, Tăng cường bê tông, 鉄筋コンクリート, Hormigón Armado, Armerad betong."

      "label": "SA Group Text is the most efficient way to send group messages. You can add recipient names and phone numbers in an Excel file. You can enter static or personalized text messages right in the Excel spreadsheet. For example, if you enter “Hi {first name}, ...” in a message, the app will take the first name of the recipients and personalize the message, generating text such as “Hi David, …” , “Hi Michael, …”…\n\nYou can use an Excel spreadsheet again without editing the spreadsheet on your computer. You can just pick an Excel file, type in a quick message and send it. It is similar to sending a message to a group.\n\nSA Group Text is also an easy way to send text messages to the contacts on your iPhone. Just pick groups or individual contacts, type in a static or personalized message and send it.\n\nWho uses SA Group Text ?\n1) Small Businesses\n2) Religious Groups\n3) Retail\n4) Nightlife - Bars & Nightclubs\n5) Restaurants\n6) Banks/Financial Institutions\n7) Insurance Companies\n8) Event Marketers (With hundreds (or even thousands) of people attending your events)\n9) Traditional Media\n10) Schools\n11) Social Groups\n12) Real Estate\n\nWith SA Group Text you can :\n1. Import group SMS from an Excel file via USB/WiFi/Email.\n2. Create your own groups in an Excel spreadsheet and send messages to them.\n3. Send unsent messages . If the app is terminated while sending group SMS, the sending task will be continued next time you launch the app..\n4. Insert tags ({nickname},{firstname},{lastname},{nickname},{company} etc) in your text message in order to create personalized messages. When you use this function, each message has a personal touch. For example:\n    Dear {firstname}, Welcome to our dinner party.\n5. Use MS Excel 2003 / 2007 / 2010 , OpenOffice.org , Apple Numbers or any other Excel-compatible applications to create your group text messages. Be sure to save as an Excel 97-2003 Workbook.\n6. Export an Excel template , and use it to create your own Excel file.\n7. Send SMS to as many recipients as you need within your Excel file \n8. Limit the number of recipients per message. The app will split a large message into multiple separate messages.\n9. Create a formatted Excel file easily. The file can contain only two columns : Mobile and Message. You can find more example spreadsheets on the app’s website.\n10. Create flexible group SMS in your spreadsheet. \nFor example “{family} Family – Practice Tomorrow at 5pm for little {kidname}!”  becomes “David Family – Practice Tomorrow at 5pm for little Johnny!”. The names change over and over again.\n11. Create contact groups, you can create in-app groups for Exchange contacts.\n12. Choose contacts organized in groups, companies, job titles and cities.\n13. Preview messages before sending them out.\n14. Skip duplicated phone numbers and messages.\n15. The lite version has ads.  \n16. Send online sms, supporting Twilio and Nexmo. \n17. Find a way to send messages without user interaction, please contact to samyuservice@gmail.com for details.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE :\nPlease check the setting of \"Group Messaging\" on the iPhone settings. If the option is available, set it to OFF (yes OFF) to be able to send to large groups. If it's on, the iPhone will try to send MMS instead of SMS and will fail to send to large groups.\n\nMore detail and up-to-date help guides are available in samapp.com."

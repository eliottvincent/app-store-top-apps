For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

Sometimes it's not easy to see your upcoming shift schedule very clearly, especially if your shifts don't fall into the traditional working week. Shift Worker solves this problem and turns the frustrating task of entry into a quick and easy experience.\n\nShift Worker allows you to create your own types of shifts by combining visually-attractive icons with letters/numbers so that they can be easily identified at a glance. By including a range of icons (such as suns and stars for day and night shifts) in a variety of colors, any combination is possible for all types of shifts.\n\nEntering shifts can be done quickly by simply selecting a type of shift and tapping on each date it occurs. An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!\n\nIn addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. \n\nShift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date. Notes can be used anytime additional information needs to be added to a date.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Create a virtually unlimited amount of shift types\n- Enter shifts on the calendar months in advance in seconds\n- Add your rotation and automatically fill the calendar in a few simple steps\n- Show friends and family shifts using multiple calendars\n- View the calendar in timeline format to see your shift flow at a glance\n- Create colored personalized notes for any date on the calendar\n- Include week of year or week 1/2 alternating pattern on calendar\n- Jump to any month by using the \"Goto\" button\n- Save a month's worth of shifts to your background\n- Share your shifts to others via email, MMS, Facebook or Twitter\n- Import other Shift Worker shifts and view them all within the one app\n- No in-app purchases!\n- No ads!"

How about not opening Safari? Yes, you can even switch engines in Spotlight with shortcut and redirect to Safari automatically.\n\n◆ URL Scheme: xSearch not only supports website engines, but also supports URL Scheme, for example: search `twapp apple` in Safari (or Spotlight) will redirect to Twitter app (if it's installed) and search `apple` automatically.\n\n◆ Syncing all your engines across your devices via iCloud.\n\n◆ Export and Import engines JSON file, this let you backup your engines or share engines with other users.\n\n◆ Edit engines in JSON.\n\n◆ Use share extension to search any text via xSearch.\n\n!!!

      "label": "LockBox Pro lets you store and protect sensitive info such as credit card numbers, bank accounts, passwords, pin numbers, private notes, and any other secret information on your iPhone or iPod Touch.\n\nNow supports ios11\n\nNEW Version v1.2 fixes a bug that sometimes causes imports to fail or only import partial data. Thanks to everyone who reported this and helped us fix it!!\n\nNEW Version 1.1 allows you to:\n\n- NEW! Import Bulk Data from your computer into LockBox Pro.  Saves lots of typing on your device!\n\n- NEW! Export/Backup data to your computer over a WiFi connection! Remember to do this regularly!\n\n- NO Ads!\n\nUse it to keep information handy and also protected at the same time.\n\nNew Pro Edition Features:\n(not found in the free version)\n\n* Import Data - create a file on your computer and import it into LockBox Pro via Wifi.  Saves you lots of typing on the device.\n\n* Stronger Security - data is secured via Apple's Keychain which utilizes 3DES encryption for high security.\n\n* More Flexible - you can add as many fields as you like to each entry. (the free version is fixed at 2 fields per entry)\n\n* No Ads\n\nIMPORTANT:\nExisting free version users... you can now upgrade easily while keeping your data!  Just export your data first using the free version and then import it into LockBox Pro via the WiFi import feature.\n\nNew Features:\n\n* import/export via WiFi \n* Sound effects can now be turned off! :-)\n* The app exits correctly when you lock your iPhone with the top button.\n* You can now easily rearrange and delete items in your list. (and they stay rearranged)\n* Your data is backed up via the regular iTunes backup, but be sure to use the new export feature as data is sometimes saved incorrectly in iTunes. iTunes also does not allow you to change devices... your data will be lost if you don't back it up using the new WiFi export method.\n\n(all bug fixes are available in the free version as well... however the new advanced features are not)\n\nMore Info:\n\nAll data is encrypted and protected by your secret code, so only you have access to it, even if you let your friends borrow your phone to make a call or browse online.\n\nThis is the kind of information that you want easy access to while you are on the go, but find it hard to recall just when you need it.  For example, I always forget my bank account number right when I need to deposit a check at the bank.\n\nNot sure if you need this?\n\nTry the FREE version first... it's called LockBox (not Pro) :-)\n\nGo Pro for a low price for a limited time!  \n\nIMPORTANT BACKUP INFORMATION: \n\nRemember to sync and do a backup of your data through the LockBox app before updating to newer versions!  You never know what might happen to your phone in the middle of a sync :-)  Also, the iTunes backup is not enough in some cases especially when you have to replace your phone or reset it, so make sure you use the WiFi backup method to protect your data.  Its the only way to make sure your data is safe when doing a sync or restore for your device."

It helps you organizing both your business and personal tasks altogether, reducing stress while increasing productivity at the same time.\n\nOther apps focus on collecting many lists and tasks, Eisenhower helps you to actually complete the ones that really matter—through providing a framework to filter incoming tasks and maximize the happy feeling of completion when finishing or delegating them.\n\n—————\nJoin many others and become more productive today!\n—————\n\nWhat our users are saying about Eisenhower:\n\n▶ \"Perfect for those with busy lifestyles or who just want to get things done.\"\n\n▶ \"Get this, now, not later. This is how Eisenhower ran a country, might be good for your productivity too.\"\n\n▶ \"Helps me to be productive - quick, easy, efficient.\"\n\n▶ \"This could be the next big thing in productivity apps.\"\n\n▶ \"I absolutely love this application and I find it to actually be hugely useful - having played with it the whole day today and populated it out with tasks I want to achieve to test the theory, I indeed finished each of the \"Do First\" tasks in order, and achieved Zero-Inbox. This is the most productive day I've had in months!\"\n\n—————\nFEATURES\n—————\n\n▶ Task Counter\nOn each to-do sheet, best manage no more than 8 tasks. Still, we have made room for unlimited tasks and notes whenever you might need it—and each sheet counts how many there are to tackle right now.\n\n▶ Focus Mode\nFor urgent and important tasks, you can use a special timer, helping you to focus on only one task for 30 minutes—or whatever duration you like best.\n\n▶ Schedule & Delegate\nUsing other task-related actions, you can directly place reminders in your calendar or send e-mails including the tasks to co-workers.\n\n▶ Cloud Sync\nOnce you have created your account, Eisenhower automatically syncs with the free web client on app.eisenhower.me—and vice versa, in real-time!\n\n—————\nMORE\n—————\n\nIf you are new to the Eisenhower matrix or just want to refresh your memory, check out our quick video tutorial here: bit.ly/eisenhower-matrix\n\nGet in Touch\nGot feedback for us?

It's a different way of looking at the day\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nThe visual planner works like an analog clock widget. It automatically receives all the calendar events and overlays them on the 12/24 hour dial. This provides a different, more efficient view of your schedule.\n\nHOW IT LOOKS\n\nIt looks like a projection of your calendar of events onto a 12-hour dial that has hour and minute hands just like a regular watch.\nEvent sectors are displayed in those hour intervals in which they will occur.\nThe interval of idle time between events is displayed between sectors, as well as the time from an hour hand to the start of each event.\nEvents are displayed automatically 12/24 hours ahead of time.\n\nThe calendar and analog clock, combined, give a visual representation of your busyness, allow you to effectively plan and calculate daytime.\n\nUse a widget for better integration.\n\nAREAS OF APPLICATION\n\n• Day scheduling and timing. Conveniently track your daily tasks, meetings, events and at any time know how much time is left to wait until the end of the current event and until the start of the next. Don't be late.\n\n• Accounting and control of working hours. Keep your phone in your workplace and you will be completely under control.\n\n• Class schedule. Observe how much time is left before the end of a tiresome lecture at the university and never be late for laboratory work.\n\n• Schedule of the day. Follow your daily routine and get better, just use the app to keep track of your to-dos and daily tasks. Take rest breaks in time!\n\n• Trip timer and flight duration. Are you losing the passage of time due to endless travel and flights? Control check-in time, boarding time and flight duration. Keep everything under control.\n\n• Make your meal, medication, and exercise schedule clearer. Lead the right lifestyle and be healthy!\n\n• Convenient countdown to scheduled events in the app and widget. The plan of the day will be executed exactly.\n\n• The app may appeal to fans of Pomodoro and Chronodex timer technologies. Time tracking with him will happen in a new way."

And if you (or your employer) doesn't want the events' details to be uploaded to Google Calendar, you can only upload empty events instead, so that your family knows at least the times of your events.\n\nJust install SyncCal, enter your Google Calendar account, select which calendars should be synced and tap \"Start\". Afterward it will copy the selected calendars into new calendars in Google Calendar.

      "label": "Congratulations! You’ve just discovered the app that perfects the process of improved attention and focus. Old science has taught us new ways to unlock the power of your brain to stay focused and attentive, even on tasks where it feels nearly impossible. With this app you will experience consistent increases in: \n\n\t-Sustained attention \n\t-Increased focus\n\t-Consistent on-task behavior\n\nYou will become less distracted and more productive, even on the most boring of tasks. \n\nOld Science + New Technology = Earned Success \nNearly 50 years ago, researchers found that using random, audio beeps on a tape recorder (beeper tape) helped test subjects stay focused better than others who:\n   -Depended on another person to prompt them to stay on task \n   -Relied upon reward systems as incentive\n   -Used medication exclusively\n\nDevelop Self-Regulation \nOriginal Beeper App™, developed by a licensed mental health provider is designed to allow you to assess your own level of attention on any given task and to record these results. \n\nThis is important because research shows that a person who can self-monitor their attentiveness and focus, whether through using a beep tape or some other cueing device, will consistently increase in on-task behavior, accuracy and performance. \n\nSelf-regulation strategies are proven to be effective procedures for increasing on-task behavior above and beyond the gains typically associated with medications or other external methods. \n\n\n\nFlexible and Customizable \nYou can set the timer, sound and frequency of your beeper prompts to be exactly suited to your personal needs. You will quickly and easily determine the best settings for you. \n \nUse at School \nOriginal Beeper App™ is custom made for school implementation as well. It does not interfere with a teacher’s lesson, and it does not require constant teacher involvement to manage off-task behaviors. Lastly, since Original Beeper App™ is completely customizable for many situations that require sustained on-task behavior, it is the most effective resource for supporting on-task behavior in the real world, all over the world.    \n \nPossible Applications of Original Beeper App™\n1.     Complete chores at home more quickly\n2.     Independently focus on homework\n3.     Maintain clear attention on work projects\n4.     Get through college courses with confidence \n5.     Work quietly in classroom setting (any grade) \n6.     Apply your best effort on any other situation at school, work or home when sustained focus is expected.\n\n\nWhat Users have already experienced Using Original Beeper App -\n\nThe beeps feel like guardrails keeping focus steadily flowing between the lines. If having a day where they are more distracted, increasing the frequency of the beeps tightens the guardrails. \n\nThe randomness of the beeps (at any frequency) is helpful because it prevents the mind from finding a pattern and coasting. It’s like driving on a curvy road instead of a straight one. \n\nThe beeps help users automatically check in and adjust their focus. If their thoughts are drifting out of the lane, the beep brings them right back where they need to be to stay on-task. \n\n\n*NEVER USE WHEN DRIVING/OPERATING ANY VEHICLE/ MACHINERY\n\n\nvisit originalbeeperapp.com for complete information"

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research?

      "label": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

      "label": "\"Oblique Strategies\" is a concept developed by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt to help artists overcome creative blocks through lateral thinking. It consists of a deck of cards, each one containing a vague or ambiguous phrase that can be used to solve a problem intuitively, by breaking conventional thinking patterns and interpreting it from a new perspective.\n\nThis app aims to translate the essence of the original cards deck into a digital experience, making it accessible to a wider audience. It contains the original edition, as well as the newer decks, presenting them in a sleek minimalist style inspired by the original design of the cards. The user interface is simple and straightforward, built to encourage creative or design thinking without distracting from the process. The home screen widget on iOS 14 allows reading a new quote every day without opening the application. The Apple Watch version can run independently without needing the app installed on your iPhone.\n\nWith VoiceOver, anyone with a visual impairment can have the Oblique Strategies phrase read to them. Long tap the screen to have the last sentence read to you again. Also, you can shake the iPhone for a new sentence."

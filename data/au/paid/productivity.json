For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

Use headings to structure your list as you outline your plan. There’s also a place to jot down your notes, and a deadline to keep you on schedule.\n\n• Your Areas\nCreate an Area for each sphere of your life, such as Work, Family, Finance, and so on. This keeps everything neatly organized, and helps you see the big picture as you set your plans in motion.\n\n• Your Plan\nEverything on your schedule is neatly laid out in the Today and Upcoming lists, which show your to-dos and calendar events.

      "label": "Shift Worker is designed for people who need a quick and easy way to enter and view their shifts.\n\nA traditional calendar is not always ideal for shift workers. Sometimes it's not easy to see your upcoming shift schedule very clearly, especially if your shifts don't fall into the traditional working week. Shift Worker solves this problem and turns the frustrating task of entry into a quick and easy experience.\n\nShift Worker allows you to create your own types of shifts by combining visually-attractive icons with letters/numbers so that they can be easily identified at a glance. By including a range of icons (such as suns and stars for day and night shifts) in a variety of colors, any combination is possible for all types of shifts.\n\nEntering shifts can be done quickly by simply selecting a type of shift and tapping on each date it occurs. An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!\n\nIn addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. \n\nShift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date. Notes can be used anytime additional information needs to be added to a date.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Create a virtually unlimited amount of shift types\n- Enter shifts on the calendar months in advance in seconds\n- Add your rotation and automatically fill the calendar in a few simple steps\n- Show friends and family shifts using multiple calendars\n- View the calendar in timeline format to see your shift flow at a glance\n- Create colored personalized notes for any date on the calendar\n- Include week of year or week 1/2 alternating pattern on calendar\n- Jump to any month by using the \"Goto\" button\n- Save a month's worth of shifts to your background\n- Share your shifts to others via email, MMS, Facebook or Twitter\n- Import other Shift Worker shifts and view them all within the one app\n- No in-app purchases!\n- No ads!"

Well, with Anchor Alarm you've the ability to set your swing shape in advance as individually as specific for each situation!\n\nAll feature at a glance:\n§ Individual shapes instead of a fix swing arc\n§ Alarm sound which will wake you\n§ Ship dimensions in true-to-scale representation in the map\n§ Optional alarm on low battery or other power supply issues\n§ Optional alarm on poor GPS accuracy\n§ Optional alarm on low volume / silent mode\n§ Optional alarm if headset is connected\n§ All alarms are active in the background and even if you lock your iPhone.\n\nApple Disclaimer\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.

      "label": "Unstuck is a simple tool to help you break through difficult interpersonal, management, substantive, and organizational challenges. Unstuck guides you through the process of peer coaching -- a proven approach to collaboratively solving problems.   This app supports that process by providing structure, suggesting helpful coaching questions, and guiding you toward new perspectives and insights that will help you overcome whatever challenges you're facing.\n\n*** What is peer coaching? ***\nPeer coaching is a widely used framework in organizations, schools, and workplaces, as a way to collaboratively find solutions when facing a difficult challenge.  In a two-person coaching session, one person is the learner -- the person seeking a fresh perspective on a challenge.  The other person is the coach -- someone who listens and asks probing, helpful questions.  \n\nUnstuck guides you through the three stages of peer coaching: \n1) The learner describes the \"what, where, when, and who\" of their challenge so that the coach understands the situation; \n2) The coach asks questions to help the learner talk through the problem and expand their thinking;\n3) Both the learner and the coach have an opportunity to reflect on what they've learned.\n\nUnstuck leads you through these stages by tracking the time, prompting you to move on to the next stage, and even offering questions to consider.  This allows you to focus on the coaching.\n\n*** Why use peer coaching? ***\n\nPeer coaching can help you see new approaches to difficult personal, workplace, or social challenges.  But peer coaching can help in other ways, too!  According to research in the Journal of Applied Behavioral Science, peer coaching can help heighten self-awareness, improve active listening skills, enhance interpersonal connections, and improve leadership skills.  This is why peer coaching is taught in leadership and management training programs around the world.\n\n*** How do I get started? ***\n\nIt's easy to get started.  All you need to do is find a trusted friend or colleague willing to be your coach. Their job is to help you think through the challenge by listening and asking thoughtful questions, not giving advice or telling you what to do. Customize your Unstuck session to fit your schedule. Whether you have an hour or only 10 minutes to talk with your coach, Unstuck will help you make the most of whatever time that you have.\n\n*** Can I use Unstuck on my own? ***\n\nYes! Unstuck is primarily designed to help two people do peer coaching together (in person or remotely).  But by using Unstuck's built-in question library, you can be your own coach and think through challenges on your own.\n\n*** Do I need special training? ***\n\nNo!  Unstuck makes it easy to begin peer coaching.  Neither the learner nor the coach needs any kind of special training or expertise -- just a willingness to listen and think. And if the coach gets stuck, Unstuck can suggest questions!"

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nGet Started\n• Interactive tutorial project\n• Keep each manuscript and supporting materials in a self-contained project\n• Import Word, RTF, Final Draft and plain text files\n• Easily split imported text into separate sections\n\nGet Writing\n• Write your manuscript in sections of any size\n• View all sections as a single text using the “Draft Navigator” (iPad only)\n• Quickly navigate sections using the “binder” sidebar\n• Format with fonts and presets\n• Comments, footnotes, links and highlights\n• Simple bullets and lists\n• Insert images\n• Pinch-zoom to resize text\n• Full-screen mode (iPad only)\n• Typewriter scrolling mode keeps typed text center-screen (iPad only)\n• Write a screenplay using scriptwriting mode\n• Live word and character counts\n• Set word and character count targets\n• Find and replace\n• Customizable keyboard row provides quick-access buttons for formatting, navigation and punctuation\n• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for external keyboard users\n• Dark mode\n\nFind Your Structure\n• Write in any order and reorganize later\n• Write a synopsis for any text section and see it in the outline\n• Expand, collapse and drill down into sections of your project\n• Rearrange sections as index cards on the corkboard (iPad only)\n• Project-wide search\n• Track ideas using labels and status\n• Apply custom icons to your sections\n\nRefer to Research\n• Import research material such as image, PDF and media files\n• View research files or other sections right alongside your writing (iPad only)\n• Every section has its own notes area for jotting down ideas\n• Supports multi-tasking split screen mode (supported devices only)\n\nShare Your Work\n• Compile to a single document for sharing or printing\n• Use different formatting in your exported or printed document\n• Export to Word, RTF, Final Draft, PDF or plain text\n• Convert rich text to Markdown for sharing with Markdown apps\n• Create and email zipped backups of your projects\n\nWork Anywhere\n• Use Dropbox to sync between devices and with the macOS and Windows versions of Scrivener*\n• Copy projects between devices via iTunes\n\n* Requires a Dropbox account (not compatible with iCloud).\n\nSUPPORT\nYou can contact us at ios.support@literatureandlatte.com, visit our forums at http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum, or find us @scrivenerapp on Twitter."

A prompt button is there to remind you of your line if you forget.\nYou can choose to repeat individual scenes, or the whole play.\nWith line learner you can record your script, and share it with others, who can record their lines, and share them back, giving you the ability to rehearse together even when apart.\nThe app allows you to load up a script in PDF or Word format and display it as you record your lines.\nAfter you have recorded your lines you can alter the pitch of the other characters so as to more easily tell their lines apart from your own.\nSome quotes from some of our users:\n\" I attribute much of my success to using your app\"\n\"Great app, really enjoying it!\"\n\"I say this app is damn near perfect!\"\n\"I really love your app and find it very useful.\""

      "label": "*** Top Paid featured in the Productivity section on the AppStore! ***\n\nStop wasting time and start being more productive.\nTime your tasks and save up to 3 hours everyday.\n\nClockit is an incredibly simple to use Pomodoro timer that helps you manage your time and get things done. Just enter how much time you need to spend on something, press start, and Clockit will notify you when to break, when to resume task, and when you’re done with that task. Repeat with all your tasks and see yourself getting more and more done. Don't want to estimate completion time? Switch to classic pomodoro mode to do things the traditional way.\n\nFor iPad users, Clockit is fully compatible with Split View, allowing you to keep track of your progress from anywhere without exiting an app.\n\nTIMER\nNot just a simple countdown clock but a carefully designed timer that takes your breaks and overtime into account to maximize your productivity. The timer runs in background and notifications are generated automatically, effectively saving you more time.\n\nBREAKS\nTaking no breaks while completing a certain task is in fact counterproductive. Clockit allows users to break every once in a while. Say you would like to take a break every 30 mins. The app takes that into account and notifies you automatically when to break as you focus on your work. This effectively relieves your stress as you know there’s a break coming up soon. Clockit also notifies you when break time is up so you'll be back on track right on time.\n\nOVERTIME\nSpending too much time on something is a common problem and that’s why Clockit provides an overtime limit to solve this obstacle. Once you complete a task, Clockit displays the amount of time you have left for overtime and notifies you 10 minutes before your time is up.\n\nSTATS\nKnowing how you use your time is essential to becoming more productive. That's why Clockit devotes an entire page just on delivering the most insightful stats to you. What's even more incredible is that these stats are all collected passively for your convenience.\n\nCUSTOMIZATION\nMake Clockit yours. Set default values, customize notification sounds, and customize theme color. Productivity should be fun and tailored to you!\n\nDESIGN\nLightweight and clean, Clockit elegantly merges with your daily routine, generating absolutely zero burden. The ease of use exceeds an entirely new level, providing users more functions with less hassle. The simplicity of this app furthermore reflects focus and organization, the foundation of productivity.\n\n\"Productivity is never an accident. It is always the result of a commitment to excellence, intelligent planning, and focused effort.” - Paul J. Meyer"

(You can also copy this data by pressing and holding down any table row.)\n\nAs of version 3.0.0, the public FiveM serverlist is no longer available.

Simplifying our lives makes us less stressed and more productive. Having tasks fed to you one by one allows you to maintain focus on completing just a single task. To top it all off, shuffling makes completing tasks fun and motivating.\n\nSHUFFLING\nTaskBox’s unique algorithm allows weighted shuffling. With priorities set on your tasks, higher priority tasks will have a higher chance of being selected for you to complete first.\n\nDESIGN\nEvery element and detail of TaskBox is designed to enhance user experience. Minimalistic in design, the app creates zero burden, even goes as far as to lighten up your day.\n\n\"Productivity is never an accident. It is always the result of a commitment to excellence, intelligent planning, and focused effort.” - Paul J.

      "label": "Shortcut Keyboard is your new Keyboard!\nThe app creates you a new keyboard. This keyboard is made for you with your personal shortcuts. Insert the shortcut’s text to save a lot of time. Additionally, once you have created a shortcut, the text will not change so you can be sure that you do not insert wrong information. One more benefit is that you are not bugged by typing the same letters over and over again.\nShortcut Keyboard has a lot of functions, including:\n\n- Create new shortcuts with ease and insert the shortcut’s text with a single finger press\n- Create new pages and position your shortcuts wherever you want on the keyboard\n- Your texts are variable!\n - Static texts are inserted without any changes\n - It is possible to replace a date variable with the current date and time\n - Another feature allows you to insert your current location\n- Import and export your shortcuts so they can be used as a backup and to keep your other devices updated\n\nCreate shortcuts to fill out forms with just a few finger presses.  Until now, you did not know how fast you can insert your name, address, email​ and phone number.\nSend your friends your current location and let them know where the party is at or text your parents that you safely made it to your current location.\nYou can mark your finished tasks with the current date and even insert the current time quickly.\nShortcuts can be used in all kinds of situations. They are especially useful for texts you often use and are also handy for hashtags, websites, signatures and I bet you already have your individual use in your mind.\n\nHow do I use Shortcut Keyboard?\n\nThe app shows a keyboard. This represents the actual keyboard you will be using.\nCreate a new shortcut by simply clicking on the +. Enter the text you want to be inserted and a text that will be shown on the keyboard.\nMoving shortcuts is just as easy. Click on the icon in the top right of your screen. A blue border will appear. Click two shortcuts to change places.\nDo not forget to add Shortcut to your keyboards. Settings -> General -> Keyboard -> Keyboards -> Add Keyboard. You will see Shortcut Keyboard. Add it to your keyboards. Now you can use the globe on Apple's keyboard to change your active keyboard to Shortcut Keyboard.\nOn the keyboard, click a shortcut to insert the text. You can also long press a shortcut to see the text that can be inserted.\n\nEvery kind of feedback is highly appreciated. Feel free to tell us about your experience with Shortcut Keyboard and what features you want to see in upcoming versions. :)\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ShortcutKeyboardApp/\n@ShortcutKeyboardApp\nSupport: shortcut@wrave.de"

      "label": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

      "label": "BlockyTime, A simple time logger no need to tap Start/Stop.\n\n### App Store Featured of 2016 in China & HongKong ###\n### Top 10 Productivity apps in China ###\n\nEverybody has his own demand on tracking time, but most people can't persist on it for long time because the traditional time-tracking App is way too professional, and it costs too much energy to use a stopwatch.\n\nBlockyTime is very different from traditional time-tracking App, it never needs to tap \"Start/Stop\". Months of research of users experience made us to work out a better tracking method which is more suitable for people's thinking. No worries to forget to start or stop stopwatch, just take a few seconds in leisure time, like playing game, select, tap, a whole day is tracked.\n\nWhen tracking time no longer has pressure but becomes relaxing, it solves the persistence problem easily. Even people don't has huge perseverance can be good at time management.\n\n[Features]\n• Super easy and rapid method to track time spending on every event\n• Custom classification of event\n    Not only by event type (eg. work, rest), but also by specific details (eg. Game, music), also by priorities (such as four quadrants)\n• Unique link of event and object, analyze event from different angle\n• Comment, record details of event like writing a diary\n• Statistics, analyze time occupation by pie or bar chart\n• Trend, check and compare events time spending in line chart by day or month\n• Goal, such as reach 10000h in 5 years on drawing\n• Backup data to iCloud or computer, never lose it\n• Selected color themes, and colorblind mode is added\n\n[Suitable for]\n• Students\n  Track time spending on subjects, analyze it and make a better study plan\n• Researchers\n  Track time spending on research, analyze and make a more efficient research plan\n• Managers\n  Who have many projects to do and needs to know time spending on every project\n• People with part-time jobs\n  Track time on every work and analyze earnings\n• Salespeople\n  Record time and frequency of contacting clients\n• New moms and dads\n  Get to know baby's regular life and make a plan to rest\n• People haven't know the value of time\n  Keep tracking time for a while, the statistics will shock you\n• People want to analyze time and make him better\n• People want to know what costs time\n• People are not satisfied with current situation, want to learn how to manage time and improve himself \n\n[Q & A]\nQ: Why named \"BlockyTime\"?\nA: Though time is continuous, for rapid tracking, we separate time into blocks by half an hour at the expense of accuracy. This period not only meets the need of statistics, but also is convenient for people to remember event.\n\nQ: Why make 30 minutes a block? This is not accurate.\nA: Statistics is meaningful only when people persist for a long time. Look at statistics in week or month, 30 minutes a blocks hardly make negative effects on analysis. Compared to spending more energy to make it accurate, track time quicker, take advantage of saved time on other things makes it better.\n\nQ: I have OCD, inaccuracy makes me uncomfortable.\nA: Just stand back and think about it, if you pursue the accuracy, after every time of record, should you add an event called \"Tracking time\"? Then it takes some time to track this one, so you have to record again, and then, endless loop…\n\nNever spend much time on tracking time, this is truly using time effectively.\n\n[Users' comments]\n“The most time-saving tool ever”\n“It makes me not to spend time on recording, reveals the essence of tracking. I must rate this truly efficient app”\n“One of my favourite time management/tracking apps!”\n“Very easy to use and intuitive”\n“Easiest time tracking tool I ever used”\n“Milestone app of time tracking” -- zhihu.com\n\nIf you like this app, just take one minute to rate it, we'll appreciate it!\n\n[Contact me]\nGot some ideas in your mind?

      "label": "iBend Pipe is the best conduit bending applicaiton on an iPhone, it helps you bend it right...the first time.  \n\nIt calculates the following bends using English or Metric measurements so you don’t have to:\n\n    -Offsets Bends (specify towards an obstruction or away from an obstruction)\n    -Rolling Offsets Bends  (specify towards an obstruction or away from an obstruction)\n    -Parallel Offset Adjustment\n    -3-Bend Saddles\n    -4-Bend Saddles\n    -Segment Bends\n    -90° Bends\n    -Back to Back 90° Bends\n    -Kicked 90°s Bends\n    -Compound 90° Bends around a Round Obstruction\n    -Compound 90° Bends around a Square Obstruction\n    -Compound 90° Bends around a Rectangular Obstruction\n\n+ HOW DOES IT WORK?\nSimply slide your finger to set measurements and results are updated instantly.  There is no need to navigate through multiple screens just to get a measurement.  Easy and intuitive to use, and measurement are displayed in big font to make it easy to read.\n\n+FAST ONE SCREEN CALCULATIONS\nSimple one screen calculations that show results \"live\" and on the fly as you slide your finger to enter values in.\n\n+ACCURATE CALCULATIONS\nCenterline bending radius - based calculations are also available.  These calculations offer greater accuracy when compared to bending multiplier methods.  Preposition your bends automatically.  All bends take shrink into account so you don't have to do any math.  What's faster - bending it twice or bending it right the first time?\n\n+PROTRACTOR FUNCTION INCLUDED\nUse the included protractor function to measure the angle as you bend.  Angle will be fed directly from your input screen to save you time.\n\n+BENDER PROFILES\nAlmost 100 different bender/pipe combinations included.  You have the ability to tweak or completely modify any of the combinations to match your bender on the field.\n\n+ WHO IS IT FOR?\nIf you consider yourself a craftsman that takes pride in his work, iBend Pipe is for you.  If other \"sparkies\" come to you when they have a difficult bend, this is for you.  If you want to have a smaller \"bone\"  pile, this is for you.  If you can write your name in conduit, this is for you.  From, a  1st year inside wireman apprentice to a seasoned “old timer” this app will save you time and material.\n\nInput fractions instead of converting to decimals and get results in fractions.\n\nThanks for all the great reviews, if you have any suggestions:\nsupport@ibendpipe.com"

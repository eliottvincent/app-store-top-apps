For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

Sometimes it's not easy to see your upcoming shift schedule very clearly, especially if your shifts don't fall into the traditional working week. Shift Worker solves this problem and turns the frustrating task of entry into a quick and easy experience.\n\nShift Worker allows you to create your own types of shifts by combining visually-attractive icons with letters/numbers so that they can be easily identified at a glance. By including a range of icons (such as suns and stars for day and night shifts) in a variety of colors, any combination is possible for all types of shifts.\n\nEntering shifts can be done quickly by simply selecting a type of shift and tapping on each date it occurs. An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!\n\nIn addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. \n\nShift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date. Notes can be used anytime additional information needs to be added to a date.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Create a virtually unlimited amount of shift types\n- Enter shifts on the calendar months in advance in seconds\n- Add your rotation and automatically fill the calendar in a few simple steps\n- Show friends and family shifts using multiple calendars\n- View the calendar in timeline format to see your shift flow at a glance\n- Create colored personalized notes for any date on the calendar\n- Include week of year or week 1/2 alternating pattern on calendar\n- Jump to any month by using the \"Goto\" button\n- Save a month's worth of shifts to your background\n- Share your shifts to others via email, MMS, Facebook or Twitter\n- Import other Shift Worker shifts and view them all within the one app\n- No in-app purchases!\n- No ads!"

We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase."

      "label": "BimmerLink is the direct link to your BMW or MINI. Using one of the supported OBD adapters you can read trouble codes or display sensor values in realtime, check the current state of the DPF in your car or register a new battery after replacement. BimmerLink even allows you to remotely control the exhaust flap or mute the Active Sound Design in your car.\n\nREAD AND CLEAR TROUBLE CODES\nDiagnose your car as would otherwise be possible only by your Service Partner. In contrast to generic OBD apps that read emission related errors only, BimmerLink allows you to read and clear trouble codes from ALL control units in your car.\n\nDISPLAY REALTIME SENSOR VALUES\nBimmerLink provides a big selection of values like oil temperature or boost pressure. Keep an eye on all the important parameters of your car with a personalized dashboard.\n\nEXHAUST FLAP REMOTE CONTROL*\nTake control over the exhaust flap in your car and decide yourself, whether it should be closed or open.\n\nACTIVE SOUND DESIGN**\nIf you do not like the artificial engine sound generated in your car, just mute the Active Sound Design with BimmerLink.\n\nSOUND TUNING***\nThe “Sound Tuning” option allows you to disable the “exhaust burble“ in cars equipped with the S55 engine (M2 Competition, M3, M4).\n\nDPF REGENERATION****\nBimmerLink allows you to check the current state of the diesel particulate filter in your car. Find out when the last regeneration took place or how much ash has accumulated in the filter and start a regeneration with the touch of a button.\n\nBATTERY REGISTRATION\nIf you want to replace the battery in your car, this has to be registered in the engine control unit and BimmerLink allows you to do this yourself now.\n\nPARKING BRAKE SERVICE MODE\nBimmerLink allows you to activate the service mode for the electromechanical parking brake.\n\nSERVICE RESET\nReset the service display in your car after carrying out maintenance work like a brake pad replacement or an engine oil change.\n\nREQUIRED ACCESSORIES\nTo use the app one of the supported Bluetooth or WiFi OBD adapters or cables is required.

Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for.

It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

      "label": "CalenGoo gives you a fast and easy way to access and modify your Google Calendar with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. It can also be used when you have no Internet connection, using the cached data. Changes are saved and uploaded the next time you are connected.\n\nThe calendar view is similar to the web view of Google Calendar. Events are displayed using the same calendar colors that you use in your Google Calendar, even Google's event colors are supported (please see http://www.calengoo.com/cc ). It also recognizes which calendars are visible and which are hidden. So the view should match the view of your Google Calendar as much as possible. \n\nCalenGoo also has a month view similar to that of Google Calendar. It can be zoomed and panned to quickly get an overview over the events of a month. Zooming the month is done by using the two-finger-zoom gesture that you know from Safari and the photo application. A double tap opens the tapped day.\n\nIt also supports the same kinds of recurrence rules as Google Calendar and displays recurring events correctly even when you are offline or scroll far into the future.\n\nYou can also use Google Calendar's feature to invite people to events and see their status (accepted, declined, maybe, no answer). They will get an invitation email with links to e.g. accept or decline the invitation.\n\nGoogle Calendar has an integrated task list, called Google Tasks. Tasks with a due date are displayed on the corresponding days of the calendar. CalenGoo can do the same, it can sync this list, display your tasks in the calendar views and in a list view and it even makes your tasks available offline. You can edit and add tasks and the changes will be synced with Google Tasks.\n\nYou either need a (free) Google Calendar account to use this app or you can use it with your iOS calendars. However using it with Google Calendar has a few advantages.\n\nTo get more information, screenshots and a tutorial, please go to http://www.calengoo.com\n\nIf you have any problems or suggestions, please send an email to calengoo@dgunia.de or take a look at CalenGoo's support website to get help.\n\nIf you think the font is too small and hard to read, you can increase the font size of all calendar views in the settings under \"Settings\", \"Display and Use\".\n\nFeatures ( http://www.calengoo.com ):\n\n- Drag&drop to quickly copy and move events\n- Templates to quickly create similar events again. They can even be combined, e.g. one template for the location of an event and another for the attendees\n- Print/PDF function to print the day, week, month or agenda view via AirPrint or to email it as a PDF file\n- Supports the same recurrence rules as Google Calendar\n- Supports Google Calendar's event colors when syncing via OAuth2\n- Icons can be assigned to Google Calendar events\n- Date/time can be entered using the iOS wheels or by using a keypad\n- Fast search function\n- Show/edit iOS calendars in addition to Google calendars (or instead of Google calendars)\n- Sync with Google Tasks and iOS Reminders\n- Reminders can be snoozed and they can be (optionally) repeated every minute\n- Birthdays and anniversaries of your contacts can be displayed\n- Zoomable month view, which can be configured to scroll horizontally (month by month) or vertically (week by week)\n- Events can be linked to contacts\n- Floating events and completable events\n- Photos and PDF files can be created and attached to events (via Google Drive)\n- Calendar selection bar to quickly show and hide single calendars\n- The location of an event can be opened with Apple Maps, Google Maps, Navigon, TomTom, Skobbler, Sygic, iGo or Waze\n- View/edit calendars that are shared with others via Google Calendar\n- Many configuration options to change the way the app looks and works"

      "label": "SA Group Text is the most efficient way to send group messages. You can add recipient names and phone numbers in an Excel file. You can enter static or personalized text messages right in the Excel spreadsheet. For example, if you enter “Hi {first name}, ...” in a message, the app will take the first name of the recipients and personalize the message, generating text such as “Hi David, …” , “Hi Michael, …”…\n\nYou can use an Excel spreadsheet again without editing the spreadsheet on your computer. You can just pick an Excel file, type in a quick message and send it. It is similar to sending a message to a group.\n\nSA Group Text is also an easy way to send text messages to the contacts on your iPhone. Just pick groups or individual contacts, type in a static or personalized message and send it.\n\nWho uses SA Group Text ?\n1) Small Businesses\n2) Religious Groups\n3) Retail\n4) Nightlife - Bars & Nightclubs\n5) Restaurants\n6) Banks/Financial Institutions\n7) Insurance Companies\n8) Event Marketers (With hundreds (or even thousands) of people attending your events)\n9) Traditional Media\n10) Schools\n11) Social Groups\n12) Real Estate\n\nWith SA Group Text you can :\n1. Import group SMS from an Excel file via USB/WiFi/Email.\n2. Create your own groups in an Excel spreadsheet and send messages to them.\n3. Send unsent messages . If the app is terminated while sending group SMS, the sending task will be continued next time you launch the app..\n4. Insert tags ({nickname},{firstname},{lastname},{nickname},{company} etc) in your text message in order to create personalized messages. When you use this function, each message has a personal touch. For example:\n    Dear {firstname}, Welcome to our dinner party.\n5. Use MS Excel 2003 / 2007 / 2010 , OpenOffice.org , Apple Numbers or any other Excel-compatible applications to create your group text messages. Be sure to save as an Excel 97-2003 Workbook.\n6. Export an Excel template , and use it to create your own Excel file.\n7. Send SMS to as many recipients as you need within your Excel file \n8. Limit the number of recipients per message. The app will split a large message into multiple separate messages.\n9. Create a formatted Excel file easily. The file can contain only two columns : Mobile and Message. You can find more example spreadsheets on the app’s website.\n10. Create flexible group SMS in your spreadsheet. \nFor example “{family} Family – Practice Tomorrow at 5pm for little {kidname}!”  becomes “David Family – Practice Tomorrow at 5pm for little Johnny!”. The names change over and over again.\n11. Create contact groups, you can create in-app groups for Exchange contacts.\n12. Choose contacts organized in groups, companies, job titles and cities.\n13. Preview messages before sending them out.\n14. Skip duplicated phone numbers and messages.\n15. The lite version has ads.  \n16. Send online sms, supporting Twilio and Nexmo. \n17. Find a way to send messages without user interaction, please contact to samyuservice@gmail.com for details.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE :\nPlease check the setting of \"Group Messaging\" on the iPhone settings. If the option is available, set it to OFF (yes OFF) to be able to send to large groups. If it's on, the iPhone will try to send MMS instead of SMS and will fail to send to large groups.\n\nMore detail and up-to-date help guides are available in samapp.com."

We all have good intentions but we need a bit of encouragement here and there. Doing the laundry is an epic feat of stamina so why not get stamina points for it?!\n\nThe to-do list is fully-featured and supports repeating tasks, displays reminders for overdue events and allows time-critical events to be assigned to specific days, while more aspirational quests can be set to \"someday\" so you don't lose sight of your goals. And each task completed is destroyed by your avatar, so get your Undead Warrior to beat-up your laundry, or your Treeman to headbutt your overspilling inbox.\n\nThe app is supplied with 5 animated avatars which grow in characteristics that represent your own life. Will you be a Maiden of Juggled Priorities, or a King of Win? The lifestyle you lead will decide."

      "label": "BlockyTime, A simple time logger no need to tap Start/Stop.\n\n### App Store Featured of 2016 in China & HongKong ###\n### Top 10 Productivity apps in China ###\n\nEverybody has his own demand on tracking time, but most people can't persist on it for long time because the traditional time-tracking App is way too professional, and it costs too much energy to use a stopwatch.\n\nBlockyTime is very different from traditional time-tracking App, it never needs to tap \"Start/Stop\". Months of research of users experience made us to work out a better tracking method which is more suitable for people's thinking. No worries to forget to start or stop stopwatch, just take a few seconds in leisure time, like playing game, select, tap, a whole day is tracked.\n\nWhen tracking time no longer has pressure but becomes relaxing, it solves the persistence problem easily. Even people don't has huge perseverance can be good at time management.\n\n[Features]\n• Super easy and rapid method to track time spending on every event\n• Custom classification of event\n    Not only by event type (eg. work, rest), but also by specific details (eg. Game, music), also by priorities (such as four quadrants)\n• Unique link of event and object, analyze event from different angle\n• Comment, record details of event like writing a diary\n• Statistics, analyze time occupation by pie or bar chart\n• Trend, check and compare events time spending in line chart by day or month\n• Goal, such as reach 10000h in 5 years on drawing\n• Backup data to iCloud or computer, never lose it\n• Selected color themes, and colorblind mode is added\n\n[Suitable for]\n• Students\n  Track time spending on subjects, analyze it and make a better study plan\n• Researchers\n  Track time spending on research, analyze and make a more efficient research plan\n• Managers\n  Who have many projects to do and needs to know time spending on every project\n• People with part-time jobs\n  Track time on every work and analyze earnings\n• Salespeople\n  Record time and frequency of contacting clients\n• New moms and dads\n  Get to know baby's regular life and make a plan to rest\n• People haven't know the value of time\n  Keep tracking time for a while, the statistics will shock you\n• People want to analyze time and make him better\n• People want to know what costs time\n• People are not satisfied with current situation, want to learn how to manage time and improve himself \n\n[Q & A]\nQ: Why named \"BlockyTime\"?\nA: Though time is continuous, for rapid tracking, we separate time into blocks by half an hour at the expense of accuracy. This period not only meets the need of statistics, but also is convenient for people to remember event.\n\nQ: Why make 30 minutes a block? This is not accurate.\nA: Statistics is meaningful only when people persist for a long time. Look at statistics in week or month, 30 minutes a blocks hardly make negative effects on analysis. Compared to spending more energy to make it accurate, track time quicker, take advantage of saved time on other things makes it better.\n\nQ: I have OCD, inaccuracy makes me uncomfortable.\nA: Just stand back and think about it, if you pursue the accuracy, after every time of record, should you add an event called \"Tracking time\"? Then it takes some time to track this one, so you have to record again, and then, endless loop…\n\nNever spend much time on tracking time, this is truly using time effectively.\n\n[Users' comments]\n“The most time-saving tool ever”\n“It makes me not to spend time on recording, reveals the essence of tracking. I must rate this truly efficient app”\n“One of my favourite time management/tracking apps!”\n“Very easy to use and intuitive”\n“Easiest time tracking tool I ever used”\n“Milestone app of time tracking” -- zhihu.com\n\nIf you like this app, just take one minute to rate it, we'll appreciate it!\n\n[Contact me]\nGot some ideas in your mind?

The Do Less To-Do List\n\nBento helps you do less, but more meaningful tasks.\nWe all have plenty of to-dos on our list and our mission is to reduce task overwhelm to maximize achievement.\n\nBento doesn't replace your to-do list, it complements it!\nOne of the biggest productivity issues is prioritization - so we've limited you to 3 tasks per Bento box.\n\n---\n\nSo, how does Bento work?\n\nTASK LIMITS\n\nBento limits you to 3 tasks per box - to help you do less, but more meaningful to-dos. We limit how many boxes you can open to 7 boxes in total, to help you plan only what is most important. Our mission is to reduce task overwhelm to maximize achievement.\n\nSMALL, MEDIUM & LARGE TASKS\n\nMuch like a box for sushi, Bento allows you to create small, medium, and large tasks helping you to organize your tasks in sizeable chunks for better completion. The best productivity experts recommend reducing your workload for better per-task performance.\n\n3 ENERGY-BASED WORKFLOWS\n\nOnce you have your 3 priority tasks. We've created 3 workflows, Eat That Frog, Climb The Summit, and the Slow Burn to help you best order your day for success and energy.\n\nSINGLE-TASK FOCUS MODE\n\nTo truly focus, we need fewer distractions. Blocking out attention to focus on just your key task can make a huge difference. Inside Bento, we have a single-task focus mode combined with a countdown timer for deep focus work states.\n\nDARK & LIGHT MODE\n\nEach box can be customized with an emoji alongside stunningly animated themes. Each theme has a light mode and dark mode, for optimal productivity.\n\n6 BEAUTIFULLY ANIMATED THEMES\n\nRelaxing Japanese-themed backgrounds for a soothing way to handle your most meaningful tasks.\n\n---\n\nBento can be used in a variety of ways, here are a few recommendations:\n\n- Create a daily Bento to plan your 3 priority tasks\n- Plan the full week by adding up to 7 Bento boxes\n- Build a week, month, and yearly goals list for planning ahead\n\nThe Bento app is the best and most effective place to implement the Bento Methodology, a new mindful way to approach task management. Bento is now optimised for iPad as part of a single universal app for all your iOS devices.\n\n---\n\nQUESTIONS\n\nReach out on Twitter @BentoMethod or email bento@keepproductive.com for any help.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\n\nFind the full privacy policy here: https://www.bentomethod.com/privacy"

      "label": "SSL Checker is developed for all cyber‑security enthusiasts and website owners who have websites with Secure Socket Layer certificate installed. With this app, you can quickly check current SSL status of any host, and if there is any issue with the certificate, it will tell you what it is about. This app is capable of identifying when the certificate is self‑signed, not issued for the particular checked host, or has expired. Whenever you check a host, you can also start monitoring it. By monitoring, the app will detect changes on that host's certificate, and also keep track of its expiration date. Whenever a SSL certificate for any of the monitored host is about to expire, it will send you a notification to remind you to renew it.  This way, you can eliminate the chances of forgetting about renewing the certificate for your host on time.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Validates SSL quickly\n- Monitors selected hosts for SSL issues\n- Notifies when SSL is about to expire\n\nSSL Checker is a simple, yet powerful, iOS app that specifically aims to assist website owners from unknowingly or accidentally letting their SSL certificate to expire. With a growing use of SSL to secure the Web, keeping track of certificate expiry has become one of the growing concerns among the developers. This app takes that headache out of the way, by notifying you when the certificate for any of the hosts that you are monitoring is about to expire. Besides, it also color codes the hosts whose SSL are getting close to expiry, so you know when you should start worrying about renewing it.\n\nWhile many SSL issuers currently do notify the hosts, this notification is usually sent out through an e‑mail. With the number of promotional e-mails these issuers send out periodically, it is easy to oversee or ignore the important e‑mails with SSL expiry notice, resulting in expiry of the SSL. To prevent this, using this app as a backup for receiving SSL-expiry notification is highly recommended.\n\nWe hope you find this app useful."

      "label": "Get the app that Macworld says \"deserves a spot on your iPhone\"!\n\nMAKE LISTS OF ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING\n\nPaperless is a simple but powerful app for making lists. Use it to create to do lists, make grocery lists, take notes, write an outline of a story, prepare notes for a presentation, make a list of gift ideas, plan a vacation... or anything else you'd want to make a list for.\n\n\nBEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED\n\nAssign a fun icon to each of your lists - there are over 450 to choose from. You can also select from 30 themes to customize the app's design to your liking.\n\n\nSIMPLE AND VERSATILE\n\nPaperless is easy to use with a clean, elegant and well thought out interface. Each list can either be a checklist or a regular list without checkboxes, making a wide variety of uses possible.\n\n\nREALLY HELPS YOU GET THINGS DONE\n\nFor checklists and todo lists, many people prefer using Paperless over traditional \"getting things done\" apps - or, they use it in addition to one. There are no due dates or priority settings, so you're left to focus on the actual tasks at hand, rather than waste time changing those settings when your priorities change. Instead, if a particular task becomes important, you can simply move it to the top of the list.\n\n\nAUTOMATIC BACKUP AND SYNCING\n\nAutomatically backup your lists and sync them between iOS devices via a free Dropbox account.\n\n\nPOWERFUL FEATURES\n\n- send lists via email, others can import your list into their copy of Paperless\n- send a plain text version of a list via iMessage, or copy it into another app\n- easily duplicate lists\n- manually reorder lists and list items\n- sort list items alphabetically\n- copy and move items from one list to another\n- comprehensive search\n- passcode lock\n\n\nPRAISED BY THE PRESS\n\n\"Paperless deserves a spot on your iPhone\" - Lex Friedman, Macworld (4.5 out of 5 mice rating)\n\n\"Paperless has a permanent spot on the first page of my iPhone's home screen... it will probably earn a similar spot on yours.\" - Marianne Schultz, AppShopper\n\n\"... a good way to ensure things get done at your own pace, free of the disappointment of missing deadlines.\" - Nick Spence, Macworld UK\n\n\"I've been trying many To Do apps since iPhone 1.0 -- from the expensive Things to Toodledo and others -- and I don't use any of them regularly. Most just require too much effort. Paperless is the first one I've found that hits that sweet spot between being simple enough you'll actually use it and powerful enough to be useful.\" - Marc Zeedar, REALbasic Developer Magazine (4.8 out of 5 rating)\n\n\"This is one nice-looking list / task app... As a basic list app, the beautiful Paperless reigns supreme.\" - Bonnie Eisenman, 148apps.com (4 out of 5 rating)\n\n\nPRAISED BY USERS\n\n\"Best app ever - The most incredibly useful app I've come across. Simple, effective and bloody marvelous!!!\"\n\n\"The simplicity of the interface and the flexibility given to the user is perfection.\"\n\n\"Simply loved it - Best app I've ever downloaded, my life is so organized now! ...\"\n\n\"After having tried a good deal of apps to get myself more organized - both free and paid - it is clear that this tops them all. Other apps presented a kind of novelty; I could fool myself into thinking that I was more organized, but it was never long before I abandoned them because it was obvious that they consumed unnecessary time. Paperless, however, has truly helped. It is streamlined, it is simple, it is sumptuous\"\n\n\nPLEASE RATE AND REVIEW\n\nIf you love Paperless, please leave a review and star rating. Thank you!"

      "label": "Pool Chem Dose Calculator will calculate the exact chemical dose needed for 38 chemicals in 11 categories for any size pool in US Imperial or Metric measures. To use it you enter the pool volume in gallons or liters, choose US Imperial or Metric, select which item you want to change from the drop down list and then enter the desired change in ppm or mg/l. Pool Chem Dose Calculator then lists all of the chemicals that can be used for that item change and the doses for each one. It only shows 3 chemicals on the screen. If there are more than 3 for an item, you can scroll down the list.\n\nNo brand names, no sales just the exact dose of the chemical you want to use by chemical name. Use it while you are at a pool or in the field to find out how much chemical to add to make a correction or increase or decrease a condition.\n\nSelect from the following items: \n\nIncrease Chlorine, 15 chemicals Increase Bromine 2 chemicals\nIncrease Alkalinity 3 chemicals Decrease Alkalinity 2 chemicals\nIncrease Hardness 2 chemicals Increase CYA 2 chemicals\nIncrease Oxidizer 1 chemical Decrease Chlorine 6 chemicals\nIncrease Salt 1 chemical Increase Borate 3 chemicals\nIncrease Copper 1 chemical.\n\nFor example, if you want to Increase Chlorine by 3 ppm in a 14,750 gallon pool, enter 14750, select US Imperial, select Increase Chlorine from the drop down menu and enter 3.0 in ppm. Instantly see the amounts needed to get 3.0 ppm chlorine in that pool for 15 types of chlorine. Makes it easy to compare and see which might be cheaper to use or make a substitution. \n\nYou can also use the Pool Chem Dose Calculator to figure out the change to a water condition if you add an amount of chemical. For instance suppose you have a 15,000 gallon pool and you want to know how much the free chlorine will increase if you add a gallon of 10% liquid chlorine. No problem, just enter the pool volume, select US Imperial, select Increase Chlorine and then enter an amount for ppm. Keep changing the ppm up or down until the dose amount for Chlorine 10% gets near 128 fl oz or 4 qts.\n\nSaves money because you get the exact dose for that pool – no more guessing. Have an emergency where too much chlorine was added and now you need to neutralize the chlorine in the pool? No problem, Just enter the pool volume, US or Metric, select Decrease Chlorine and enter the amount of chlorine you want neutralized and you get the amounts needed for 6 chlorine neutralizers. You will find this app invaluable."

      "label": "One evening, after a very long week of shows we were sat in the office looking at the show times wishing the running times would work them selves out (we've all been there), it was at this moment this show timing app was created. Welcome to the future of show timing without multiple stop watches and reminder alarms. Now you can start your show with the press of one button and the app does the rest. With unlimited Acts and Intervals in any configuration that you like! , just set your show structure, tell it your interval duration(s) and away you go. \n\nShow StopWatch also handles separate in act timers and show stops, adjusting the running and playing times accordingly! Once you have completed a show you can then email the times with a simple button press or copy them your clipboard as well as storing them for later. \n\nThere is also the option to have pre show notifications for back stage calls and the same again in the interval so you don't have to spend all your time looking at the clock. The app will also run in the back ground of your phone if for what ever reason you need to use your phone for something else (certainly not facebook, for those long scenes with no cues) while its running. \n\nThis app was created by stage managers for stage managers, it is currently being used by a number of productions and companies including UK Tours, West End shows and Repertory Theatres. It will continue to be a working development so any thing you come across that you think ‘it would be great if’ please don't hesitate to get in contact! It became apparent while testing how tiny details make a difference to everyone so we have tried to incorporate them all, for example; the interval timer shows both time elapsed and remaining, and is in green until you start over running when it goes red (because how often do you go up on time), and the ability to access times so far, for those quiet moments where you are able to start the show report early!\n\nThis app has not been made to replace your note book, still write times down if you get a chance, its simply to try and make life easier at the end of the show! Have a play, get to know it and let us know how you get on!\n\nIf you want to get in contact email me at jackrlord@gmail.com"

Calculate pressure drop for the selected pipe section. \n\n\n#### Obtain required pipe diameter instantly\n\nThe application provides a quick and simple way to obtain required pipe diameter when designing natural gas piping systems. \n\nOnly some basic user input is required (heat output and pipe length) and the result is instantaneous and accurate. \n\n\n#### Wide range of conditions\n\nThe application allows to perform calculations at a wide range of conditions, as gas lower heating value, temperature, pressure and location altitude can be set individually in order to get accurate results. \n\n\n#### Calculate pressure drop easily\n\nAfter a quick estimate of the recommended standard or nominal pipe size, the user can choose their own diameter, customize pipe material and define fittings and valves to calculate volume flow rate, velocity and pressure drop. The app will notify the user if their chosen diameter is too small. \n\n\n#### Metric and Imperial units\n\nNatural Gas Pipe Size app can perform calculations using metric or imperial units. \n\n\n#### Features\n\n- Provides required pipe diameter for a pipe section in an instant;\n- Recommended diameter is displayed as a standard DN or nominal NPS;\n- Gas working pressure and temperature can be specified;\n- Wide range of working conditions (heat output, pressure and temperature);\n- Suitable for individual (home) as well as larger, industrial applications;\n- Different predefined materials can be selected;\n- Fittings and valves can be selected from the list;\n- Displays natural gas volume flow rate and pressure drop for selected pipe section;\n- Suggests whether the selected pipe diameter might be too small;\n- Metric and imperial units;\n- No data connection required to perform calculations;\n- No ads, no in-app purchases;\n\n\n#### Note\n\nThe application displays results for a pipe section. Calculations for multiple pipe sections should be performed separately.\n\n------\n\n#### Some reviews\n\nNatural Gas Pipe Size: pipe sizing & pressure drop calculation for natural gas installations\n\nVery helpful natural gas pipe sizing.... \n\nI really like this version for sizing natural gas lines. Imperial units are certainly appreciated. Just be sure to reset the fittings section for each section of pipe you checking. \n\n5 stars by Cod Peace | 09 Feb 2016\n\n----------\n\nErdgasleitung: Rohr Dimensionierung und Druckverlust-Berechnung für Erdgasanlagen\n\nErdgasleitung \n\nIch benutze diese App sehr viel und immer mit Erfolg.\nHabe die Angaben oft nachgerechnet und sie stimmten immer. \n\n5 stars by MOMOG62 | 10 Dec 2013"

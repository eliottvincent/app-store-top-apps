For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

Shift Worker solves this problem and turns the frustrating task of entry into a quick and easy experience.\n\nShift Worker allows you to create your own types of shifts by combining visually-attractive icons with letters/numbers so that they can be easily identified at a glance.

An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!\n\nIn addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. \n\nShift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date. Notes can be used anytime additional information needs to be added to a date.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Create a virtually unlimited amount of shift types\n- Enter shifts on the calendar months in advance in seconds\n- Add your rotation and automatically fill the calendar in a few simple steps\n- Show friends and family shifts using multiple calendars\n- View the calendar in timeline format to see your shift flow at a glance\n- Create colored personalized notes for any date on the calendar\n- Include week of year or week 1/2 alternating pattern on calendar\n- Jump to any month by using the \"Goto\" button\n- Save a month's worth of shifts to your background\n- Share your shifts to others via email, MMS, Facebook or Twitter\n- Import other Shift Worker shifts and view them all within the one app\n- No in-app purchases!\n- No ads!"

Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

The adjustable swing arc should assume every possible shape, as the maximum distance could be different to each direction.\n2. I would like to wake up even if I sleep like a log. Also in case of other problems like poor GPS accuracy or power supply drain.\n\nI'm convinced, with this App your anchor watch will be improved in many ways!\n\nFor sure you know the problem after you set the anchor successfully, you would like to set an Anchor Alarm for your anchor-watch, but later at night the wind shifts from East to West, and exactly in West there is a nasty shoal. Well, with Anchor Alarm you've the ability to set your swing shape in advance as individually as specific for each situation!\n\nAll feature at a glance:\n§ Individual shapes instead of a fix swing arc\n§ Alarm sound which will wake you\n§ Ship dimensions in true-to-scale representation in the map\n§ Optional alarm on low battery or other power supply issues\n§ Optional alarm on poor GPS accuracy\n§ Optional alarm on low volume / silent mode\n§ Optional alarm if headset is connected\n§ All alarms are active in the background and even if you lock your iPhone.\n\nApple Disclaimer\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. So please do not forget your 12V charger ;-)"

Use the application to store items such as URLs, passwords, account information, credit card numbers, postal addresses, or other text.\n\nMain features:\n\n- Store different types of data. The different types of items you can use to store your personal data are URL, password, and text.\n- Support for multiple private data files.\n- Password management. Passwords can be generated based on your own rules, optionally stored in an encrypted format, and easily retrieved when required.\n- Organize data. Related data can be stored in the same folder. For example, all the information about a credit card account can be kept in one folder for easy access.\n- Data security. You can restrict access to your personal data with a master password which iPIK will use to strongly encrypt the data.\n- Recycle bin. This provides a safety net when deleting items or folders as you can restore them back to their original location.\n- Search facility.

      "label": "SA Group Text is the most efficient way to send group messages. You can add recipient names and phone numbers in an Excel file. You can enter static or personalized text messages right in the Excel spreadsheet. For example, if you enter “Hi {first name}, ...” in a message, the app will take the first name of the recipients and personalize the message, generating text such as “Hi David, …” , “Hi Michael, …”…\n\nYou can use an Excel spreadsheet again without editing the spreadsheet on your computer. You can just pick an Excel file, type in a quick message and send it. It is similar to sending a message to a group.\n\nSA Group Text is also an easy way to send text messages to the contacts on your iPhone. Just pick groups or individual contacts, type in a static or personalized message and send it.\n\nWho uses SA Group Text ?\n1) Small Businesses\n2) Religious Groups\n3) Retail\n4) Nightlife - Bars & Nightclubs\n5) Restaurants\n6) Banks/Financial Institutions\n7) Insurance Companies\n8) Event Marketers (With hundreds (or even thousands) of people attending your events)\n9) Traditional Media\n10) Schools\n11) Social Groups\n12) Real Estate\n\nWith SA Group Text you can :\n1. Import group SMS from an Excel file via USB/WiFi/Email.\n2. Create your own groups in an Excel spreadsheet and send messages to them.\n3. Send unsent messages . If the app is terminated while sending group SMS, the sending task will be continued next time you launch the app..\n4. Insert tags ({nickname},{firstname},{lastname},{nickname},{company} etc) in your text message in order to create personalized messages. When you use this function, each message has a personal touch. For example:\n    Dear {firstname}, Welcome to our dinner party.\n5. Use MS Excel 2003 / 2007 / 2010 , OpenOffice.org , Apple Numbers or any other Excel-compatible applications to create your group text messages. Be sure to save as an Excel 97-2003 Workbook.\n6. Export an Excel template , and use it to create your own Excel file.\n7. Send SMS to as many recipients as you need within your Excel file \n8. Limit the number of recipients per message. The app will split a large message into multiple separate messages.\n9. Create a formatted Excel file easily. The file can contain only two columns : Mobile and Message. You can find more example spreadsheets on the app’s website.\n10. Create flexible group SMS in your spreadsheet. \nFor example “{family} Family – Practice Tomorrow at 5pm for little {kidname}!”  becomes “David Family – Practice Tomorrow at 5pm for little Johnny!”. The names change over and over again.\n11. Create contact groups, you can create in-app groups for Exchange contacts.\n12. Choose contacts organized in groups, companies, job titles and cities.\n13. Preview messages before sending them out.\n14. Skip duplicated phone numbers and messages.\n15. The lite version has ads.  \n16. Send online sms, supporting Twilio and Nexmo. \n17. Find a way to send messages without user interaction, please contact to samyuservice@gmail.com for details.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE :\nPlease check the setting of \"Group Messaging\" on the iPhone settings. If the option is available, set it to OFF (yes OFF) to be able to send to large groups. If it's on, the iPhone will try to send MMS instead of SMS and will fail to send to large groups.\n\nMore detail and up-to-date help guides are available in samapp.com."

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nGet Started\n• Interactive tutorial project\n• Keep each manuscript and supporting materials in a self-contained project\n• Import Word, RTF, Final Draft and plain text files\n• Easily split imported text into separate sections\n\nGet Writing\n• Write your manuscript in sections of any size\n• View all sections as a single text using the “Draft Navigator” (iPad only)\n• Quickly navigate sections using the “binder” sidebar\n• Format with fonts and presets\n• Comments, footnotes, links and highlights\n• Simple bullets and lists\n• Insert images\n• Pinch-zoom to resize text\n• Full-screen mode (iPad only)\n• Typewriter scrolling mode keeps typed text center-screen (iPad only)\n• Write a screenplay using scriptwriting mode\n• Live word and character counts\n• Set word and character count targets\n• Find and replace\n• Customizable keyboard row provides quick-access buttons for formatting, navigation and punctuation\n• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for external keyboard users\n• Dark mode\n\nFind Your Structure\n• Write in any order and reorganize later\n• Write a synopsis for any text section and see it in the outline\n• Expand, collapse and drill down into sections of your project\n• Rearrange sections as index cards on the corkboard (iPad only)\n• Project-wide search\n• Track ideas using labels and status\n• Apply custom icons to your sections\n\nRefer to Research\n• Import research material such as image, PDF and media files\n• View research files or other sections right alongside your writing (iPad only)\n• Every section has its own notes area for jotting down ideas\n• Supports multi-tasking split screen mode (supported devices only)\n\nShare Your Work\n• Compile to a single document for sharing or printing\n• Use different formatting in your exported or printed document\n• Export to Word, RTF, Final Draft, PDF or plain text\n• Convert rich text to Markdown for sharing with Markdown apps\n• Create and email zipped backups of your projects\n\nWork Anywhere\n• Use Dropbox to sync between devices and with the macOS and Windows versions of Scrivener*\n• Copy projects between devices via iTunes\n\n* Requires a Dropbox account (not compatible with iCloud).\n\nSUPPORT\nYou can contact us at ios.support@literatureandlatte.com, visit our forums at http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum, or find us @scrivenerapp on Twitter."

We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase."

Sharp Mind induces optimized mental states ideal for school, exam preparation, confidence, problem solving, memory, creativity, confidence and learning. Combine Binaural Tones with iTunes Music, Audiobooks, Spotify * Built-in iTunes Playlist Creator * 17 Soothing Ambient Backgrounds and 10 Gentle Alarm Sounds. * Universal App * iPhone and iPad UIs HD&SD * Headphones/Earbuds must be worn for Binaural Tones to be Effective. \n\nTo combine Brainwaves and Ambience with Audio from Another App use Background Source option #5 on the Background Settings, 'Ambience + Other App'.  \n\nTo use just Brainwaves and Audio from Another App use the \"No Background\" option for the Background Source.\n\nWarning: These are powerful brainwave entrainment programs and should never be used while driving or operating machinery.\n\nBrainWave Sharp Mind is unlike any other brainwave entrainment application.  Other brainwave and binaural beat applications use only a single brainwave frequency and carrier signal.  The Sharp Mind Progressive Brainwave Entrainment algorithms use a series of brainwave programs, multiple frequencies and carrier waves to gently bring your brainwave frequencies to your desired state using a more natural and effective frequency progression.\n\n*** Advanced Features ***\n\n - Multiple Brainwave programs each specially designed to elevate you to a unique mental state.\n\n - Multiple ambient background sounds to choose from.\n\n - Adjustable Brainwave Intensity - The intensity of the brainwaves can be adjusted independently of the ambient background sound.  This allows you to set the brainwave volume to your comfort level.  The application will also save your preference for future use.\n\n - Adjustable ambient background volume.\n\n - Visual timer countdown indicator.\n\n - Automatic saving of preferred brainwave entrainment program and ambient background sounds.\n\n - Ability to create your own custom time option.\n\n\n*** Programs Included ***\n\n - Brain Energizer: Takes you through a series of brainwave programs and progressively elevates your level of alertness.\n\n - High Beta Concentration: Designed to put your mind into the ultimate state of focus and concentration.  Ideal when you need to block out surrounding distractions and study.\n\n - Creative Brainstorming:  A series of brainwave programs that elevates your mind to a state of open-mindedness and creativity.  Perfect for when you're stuck on a problem or are having difficulty coming up with an idea.  Sit back and plug into this program to completely open your mind.\n\n - Creative Problem Solving:  The ultimate combination of focus and creativity achieved through a series of brainwave programs and frequency mixes.\n\n - Gamma Memory Boost:  This program was designed to be used whenever you feel like taking a break and letting what you've just learned sink in.  This will help you maximize memory recall.\n\n - Beta Confidence Boost:  Designed to be taken before a test or presentation.  The other programs help you prepare, solve problems, come up with ideas and remember what you've learned.  \n\nSharp Mind also includes:\n\n- Creative Thinking\n- Lateral Thinking\n- Convergent Thinking\n- Deductive Thinking\n- Centered Mind\n- Focus/Concentration\n- Gamma Creativity Boost\n- Evening Memory Boost\n- Full Beta Spectrum\n- Full Gamma Spectrum\n\n* How Binaural Brainwave Entrainment Works *\n\nThis app uses advanced Binaural Brainwave Entrainment to stimulate brainwave frequencies associated with different states of mind.  These brainwave frequencies are in most cases inaudible and therefore must be induced through the use of binaural tones.  In this process two different tones are played, one for one ear, and one for the other (headphones or earbuds must be used).  When processing these two different tones the human brain perceives the difference as a beat matching the target brainwave frequency."

The user of the app is responsible for double checking the results.  Please ensure that all default values (prices, product densities, etc.) are to your liking before calculating.\n\nDo you want to know how much a fertilizer blend will cost per ton?  Per acre?  Liquid or dry blends?  This is the app for you!  It was designed by farmers for farmers and others involved in the agricultural world.  To get you started it includes some common fertilizers, but you can edit the products and add your own.\n\nWorking the app couldn’t be easier.  Start a blend, specify how many pounds per acre of each element that you’d like to apply, and then specify which products you want to use in the blend.  That’s it and you’re ready to calculate!  But what if you want to have a final blend that includes two particular products for the same element?  Just choose both products and specify what percentage of each you want in the final product (i.e. 65% of N Product 1 and 35% of N Product 2).  Once you’re ready and press ‘Calculate’ you’re served with a detailed report showing (fields are for dry blend with liquid fields bracketed):\n\nNet Elements in Blend\nWeight per Load\n(Weight of liquid per acre)\nWeight of Product to Order (Volume to Order)\nVolumes, Costs, Etc.\nLegal Analysis %\n\nIn the latest update we tried to add support for as many units as possible.  Should you find a unit we missed or a conversion that you suspect isn't right, please email us and we'll get it up to date."

There is an emphasis on quick and precise modelling with graphical interaction. Results are graphically interactive with a sliding readout of numerical results at any point along a member.\n\nTrusses have all member ends pinned to the nodes, preventing transfer of bending moments and requiring the structure to be suitably braced against collapse.\n\nMore information about this App can be found in its integrated help and on our website. The App also contains \"Replay Demonstrations\" which describe and enact its use.\n\n\n=== General Technical Features ===\n\n* Automatic analysis.\n\n* Integrated extensive section library:\n - British, European, American, Canadian, Australian, South African, Japanese, Russian.\n - See our website for the range of shapes.\n\n* Integrated section generator for common shapes:\n - Open: I/H, channel, zed, angle, tee.\n - Hollow: Oval, Rectangular.\n - Solid: Oval, Rectangular.\n - Calculates: Area, Inertia, Torsional constant, Elastic moduli, mass.\n\n* Integrated material library:\n - Steel, Aluminium, Concrete, Timber, Glass.\n - User materials can be added.\n\n* All member ends are pinned.\n\n* Loads applied as point, couple, trapezoid.\n\n* Multiple load-cases.\n\n* Gravity (self-weight) loading.\n\n* Factored load-case combinations.\n\n* Graphical and numerical results include:\n - Reactions, deflections, bending moments, shear forces, bending stress.\n - Points of interest.\n - Results given all along members.\n\n\n=== General User Interface Features ===\n\n* Universal App - for iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad.\n\n* Metric & imperial units.\n\n* Four simple interactive screens:\n - Geometry, Loading, Results: for interacting with the model.\n - Utilities: Supplementary functions (see below).\n\n* Easy modelling:\n - Tap to select; tap to edit.\n - Move and copy geometry.\n - Slide nodes along members.\n - Change member spans.\n - Split members.\n - Replicate loading across members.\n\n* Graphical drag-and-tap controls:\n - Rotate, pan, zoom the view with simple gestures.\n - Drag nodes for positions.\n - Drag loads for positions and magnitudes.\n - Drag marker along member to read off results values.\n - Tap on Points of Interest for important results.\n - Select nodes to measure distances, angles, and areas between them.\n\n* Numeric entry available:\n - Double-tap on a datum to enter its numerical value.\n - Includes a convenient built-in calculator.\n\n* Straightforward section library:\n - Pick from country, shape, and size.\n - View diagram and properties.\n - For custom shapes, double-tap on dimensions to edit.\n - Axes can be rotated by 90 degrees.\n\n* Report generation:\n - Configurable content.\n - Graphical layout.\n - On-screen preview.\n - Export PDF by e-mail.\n - AirPrint.\n\n* Supplementary functions:\n - Document titles.\n - Choice of unit system (UK/EU Metric, US Imperial).\n - On-line help.\n - Load, save, and export models."

I always wanted to build the habit tracker of my liking and this is it — and I hope you'll enjoy using it too!\n\n### Unlimited Habits\nIf you're just starting out with one or two habits or already have a long list of things you want to keep track of — HabitBoard imposes no limitations on the number of habits you can track.\n\n### Historic Data\nIt provides a detailed calendar-like view of your historic data which grows over time. In addition, you get habit-specific statistics like current and longest streaks, completion rate, and count by week, month, and year.\n\n### Statistics\nHabitBoard makes provides meaningful and beautiful stats that give an overview over all your tracked habits. You can inspect your overall weekly and monthly completions, get an overall completion rate, and keep track of your daily completions.\n\n### Weekly Goals and Skipped Days\nSome habits are not planned daily and HabitBoard makes it easy to configure automatically skipped days and weekly goals per habit. If you set a weekly goal, you'll see an additional label for the current progress in the habit list.\n\n### Customizable Colors\nEach habit can use colors according to your personal taste or for visual grouping of habits. You can customize both the colors for done and missed habit states.\n\n### Widgets\nHabitBoard offers new Lock Screen widgets and small, medium, and a large calendar-like widgets so that you can glance on your habits even if you're not using the app.\n\n### Shortcuts\nWith the \"Mark habit as done\" Shortcuts action, you can combine different tasks to automatically keep your HabitBoard up-to-date.\n\n### Archived Habits\nSome things also come to an end (or are paused), so HabitBoard offers a dedicated place for archived habits. Habits that live there are still fully interactive, so it can also be used as a more private area for certain habits.\n\n### Configuration of List Labels\nIn my own practice of habit tracking, I've noticed that the current streak is not always the most meaningful metric — personally, I focus more on monthly completions. With HabitBoard, you can decide whether you want to display the current streak, weekly, monthly, and yearly completions in addition to the names in the habit list.\n\n### Daily Reminder\nWhen you're starting out, a daily reminder can be useful. If you want, the app notifies you when it's time to review your HabitBoard for the day.\n\n### Automatic Backup and Sync\nHabitBoard securely and privately backups and syncs your habits via iCloud. If you're using a second device, your data is already there.\n\n---\n\nIf you have feedback, a bug report, or want to be a beta tester, feel free to reach out via any of the links under *Settings → About*.\n\nThanks for using HabitBoard!"

This prevents you from having to go through each event\nIndividually. \n\nExisting events are automatically synchronized. If you prefer not to type, you can record voice memos instead. \n\nYou can use VO Calendar with the VoiceOver gestures you are used to.\n\nHowever, there is an even faster way. With the screen being split into two halves you can scan the right half of the screen with your right thumb. A single tap with your left thumb then is enough to activate the concerning function. After getting used to you will find out this helps you to browse through your calendar even quicker.\n\nThe left bottom always contains the ‘Return’ button so you can still reach it with your right thumb (being an L-shaped layout). At the top left you can always find a summary of the current screen content. In case you are left-handed you can swap left and right.\n\nNote: If you have multiple calendars configured, VO Calendar will show all concerning events. New events will be assigned to your iPhone’s default calendar. Change the default calendar in: Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Default Calendar.\n\nVO Calendar is developed in cooperation with Royal Dutch Visio, Centre of Expertise for blind and partially sighted people (www.visio.org).\n\nWe appreciate your opinion and are always interested in hearing from you. Feel free to leave your feedback in the form of a review or contact us at: support@vo-calendar.com\n\nIn case you have problems recording a memo:\n- Hold one finger on 'Record memo' button\n- Use other finger to tap on screen\n(instead of first focussing on the button and then double tap)"

      "label": "PDFOptim is a simple and intuitive way to compress, optimize and reduce PDF documents on iPhones and iPads. PDFOptim provides easy and effective ways to compress large image and graphics heavy PDF files. Inbuilt side-by-side preview to compare original and optimized PDF.\n\n* * * PDFOptim for Mac is also available on the Mac App Store. * * *\n\nCompressed PDF documents requires less disk space for storage and faster uploads and downloads saves transmission time and cost. The PDFOptim gives you access to compression options to help you to reduce PDF file size without compromising the document's integrity. PDFOptim rewrites the entire PDF documents using selected compression options as efficiently as possible. Some PDF documents might not get compressed, because the PDF documents might be already compressed or have nothing much to compress.\n\nIf your PDF documents are in another app (For Example Mail, DropBox or SkyDrive etc.) that uses the Open In… button, tap the button to open the PDF document in PDFOptim. You can also transfer PDF documents from your desktop computer via iTunes into PDFOptim application on your iPhone or iPad.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n\n- PDF optimization options to set from Image Color Model, Image Resolution, JPEG Image Quality and Optimise graphics level.\n\n- Image color model to choose from RGB, Gray and Mono. Selecting Monochrome color model compression option converts raster PDF contents into black and white which helps reduces PDF file size to greater extent. It is very helpful when compressing scanned books mainly containing text. Optimizing PDF using Monochrome color model can create 24 times smaller PDF compared to RGB color model compression.\n\n- Image resolution ppi (pixels/inch) control to resize raster image contents. Downsampling at lower resolution decrease the file size dramatically.\n\n- Quality control. Set quality from lossless to least for resampling all raster images into PDF. It allows you to control optimized PDF size and viewing quality.\n\n- Optimize graphics option removes superfluous information to reduce vector graphics heavy PDF. Increase in optimize graphics from 'Level 1' to 'Level 5' reduces output PDF file size less to more respectively. Higher optimise graphics level reduces file size but also reduces PDF visual fidelity at higher zoom scale. Choose appropriate Optimize graphics level to balance file size and visual fidelity. Choose Optimize graphics option 'None' to avoid vector graphics optimization.\n\nThis option is very useful when PDF content mainly consist of high precision vector graphics. This option removes such superfluous information, thereby reducing the size of your PDF files. Usually PDF drawing, note-taking and PDF markup apps creates large vector graphics heavy PDF files which can be compressed by this option efficiently.\n\n\n- Password protected PDF documents supported for optimization using correct password.\n\n- Single or multiple optimized PDFs can be shared as single ZIP (*.zip) file.\n\n- Allows Optimized PDFs to Open In… another application, Mail, Message, Print, share PDFs to nearby iOS devices via AirDrop.\n\n- Use Copy to iTunes to save and share optimized PDFs on your desktop computer.\n\n- Real time side-by-side preview of original and optimized PDF. It helps you to compare optimized PDF integrity and quality side-by-side. Synchronized scrolling and zooming controls for both preview showing file size and reduced percentage information.\n\n\nPDF VIEWER:\n\n- Inbuilt PDF viewer with fully selectable and searchable text contents. Select and copy text to clipboard for further use.\n\n- Pinch out and Pinch in to ZoomIn and ZoomOut view.\n\n- Built in search feature to find a character, word or sentence any where in the PDF document.\n\n- Scroll through your document by thumbnail view or Go to page feature.\n\nNote: PDFOptim is standalone application running natively to optimize PDF documents securely on your iOS device.\n\nYou can refer User Manual for any assistance Or Contact Support."

      "label": "Fast remote desktop client from the developers of TightVNC. It allows you to access, view and control your PC, Mac and Unix systems remotely. As compared to competing VNC viewers, Remote Ripple offers:\n\n- Clean and simple user interface\n- Fast operation even on slow connections\n- Smooth desktop scaling\n- Low memory footprint\n\nIt works via Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G/LTE networks and connects straightly to your remote machines. It does not use intermediate servers and does not route your data to third-party services. While direct connections via Internet may require some configuration, they guarantee best performance and independence from online services.\n\n\nHOW IT CAN HELP YOU\n\nFrom time to time, many of us need to access our “big computers” and use some “big software” installed on it. Remote Ripple allows you to do your work remotely. Also, you can:\n\n- Monitor what's happening on your computers while you're away (use View-only mode to prevent from interfering with the desktop).\n- Provide remote support to your friends and family. Assist in installing software, fix problems and demonstrate how to set up things.\n- Administer servers, workstations and virtual machines remotely.\n- Control your home computers while laying in a lounge chair. For example, you can use Remote Ripple as a remote control for your music or video player running on a PC.\n- Copy a file forgotten on a remote host (while Remote Ripple does not support direct file transfers, it can help in transferring files with other services like Dropbox or Google Drive).\n\nInstall Remote Ripple, and find your own use cases!\n\n\nGETTING STARTED\n\nTo connect with Remote Ripple, make sure your target computer runs a sort of VNC server.\n\n- If the target PC runs Windows, install a VNC server on it. We strongly recommend TightVNC as it provides best performance and compatibility with Remote Ripple. You can download your free copy of TightVNC on its Web site — http://www.tightvnc.com/\n\n- Mac OS X systems already have a VNC server included. It's a part of Apple Remote Desktop service. To enable it, go to System Preferences, choose Sharing, enable Remote Management, press Computer Settings, check “VNC viewers may control screen with password” and enter the password you will use when connecting.\n\n- Most Linux distributions include a number of VNC servers as well. Just install a VNC server from your package collection, and type something like vncserver or tightvncserver (or whatever command starts that particular VNC server). Typically, it will offer you to enter new VNC password and will start sharing your desktop (or create new virtual desktop for you).\n\n- Virtualization systems (such as VMware and QEMU) often include built-in VNC servers, although they may not be enabled by default.\n\n\nGET NEWS AND SUPPORT\n\n- App page at Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RemoteRipple (press Like to see updates in your news feed)\n- Remote Ripple on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RemoteRipple (press Follow to get updates)\n\n\nLIKE REMOTE RIPPLE? RATE AND REVIEW IT ON THE APP STORE!\n\nAlso, we will appreciate if you review Remote Ripple in your blog, social networks, other Web sites or forums. Send us links to your reviews!\n\nThank you!"

      "label": "Pool Chem Dose Calculator will calculate the exact chemical dose needed for 38 chemicals in 11 categories for any size pool in US Imperial or Metric measures. To use it you enter the pool volume in gallons or liters, choose US Imperial or Metric, select which item you want to change from the drop down list and then enter the desired change in ppm or mg/l. Pool Chem Dose Calculator then lists all of the chemicals that can be used for that item change and the doses for each one. It only shows 3 chemicals on the screen. If there are more than 3 for an item, you can scroll down the list.\n\nNo brand names, no sales just the exact dose of the chemical you want to use by chemical name. Use it while you are at a pool or in the field to find out how much chemical to add to make a correction or increase or decrease a condition.\n\nSelect from the following items: \n\nIncrease Chlorine, 15 chemicals Increase Bromine 2 chemicals\nIncrease Alkalinity 3 chemicals Decrease Alkalinity 2 chemicals\nIncrease Hardness 2 chemicals Increase CYA 2 chemicals\nIncrease Oxidizer 1 chemical Decrease Chlorine 6 chemicals\nIncrease Salt 1 chemical Increase Borate 3 chemicals\nIncrease Copper 1 chemical.\n\nFor example, if you want to Increase Chlorine by 3 ppm in a 14,750 gallon pool, enter 14750, select US Imperial, select Increase Chlorine from the drop down menu and enter 3.0 in ppm. Instantly see the amounts needed to get 3.0 ppm chlorine in that pool for 15 types of chlorine. Makes it easy to compare and see which might be cheaper to use or make a substitution. \n\nYou can also use the Pool Chem Dose Calculator to figure out the change to a water condition if you add an amount of chemical. For instance suppose you have a 15,000 gallon pool and you want to know how much the free chlorine will increase if you add a gallon of 10% liquid chlorine. No problem, just enter the pool volume, select US Imperial, select Increase Chlorine and then enter an amount for ppm. Keep changing the ppm up or down until the dose amount for Chlorine 10% gets near 128 fl oz or 4 qts.\n\nSaves money because you get the exact dose for that pool – no more guessing. Have an emergency where too much chlorine was added and now you need to neutralize the chlorine in the pool? No problem, Just enter the pool volume, US or Metric, select Decrease Chlorine and enter the amount of chlorine you want neutralized and you get the amounts needed for 6 chlorine neutralizers. You will find this app invaluable."

Just enter the width and height of the opening as well as the width of the boards to be used.\n \n\r\n\r\nBoth Imperial and Metric measurements are supported. Each board end as well as the intersection of boards in the middle are displayed with the angles for each, based on data input. In addition, the length of the board required to fit the desired space (pre-cuts) is given. \n\n\r\n\r\nA visual representative image of the cross braces displays upon calculation showing exact miter angles and position of angles. Miter Angle takes the guesswork out of miter cuts allowing you to achieve that perfect fit with cross or x end braces."

      "label": "Sketch 3D is a tool for designing 3D models from your fingertips.  You could download models from others, and could also share your great designs with other users by saving models in Public space.\n\nNew feature: Use True Depth Camera to capture face model.\n\nNew feature: Support using video as model texture.\nYou could use video clips from Photo Album, or from Internet URL (YouTube URL not supported), and then apply it onto a model as texture map.\n\nNew feature: Capture movie from the 3D scene.  \nNote! If your device could not capture movie, then, could try out a smaller output resolution (by tapping the control pane). However, arbitrary output size may stop capturing prematurely.\n\nNew feature: Design 3D model animation with skeleton structure.  \nYou could design a skeleton structure by placing bones in hierarchical relation.  Attach model to the skeleton, and then moving the bones to define different poses.  Each pose represented as a keyframe in the timeline view.  And animation sequence is produced by playing interpolation between the keyframes.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nFeatures:\n- Import 3D content directly from browser or email, either in .zip, .rar, .7z.\n- Support formats: Collada DAE, OBJ, 3DS, STL(for 3D printing), and others.\n- Import/export to iCloud drive, via iTune File Sharing, or to Public area via Apple CloudKit Service.\n- Supports AirDrop.\n- Support Quad faces.\n- Smooth surfaces using Subdivision.\n- Mirroring editing.\n- 2-fingers vertex movement, 3 or 4-fingers planar shape creation.\n- Versatile multi-touches drag-through-space gestures to support editing and changing viewing angle at the same time.\n- Flexible face strip drawing.\n- Stitching boundary faces. Stitch triangle soap into connected faces. Stitch over edge or vertex to form a larger face.\n- Stitching Triangles to Quads.\n- Loop Cut faces.\n- Bevel edges.\n- Extrude faces or edges.\n- Revolve (Spin).\n- Vertex Smoothing.\n- Vertex Slide along edges.\n- Crease Editing after mesh subdivision.\n- Split mesh from, or Join mesh to the editing one.\n- Support hierarchical mesh node structure.\n- Direct vertex color editing when texture map is not used.\n- Edit texture map UV coordinates, include atlas generation.\n- 3D Text generation.\n- Scene interaction with your created shape.\n- Design Animation with skeleton structure.\n- Capture movie from the 3D scene.\n- Support using video as model texture map."

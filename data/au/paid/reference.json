      "label": "Eucalypts are the dominant trees in Australia. Consequently, they play significant roles in the landscape, in the ecology of our land, in forestry, in apiculture and in horticulture.\n\nEUCLID provides complete descriptions of 934 species and subspecies of Angophora, Corymbia and Eucalyptus plus an interactive identification key using Lucid software. It covers all Australian States and Territories. Over twelve thousand images are used to assist interpretation of species features and the species themselves as well as their geographic distribution. \n\nThis innovative application makes identification a breeze. The process begins by choosing from simple characteristics of the eucalypt you are trying to identify. For example, answer questions such does it have rough or smooth bark, leaf shapes and flower types. If you’re not sure what to look at next the Lucid application can even recommend features to guide you through to the fastest identification possible. EUCLID is a treasure-trove of information. The application brings together beautifully illustrated features states to help visualise your choices as well as fact sheets and images of every species – all at your fingertips. \n\nThe App edition of EUCLID still functions without an internet connection, making it especially valuable for people working in the field."

Many species are represented with multiple call examples showing the full range of vocalizations.\n● The ability to compare any two images, maps, or sounds, side by side on the screen. The ability to filter by geographic location, so that you see only the species likely to occur in your location, and to further reduce the possibilities to usual or vagrant species in the selected area.\n● A “Smart Search” that gives the ability to search by distinguishing features such as size, colour, physical features, habitat and exclude certain types of birds (eg. Passerines).\n● A basic personal species list that stores your sightings saved to the device* (ability to upload list coming soon)\n● A comprehensive help and introduction section to help you if you get stuck or don’t understand how a certain feature works.\n\n*Uninstalling/reinstalling the program will result in the loss of your list, it is recommended that you keep your own backup (master list) separate from the application.\n\nWe invite all users to share their comments and ideas on our forum at www.mydigitalearth.com \n\nNB. This Application WILL ONLY work on an iPhone or iPod Touch running iOS V7.1 or higher NOT A NORMAL IPOD CLASSIC/NANO and the download is about 320MB."

      "label": "Piping Base Elbow Layout Calculator is a iPhone app that provides the fitter with the points to make an accurate cut (fish mouth, cope, etc) for piping (base pipe cylinder to elbow radius) intersections. This app is intended to be used by fitters, welders, fabricators, or anyone who needs to join a metal cylinder at an elbow.\n\nAre you still carrying that blue book around? Confused about how to layout cut lines for joining a piece of pipe to an elbow? If you are a pipe fabricator, welder, or fitter who needs to make perfect elbow base support cuts, then this app is for you. Forget books, calculators, compasses, ancient saddle layout procedures, laptops, expensive CAD programs, mathematics or internet access to figure out how to make that perfect base ell joint.\n\nPiping Base Elbow Layout Calculator is easy. Piping Base Elbow Layout Calculator provides the offset layout dimensions for that perfect pipe joint. This calculator works with any size pipe, any size elbow of any radius, and any wall thickness of pipe. User enters: main pipe outside diameter, base support diameter, wall thickness (this app considers wall thickness, you don't want to leave too much metal, or take too much off) and elbow or bend radius. The calculator does the rest.\n\nThe calculator will provide dimensions for three different configurations: CENTER (base support), TOP (dummy leg), or BOTTOM (dummy leg).\n\nThis calculator immediately produces an ordinate table of the offsets. The beauty of this app is that it also produces full size pattern templates, so you don't have to measure and layout all of the work points. Now you can print out your pipe pattern templates for any size and any angle intersection. This version outputs patterns configured for an 8.5 X 11 (everyone has access to one of these), 11 X 17, and 24 X 36 printer sizes. So with this app and a 8.5 X 11 printer, the user can still produce any size pipe coping pattern.\n\nThe calculator is very versatile. Presently input and output is US based imperial and/or metric. Output is feet, or feet and inches, decimal or fractions (to 1/32\").\n\nUser can control how much cut line accuracy he/she wants by setting how many control points are desired (infinite amount, user can get 8 control points, i.e. every 45 degrees or 360 control points, i.e every degree, or more). Most books only give 8 or 16 control points. This app allows an infinite amount. For example, a 2\" pipe needs fewer control points than a 48\"."

A slide menu facilitates easy navigation between all modules.\n\nThe app can be used as a FIELD GUIDE (like the book) or as a BIRD LIST, with essential functions such as view bird page, distribution map or text, play the sound, add to your list, and view similar birds available directly in both.  \n\nThe FIELD GUIDE displays the full field guide (family) pages of the book. You can browse the pages, select from the family list, or search for a specific species in the bird list.  Selecting a bird links to the full functions toolbar.\n\nThe BIRD GUIDE includes a full bird list and links to individual BIRD PAGES for over 900 species, with illustrations, species text, colour-coded distribution maps, photographs and sounds.  Selecting a bird in the list opens the full functions toolbar.  Optional settings for the BIRD LIST include regional lists, bird names from either IOC or Birdlife, alphabetical or taxonomic sort order, and text and thumbnail size.\n\nSIMILAR BIRDS loads a list of birds for comparison and identification. \n\nCOMPARE BIRDS displays the bird pages side by side for direct comparison.\n\nIDENTIFICATION uses location, habitat, bird shapes and plumage to shortlist possible species for identification, or viewing with the Compare Birds function. \n\nMY LOCATION is an interactive map for generating bird lists and locating birding sites near you. You can use current location or drop a pin for a new location with GPS co-ords and bird list. Birding sites are displayed with links to a list and site description.\n\nMY LISTS is a personal list manager that includes a life list and sub-lists that report to your life list. Sighting details include place, date, GPS co-ords, and sighting notes.  You can sync your lists to iCloud for backup, and also sync to linked devices. New SIGHTINGS SUMMARY for a selected species displays a summary list of sightings or displays sightings on a map.\n\nBIRDING SITES includes descriptions and photos of over 270 birding sites from around Australia, with functions for a bird list and ‘show on map’.\n\nMY PHOTOS links your personal bird photos to your sightings and lists, displays thumbnails on the bird pages and links to a photo viewer.\n\nThe MULTIMEDIA DATA includes • over 250 field-guide pages • over 900 individual bird pages • all the ‘new’ bird species and names • over 2500 illustrations, 4000 photos, and 1500 bird sounds • colour-coded distribution maps • seasonal status bar • endemic and red data species • rare bird maps.\n\n# This app can be used in the bush and remote locations. It does NOT require a wifi, phone or internet connection to operate. \n\nFor more detail on the PIZZEY AND KNIGHT BIRDS OF AUSTRALIA DIGITAL EDITION and to take a tour of the app, please visit www.gibbonmm.com.au."

You have done a brilliant job. Please let me know if you have a panel of testers or proof readers which requires more members, or any other way in which I can contribute to your efforts from home while Miss 8 sleeps. I have been forwarding your \"tell a friend\" message onto everyone I know who has an iPhone.  \nAnnie, Boronia, VIC   \n\nAWESOME app!! Thanks guys. I'm a naturopath that tries to educate my patients on the benefits of ethical shopping and living sustainably. Will definitely be recommending this app to my patients. Great work! \n Elise, Vic   \n\nThank you big time for this app!! It's so easy to use at the supermarket and clarifies so many of the issues surrounding products and companies, making the weekly shop fit better with my conscience. My kids are also able to look and see if their favourite things are positive or negative and can make their own ethical shopping decisions.

What does it look like? Some Roman did this and gave birth to the word we now know as \"muscle\", which meant \"little mouse\" in Latin, the language of the Ancient Romans.\n\nKnowing the history of words the words not only gives you deeper understanding of what you are reading, it also unlocks the power to use words in their fullest sense so that you can clearly communicate your ideas to others."

      "label": "Australian Snake ID by Hal Cogger\n\nAustralia boasts a rich snake fauna of about 180 species of land snakes, with a further 36 species of venomous sea snakes in its surrounding oceans. Identifying a snake that has been observed in the wild before disappearing into the bush [or ocean], and so cannot be examined close-up, is fraught with difficulties. Some groups of snakes, such as the seven (7) different kinds of death adders that occur throughout continental Australia, share a distinctive shape and form of tail, and are instantly recognisable. The 47 worm-like blind snakes (Family Typhlopidae), with their unformed eyes and nearly always a distinctive blunt spiny tip to their tails, are also instantly recognisable as a group, but immensely difficult to identify to species without the aid of a microscope.\n\nTo a specialist familiar with them, subtle differences in body form (i.e. slender or heavy build, narrow neck, broad head) will often allow the recognition of a snake species at a glance, or the colour or pattern alone may be quite distinctive and diagnostic. But to accurately identify the majority of Australia's snakes requires checking finer details of body features - the number of scales around the middle of the body or along the belly and tail, or the configuration of the scales on the head, or the nature of the individual scales - characteristics that can only be observed if the snake is in hand. Consequently the ease and accuracy of identifying an Australian snake depends on being able to closely examine the finer details of its physical characteristics.\n\nWhere up-close examination of a snake is not feasible, this guide asks for some basic information (approximate size, dominant colour(s), location, etc) and presents the user with a series of photographs of species likely to be encountered at the location where the observation was made, and that can roughly match the few characters observed. The user is then invited to work through the gallery of potential species to find the one (or more) that most closely resembles the snake observed. Information about other features of these species (their habits and habitats) can then be used in an attempt to eliminate as many species as possible from the list of 'possibles'.\n\nIf the snake to be identified has been killed or captured, its identity can be established with a much higher level of accuracy and certainty. This will usually involve first becoming familiar with the characters most often used in snake identification, by following the diagrams and examples provided - a task that becomes much easier with practice and familiarity. But whenever you end up with two or more \"possibles\" at the end of an identification session, then do as suggested in the absence of a specimen - work through the gallery of remaining \"possibles\" to find the one that most closely resembles the snake in hand.\n\nToday an increasing number of species - of snakes and other animals - are being identified on genetic grounds by comparing the DNA of specimens from a range of localities. Sometimes, species identified by this method may be physically similar to, or externally indistinguishable from, related species, making their identification in the field either ambiguous or impossible. However, if their geographic ranges don't overlap then location itself may be a diagnostic distinguishing feature. It is for this reason that regional location is a critical early character used in this app.\n\nAuthorship: Dr. Hal Cogger\n\nThis app was created using Lucid Builder v3.6 and Fact Sheet Fusion v2.

Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

Use your finger to spin the knot and see how it looks from any angle in 3D!  \n\nEach 3D knot has detailed reference information including tying pointers, strength and reliability, structural info, and Ashley reference numbers (ABoK) and occasionally the history behind the knot.\n\nThe knots are arranged by both category (Boating, Climbing, Fishing, Scouting, etc) and type (Bend, Loop, Stopper, etc).  If you find a knot you like or want to come back to later, add it to your Favorites list for quick reference.  Grab some rope or paracord and have fun knotting!\n\nThe complete list of knots can be found on our website: http://knots3d.com/knots/en_us/ALL"

It is based on an updated edition of the popular CD version and includes the full identification key, weed fact sheets, and over 10,000 images right on your smart device. \n\nEnvironmental Weeds of Australia has been developed to assist with the identification of weed species that invade natural habitats. It is a valuable resource for all those concerned about environmental weeds: weed and biodiversity researchers, trainers, advisors, weed control officers, environmental community groups, weed management practitioners, and anyone with an interest in environmental weeds.\n\nWhile Australian focused, this key provides an excellent resource to users in other countries. Both plain English and botanical terms (usually in brackets) are used throughout the App to make it applicable to as wide an audience as possible. \n\nAt the core of this App is an interactive Lucid identification key to 1020 plant species that are either significant or emerging environmental weeds in Australia. To help confirm the identification of weed species the app  provides over 10,000 photos and a wealth of information on each weed species and how to distinguish between very similar species. In many cases,  links are provided to websites that have relevant information about the management of specific weed species."

The dirt here includes some volcanic pumice which means even when it’s raining, the trails stay mostly dry.  This is the place dreams are made of.  The Whakarewarewa trail network is what Maori call ‘taonga’ or treasure. As BIKE magazine’s Mike Ferrintino wrote, “This haven of geysers and mudpools is, and always has been, New Zealand’s meeting point between tourism and Maori culture.  Not that we had the chance to notice, sucked immediately as we were into the ferny lush of the local forest, onto trails built by mountain bikers with mountain bikers in mind. Trails in verdant shade that dip weave and roll.  Trails that snake through the trees in a way that makes hard riders hoot with joy yet at the same time could coax a huge grin to the face of a 70-year-old granma on her first bike ride ever.  Candy Land.  A lucky utopia.  Sure gawk at the geysers, wrinkle your nose at the sulphury mud holes, soak in the hot springs, buy greenstone trinkets, but get down on your knees and kiss the mulchy earth of these trails because they are the true hidden treasure here”."

      "label": "With On the Fly you will be able to accurately identify the family to which an Australian fly belongs.\n\nThe App also includes further information on each Australian fly family, including photographs, a brief morphological description, biology and distribution, and links to literature and web sites.\n\nDiptera, commonly known as 'true flies', is an insect order which includes many widespread and familiar insects such as mosquitoes, midges, sand flies, fruit flies, houseflies and blowflies. Most insects have two sets of functional flying wings, but flies have only one.  The second pair are reduced to small club-like structures called halteres, which are used for balance and steering during flight.\n\nWorldwide, there are approximately 150, 000 described fly species in 150 families (C. Thompson, pers. comm. 2004, http://www.diptera.org). However the total number, including undescribed species, is much higher. This large number of species makes Diptera one of the most species-rich insect orders and also one of the largest groups of commonly recognised organisms on earth (Brown 2003). Not only are there an enormous number of fly species in the world, they also display great diversity in anatomical, biological and ecological specialisations (Merritt et al. 2003).\n\nThe most recent estimate for the number of fly species in Australia is around 30,000 in 104 families (Yeates et al. 2004), with only 6,400 species described so far. The Australian fly fauna is largely endemic at species level, with most species occurring only in Australia (Colless and McAlpine 1991). Flies are ubiquitous and often abundant in Australian terrestrial ecosystems, where they perform important ecological functions such as nutrient recycling, predation and pollination. Many fly larvae are parasitoids of other insects. Some are economically important pests or vectors of disease, while others are beneficial, and play important biological or ecological roles such as regulating pest populations. Flies can also be nuisances, for example, the bush fly (Musca vetutissima), and various species of blood sucking mosquitoes, sandflies and blackflies (Culicidae, Ceratopogonidae: mostly Culicoides; and Simuliidae — mostly Simulium, respectively). Estimating the total number of Australian fly species is difficult given the large size of the continent, the paucity of sampling and the narrow endemism displayed by many taxa. Most families occur in Australia and those that are absent are mainly small, specialised acalyptrates, some of which may be discovered here in the future (Colless and McAlpine 1991)."

The South West Nature Guide has been developed in partnership with DPAW.\n\nWhether you’re standing near a plant or a magnificent old tree, overlooking an expansive view, or looking out for wildlife, learning more about the natural world is easy with the South West NatureGuide helping you along the way \n\nThe App contains over 130 entries on local flora, fauna, history and geology. Tagged trails can be found at: \n\n- The Tree Top & Ancient Empire Walks – 17km east of Walpole\n- The Diamond Tree  - just south of Manjimup\n- The Gloucester Tree – near Pemberton\n- Hill Top - 5km east of Walpole\n- William Bay National Park – 10km west of Denmark\n- Horse Yard Hill - behind the Walpole Visitor Centre\n- The Dave Evans Bicentennial tree – In Beedelup National Park near Pemberton; and\n- King Jarrah – just outside the town of Manjimup\n\nThe number of tagged trails and entries is growing all the time. \n\nThe App contains maps of the trails that are currently tagged.  We recommend you download offline versions of some maps where mobile network coverage is poor. Having an offline version means that you will be able to see the map; and your location on it, even without mobile network coverage.\n\nTo download maps, select the Maps option and then Download Offline Maps. This will display a list of maps where there is poor network coverage. Downloading the maps takes a couple of minutes each. The App is currently 100MB of which 75MB are the maps."

It also includes two species of Acaciella, four species of Senegalia and nine species of Vachellia that occur in Australia and which were previously included in Acacia.\n\nWATTLE ver. 3 builds upon two previous versions of WATTLE, namely, the original version that was published in 2001 on CD and version 2 that was published in 2014 on the Lucidcentral website. Compared with earlier versions, which are no longer available, WATTLE ver. 3 contains more species, updated coding and new or updated descriptions for each taxon, together with photographs and improved distribution maps.\n\nAt the heart of WATTLE is a powerful Lucid identification key which helps people of all ages to quickly and accurately identify species. The key is a truly random access tool, one that allows users to enter, in any order, the characteristics of a specimen that they wish to identify. The key then lists those species possessing the characteristics nominated, rejecting those that do not match the criteria entered. By progressively providing additional characteristics about the unknown specimen, users can narrow the search, eventually ending up with just one or a few species.\n\nThe key provides context-relevant information (text and images) that assist users to correctly interpret the characteristics of the plant they are attempting to identify. For those who want information about the species that has been identified, WATTLE ver. 3 provides fact sheets containing illustrations, detailed descriptions, photographs and maps that can be accessed directly. Hyperlinks provide simple navigation between fact sheets of related or similar species.\n\nWATTLE ver. 3 is jointly published by the Australian Biological Resources Study (ABRS), Canberra, The Western Australian Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (formerly CALM) and Identic Pty Ltd, Queensland. WATTLE complements the Flora of Australia (www.ausflora.org.au)."

      "label": "SkySafari 6 Pro will revolutionize your astronomical viewing experience.  It has the largest database of any astronomy app, includes every solar system object ever discovered, offers unparalleled accuracy, flawless telescope control, Augmented Reality (AR) mode, and provides the very best experience under the stars when you depend on it. Discover why SkySafari 6 Pro is the #1 recommended astronomy app for serious amateur astronomers since 2009.\n\nHere's what's new in version 6:\n\n1) Complete support for iOS 13 and iPhone 11. We release regular updates.\n\n2) Clouds and Astronomy. Two words that rarely go together. SkySafari 6 Pro will (optionally) back up all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n3) We Have The Best Stars. Precise, modern and deep. We’ve updated our star catalog to use the latest and greatest, UCAC5 star catalog. If 25 million stars down to 15th magnitude isn’t enough for you, an easy in-app purchase gets you down to 16.5 magnitude and a whopping 100 million stars!\n\n4) We Have The Best Galaxies. The PGC catalog includes galaxies down to 18th magnitude. Want more galaxies? How about 2.6 million more? An in-app purchase gives you access to the largest galaxy database available for your device.\n\n5) Observers First. A redesign of our tools puts the active observer first. Quick access to features like your equipment, observing sites, lists, and observations make it easy and enjoyable to get out, observe, and record your observations. The observing sessions feature lets you collect your observations into groups that span a few hours, or a few nights.\n\n6) Graph It. The completely new graph tool will give a quick visual representation of an object’s altitude above the horizon. Essential for planning your night’s observations.\n\n7) Plan It. Make the most of your time under the stars. Our updated planner is a powerful tool that lets you create a list of targets for your observing session with filters like object types, specific time ranges, constellation, catalog, and more. Plan it and get more done.\n\n8) Say It. Ever just wanted to just yell at your device and tell it what to do!? SkySafari 6 adds basic voice control for a wide range of operations. Say “select Jupiter,” “search for Titan,” “center on Polaris” and SkySafari will do the work for you. Yelling optional. \n\n9) Tilt It. Every old astronomy app these days lets your tilt and pan your device to show different parts of the sky, but who else lets you control your telescope that way!? “Tilt to slew” is an optional mode allowing you to keep your eye in the eyepiece, and, using the accelerometers in your device, gently translate the movements of your hands into smooth telescope motion.\n\n10) Share It. SkySafari 6 is more than just a mobile app, it’s a new system to help organize and share your observing experiences. With a free signup, you can see and share your observing data from our web portal, LiveSky.com! Affordable premium memberships add online editing, so you can not only view, but edit your observations, add new observing sites, manage your equipment and more. Finally, (coming soon) you can view, edit and manage your settings files with SkySafari Web, our fully functional web version.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 6 Pro before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n• Hold your device up, and SkySafari 6 Pro will find stars, constellations, planets, and more! The star chart updates automatically with your movements for the ultimate stargazing experience.\n\n• Simulate the night sky up to 10,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n• Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n• Night Vision.\n\n• Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n• Galaxy View shows the position of deep sky objects in our Milky Way!\n\n• Much more!"

      "label": "Strong's Concordance, is a concordance of the King James Bible (KJV) that was constructed under the direction of Dr. James Strong (1822–1894) and first published in 1890.\n\nA concordance lets the reader directly compare how the same word may be used else where in the Bible. In this way the Strong's Concordance provides an independent check against translations, and offers an opportunity for greater, and more technically accurate understanding of the Bible text.\n\nWant to see it in action before you buy? Try Strong's Concordance Lite which provides a 100% functional demo of Matthew and Genesis.\n\nThis program does not require internet access, everything you need is all stored on the iDevice.\n\nFeatures:\n* Search for English words, and lookup Greek/Hebrew dictionaries.\n* Proper concordance, listing how the word was translated in other bible verses.\n* Full King James Text is included\n* Click on any blue word for concordance text.\n* Night mode for those that like to read at night (White on black)\n* iPad support\n\nPlease note: This version is not an \"exhaustive\" concordance, and does skip smaller words such as \"and, or, the, a\" as well as some other words. Though we think you'll find it has most (if not all) the words you'll ever need.\n\nWe're open to suggestions for improvement in future versions. Send comments and suggestions to strongs at orionsys.org."

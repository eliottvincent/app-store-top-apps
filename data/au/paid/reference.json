It has the largest database of any astronomy app, includes every solar system object ever discovered, offers unparalleled accuracy, advanced planning and logging tools, flawless telescope control, and provides the very best experience under the stars when you depend on it. Don’t postpone joy. Discover why SkySafari is the #1 recommended astronomy app for serious amateur astronomers since 2009.\n\nHere's what’s new in version 7:\n\n+ Complete support for iOS 15 and iPhone 13. Version 7 brings a new and immersive stargazing experience.\n\n+ Events Finder - go to the new Events section to unlock a powerful search engine that finds astronomical events visible tonight and far into the future. The finder dynamically generates a listing of moon phases, eclipses, planetary moon events, meteor showers and planetary phenomenon such as conjunctions, elongations and oppositions.\n\n+ Notifications - the notifications section has been completely revamped to allow you to customize and manage which events trigger an alert notification on your device.\n\n+ Telescope Support - telescope control is at the heart of SkySafari.  Version 7 takes a giant leap forward by supporting ASCOM Alpaca and INDI.  These next generation control protocols allow you to effortlessly connect to hundreds of compatible astronomical devices.\n\nStargazing is often done on your own but looking up at the stars reminds us that we are all part of a larger interconnected universe. SkySafari 7 brings social stargazing to mobile devices with two new features to help you connect with other like minded people.\n\nOneSky - allows you to see what other users are observing, in real time.  This feature highlights objects in the sky chart and indicates with a number how many users are observing a particular object.\n\nSkyCast - allows you to guide a friend or group around the night sky through their own copy of SkySafari. After initiating SkyCast, you can generate a link and conveniently share it with other SkySafari users via text message, apps or social media accounts.\n\n+ Sky Tonight -  jump to the new Tonight section to see what’s visible in your sky tonight.  Expanded information has been designed to help plan your night and includes  Moon & Sun info, calendar curations, events and the best positioned deep sky and solar system objects.\n\n+ Improved Observation Tools - SkySafari is the perfect tool to help you plan, record and organize your observations.  New workflows make it easier to add, search, filter and sort data.\n\nThe Small Touches:\n\n+ You can now edit the Jupiter GRS Longitude Value in the Settings.\n+ Better Moon Age calculation.\n+ New grid & reference options allow you to display Solstice and Equinox markers, Orbit + Node markers for all solar system objects, and tick marks and labels for the Ecliptic, Meridian, and Equator reference lines.\n+ Previous In-app Purchases are Now Free -  this includes the H-R diagram, 3D Galaxy view, and the PGC galaxy and GAIA star catalogs. Enjoy.\n+ Many more.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 7 Pro before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n+ Hold your device up, and SkySafari 7 Pro will find stars, constellations, planets, and more! The star chart updates automatically with your movements for the ultimate stargazing experience.\n\n+ Simulate the night sky up to 100,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n+ Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n+ Optionally backup all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n+ Augmented Reality (AR) mode\n\n+ Night Vision.\n\n+ Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n+ Galaxy View shows the position of deep sky objects in our Milky Way!\n\n+ Much more!"

Consequently, they play significant roles in the landscape, in the ecology of our land, in forestry, in apiculture and in horticulture.\n\nEUCLID provides complete descriptions of 934 species and subspecies of Angophora, Corymbia and Eucalyptus plus an interactive identification key using Lucid software. It covers all Australian States and Territories. Over twelve thousand images are used to assist interpretation of species features and the species themselves as well as their geographic distribution. \n\nThis innovative application makes identification a breeze. The process begins by choosing from simple characteristics of the eucalypt you are trying to identify. For example, answer questions such does it have rough or smooth bark, leaf shapes and flower types. If you’re not sure what to look at next the Lucid application can even recommend features to guide you through to the fastest identification possible. EUCLID is a treasure-trove of information. The application brings together beautifully illustrated features states to help visualise your choices as well as fact sheets and images of every species – all at your fingertips. \n\nThe App edition of EUCLID still functions without an internet connection, making it especially valuable for people working in the field."

      "label": "The PIZZEY AND KNIGHT BIRDS OF AUSTRALIA Digital Edition for iPhone and iPad is a comprehensive and interactive application that combines images and sounds on over 900 Australian bird species with seven interactive modules for every aspect of mobile birding.  A slide menu facilitates easy navigation between all modules.\n\nThe app can be used as a FIELD GUIDE (like the book) or as a BIRD LIST, with essential functions such as view bird page, distribution map or text, play the sound, add to your list, and view similar birds available directly in both.  \n\nThe FIELD GUIDE displays the full field guide (family) pages of the book. You can browse the pages, select from the family list, or search for a specific species in the bird list.  Selecting a bird links to the full functions toolbar.\n\nThe BIRD GUIDE includes a full bird list and links to individual BIRD PAGES for over 900 species, with illustrations, species text, colour-coded distribution maps, photographs and sounds.  Selecting a bird in the list opens the full functions toolbar.  Optional settings for the BIRD LIST include regional lists, bird names from either IOC or Birdlife, alphabetical or taxonomic sort order, and text and thumbnail size.\n\nSIMILAR BIRDS loads a list of birds for comparison and identification. \n\nCOMPARE BIRDS displays the bird pages side by side for direct comparison.\n\nIDENTIFICATION uses location, habitat, bird shapes and plumage to shortlist possible species for identification, or viewing with the Compare Birds function. \n\nMY LOCATION is an interactive map for generating bird lists and locating birding sites near you. You can use current location or drop a pin for a new location with GPS co-ords and bird list. Birding sites are displayed with links to a list and site description.\n\nMY LISTS is a personal list manager that includes a life list and sub-lists that report to your life list. Sighting details include place, date, GPS co-ords, and sighting notes.  You can sync your lists to iCloud for backup, and also sync to linked devices. New SIGHTINGS SUMMARY for a selected species displays a summary list of sightings or displays sightings on a map.\n\nBIRDING SITES includes descriptions and photos of over 270 birding sites from around Australia, with functions for a bird list and ‘show on map’.\n\nMY PHOTOS links your personal bird photos to your sightings and lists, displays thumbnails on the bird pages and links to a photo viewer.\n\nThe MULTIMEDIA DATA includes • over 250 field-guide pages • over 900 individual bird pages • all the ‘new’ bird species and names • over 2500 illustrations, 4000 photos, and 1500 bird sounds • colour-coded distribution maps • seasonal status bar • endemic and red data species • rare bird maps.\n\n# This app can be used in the bush and remote locations. It does NOT require a wifi, phone or internet connection to operate. \n\nFor more detail on the PIZZEY AND KNIGHT BIRDS OF AUSTRALIA DIGITAL EDITION and to take a tour of the app, please visit www.gibbonmm.com.au."

Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

      "label": "Australian Snake ID by Hal Cogger\n\nAustralia boasts a rich snake fauna of about 180 species of land snakes, with a further 36 species of venomous sea snakes in its surrounding oceans. Identifying a snake that has been observed in the wild before disappearing into the bush [or ocean], and so cannot be examined close-up, is fraught with difficulties. Some groups of snakes, such as the seven (7) different kinds of death adders that occur throughout continental Australia, share a distinctive shape and form of tail, and are instantly recognisable. The 47 worm-like blind snakes (Family Typhlopidae), with their unformed eyes and nearly always a distinctive blunt spiny tip to their tails, are also instantly recognisable as a group, but immensely difficult to identify to species without the aid of a microscope.\n\nTo a specialist familiar with them, subtle differences in body form (i.e. slender or heavy build, narrow neck, broad head) will often allow the recognition of a snake species at a glance, or the colour or pattern alone may be quite distinctive and diagnostic. But to accurately identify the majority of Australia's snakes requires checking finer details of body features - the number of scales around the middle of the body or along the belly and tail, or the configuration of the scales on the head, or the nature of the individual scales - characteristics that can only be observed if the snake is in hand. Consequently the ease and accuracy of identifying an Australian snake depends on being able to closely examine the finer details of its physical characteristics.\n\nWhere up-close examination of a snake is not feasible, this guide asks for some basic information (approximate size, dominant colour(s), location, etc) and presents the user with a series of photographs of species likely to be encountered at the location where the observation was made, and that can roughly match the few characters observed. The user is then invited to work through the gallery of potential species to find the one (or more) that most closely resembles the snake observed. Information about other features of these species (their habits and habitats) can then be used in an attempt to eliminate as many species as possible from the list of 'possibles'.\n\nIf the snake to be identified has been killed or captured, its identity can be established with a much higher level of accuracy and certainty. This will usually involve first becoming familiar with the characters most often used in snake identification, by following the diagrams and examples provided - a task that becomes much easier with practice and familiarity. But whenever you end up with two or more \"possibles\" at the end of an identification session, then do as suggested in the absence of a specimen - work through the gallery of remaining \"possibles\" to find the one that most closely resembles the snake in hand.\n\nToday an increasing number of species - of snakes and other animals - are being identified on genetic grounds by comparing the DNA of specimens from a range of localities. Sometimes, species identified by this method may be physically similar to, or externally indistinguishable from, related species, making their identification in the field either ambiguous or impossible. However, if their geographic ranges don't overlap then location itself may be a diagnostic distinguishing feature. It is for this reason that regional location is a critical early character used in this app.\n\nAuthorship: Dr. Hal Cogger\n\nThis app was created using Lucid Builder v3.6 and Fact Sheet Fusion v2.

You cannot act moods. You need to be doing something with every line. You need an aim to achieve, and an action selected to help achieve that aim. ‘Actions’ are active verbs. In order to play a line truthfully, you need to discover the action that suits that particular situation and that particular line. That is where this app comes in…\n\nIt is a fully searchable, easy-to-navigate thesaurus of active verbs, that will help you refine your acting choice until you find the action you require to make each line come alive.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n·  A to Z search, and predictive search function\n·  Emotional groupings to help you pinpoint the action you require\n·  Bookmark, note-making and random word functions\n·  Share your actions on social media or by email\n·  Full instructions on how to use actioning in rehearsal, plus how to use the app\n\nFor actors at all levels and of all ages, Actions: The Actors’ Thesaurus will revolutionise how you rehearse. Once you’ve started using it, you’ll wonder how you ever managed without it.\n\n‘If you want to act, or act better, Actions will take you a long way on the journey to excellence’ Terry Johnson\n\n'Actioning ain't easy – but it's so useful' Zawe Ashton\n\nBased on the bestselling book Actions: The Actors’ Thesaurus by Marina Caldarone and Maggie Lloyd-Williams"

They help children become more comfortable and competent in social situations. Detailed strategies are presented in 21 areas including making friends, dealing with bullying and teasing, getting a hair cut, riding in a school bus, social problem solving, travelling and going on vacation, using leisure time, and play, going shopping, eating in a restaurant, going to the dentist and visiting their physicians as examples. Strategies are classified according to age level ranging from age 3-12. The app not only includes strategies but reading lists associated with each topic area. Users can create a note to attach to their strategies that can be exported in an attractive book format as a pdf file into iBooks, sent as a text message, attached to an email, or saved to iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or Google Drive. Parents and teachers can send copies of strategies to one another to assist in program planning and maintain good communication."

This contrasts with the frequency at which rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, tortoises and other reptiles and birds are presented at the veterinary surgery.\r\n\r\nVets are left with no specific training on dealing with these species, and although data is available in books, it usually has to be sourced and may be difficult to obtain if the practice does not have the relevant texts.\r\n\r\nVeterinary Care of Exotic Pets is designed to provide biological data on the commonly presented exotic species and includes:\r\n\r\nBiological data on commonly presented exotic species, providing answers to common enquiries (e.g. how long is a rabbit pregnant for?  When does a guinea-pig become reproductively active?  What is the normal temperature of a chinchilla?) \r\nA comprehensive list of common ailments\r\nA list of commonly used drugs and their doses\r\nGallery of examples of some common conditions and radiographic data\r\nVideo clips of blood sampling each species\r\n\r\nAll this information combines into an app which will allow the vet to easily access some basic information, know which diseases are common in that species, how to treat them and how to work cases up by blood sampling.\r\n\r\nThis app will prove to be an invaluable mobile resource for Vets, Vet Nurses, Veterinary Technicians and Veterinary Students worldwide. The concept of updates means that this App will never go out of date and can be added to as necessary in the future."

      "label": "The Wattle - Acacias of Australia app (WATTLE ver. 3) enables users to identify wattle plants that occur anywhere in Australia or elsewhere in the world where they are grown. It includes 1,057 formally described species of Acacia, plus several hybrids and informal taxa of this genus. It also includes two species of Acaciella, four species of Senegalia and nine species of Vachellia that occur in Australia and which were previously included in Acacia.\n\nWATTLE ver. 3 builds upon two previous versions of WATTLE, namely, the original version that was published in 2001 on CD and version 2 that was published in 2014 on the Lucidcentral website. Compared with earlier versions, which are no longer available, WATTLE ver. 3 contains more species, updated coding and new or updated descriptions for each taxon, together with photographs and improved distribution maps.\n\nAt the heart of WATTLE is a powerful Lucid identification key which helps people of all ages to quickly and accurately identify species. The key is a truly random access tool, one that allows users to enter, in any order, the characteristics of a specimen that they wish to identify. The key then lists those species possessing the characteristics nominated, rejecting those that do not match the criteria entered. By progressively providing additional characteristics about the unknown specimen, users can narrow the search, eventually ending up with just one or a few species.\n\nThe key provides context-relevant information (text and images) that assist users to correctly interpret the characteristics of the plant they are attempting to identify. For those who want information about the species that has been identified, WATTLE ver. 3 provides fact sheets containing illustrations, detailed descriptions, photographs and maps that can be accessed directly. Hyperlinks provide simple navigation between fact sheets of related or similar species.\n\nWATTLE ver. 3 is jointly published by the Australian Biological Resources Study (ABRS), Canberra, The Western Australian Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (formerly CALM) and Identic Pty Ltd, Queensland. WATTLE complements the Flora of Australia (www.ausflora.org.au)."

      "label": "The SHOP ETHICAL! app gives you the low-down on the environmental and social record of companies behind common brands you buy in Australian supermarkets and beyond. Shop with a clear conscience!\n\nThe most comprehensive guide to ethical shopping in Australia, Shop Ethical! has been designed to provide consumers with the easiest way to make informed purchasing decisions. \n\nThe Shop Ethical! app provides consumers instant access to over 5,000 products with related company information and lets them make an informed and ethical decision whenever they shop.\n\nBy shopping ethically consumers can send a strong message for change and help support the practices that make our world a better place to live in.\n\nThe Shop Ethical! app uses the latest data from the Shop Ethical! website (ethical.org.au) and is also available as a book. The Shop Ethical! app has been downloaded thousands of times since 2010, and the Shop Ethical! book has sold over 135,000 copies since 2008.\n\nCompany ratings are based on information gathered from over 50 sources including the work of organisations such as Greenpeace, Choose Cruelty Free, WWF, Rank a Brand and Friends of the Earth.\n\nShop Ethical! is a collaboration between the Ethical Consumer Group and Outware Mobile. \n\nAS FEATURED ON CHANNEL 7 NEWS!  \n\nCUSTOMER TESTIMONIALS : \n  Best app I have, I use it daily and it's changed the way I see the world. \n Emma, VIC \n\n  Simply, \"Thank you.\" I am so grateful that you have done all the hard work, so that lazy/tired/child-distracted mothers like me can confidently tell their whining 8 year olds \"no, we are not buying that, because the people who will get our money hurt other people and/or animals\".  I have always wanted this information but have never had the spare energy to go and find it myself. You have done a brilliant job. Please let me know if you have a panel of testers or proof readers which requires more members, or any other way in which I can contribute to your efforts from home while Miss 8 sleeps. I have been forwarding your \"tell a friend\" message onto everyone I know who has an iPhone.  \nAnnie, Boronia, VIC   \n\nAWESOME app!! Thanks guys. I'm a naturopath that tries to educate my patients on the benefits of ethical shopping and living sustainably. Will definitely be recommending this app to my patients. Great work! \n Elise, Vic   \n\nThank you big time for this app!! It's so easy to use at the supermarket and clarifies so many of the issues surrounding products and companies, making the weekly shop fit better with my conscience. My kids are also able to look and see if their favourite things are positive or negative and can make their own ethical shopping decisions. Brilliant!!!  \nSara, Canberra\n\nThis app works on both iPhone and iPad. It is optimised for smartphones, not tablets."

      "label": "The release of Australian Tropical Rainforest Plants Edition 8 (RFK 8) represents another significant milestone in the development of this information system for identifying and learning about plants in Australian tropical rainforests. Each edition of the system since 1971 has made significant advances in the coverage of plant groups, the numbers of species included, the effectiveness of the identification system, and in the utilisation of current technology. As always, the aim of this new edition is to enable as many people as possible to simply and accurately identify and learn about plants in Australia’s tropical rainforests.\n\nWhat is new?\n\nThe main goal for Edition 8 of Australian Tropical Rainforest Plants was to move to a mobile application platform that is available both online and downloadable to electronic devices. The coverage of the key includes the rainforests of the whole of the Australian tropics. A second goal was to continue adding taxa from regions already covered that had not been included in previous editions primarily due to lack of specimens for coding, and to update the nomenclature and distribution information for all taxa as required.\n\nAustralian Tropical Rainforest Plants Edition 8 includes 2762 taxa in 176 families and 48 new name changes. All flowering plant species are included - trees, shrubs, vines, forbs, grasses and sedges, epiphytes, palms and pandans – except most orchids which are treated in a separate key (see below), and a few other species for which specimens suitable for coding features are lacking.\n\nAll rainforest orchids are included in a dedicated orchid module (Australian Tropical Rainforest Orchids) now also delivered online. The need for a separate module was due to the unique morphology of the Orchidaceae family and the distinct set of features required for effective identification to species level. Nine species of orchid have been included within RFK8, mainly terrestrial species that reach more than one metre in height, or climbers.\n\nSimilarly, the ferns are currently under development as a separate module, Ferns of Northern Australia. Again, the unique morphology, terminology and features required for effective identification of ferns have dictated that a stand-alone module be developed.\n\nThe number of images in the key continues to increase, now numbering over 14,000. Most of images were gathered by CSIRO staff as part of this long-running research project. Significant numbers of new images have been provided by various photographers listed in the Acknowledgements section, most notably Garry Sankowsky, Steve Pearson, John Dowe and Russell Barrett. All donors of images for this project are gratefully acknowledged."

Buoyage: A graphic reference guide with 70 illustrations and captions which explain the different types of buoy, their uses, appearance, permutations and light characteristics.\n\n2. Lights: A graphic reference guide with 12 illustrations and captions which explain the different types of light and their characteristics, used by beacons and lighthouses.\n\n3. IALA Rules: The International Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) rules are reproduced in full.\n\n4.

Both Spray Calibration and Mixture Calculation results can be emailed for various record keeping requirements.\n\nOz Farmer also allows the recording of chemical treatments of cattle, sheep, grains and crops and also determines the safe for slaughter and feed dates for specific treatments given the applicable withholding period. Treatment records can then be queried and exported for specific periods via email as an Excel spreadsheet.\n\nOz Farmer has a gestation calculator that determines the expected due date after servicing for common farmed animals. Once the expected date has been calculated this can then be entered into the calendar for future reference and alerts.\n\nOz Farmer has a conversion calculator to perform conversion between commonly used units (i.e. Acre to Hectares)."

      "label": "The IAP Bushings & Tubes app provides a searchable and sortable interface to over 4000 pen kits from most of the major kit suppliers. The app displays detailed tube and bushing specifications and drill bit requirements for every kit in the app database. These kit details can be emailed or printed via Air Print. You can create a favorites list of your most frequently used kits for faster access to those kits rather than searching through the entire app database every time you need to reference those kits. You can also reorder the database by your preferred supplier order.\n\nThe app also includes a drill bit converter for converting between inch fractional, inch decimal, metric and gauge drill sizes. Conversions to inch fractional are made to the nearest 1/64\" and conversions to gauge drill size are made to the nearest gauge drill size (107-1 and A-Z). An error factor is displayed for inexact conversions to inch fractional and gauge drill size.\n\nA 30-digit, 4-function calculator is included in the app. It has several advanced features not found in many simple calculators including a memory cell and the ability to display data in decimal or scientific notation.\n\nPhotos, Instructions and Bushing Drawings are available for most of the kits. When instructions or bushings are available, they may be viewed, mailed or printed.\n\nThe app also contains several lists of useful references: Worldwide Suppliers of pen kits with links to take you directly to their web site; Helpful Penturning videos with links that will take you directly to the video; and Penturning Tutorials with links that will download the tutorial to your device for viewing in the app or to email or print.\n\nThe app will automatically download database updates and the kit reference files from the IAP server."

      "label": "The Hebrew Bible iPhone application is designed for reading/studying the Hebrew Bible in either Hebrew, Aramaic (Torah only), or in a parallel translation format combining Hebrew and another language (at present, either English or French). It is also useful as a tool for improving one's knowledge of Biblical Hebrew and Biblical Aramaic. It is comprised of five main components:\n\n1. Bible: The Hebrew Bible is accessible in several different versions (a default version is selected via iPhone preferences and it is possible to change versions while running the application as well). The first six versions listed below are included in the App, the other versions can be either accessed over the Internet or downloaded (at no additional charge). The versions that are available are: \n    * Hebrew (cantillation)\n    * Hebrew (vowels)\n    * Hebrew (no vowels)\n    * Hebrew/English (cantillation)\n    * Hebrew/English (vowels)\n    * Hebrew/English (no vowels)\n    * Hebrew/French\n    * English\n    * Hebrew Torah (commentary)\n    * Aramaic Torah (vowels)\n    * Aramaic Torah (no vowels)\n\nWhen reading a book or chapter (regardless of the version selected), it is also possible to listen to the Hebrew version of the selected book/chapter being read by pressing the \"Play\" button at the top of the page. The audio readings are pronounced in Sephardi-style Hebrew. In additon to a \"Book\"-based reading approach, it is possible to also toggle to a \"Parashah\"-based approach (a Parashah is the weekly synagogue Torah/Haftarah reading). Both Ashkenazi and Sephardi Parashah readings are supported. While reading the Hebrew and Hebrew/English versions, if you touch any Hebrew word, you will be presented with a pop-up English definition. From the popup, it is also possible to display a list of all the verses in the Hebrew Bible that contain that word. \n\n2. Words: This is useful for learning more about specific Hebrew words and for discovering related words. One can lookup words by \"Root\" by selecting the first two letters of the Hebrew word root. A listing will be displayed of all Hebrew words (and, optionally, Aramaic words and/or proper names) that begin with those two letters. Once the list is displayed, touching a word will open up a further level of detail about the selected word (and, optionally, all verses that contain that word or the BDB page for that word). Alternatively, one can use the \"Translate\" function to translate words or sentences or go directly to the word detail via the \"Strongs\" number lookup function. There is also a word search facility.\n\n3. Topics: There are links to key topics (over 200 people/places/things) in the Wikipedia online encyclopedia. One can access topics by Bible book, by \"Meta\" topics, and a consolidated list of all topics.\n\n4. Maps: There are maps of almost every location (over 1,000 locations) mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. It is possible to display multiple different locations on a map and to clear previously selected locations from a map. One can access Maps by Bible book or a consolidated list of all maps. By selecting a location on the map and touching the \"callout detail disclosure\" symbol (the \"right arrow\"), one can see a listing of all verses in the Hebrew Bible that mention that location.\n\n5. BDB: The Brown–Driver–Briggs Hebrew Lexicon is probably the most commonly used Biblical Hebrew Lexicon. A complete copy of this lexicon is accessible from within the application. In additon, individual pages  can be displayed via the word lookup functionality.\n\nAn Internet connection is required in order to use some content in this application but most core functionality is maintained locally."

God is a God of order as evidenced in His works of creation and redemption. Consequently, order belongs to the essence of His church. Order is achieved through principles and regulations that guide the Church in its internal operations and in fulfillmenting its mission to the world. In order for it to be a successful ecclesiastical organization at the service of the Lord and humanity, it needs order, rule, and discipline. Scripture affirms that “all things be done decently and in order” (1 Cor. 14:40)."

In addition to the birds‘ geographical ranges, the altitudinal zones which they inhabit are given. The zones and their limits are:\n\n• Tropical Zone:\n  sea level to 4500–5000 ft\n  (1,400 to 1,500 m)\n  \n• Subtropical Zone:\n  4500–5000 to 7500–8500 ft\n  (1,400–1,500 m to 2,300–2,600 m)\n  \n• Temperate Zone:\n  7500–8500 to 9500–11,500 ft\n  (2,300–2,600 m to 2,900–3,500 m)\n  \n• Páramo or Puna Zone:\n  9500–11,500 ft to snow line\n  (2,900–3,500 m) \n\nThe current app version contains the descriptions and images of all 480+ bird species found in Chile. Moreover, an ornithological dictionary (English, French, Spanish, Portuguese) and illustrations of bird anatomy are included.\n\nApart from using the optional backup and restore functions for Field Notes and Favorites, the app runs completely offline and there is no need for an internet connection during usage in the field.\n\nAs with \"The Birds of South America\", which contains more than 3,000 birds found on the entire continent, also \"The Birds of Chile\" runs on any iOS device and can exchange Field Notes and Favorites lists between identical versions on two or more devices via Bluetooth."

      "label": "Strong's Concordance, is a concordance of the King James Bible (KJV) that was constructed under the direction of Dr. James Strong (1822–1894) and first published in 1890.\n\nA concordance lets the reader directly compare how the same word may be used else where in the Bible. In this way the Strong's Concordance provides an independent check against translations, and offers an opportunity for greater, and more technically accurate understanding of the Bible text.\n\nWant to see it in action before you buy? Try Strong's Concordance Lite which provides a 100% functional demo of Matthew and Genesis.\n\nThis program does not require internet access, everything you need is all stored on the iDevice.\n\nFeatures:\n* Search for English words, and lookup Greek/Hebrew dictionaries.\n* Proper concordance, listing how the word was translated in other bible verses.\n* Full King James Text is included\n* Click on any blue word for concordance text.\n* Night mode for those that like to read at night (White on black)\n* iPad support\n\nPlease note: This version is not an \"exhaustive\" concordance, and does skip smaller words such as \"and, or, the, a\" as well as some other words. Though we think you'll find it has most (if not all) the words you'll ever need.\n\nWe're open to suggestions for improvement in future versions. Send comments and suggestions to strongs at orionsys.org."

      "label": "The PIZZEY AND KNIGHT BIRDS OF AUSTRALIA Digital Edition for iPhone and iPad is a comprehensive and interactive application that combines images and sounds on over 900 Australian bird species with seven interactive modules for every aspect of mobile birding.  A slide menu facilitates easy navigation between all modules.\n\nThe app can be used as a FIELD GUIDE (like the book) or as a BIRD LIST, with essential functions such as view bird page, distribution map or text, play the sound, add to your list, and view similar birds available directly in both.  \n\nThe FIELD GUIDE displays the full field guide (family) pages of the book. You can browse the pages, select from the family list, or search for a specific species in the bird list.  Selecting a bird links to the full functions toolbar.\n\nThe BIRD GUIDE includes a full bird list and links to individual BIRD PAGES for over 900 species, with illustrations, species text, colour-coded distribution maps, photographs and sounds.  Selecting a bird in the list opens the full functions toolbar.  Optional settings for the BIRD LIST include regional lists, bird names from either IOC or Birdlife, alphabetical or taxonomic sort order, and text and thumbnail size.\n\nSIMILAR BIRDS loads a list of birds for comparison and identification. \n\nCOMPARE BIRDS displays the bird pages side by side for direct comparison.\n\nIDENTIFICATION uses location, habitat, bird shapes and plumage to shortlist possible species for identification, or viewing with the Compare Birds function. \n\nMY LOCATION is an interactive map for generating bird lists and locating birding sites near you. You can use current location or drop a pin for a new location with GPS co-ords and bird list. Birding sites are displayed with links to a list and site description.\n\nMY LISTS is a personal list manager that includes a life list and sub-lists that report to your life list. Sighting details include place, date, GPS co-ords, and sighting notes.  You can sync your lists to iCloud for backup, and also sync to linked devices. New SIGHTINGS SUMMARY for a selected species displays a summary list of sightings or displays sightings on a map.\n\nBIRDING SITES includes descriptions and photos of over 270 birding sites from around Australia, with functions for a bird list and ‘show on map’.\n\nMY PHOTOS links your personal bird photos to your sightings and lists, displays thumbnails on the bird pages and links to a photo viewer.\n\nThe MULTIMEDIA DATA includes • over 250 field-guide pages • over 900 individual bird pages • all the ‘new’ bird species and names • over 2500 illustrations, 4000 photos, and 1500 bird sounds • colour-coded distribution maps • seasonal status bar • endemic and red data species • rare bird maps.\n\n# This app can be used in the bush and remote locations. It does NOT require a wifi, phone or internet connection to operate. \n\nFor more detail on the PIZZEY AND KNIGHT BIRDS OF AUSTRALIA DIGITAL EDITION and to take a tour of the app, please visit www.gibbonmm.com.au."

Passerines).\n● A basic personal species list that stores your sightings saved to the device* (ability to upload list coming soon)\n● A comprehensive help and introduction section to help you if you get stuck or don’t understand how a certain feature works.\n\n*Uninstalling/reinstalling the program will result in the loss of your list, it is recommended that you keep your own backup (master list) separate from the application.\n\nWe invite all users to share their comments and ideas on our forum at www.mydigitalearth.com \n\nNB.

Shop with a clear conscience!\n\nThe most comprehensive guide to ethical shopping in Australia, Shop Ethical! has been designed to provide consumers with the easiest way to make informed purchasing decisions. \n\nThe Shop Ethical! app provides consumers instant access to over 5,000 products with related company information and lets them make an informed and ethical decision whenever they shop.\n\nBy shopping ethically consumers can send a strong message for change and help support the practices that make our world a better place to live in.\n\nThe Shop Ethical! app uses the latest data from the Shop Ethical! website (ethical.org.au) and is also available as a book. The Shop Ethical! app has been downloaded thousands of times since 2010, and the Shop Ethical! book has sold over 135,000 copies since 2008.\n\nCompany ratings are based on information gathered from over 50 sources including the work of organisations such as Greenpeace, Choose Cruelty Free, WWF, Rank a Brand and Friends of the Earth.\n\nShop Ethical! is a collaboration between the Ethical Consumer Group and Outware Mobile. \n\nAS FEATURED ON CHANNEL 7 NEWS!  \n\nCUSTOMER TESTIMONIALS : \n  Best app I have, I use it daily and it's changed the way I see the world. \n Emma, VIC \n\n  Simply, \"Thank you.\" I am so grateful that you have done all the hard work, so that lazy/tired/child-distracted mothers like me can confidently tell their whining 8 year olds \"no, we are not buying that, because the people who will get our money hurt other people and/or animals\".  I have always wanted this information but have never had the spare energy to go and find it myself. You have done a brilliant job. Please let me know if you have a panel of testers or proof readers which requires more members, or any other way in which I can contribute to your efforts from home while Miss 8 sleeps. I have been forwarding your \"tell a friend\" message onto everyone I know who has an iPhone.  \nAnnie, Boronia, VIC   \n\nAWESOME app!! Thanks guys. I'm a naturopath that tries to educate my patients on the benefits of ethical shopping and living sustainably. Will definitely be recommending this app to my patients. Great work! \n Elise, Vic   \n\nThank you big time for this app!! It's so easy to use at the supermarket and clarifies so many of the issues surrounding products and companies, making the weekly shop fit better with my conscience. My kids are also able to look and see if their favourite things are positive or negative and can make their own ethical shopping decisions. Brilliant!!!  \nSara, Canberra\n\nThis app works on both iPhone and iPad. It is optimised for smartphones, not tablets."

Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

It also includes two species of Acaciella, four species of Senegalia and nine species of Vachellia that occur in Australia and which were previously included in Acacia.\n\nWATTLE ver. 3 builds upon two previous versions of WATTLE, namely, the original version that was published in 2001 on CD and version 2 that was published in 2014 on the Lucidcentral website. Compared with earlier versions, which are no longer available, WATTLE ver. 3 contains more species, updated coding and new or updated descriptions for each taxon, together with photographs and improved distribution maps.\n\nAt the heart of WATTLE is a powerful Lucid identification key which helps people of all ages to quickly and accurately identify species. The key is a truly random access tool, one that allows users to enter, in any order, the characteristics of a specimen that they wish to identify. The key then lists those species possessing the characteristics nominated, rejecting those that do not match the criteria entered. By progressively providing additional characteristics about the unknown specimen, users can narrow the search, eventually ending up with just one or a few species.\n\nThe key provides context-relevant information (text and images) that assist users to correctly interpret the characteristics of the plant they are attempting to identify. For those who want information about the species that has been identified, WATTLE ver. 3 provides fact sheets containing illustrations, detailed descriptions, photographs and maps that can be accessed directly. Hyperlinks provide simple navigation between fact sheets of related or similar species.\n\nWATTLE ver. 3 is jointly published by the Australian Biological Resources Study (ABRS), Canberra, The Western Australian Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (formerly CALM) and Identic Pty Ltd, Queensland. WATTLE complements the Flora of Australia (www.ausflora.org.au)."

      "label": "Australian Snake ID by Hal Cogger\n\nAustralia boasts a rich snake fauna of about 180 species of land snakes, with a further 36 species of venomous sea snakes in its surrounding oceans. Identifying a snake that has been observed in the wild before disappearing into the bush [or ocean], and so cannot be examined close-up, is fraught with difficulties. Some groups of snakes, such as the seven (7) different kinds of death adders that occur throughout continental Australia, share a distinctive shape and form of tail, and are instantly recognisable. The 47 worm-like blind snakes (Family Typhlopidae), with their unformed eyes and nearly always a distinctive blunt spiny tip to their tails, are also instantly recognisable as a group, but immensely difficult to identify to species without the aid of a microscope.\n\nTo a specialist familiar with them, subtle differences in body form (i.e. slender or heavy build, narrow neck, broad head) will often allow the recognition of a snake species at a glance, or the colour or pattern alone may be quite distinctive and diagnostic. But to accurately identify the majority of Australia's snakes requires checking finer details of body features - the number of scales around the middle of the body or along the belly and tail, or the configuration of the scales on the head, or the nature of the individual scales - characteristics that can only be observed if the snake is in hand. Consequently the ease and accuracy of identifying an Australian snake depends on being able to closely examine the finer details of its physical characteristics.\n\nWhere up-close examination of a snake is not feasible, this guide asks for some basic information (approximate size, dominant colour(s), location, etc) and presents the user with a series of photographs of species likely to be encountered at the location where the observation was made, and that can roughly match the few characters observed. The user is then invited to work through the gallery of potential species to find the one (or more) that most closely resembles the snake observed. Information about other features of these species (their habits and habitats) can then be used in an attempt to eliminate as many species as possible from the list of 'possibles'.\n\nIf the snake to be identified has been killed or captured, its identity can be established with a much higher level of accuracy and certainty. This will usually involve first becoming familiar with the characters most often used in snake identification, by following the diagrams and examples provided - a task that becomes much easier with practice and familiarity. But whenever you end up with two or more \"possibles\" at the end of an identification session, then do as suggested in the absence of a specimen - work through the gallery of remaining \"possibles\" to find the one that most closely resembles the snake in hand.\n\nToday an increasing number of species - of snakes and other animals - are being identified on genetic grounds by comparing the DNA of specimens from a range of localities. Sometimes, species identified by this method may be physically similar to, or externally indistinguishable from, related species, making their identification in the field either ambiguous or impossible. However, if their geographic ranges don't overlap then location itself may be a diagnostic distinguishing feature. It is for this reason that regional location is a critical early character used in this app.\n\nAuthorship: Dr. Hal Cogger\n\nThis app was created using Lucid Builder v3.6 and Fact Sheet Fusion v2.

      "label": "SkySafari 6 Plus goes beyond most basic astronomy apps by providing you with a full-featured space simulator with telescope control and Augmented Reality (AR) mode.\n\nNote that there is no discount upgrade path from SkySafari 6 Plus to SkySafari 6 Pro. Choose carefully!\n\nHere's what's new in version 6:\n\n1) Complete support for iOS 13 and iPhone 11. We got you covered and release regular updates.\n\n2) Clouds and Astronomy. Two words that rarely go together. Rewritten from the ground up, SkySafari 6 Plus will (optionally) back up all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n3) We Have The Best Stars. Precise, modern and deep. We’ve updated our star catalog to use the latest and greatest, UCAC5 star catalog.\n\n4) Observers First. A redesign of our tools puts the active observer first. Quick access to features like your equipment, observing sites, lists, and observations make it easy and enjoyable to get out, observe, and record your observations.\n\n5) Graph It. The completely new graph tool will give a quick visual representation of an object’s altitude above the horizon. Essential for planning your night’s observations.\n\n6) Plan It. Make the most of your time under the stars. Our updated planner is a powerful tool that lets you create a list of targets for your observing session with filters like object types, specific time ranges, constellation, catalog, and more. Plan it and get more done.\n\n7) Say It. Ever just wanted to just yell at your device and tell it what to do!? SkySafari 6 adds basic voice control for a wide range of operations. Say “select Jupiter,” “search for Titan,” “center on Polaris” and SkySafari will do the work for you. Yelling optional. \n\n8) Tilt It. Every old astronomy app these days lets your tilt and pan your device to show different parts of the sky, but who else lets you control your telescope that way!? “Tilt to slew” is an optional mode allowing you to keep your eye in the eyepiece, and, using the accelerometers in your device, gently translate the movements of your hands into smooth telescope motion.\n\n9) Share It. SkySafari 6 is more than just a mobile app, it’s a new system to help organize and share your observing experiences. With a free signup, you can see and share your observing data from our web portal, LiveSky.com! Affordable premium memberships add online editing, so you can not only view, but edit your observations, add new observing sites, manage your equipment and more. Finally, (coming soon) you can view, edit and manage your settings files with SkySafari Web, our fully functional web version.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 6 Plus before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n• Hold your device up, and SkySafari 6 Plus will find stars, constellations, planets, and more!\n\n• Simulate the night sky up to 10,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n• Learn the history, mythology, and science of astronomy! Browse over 1500 object descriptions and astronomical images. Explore NASA space missions! Stay up-to-date with SkyWeek for all major sky events every day!\n\n• Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n• Night Vision  – Preserve your eyesight after dark.\n\n• Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n• Time Flow – Follow the motion of sky objects as days, months, and years are compressed into a few seconds.\n\n• Advanced Search – Find objects using properties other than their name.\n\n• Support for Apple Watch!\n\n• Tonight at a Glance: the Sun, Moon, Planets, ISS, and Iridium flares in one handy view!\n\n• Notifications when the ISS will pass overhead, when Iridium satellites flare, and more!\n\n• Much more!\n\nFor even more features, and a gigantic database aimed at the most dedicated amateur or professional astronomer, check out SkySafari 6 Pro!"

      "label": "\"...anyone grappling with the sort of evil cryptics with no black squares will appreciate its power.\" - The Sunday Times\n\nThe Advanced Crossword Solver is a combination of a powerful regular expression-style word matcher and a user-customisable database of nearly 300,000 words and phrases. \n\nIt is specifically designed to help with solving advanced thematic crosswords such as The Times’ Listener and The Sunday Telegraph’s Enigmatic Variations, but is also useful for word games such as Scrabble and Boggle, and indeed for any other word puzzles or games, for logic problems and as an aid to crossword setting.\n\nUnlike most crossword solving programs, this is far more than a simple pattern matcher for unknown letters. It can be used as a pattern matcher, and can solve simple anagrams, but in addition, some of its more powerful features include:\n\n• search for a combined pattern and anagram, when you know the answer is an anagram, and you also know where some of the letters are.\n• search with wildcards, when you know that an answer includes a particular letter or string of letters, but not where in the word they are.\n• solve partial anagrams, when you know that some of the letters of an answer are an anagram, but other letters are unknown. \n• solve subset anagrams, when you want to find the longest word you can make from a given set of letters.\n• search with multiple possibilities for letters, when you know a letter is one of a few possibilities, but not which one it is.\n• search with letter variables, when you know that several letters are the same, but not which letter it is.\n• search with vowel and consonant symbols, when you know that a letter is either a vowel or a consonant, but not which letter it is.\n• search for all the words which are one misprinted letter away from another word.\n• search for words which match a given pattern but which have one or more misprinted letters.\n• search for pairs of words (across and down) which cross at an unknown letter.\n\nUsing the simple input syntax, complex combinations of the above can be searched to quickly narrow down to a solution. Even the most complex search takes no more than a few seconds, and results are clearly presented in a scrollable list.\n\nTapping on a result from the solver shows a menu which allows the result to be looked up in a choice of iPhone dictionary and thesaurus applications, including Chambers and WordWeb, or online. This menu can be customised to add your own choice of applications and websites. (Note that in order to link to a dictionary, it must offer a URL that can be used by other apps - check with the publisher of your chosen dictionary that this is the case.)\n\nThe word list used by the Solver is a combination of  the UK Advanced Cryptics Dictionary (UKACD) and the Enhanced North American Benchmark LExicon (ENABLE). The UKACD is compiled by a crossword puzzle enthusiast from the words and phrases that are found in typical British advanced cryptic puzzles. ENABLE is an authoritative list of Scrabble words valid in both US and UK games. Between the two lists, the program searches a database of over 298,000 words and phrases.\n\nThe word list used by the solver is stored as plain text files, and the files can be accessed via iTunes to allow them to be customised to your own requirements - words can be added or removed, or the entire word list can be replaced if desired. In addition, the symbols used to denote the input syntax can also be changed, making the entire operation of the solver customisable to your own requirements.\n\nIf your taste in puzzles extends to the truly challenging, this is the application for you."

Consequently, they play significant roles in the landscape, in the ecology of our land, in forestry, in apiculture and in horticulture.\n\nEUCLID provides complete descriptions of 934 species and subspecies of Angophora, Corymbia and Eucalyptus plus an interactive identification key using Lucid software. It covers all Australian States and Territories. Over twelve thousand images are used to assist interpretation of species features and the species themselves as well as their geographic distribution. \n\nThis innovative application makes identification a breeze. The process begins by choosing from simple characteristics of the eucalypt you are trying to identify. For example, answer questions such does it have rough or smooth bark, leaf shapes and flower types. If you’re not sure what to look at next the Lucid application can even recommend features to guide you through to the fastest identification possible. EUCLID is a treasure-trove of information. The application brings together beautifully illustrated features states to help visualise your choices as well as fact sheets and images of every species – all at your fingertips. \n\nThe App edition of EUCLID still functions without an internet connection, making it especially valuable for people working in the field."

Land on the surfaces of Mars, the Moon, Io and Enceledus!  \n\nJourney up from the smallest particles, past the moons and planets of the Solar System, out through the Oort Cloud to the Milky Way, past our Local Stars and out to distant galaxies before arriving, finally, at the edge of the known Universe. On the way you will encounter the likes of seething Red Giants, beautiful Nebulae, pulsing Neutron stars and confront a daunting vision of a Black Hole sucking down a hapless star, all rendered in spectacular 3D. \n\nProfessor Brian Cox provides mind-expanding insight in over 200 interactive articles pinned to the stars, planets, galaxies and other wonders modelled in extraordinary 3D, written in his accessible style and accompanied by two and a half hours of video from the BBC TV series Wonders of the Solar System and Wonders of the Universe. The app also includes hundreds of infographics and images of space objects supplied by astronomy experts, NASA and other space researchers. \n\n• Explore the entire Universe in 7 interlinked scales from sub-atomic to the edge of the known Universe, or take Brian's tours • Two-and-a-half hours of BBC video from the Wonders TV series (requires wifi) • 50+ spectacular 3D models of planets, moons, galaxies and nebulae to discover • Over 200 interactive articles by Brian telling the story of the Universe • Hundreds of beautiful images from around the cosmos • High resolution graphics optimised for the new iPad \n\n\nReviews: \n\n“Few apps can match Wonders of the Universe.” New York Times \n\n“Wonders is hands down one of the best apps out there for the iPad.” The Next Web \n\n“One of the best educational apps to date.” Cnet.com \n\n“In a class of its own.” Daily Mail \n\n“The graphics and content make the experience well worth it.” Mashable \n\n“Astounding.” Popsci.com \n\n“Astonishing.” Appadvice.com \n\n“Stunningly produced.” MSN.com \n\n“The only app I’ve ever called perfect.” Imore.com \n\n“Have you ever wanted a grand tour of the universe…this is it, and you’ll love it.” Mac Observer \n\n“Professor Cox shows us the Cosmos as we have never seen it before - a place full of the most bizarre and powerful natural phenomena.” Sunday Express \n\n“It will entertain and delight.” Independent on Sunday \n\n“He bridges the gap between our childish sense of wonder and a rather more profound grasp of the scale of things.” Independent \n\n“Cox’s romantic, lyrical approach to astrophysics all adds up to an experience that feels less like homework and more like having a story told to you. A really good story too”. Guardian \n\n\nAbout Professor Brian Cox: \n\nProfessor Brian Cox OBE is a particle physicist, a Royal Society research fellow, and a professor at the University of Manchester as well as researcher on one of the most ambitious experiments on Earth, the ATLAS experiment on the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland.

Buoyage: A graphic reference guide with 70 illustrations and captions which explain the different types of buoy, their uses, appearance, permutations and light characteristics.\n\n2. Lights: A graphic reference guide with 12 illustrations and captions which explain the different types of light and their characteristics, used by beacons and lighthouses.\n\n3. IALA Rules: The International Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) rules are reproduced in full.\n\n4.

      "label": "THE PREMIER IPAD ATLAS - with RETINA VECTOR MAPS\n\nThe World HD is unique in the app store because it includes both a complete set of country maps AND the largest world fact book.  These enable it to answer questions which Atlases and fact books cannot:  Atlases show you where countries are located, but have very little information about them; fact books tell you about each country, but their maps leave you guessing about where places are located.\n\n\n___________ HOW IT WORKS ___________\n\nThe interface is animated and interactive.  Touch a country on the world map and the Retina vector country map opens while the factbook slides onto the screen, each topic neatly organized as tiles along the edge of the map.  Touch a factbook tile and it zooms out to reveal detailed information about that topic.  Not sure where a country is located?  Select it on the drop-down list and The World HD zooms in on it then opens the map and factbook.\n\nThe zoomable world map is not just the fastest way to select a country it also enables you to visualize and understand entire regions.  It is so intuitive and easy to explore that once you get started it's hard to stop!\n\n\n___________ FEATURES ___________\n\nRETINA VECTOR MAPS\n** Includes high-resolution Retina vector maps for EVERY COUNTRY built-in!  Unlike the other atlases, these maps remain in focus at all magnifications so you can easily see even the smallest detail.  These aren't the CIA maps found in the factbooks, they are used in printed atlases.\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n** Contains geopolitical and demographic information on 300 countries and regions.\n\nNO INTERNET CONNECTION is required\n** Except for live Wikipedia content, all data and maps are built-in\n\nINNOVATIVE FACT BOOK PANEL\n** Presents each section of the fact book as tiles enabling you to quickly find what you need, while keeping the country map in view.\n\nHIGHLY ANIMATED INTERFACE\n** Responds to your touches and gestures so you can quickly find the information you are looking for.\n\nCIA WORLD FACTBOOK\n** This trusted source of current country information is built-in for every country, including sections on: introduction, geography, people, economy, communications, transportation, military, and transnational issues.\n\nWIKIPEDIA\n** View the live, community-written Wikipedia content for each country, island, and remote region within the app.\n\nSHOWS YOU where countries are located\n** Not sure where a country is located?  Select it on the country list and The World zooms to it on the world map and opens the Fact Book Panel\n\nDESIGNED FOR YOUR IPAD & IPHONE\n** Thoughtfully uses the whole screen to present maps and data"

[Please note that this app requires wifi or cellular access to the internet]. \n\nWith ZKReg you can get instant answers to the following questions: \n\n• What are the registration details for aircraft ZK-abc? \n\n• Who is the registered owner? \n\n• Show me ALL of the aircraft that they own or operate \n\n• Give me a list of ALL other aircraft which are of the same type, or are from the same manufacturer. \n\n• Find any owner or operator (and therefore all of their aircraft) from an auto-complete style drop down of names. \n\n• For any of the above, make a single-tap call to the internet search engines, to discover anything known about the aircraft, owner, operator, or model etc. \n\nZKReg implements a tight integration with the internet’s leading search engine. If you want extended information about an owner, or need to know engine details, or get pics of the aircraft, it’s generally only a few taps away. \n\nZKReg comes with two screen presentations (selected in iPhone…Settings) - a daylight format, and a night format, so you won't impair your night vision from the cockpit late at night! \n\nThe app is fully documented through on-screen help, with full email support to all purchasers from the developers."

The App will then display rich information about the species scanned, including the name, distribution, a photo and interesting facts. The South West Nature Guide has been developed in partnership with DPAW.\n\nWhether you’re standing near a plant or a magnificent old tree, overlooking an expansive view, or looking out for wildlife, learning more about the natural world is easy with the South West NatureGuide helping you along the way \n\nThe App contains over 130 entries on local flora, fauna, history and geology. Tagged trails can be found at: \n\n- The Tree Top & Ancient Empire Walks – 17km east of Walpole\n- The Diamond Tree  - just south of Manjimup\n- The Gloucester Tree – near Pemberton\n- Hill Top - 5km east of Walpole\n- William Bay National Park – 10km west of Denmark\n- Horse Yard Hill - behind the Walpole Visitor Centre\n- The Dave Evans Bicentennial tree – In Beedelup National Park near Pemberton; and\n- King Jarrah – just outside the town of Manjimup\n\nThe number of tagged trails and entries is growing all the time. \n\nThe App contains maps of the trails that are currently tagged.  We recommend you download offline versions of some maps where mobile network coverage is poor. Having an offline version means that you will be able to see the map; and your location on it, even without mobile network coverage.\n\nTo download maps, select the Maps option and then Download Offline Maps. This will display a list of maps where there is poor network coverage. Downloading the maps takes a couple of minutes each. The App is currently 100MB of which 75MB are the maps."

All you need to do is to provide a good scan or a good photograph of the stamp and the Stamp Analyser does the rest.\n\nOptionally, you can add the stamp Soundness and Eye Appeal components to obtain the final grade. The Soundness and Eye Appeal components are based on the PSE Grading Guide.\n\nThe Stamp Analyser user interface has been designed to be intuitive and simple.

Read on for details on what each section of “FaSoLa Minutes” can do.\n\nSingers \nClick on “Singers” (fa) to pull up a list of singers who have led songs since 1995, sorted alphabetically by last name. Use the buttons in the top right corner to sort instead by song count (the number of songs a singer has led) or by entropy (a measure from 1 to 0 of a singer’s unpredictability when leading). From the search bar, type any part of a singer’s first or last name to call up a list of matches.\n\nClick on a singer’s name to bring up the singer’s number of songs led, number of times leading, and entropy number. Beneath this information is a graph displaying the number of songs the singer has lead each year and a list of the songs they’ve led (in order of frequency) since 1995. Click on one of these song titles to view a list of the times the singer has led the song. Clicking on one of these instances takes you to the page for the singing. Click on the “All” button at the top right of the screen to view a chronological list of all the songs the singer has led as well as singings at which the singer has led them. Clicking on an entry brings up the page for that singing.\n\nSongs\nClick on “songs” (sol) to view a list of songs in order of their page number in The Sacred Harp, 1991 Edition. Click the “Count” button in the top right of the screen to sort by frequency of use, or pull down on the list to reveal a search bar at the top. You can use the field to search not only for a song’s title but for a word within the text of any song. \n\nClick on a song to access its hymn text, view a graph of the song’s usage since 1995, and to see a list of its top leaders. You can also play recordings of the song if any are featured on the BostonSing.org website. Click on one of these singers’ names to view a list of the times the singer has led the song. Clicking on one of these instances takes you to the page for the singing. \n\nSingings\nClick on “Singings” (la) to browse a chronological list of all singings from The Sacred Harp, 1991 Edition since 1995, along with their date and location. Use the search field to search for any part of a singing’s name or location.\n\nClick on a singing’s name to see how many leaders led at the singing and how many songs they led, along with a chronological list of the singing’s songs and leaders. You can play recordings of the songs—when available—by clicking on the music icon toward the right of the entry for the song. Click on the name of the song or its leader to view the leader’s page. Click on the “Text” button to see the singing’s complete minutes.\n\nThe Minutes of Sacred Harp Singings are graciously compiled and provided by the Sacred Harp Musical Heritage Association, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization whose purpose is the preservation and perpetuation of Sacred Harp singing and its traditions.

In this way the Strong's Concordance provides an independent check against translations, and offers an opportunity for greater, and more technically accurate understanding of the Bible text.\n\nWant to see it in action before you buy? Try Strong's Concordance Lite which provides a 100% functional demo of Matthew and Genesis.\n\nThis program does not require internet access, everything you need is all stored on the iDevice.\n\nFeatures:\n* Search for English words, and lookup Greek/Hebrew dictionaries.\n* Proper concordance, listing how the word was translated in other bible verses.\n* Full King James Text is included\n* Click on any blue word for concordance text.\n* Night mode for those that like to read at night (White on black)\n* iPad support\n\nPlease note: This version is not an \"exhaustive\" concordance, and does skip smaller words such as \"and, or, the, a\" as well as some other words. Though we think you'll find it has most (if not all) the words you'll ever need.\n\nWe're open to suggestions for improvement in future versions. Send comments and suggestions to strongs at orionsys.org."

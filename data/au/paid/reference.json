Many species are represented with multiple call examples showing the full range of vocalizations.\n● The ability to compare any two images, maps, or sounds, side by side on the screen. The ability to filter by geographic location, so that you see only the species likely to occur in your location, and to further reduce the possibilities to usual or vagrant species in the selected area.\n● A “Smart Search” that gives the ability to search by distinguishing features such as size, colour, physical features, habitat and exclude certain types of birds (eg. Passerines).\n● A basic personal species list that stores your sightings saved to the device* (ability to upload list coming soon)\n● A comprehensive help and introduction section to help you if you get stuck or don’t understand how a certain feature works.\n\n*Uninstalling/reinstalling the program will result in the loss of your list, it is recommended that you keep your own backup (master list) separate from the application.\n\nWe invite all users to share their comments and ideas on our forum at www.mydigitalearth.com \n\nNB.

      "label": "The PIZZEY AND KNIGHT BIRDS OF AUSTRALIA Digital Edition for iPhone and iPad is a comprehensive and interactive application that combines images and sounds on over 900 Australian bird species with seven interactive modules for every aspect of mobile birding.  A slide menu facilitates easy navigation between all modules.\n\nThe app can be used as a FIELD GUIDE (like the book) or as a BIRD LIST, with essential functions such as view bird page, distribution map or text, play the sound, add to your list, and view similar birds available directly in both.  \n\nThe FIELD GUIDE displays the full field guide (family) pages of the book. You can browse the pages, select from the family list, or search for a specific species in the bird list.  Selecting a bird links to the full functions toolbar.\n\nThe BIRD GUIDE includes a full bird list and links to individual BIRD PAGES for over 900 species, with illustrations, species text, colour-coded distribution maps, photographs and sounds.  Selecting a bird in the list opens the full functions toolbar.  Optional settings for the BIRD LIST include regional lists, bird names from either IOC or Birdlife, alphabetical or taxonomic sort order, and text and thumbnail size.\n\nSIMILAR BIRDS loads a list of birds for comparison and identification. \n\nCOMPARE BIRDS displays the bird pages side by side for direct comparison.\n\nIDENTIFICATION uses location, habitat, bird shapes and plumage to shortlist possible species for identification, or viewing with the Compare Birds function. \n\nMY LOCATION is an interactive map for generating bird lists and locating birding sites near you. You can use current location or drop a pin for a new location with GPS co-ords and bird list. Birding sites are displayed with links to a list and site description.\n\nMY LISTS is a personal list manager that includes a life list and sub-lists that report to your life list. Sighting details include place, date, GPS co-ords, and sighting notes.  You can sync your lists to iCloud for backup, and also sync to linked devices. New SIGHTINGS SUMMARY for a selected species displays a summary list of sightings or displays sightings on a map.\n\nBIRDING SITES includes descriptions and photos of over 270 birding sites from around Australia, with functions for a bird list and ‘show on map’.\n\nMY PHOTOS links your personal bird photos to your sightings and lists, displays thumbnails on the bird pages and links to a photo viewer.\n\nThe MULTIMEDIA DATA includes • over 250 field-guide pages • over 900 individual bird pages • all the ‘new’ bird species and names • over 2500 illustrations, 4000 photos, and 1500 bird sounds • colour-coded distribution maps • seasonal status bar • endemic and red data species • rare bird maps.\n\n# This app can be used in the bush and remote locations. It does NOT require a wifi, phone or internet connection to operate. \n\nFor more detail on the PIZZEY AND KNIGHT BIRDS OF AUSTRALIA DIGITAL EDITION and to take a tour of the app, please visit www.gibbonmm.com.au."

Consequently, they play significant roles in the landscape, in the ecology of our land, in forestry, in apiculture and in horticulture.\n\nEUCLID provides complete descriptions of 934 species and subspecies of Angophora, Corymbia and Eucalyptus plus an interactive identification key using Lucid software. It covers all Australian States and Territories. Over twelve thousand images are used to assist interpretation of species features and the species themselves as well as their geographic distribution. \n\nThis innovative application makes identification a breeze. The process begins by choosing from simple characteristics of the eucalypt you are trying to identify. For example, answer questions such does it have rough or smooth bark, leaf shapes and flower types. If you’re not sure what to look at next the Lucid application can even recommend features to guide you through to the fastest identification possible. EUCLID is a treasure-trove of information. The application brings together beautifully illustrated features states to help visualise your choices as well as fact sheets and images of every species – all at your fingertips. \n\nThe App edition of EUCLID still functions without an internet connection, making it especially valuable for people working in the field."

The Shop Ethical! app has been downloaded thousands of times since 2010, and the Shop Ethical! book has sold over 135,000 copies since 2008.\n\nCompany ratings are based on information gathered from over 50 sources including the work of organisations such as Greenpeace, Choose Cruelty Free, WWF, Rank a Brand and Friends of the Earth.\n\nShop Ethical! is a collaboration between the Ethical Consumer Group and Outware Mobile. \n\nAS FEATURED ON CHANNEL 7 NEWS!  \n\nCUSTOMER TESTIMONIALS : \n  Best app I have, I use it daily and it's changed the way I see the world. \n Emma, VIC \n\n  Simply, \"Thank you.\" I am so grateful that you have done all the hard work, so that lazy/tired/child-distracted mothers like me can confidently tell their whining 8 year olds \"no, we are not buying that, because the people who will get our money hurt other people and/or animals\".  I have always wanted this information but have never had the spare energy to go and find it myself. You have done a brilliant job. Please let me know if you have a panel of testers or proof readers which requires more members, or any other way in which I can contribute to your efforts from home while Miss 8 sleeps. I have been forwarding your \"tell a friend\" message onto everyone I know who has an iPhone.  \nAnnie, Boronia, VIC   \n\nAWESOME app!! Thanks guys. I'm a naturopath that tries to educate my patients on the benefits of ethical shopping and living sustainably. Will definitely be recommending this app to my patients. Great work! \n Elise, Vic   \n\nThank you big time for this app!! It's so easy to use at the supermarket and clarifies so many of the issues surrounding products and companies, making the weekly shop fit better with my conscience. My kids are also able to look and see if their favourite things are positive or negative and can make their own ethical shopping decisions. Brilliant!!!  \nSara, Canberra\n\nThis app works on both iPhone and iPad. It is optimised for smartphones, not tablets."

      "label": "Strong's Concordance, is a concordance of the King James Bible (KJV) that was constructed under the direction of Dr. James Strong (1822–1894) and first published in 1890.\n\nA concordance lets the reader directly compare how the same word may be used else where in the Bible. In this way the Strong's Concordance provides an independent check against translations, and offers an opportunity for greater, and more technically accurate understanding of the Bible text.\n\nWant to see it in action before you buy? Try Strong's Concordance Lite which provides a 100% functional demo of Matthew and Genesis.\n\nThis program does not require internet access, everything you need is all stored on the iDevice.\n\nFeatures:\n* Search for English words, and lookup Greek/Hebrew dictionaries.\n* Proper concordance, listing how the word was translated in other bible verses.\n* Full King James Text is included\n* Click on any blue word for concordance text.\n* Night mode for those that like to read at night (White on black)\n* iPad support\n\nPlease note: This version is not an \"exhaustive\" concordance, and does skip smaller words such as \"and, or, the, a\" as well as some other words. Though we think you'll find it has most (if not all) the words you'll ever need.\n\nWe're open to suggestions for improvement in future versions. Send comments and suggestions to strongs at orionsys.org."

A short description and helpful tips are given for each song or call, as well as a photo of each bird. Birds can be sorted by commonness, so you can listen to the most common ones first, then move on to rarer species. Or sort by song style, so that you can compare birds that hoot and coo, or those with high pitched songs for example. You can also sort by name, habitat or bird group.\n\nAfter listening, try the quiz to test your memory. Answer fast to earn a score multiplier and get on the high score table. Experienced birders can use the custom quiz to help distinguish and learn similar songs. \n\nThe slideshow section can be used as a way to relax, or switch the voiceover on and see if you can say the name of the bird before the voiceover. This is a good way of competing with the family - who can say the name of the bird first?! \n\nIncludes birds from Britain, Ireland, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Spain, Portugal and Italy."

Sort by song style to compare birds that hoot and coo, with birds with high pitched songs, or you might like to sort the birds by commonness, so you can listen to the most common ones first, then move on to less frequent backyard visitors. More advanced birders may like to listen to birds from a particular habitat, such as forest or freshwater for example. You can make lists of your favourites so that you can find them quickly.\n\nUse the quiz to test your memory. Answer fast to earn a score multiplier and get on the high score table. Experienced birders can use the custom quiz to help distinguish and learn similar songs. \n\nAnd when you need a rest, try the slideshow feature - choose which birds to include, maybe add background bird song, then simply relax. If you want to continue learning while you relax, switch the voiceover on and hear the name of the bird announced at the end of each clip. This is also a good way of competing with the family - who can say the name of the bird first?\n\nBird names are included in Spanish and French.\n\nProblems? Email us: spiny@spinysoftware.com"

Search for answers in HSVG, a massive & constantly growing database of equine health info – conveniently available to you “horse side.” \n\nHSVG was created by Doug Thal DVM DABVP, a lifelong horseman & veterinarian that has practiced exclusively equine veterinary medicine for over 20 years & is board certified in equine practice.  \n\nHSVG provides helpful information about equine health from the moment you notice a problem with your horse - My Observation.  It contains practical advice, suggested skills, and questions to discuss with your vet.\n\nHSVG is of value in an emergency and non-emergency, and it helps you distinguish between the two. HSVG also contains dozens of high quality instructional videos, and other media designed to enable you to become an active participant in ensuring your horse’s good health.  \n\nHowever, HSVG is not structured as a simple decision tree that takes you down a singular path based on your input. It is not a substitute for your local equine veterinarian. It does not, and cannot, anticipate and address all of the subtle variations and unique circumstances associated with your horse’s health. That is your veterinarian's job.\n__________________________\n\n- Make better decisions about your horse’s health.\n- Increase the quality of communication between you and your vet.\n- Follow a logical thought process for addressing any equine heath care problem.\n- Utilize a quality alternative to Dr. Google.\n\nOk – so what is Horse Side Vet Guide exactly? \n\nHSVG is a custom-built relational database of equine health information that contains concise information about common problems to rare diseases.  Records are contained in 1 of 9 categories:\n\n- My Observations\n- Vet Diagnostics\n- Vet Diagnoses\n- Vet Treatments\n- My Skills\n- My Supplies\n- Terms & Topics\n- Media\n- Outside Resources\n\nThese records are extensively interlinked, providing a uniquely contextualized approach to any equine health issue. \n\nWe continuously add and update the records in HSVG. We have placed great emphasis on completing the MY OBSERVATIONS records first. You can find \"full access\" records with a keyword search, in the alphabetical browse lists, and hyperlinked inside other records. Incomplete (or \"partial access\") records are listed inside full access records, with no hyperlink. Many other records are hidden from view, and will be available later. After we complete a partial or hidden record we change it to \"full access\" and it becomes immediately available to you after the app has been synchronized to your mobile device. \n\nPlease see our website www.horsesidevetguide.com for more information about this application."

      "label": "The Wattle - Acacias of Australia app (WATTLE ver. 3) enables users to identify wattle plants that occur anywhere in Australia or elsewhere in the world where they are grown. It includes 1,057 formally described species of Acacia, plus several hybrids and informal taxa of this genus. It also includes two species of Acaciella, four species of Senegalia and nine species of Vachellia that occur in Australia and which were previously included in Acacia.\n\nWATTLE ver. 3 builds upon two previous versions of WATTLE, namely, the original version that was published in 2001 on CD and version 2 that was published in 2014 on the Lucidcentral website. Compared with earlier versions, which are no longer available, WATTLE ver. 3 contains more species, updated coding and new or updated descriptions for each taxon, together with photographs and improved distribution maps.\n\nAt the heart of WATTLE is a powerful Lucid identification key which helps people of all ages to quickly and accurately identify species. The key is a truly random access tool, one that allows users to enter, in any order, the characteristics of a specimen that they wish to identify. The key then lists those species possessing the characteristics nominated, rejecting those that do not match the criteria entered. By progressively providing additional characteristics about the unknown specimen, users can narrow the search, eventually ending up with just one or a few species.\n\nThe key provides context-relevant information (text and images) that assist users to correctly interpret the characteristics of the plant they are attempting to identify. For those who want information about the species that has been identified, WATTLE ver. 3 provides fact sheets containing illustrations, detailed descriptions, photographs and maps that can be accessed directly. Hyperlinks provide simple navigation between fact sheets of related or similar species.\n\nWATTLE ver. 3 is jointly published by the Australian Biological Resources Study (ABRS), Canberra, The Western Australian Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (formerly CALM) and Identic Pty Ltd, Queensland. WATTLE complements the Flora of Australia (www.ausflora.org.au)."

Rotate your iPhone to the landscape position to show more conversion units (where available). \r\n\r\nBroad Categories\r\n• Choose New Tire Size - tables showing tire diameter, circumference and percentage difference between them.\r\n• Glossary - including Tire Sidewall Diagram\r\n• Detailed Tire Size Information - information from the tire code.\r\n• Load Index\r\n• Speed Rating\r\n• Load Range\r\n• Tire Pressure Unit Conversion\r\n• Measurement Unit Conversion\r\n\r\nSpecific Units Included \r\n• Millimeters, Inches\r\n• Pounds, Kilograms\r\n• Miles per Hour, Kilometers per Hour\r\n• Pounds per sq. Inch (psi), Kilopascals (kPa), Bar (bar), Kilogram per sq. cm (kg/cm²)\r\n\r\nUniversal App \r\nThis means you only need to buy it once to be able to install it on all your devices (iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad). \r\n\r\nIf you find this app useful, please leave a review on the App Store. \r\n\r\nIf you have suggestions, feature requests, or need support, feel free to contact us through the Settings menu within our apps."

      "label": "Insects make up the vast bulk of species diversity, with just over a million described species organized into about thirty major subgroups called orders.  Orders are in turn divided into families, families are divided into genera, and genera are divided into species. Properly defined; orders, families and genera are each groups of species that have descended from a unique common ancestor, as a result of which they share similar structural characteristics and have certain biological attributes in common.\n\nNot all insect orders are equal in species number; some have just a few hundred species while the larger orders have hundreds of thousands of species. Most insects are in just four large orders: Diptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera. The range of structural characteristics and biological features tends to be broader in the more species-rich orders.\n\nPredictions about the biology, behaviour and ecology of an insect can often be made once you know its order. But how can you know the order to which an insect belongs? Insects can be identified in various ways. Comparing a specimen with a book of illustrations of identified insects is one way. Using a printed key is another way. This Lucid Mobile key combines the advantages of these methods and adds a new dimension of simplicity and power to the process of identification.\n\nThis simple key aims to identify most common adult insects to the level of order. It has been designed for a range of users, including advanced secondary students, beginning undergraduates and others interested in entomology, and includes information about the structure and biology of insects as well as their identifying features. Three of the groups included in this key (Protura, Collembola and Diplura) are six-legged arthropods treated as insects in the vernacular sense, but now usually formally classified in their own order, outside the order Insecta. \n\nHow can you tell if an insect is an adult so it can be identified using this key? That is a simple question without a simple answer. If your insect has fully-developed, functional wings then it is an adult. However, some adult insects have reduced, non-functional wings and others have no wings at all. In these cases the adult forms have fully developed genitalia at the apex of the abdomen. Many, but not all, nymphal or immature forms are identifiable using the same features used to identify adults.\n\nThe 'Key to Insect Orders' was originally created by staff at the Department of Entomology at the University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia (Gordon Gordh; David Yeates; Tony Young; Sue McGrath), based on the simplified keys to insect Order found in Collecting, Preserving and Classifying Insects by E.C. Dahms, G.B. Monteith and S. Monteith (Queensland Museum, 1979), Worms to Wasps by M.S. Harvey and A.L. Yen (Oxford University Press, 1989) and A Field Guide to Insects in Australia by P. Zborowski and R. Storey (Reed Books, 1995).\n\nThis new edition of Insect Orders has been revised by Professor Steve Marshall at the University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada.\n\nThis app was created using the Lucid suite of tools, for more information please visit https://www.lucidcentral.org"

      "label": "SkySafari 6 Plus goes beyond most basic astronomy apps by providing you with a full-featured space simulator with telescope control and Augmented Reality (AR) mode.\n\nNote that there is no discount upgrade path from SkySafari 6 Plus to SkySafari 6 Pro. Choose carefully!\n\nHere's what's new in version 6:\n\n1) Complete support for iOS 13 and iPhone 11. We got you covered and release regular updates.\n\n2) Clouds and Astronomy. Two words that rarely go together. Rewritten from the ground up, SkySafari 6 Plus will (optionally) back up all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n3) We Have The Best Stars. Precise, modern and deep. We’ve updated our star catalog to use the latest and greatest, UCAC5 star catalog.\n\n4) Observers First. A redesign of our tools puts the active observer first. Quick access to features like your equipment, observing sites, lists, and observations make it easy and enjoyable to get out, observe, and record your observations.\n\n5) Graph It. The completely new graph tool will give a quick visual representation of an object’s altitude above the horizon. Essential for planning your night’s observations.\n\n6) Plan It. Make the most of your time under the stars. Our updated planner is a powerful tool that lets you create a list of targets for your observing session with filters like object types, specific time ranges, constellation, catalog, and more. Plan it and get more done.\n\n7) Say It. Ever just wanted to just yell at your device and tell it what to do!? SkySafari 6 adds basic voice control for a wide range of operations. Say “select Jupiter,” “search for Titan,” “center on Polaris” and SkySafari will do the work for you. Yelling optional. \n\n8) Tilt It. Every old astronomy app these days lets your tilt and pan your device to show different parts of the sky, but who else lets you control your telescope that way!? “Tilt to slew” is an optional mode allowing you to keep your eye in the eyepiece, and, using the accelerometers in your device, gently translate the movements of your hands into smooth telescope motion.\n\n9) Share It. SkySafari 6 is more than just a mobile app, it’s a new system to help organize and share your observing experiences. With a free signup, you can see and share your observing data from our web portal, LiveSky.com! Affordable premium memberships add online editing, so you can not only view, but edit your observations, add new observing sites, manage your equipment and more. Finally, (coming soon) you can view, edit and manage your settings files with SkySafari Web, our fully functional web version.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 6 Plus before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n• Hold your device up, and SkySafari 6 Plus will find stars, constellations, planets, and more!\n\n• Simulate the night sky up to 10,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n• Learn the history, mythology, and science of astronomy! Browse over 1500 object descriptions and astronomical images. Explore NASA space missions! Stay up-to-date with SkyWeek for all major sky events every day!\n\n• Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n• Night Vision  – Preserve your eyesight after dark.\n\n• Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n• Time Flow – Follow the motion of sky objects as days, months, and years are compressed into a few seconds.\n\n• Advanced Search – Find objects using properties other than their name.\n\n• Support for Apple Watch!\n\n• Tonight at a Glance: the Sun, Moon, Planets, ISS, and Iridium flares in one handy view!\n\n• Notifications when the ISS will pass overhead, when Iridium satellites flare, and more!\n\n• Much more!\n\nFor even more features, and a gigantic database aimed at the most dedicated amateur or professional astronomer, check out SkySafari 6 Pro!"

      "label": "Australian Snake ID by Hal Cogger\n\nAustralia boasts a rich snake fauna of about 180 species of land snakes, with a further 36 species of venomous sea snakes in its surrounding oceans. Identifying a snake that has been observed in the wild before disappearing into the bush [or ocean], and so cannot be examined close-up, is fraught with difficulties. Some groups of snakes, such as the seven (7) different kinds of death adders that occur throughout continental Australia, share a distinctive shape and form of tail, and are instantly recognisable. The 47 worm-like blind snakes (Family Typhlopidae), with their unformed eyes and nearly always a distinctive blunt spiny tip to their tails, are also instantly recognisable as a group, but immensely difficult to identify to species without the aid of a microscope.\n\nTo a specialist familiar with them, subtle differences in body form (i.e. slender or heavy build, narrow neck, broad head) will often allow the recognition of a snake species at a glance, or the colour or pattern alone may be quite distinctive and diagnostic. But to accurately identify the majority of Australia's snakes requires checking finer details of body features - the number of scales around the middle of the body or along the belly and tail, or the configuration of the scales on the head, or the nature of the individual scales - characteristics that can only be observed if the snake is in hand. Consequently the ease and accuracy of identifying an Australian snake depends on being able to closely examine the finer details of its physical characteristics.\n\nWhere up-close examination of a snake is not feasible, this guide asks for some basic information (approximate size, dominant colour(s), location, etc) and presents the user with a series of photographs of species likely to be encountered at the location where the observation was made, and that can roughly match the few characters observed. The user is then invited to work through the gallery of potential species to find the one (or more) that most closely resembles the snake observed. Information about other features of these species (their habits and habitats) can then be used in an attempt to eliminate as many species as possible from the list of 'possibles'.\n\nIf the snake to be identified has been killed or captured, its identity can be established with a much higher level of accuracy and certainty. This will usually involve first becoming familiar with the characters most often used in snake identification, by following the diagrams and examples provided - a task that becomes much easier with practice and familiarity. But whenever you end up with two or more \"possibles\" at the end of an identification session, then do as suggested in the absence of a specimen - work through the gallery of remaining \"possibles\" to find the one that most closely resembles the snake in hand.\n\nToday an increasing number of species - of snakes and other animals - are being identified on genetic grounds by comparing the DNA of specimens from a range of localities. Sometimes, species identified by this method may be physically similar to, or externally indistinguishable from, related species, making their identification in the field either ambiguous or impossible. However, if their geographic ranges don't overlap then location itself may be a diagnostic distinguishing feature. It is for this reason that regional location is a critical early character used in this app.\n\nAuthorship: Dr. Hal Cogger\n\nThis app was created using Lucid Builder v3.6 and Fact Sheet Fusion v2.

The Bible text is arranged into 365 manageable daily readings.

Setting the highest standards of reliability and readability, the NIV is ideal for personal reading, public teaching and group study. \nRoyalties from all sales of the NIV help Biblica in their work of translating and distributing Bibles around the world.\n\nThis Anglicised NIV Bible in One Year app has been developed in the UK by Aimer Media in collaboration with Hodder & Stoughton. Due to the terms of Hodder’s NIV license, the app cannot be purchased in the USA or Canada. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.\n\nDAVID SUCHET\nDavid Suchet CBE is an acclaimed British actor. He has enjoyed great success with the RSC and in London's West End.

      "label": "This App is based upon the 1979 Book of Common Prayer (BCP - Episcopal Church) and the Revised Common Lectionary (RCL). The purpose of the App is to provide the complete Year A, B, and C Sunday Lectionary scriptures that are normally only listed by their passages. In the past, the reader would look up the passages in the Book of Common Prayer for the applicable Year and date. Next they would individually open their Bible to the passage to obtain the reading. \n\nBy having the readings in the app database saves the reader from having to look these scriptures up. The database and supporting algorithms also provide a perpetual yearly calendar for all Sunday readings (forever).\n\nTo select the Revised Common Lectionary (RCL), click the settings button in the bottom tab bar, then select RCL in the top right corner of the Settings display then click Save. You will need to close and reopen to app after changing the Lectionary setting. \n\nI hope you and your family enjoy this App as much as I have enjoyed creating it and using it for my own family."

It covers all Australian States and Territories. Over twelve thousand images are used to assist interpretation of species features and the species themselves as well as their geographic distribution. \n\nThis innovative application makes identification a breeze. The process begins by choosing from simple characteristics of the eucalypt you are trying to identify. For example, answer questions such does it have rough or smooth bark, leaf shapes and flower types. If you’re not sure what to look at next the Lucid application can even recommend features to guide you through to the fastest identification possible. EUCLID is a treasure-trove of information. The application brings together beautifully illustrated features states to help visualise your choices as well as fact sheets and images of every species – all at your fingertips. \n\nThe App edition of EUCLID still functions without an internet connection, making it especially valuable for people working in the field."

      "label": "Australian Snake ID by Hal Cogger\n\nAustralia boasts a rich snake fauna of about 180 species of land snakes, with a further 36 species of venomous sea snakes in its surrounding oceans. Identifying a snake that has been observed in the wild before disappearing into the bush [or ocean], and so cannot be examined close-up, is fraught with difficulties. Some groups of snakes, such as the seven (7) different kinds of death adders that occur throughout continental Australia, share a distinctive shape and form of tail, and are instantly recognisable. The 47 worm-like blind snakes (Family Typhlopidae), with their unformed eyes and nearly always a distinctive blunt spiny tip to their tails, are also instantly recognisable as a group, but immensely difficult to identify to species without the aid of a microscope.\n\nTo a specialist familiar with them, subtle differences in body form (i.e. slender or heavy build, narrow neck, broad head) will often allow the recognition of a snake species at a glance, or the colour or pattern alone may be quite distinctive and diagnostic. But to accurately identify the majority of Australia's snakes requires checking finer details of body features - the number of scales around the middle of the body or along the belly and tail, or the configuration of the scales on the head, or the nature of the individual scales - characteristics that can only be observed if the snake is in hand. Consequently the ease and accuracy of identifying an Australian snake depends on being able to closely examine the finer details of its physical characteristics.\n\nWhere up-close examination of a snake is not feasible, this guide asks for some basic information (approximate size, dominant colour(s), location, etc) and presents the user with a series of photographs of species likely to be encountered at the location where the observation was made, and that can roughly match the few characters observed. The user is then invited to work through the gallery of potential species to find the one (or more) that most closely resembles the snake observed. Information about other features of these species (their habits and habitats) can then be used in an attempt to eliminate as many species as possible from the list of 'possibles'.\n\nIf the snake to be identified has been killed or captured, its identity can be established with a much higher level of accuracy and certainty. This will usually involve first becoming familiar with the characters most often used in snake identification, by following the diagrams and examples provided - a task that becomes much easier with practice and familiarity. But whenever you end up with two or more \"possibles\" at the end of an identification session, then do as suggested in the absence of a specimen - work through the gallery of remaining \"possibles\" to find the one that most closely resembles the snake in hand.\n\nToday an increasing number of species - of snakes and other animals - are being identified on genetic grounds by comparing the DNA of specimens from a range of localities. Sometimes, species identified by this method may be physically similar to, or externally indistinguishable from, related species, making their identification in the field either ambiguous or impossible. However, if their geographic ranges don't overlap then location itself may be a diagnostic distinguishing feature. It is for this reason that regional location is a critical early character used in this app.\n\nAuthorship: Dr. Hal Cogger\n\nThis app was created using Lucid Builder v3.6 and Fact Sheet Fusion v2.

Many species are represented with multiple call examples showing the full range of vocalizations.\n● The ability to compare any two images, maps, or sounds, side by side on the screen. The ability to filter by geographic location, so that you see only the species likely to occur in your location, and to further reduce the possibilities to usual or vagrant species in the selected area.\n● A “Smart Search” that gives the ability to search by distinguishing features such as size, colour, physical features, habitat and exclude certain types of birds (eg. Passerines).\n● A basic personal species list that stores your sightings saved to the device* (ability to upload list coming soon)\n● A comprehensive help and introduction section to help you if you get stuck or don’t understand how a certain feature works.\n\n*Uninstalling/reinstalling the program will result in the loss of your list, it is recommended that you keep your own backup (master list) separate from the application.\n\nWe invite all users to share their comments and ideas on our forum at www.mydigitalearth.com \n\nNB. This Application WILL ONLY work on an iPhone or iPod Touch running iOS V7.1 or higher NOT A NORMAL IPOD CLASSIC/NANO and the download is about 320MB."

      "label": "The PIZZEY AND KNIGHT BIRDS OF AUSTRALIA Digital Edition for iPhone and iPad is a comprehensive and interactive application that combines images and sounds on over 900 Australian bird species with seven interactive modules for every aspect of mobile birding.  A slide menu facilitates easy navigation between all modules.\n\nThe app can be used as a FIELD GUIDE (like the book) or as a BIRD LIST, with essential functions such as view bird page, distribution map or text, play the sound, add to your list, and view similar birds available directly in both.  \n\nThe FIELD GUIDE displays the full field guide (family) pages of the book. You can browse the pages, select from the family list, or search for a specific species in the bird list.  Selecting a bird links to the full functions toolbar.\n\nThe BIRD GUIDE includes a full bird list and links to individual BIRD PAGES for over 900 species, with illustrations, species text, colour-coded distribution maps, photographs and sounds.  Selecting a bird in the list opens the full functions toolbar.  Optional settings for the BIRD LIST include regional lists, bird names from either IOC or Birdlife, alphabetical or taxonomic sort order, and text and thumbnail size.\n\nSIMILAR BIRDS loads a list of birds for comparison and identification. \n\nCOMPARE BIRDS displays the bird pages side by side for direct comparison.\n\nIDENTIFICATION uses location, habitat, bird shapes and plumage to shortlist possible species for identification, or viewing with the Compare Birds function. \n\nMY LOCATION is an interactive map for generating bird lists and locating birding sites near you. You can use current location or drop a pin for a new location with GPS co-ords and bird list. Birding sites are displayed with links to a list and site description.\n\nMY LISTS is a personal list manager that includes a life list and sub-lists that report to your life list. Sighting details include place, date, GPS co-ords, and sighting notes.  You can sync your lists to iCloud for backup, and also sync to linked devices. New SIGHTINGS SUMMARY for a selected species displays a summary list of sightings or displays sightings on a map.\n\nBIRDING SITES includes descriptions and photos of over 270 birding sites from around Australia, with functions for a bird list and ‘show on map’.\n\nMY PHOTOS links your personal bird photos to your sightings and lists, displays thumbnails on the bird pages and links to a photo viewer.\n\nThe MULTIMEDIA DATA includes • over 250 field-guide pages • over 900 individual bird pages • all the ‘new’ bird species and names • over 2500 illustrations, 4000 photos, and 1500 bird sounds • colour-coded distribution maps • seasonal status bar • endemic and red data species • rare bird maps.\n\n# This app can be used in the bush and remote locations. It does NOT require a wifi, phone or internet connection to operate. \n\nFor more detail on the PIZZEY AND KNIGHT BIRDS OF AUSTRALIA DIGITAL EDITION and to take a tour of the app, please visit www.gibbonmm.com.au."

      "label": "The Wattle - Acacias of Australia app (WATTLE ver. 3) enables users to identify wattle plants that occur anywhere in Australia or elsewhere in the world where they are grown. It includes 1,057 formally described species of Acacia, plus several hybrids and informal taxa of this genus. It also includes two species of Acaciella, four species of Senegalia and nine species of Vachellia that occur in Australia and which were previously included in Acacia.\n\nWATTLE ver. 3 builds upon two previous versions of WATTLE, namely, the original version that was published in 2001 on CD and version 2 that was published in 2014 on the Lucidcentral website. Compared with earlier versions, which are no longer available, WATTLE ver. 3 contains more species, updated coding and new or updated descriptions for each taxon, together with photographs and improved distribution maps.\n\nAt the heart of WATTLE is a powerful Lucid identification key which helps people of all ages to quickly and accurately identify species. The key is a truly random access tool, one that allows users to enter, in any order, the characteristics of a specimen that they wish to identify. The key then lists those species possessing the characteristics nominated, rejecting those that do not match the criteria entered. By progressively providing additional characteristics about the unknown specimen, users can narrow the search, eventually ending up with just one or a few species.\n\nThe key provides context-relevant information (text and images) that assist users to correctly interpret the characteristics of the plant they are attempting to identify. For those who want information about the species that has been identified, WATTLE ver. 3 provides fact sheets containing illustrations, detailed descriptions, photographs and maps that can be accessed directly. Hyperlinks provide simple navigation between fact sheets of related or similar species.\n\nWATTLE ver. 3 is jointly published by the Australian Biological Resources Study (ABRS), Canberra, The Western Australian Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (formerly CALM) and Identic Pty Ltd, Queensland. WATTLE complements the Flora of Australia (www.ausflora.org.au)."

SkySafari 7 brings social stargazing to mobile devices with two new features to help you connect with other like minded people.\n\nOneSky - allows you to see what other users are observing, in real time.  This feature highlights objects in the sky chart and indicates with a number how many users are observing a particular object.\n\nSkyCast - allows you to guide a friend or group around the night sky through their own copy of SkySafari. After initiating SkyCast, you can generate a link and conveniently share it with other SkySafari users via text message, apps or social media accounts.\n\n+ Sky Tonight -  jump to the new Tonight section to see what’s visible in your sky tonight.  Expanded information has been designed to help plan your night and includes  Moon & Sun info, calendar curations, events and the best positioned deep sky and solar system objects.\n\n+ Improved Observation Tools - SkySafari is the perfect tool to help you plan, record and organize your observations.  New workflows make it easier to add, search, filter and sort data.\n\n+ Home Screen and Lock Screen Widgets  keep your favorite astro information at your fingertips.\n\nThe Small Touches:\n\n+ You can now edit the Jupiter GRS Longitude Value in the Settings.\n+ Better Moon Age calculation.\n+ New grid & reference options allow you to display Solstice and Equinox markers, Orbit + Node markers for all solar system objects, and tick marks and labels for the Ecliptic, Meridian, and Equator reference lines.\n+ Previous In-app Purchases are Now Free -  this includes the H-R diagram, 3D Galaxy view, and the PGC galaxy and GAIA star catalogs. Enjoy.\n+ Many more.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 7 Pro before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n+ Hold your device up, and SkySafari 7 Pro will find stars, constellations, planets, and more! The star chart updates automatically with your movements for the ultimate stargazing experience.\n\n+ Simulate the night sky up to 100,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n+ Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n+ Optionally backup all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n+ Augmented Reality (AR) mode\n\n+ Night Vision.\n\n+ Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n+ Galaxy View shows the position of deep sky objects in our Milky Way!\n\n+ Much more!"

      "label": "Find the right word wherever you go. The official RhymeZone iOS app is a fast, powerful rhyming dictionary and thesaurus that you can use anywhere, even if you're not on the net. Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

In this way the Strong's Concordance provides an independent check against translations, and offers an opportunity for greater, and more technically accurate understanding of the Bible text.\n\nWant to see it in action before you buy? Try Strong's Concordance Lite which provides a 100% functional demo of Matthew and Genesis.\n\nThis program does not require internet access, everything you need is all stored on the iDevice.\n\nFeatures:\n* Search for English words, and lookup Greek/Hebrew dictionaries.\n* Proper concordance, listing how the word was translated in other bible verses.\n* Full King James Text is included\n* Click on any blue word for concordance text.\n* Night mode for those that like to read at night (White on black)\n* iPad support\n\nPlease note: This version is not an \"exhaustive\" concordance, and does skip smaller words such as \"and, or, the, a\" as well as some other words. Though we think you'll find it has most (if not all) the words you'll ever need.\n\nWe're open to suggestions for improvement in future versions. Send comments and suggestions to strongs at orionsys.org."

This is better.\"\n\n - \"Nice, it's easier to tell which perks are really helpful without tapping every single one just to see what it does\"\n\n - \"the app will let you know when you've chosen too many perks.\" (it now tells you if legendary skills are required)\n\n\nAt any time, while planning your build, you can monitor the results of your choices: required skill levels, build summary, and player level.  \n\nLike the other apps in this series, this app is likely to be updated frequently per user requests, so try it and let me know what you think. \n\n\nUPDATE #1:\n---\n\nAdded per user requests:\n - multiple profiles\n - improved graphics (was too dark before)\n - confirmation to remove perks from summary in case of  accidental touches \n - links to email the author with questions/suggestions\n - werewolf and vampire do not add to level calculation\n - app no longer lists level cap as 82.

      "label": "The release of Australian Tropical Rainforest Plants Edition 8 (RFK 8) represents another significant milestone in the development of this information system for identifying and learning about plants in Australian tropical rainforests. Each edition of the system since 1971 has made significant advances in the coverage of plant groups, the numbers of species included, the effectiveness of the identification system, and in the utilisation of current technology. As always, the aim of this new edition is to enable as many people as possible to simply and accurately identify and learn about plants in Australia’s tropical rainforests.\n\nWhat is new?\n\nThe main goal for Edition 8 of Australian Tropical Rainforest Plants was to move to a mobile application platform that is available both online and downloadable to electronic devices. The coverage of the key includes the rainforests of the whole of the Australian tropics. A second goal was to continue adding taxa from regions already covered that had not been included in previous editions primarily due to lack of specimens for coding, and to update the nomenclature and distribution information for all taxa as required.\n\nAustralian Tropical Rainforest Plants Edition 8 includes 2762 taxa in 176 families and 48 new name changes. All flowering plant species are included - trees, shrubs, vines, forbs, grasses and sedges, epiphytes, palms and pandans – except most orchids which are treated in a separate key (see below), and a few other species for which specimens suitable for coding features are lacking.\n\nAll rainforest orchids are included in a dedicated orchid module (Australian Tropical Rainforest Orchids) now also delivered online. The need for a separate module was due to the unique morphology of the Orchidaceae family and the distinct set of features required for effective identification to species level. Nine species of orchid have been included within RFK8, mainly terrestrial species that reach more than one metre in height, or climbers.\n\nSimilarly, the ferns are currently under development as a separate module, Ferns of Northern Australia. Again, the unique morphology, terminology and features required for effective identification of ferns have dictated that a stand-alone module be developed.\n\nThe number of images in the key continues to increase, now numbering over 14,000. Most of images were gathered by CSIRO staff as part of this long-running research project. Significant numbers of new images have been provided by various photographers listed in the Acknowledgements section, most notably Garry Sankowsky, Steve Pearson, John Dowe and Russell Barrett.

The SDA Church Manual is very useful to all SDA Church Members and Leaders and other people who want to know more about Jesus and His Church the Seventh Day Adventist Church.\n\nFeatures :\n\n-\tFriendly interface\n-\tSearch any key word through the whole book\n- Support many languages : English, French, Spanish\n-\tZoom\n-\tWork offline\n-\tSelect the text to share it with your friends through e-mail, WhatsApp, Facebook\n-\tMore features to come with updates\n\n\nWhy does the Seventh-day Adventist Church have a Church Manual? God is a God of order as evidenced in His works of creation and redemption. Consequently, order belongs to the essence of His church. Order is achieved through principles and regulations that guide the Church in its internal operations and in fulfillmenting its mission to the world. In order for it to be a successful ecclesiastical organization at the service of the Lord and humanity, it needs order, rule, and discipline. Scripture affirms that “all things be done decently and in order” (1 Cor. 14:40)."

      "label": "THE PREMIER IPAD ATLAS - with RETINA VECTOR MAPS\n\nThe World HD is unique in the app store because it includes both a complete set of country maps AND the largest world fact book.  These enable it to answer questions which Atlases and fact books cannot:  Atlases show you where countries are located, but have very little information about them; fact books tell you about each country, but their maps leave you guessing about where places are located.\n\n\n___________ HOW IT WORKS ___________\n\nThe interface is animated and interactive.  Touch a country on the world map and the Retina vector country map opens while the factbook slides onto the screen, each topic neatly organized as tiles along the edge of the map.  Touch a factbook tile and it zooms out to reveal detailed information about that topic.  Not sure where a country is located?  Select it on the drop-down list and The World HD zooms in on it then opens the map and factbook.\n\nThe zoomable world map is not just the fastest way to select a country it also enables you to visualize and understand entire regions.  It is so intuitive and easy to explore that once you get started it's hard to stop!\n\n\n___________ FEATURES ___________\n\nRETINA VECTOR MAPS\n** Includes high-resolution Retina vector maps for EVERY COUNTRY built-in!  Unlike the other atlases, these maps remain in focus at all magnifications so you can easily see even the smallest detail.  These aren't the CIA maps found in the factbooks, they are used in printed atlases.\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n** Contains geopolitical and demographic information on 300 countries and regions.\n\nNO INTERNET CONNECTION is required\n** Except for live Wikipedia content, all data and maps are built-in\n\nINNOVATIVE FACT BOOK PANEL\n** Presents each section of the fact book as tiles enabling you to quickly find what you need, while keeping the country map in view.\n\nHIGHLY ANIMATED INTERFACE\n** Responds to your touches and gestures so you can quickly find the information you are looking for.\n\nCIA WORLD FACTBOOK\n** This trusted source of current country information is built-in for every country, including sections on: introduction, geography, people, economy, communications, transportation, military, and transnational issues.\n\nWIKIPEDIA\n** View the live, community-written Wikipedia content for each country, island, and remote region within the app.\n\nSHOWS YOU where countries are located\n** Not sure where a country is located?  Select it on the country list and The World zooms to it on the world map and opens the Fact Book Panel\n\nDESIGNED FOR YOUR IPAD & IPHONE\n** Thoughtfully uses the whole screen to present maps and data"

It is based on an updated edition of the popular CD version and includes the full identification key, weed fact sheets, and over 10,000 images right on your smart device. \n\nEnvironmental Weeds of Australia has been developed to assist with the identification of weed species that invade natural habitats. It is a valuable resource for all those concerned about environmental weeds: weed and biodiversity researchers, trainers, advisors, weed control officers, environmental community groups, weed management practitioners, and anyone with an interest in environmental weeds.\n\nWhile Australian focused, this key provides an excellent resource to users in other countries. Both plain English and botanical terms (usually in brackets) are used throughout the App to make it applicable to as wide an audience as possible. \n\nAt the core of this App is an interactive Lucid identification key to 1020 plant species that are either significant or emerging environmental weeds in Australia. To help confirm the identification of weed species the app  provides over 10,000 photos and a wealth of information on each weed species and how to distinguish between very similar species. In many cases,  links are provided to websites that have relevant information about the management of specific weed species."

[Please note that this app requires wifi or cellular access to the internet]. \n\nWith VH reg you can get instant answers to the following questions: \n\n• What are the registration details for aircraft VH-abc? \n\n• Who is the registered owner and/or operator? \n\n• Show me ALL of the aircraft that they own or operate \n\n• Give me a list of ALL other aircraft which are of the same type, or have the same engine or prop, or are from the same manufacturer. \n\n• Find any owner or operator (and therefore all of their aircraft) from an auto-complete style drop down of names. \n\n• For any of the above, make a single-tap call to the internet search engines, to discover anything known about the aircraft, owner, operator, or model etc. \n\nVHReg implements a tight integration with the internet’s leading search engine. If you want extended information about an owner, or need to know engine details, or get pics of the aircraft, it’s generally only a few taps away. \n\nThe app is fully documented through on-screen help, with full email support to all purchasers from the developers."

Built for your busy lifestyle, iRosary works like a traditional Rosary, but tells you the prayers, remembers your place, and is always with you when you need it.\n\nNATIONAL MEDIA:\nThe Catholic News Service says: \"Need to Pray?

Those who pray the Rosary regularly will appreciate how closely iRosary resembles a traditional Catholic Rosary.\n\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\nJust like a classic Rosary.  Simply recite the prayer and pull the beads down to advance to the next prayer.  It's that easy!\n\n\nFEATURES:\n\n•Beads which MOVE to the touch\n\n•Create your own PERFECT DESIGN from 243 cross, chain, and bead combinations\n\n•Two sets of FAMOUS ARTWORK\n\n•Text can be RESIZED directly with two fingers for easy reading\n\n•Portrait and LANDSCAPE modes\n\n•English, Spanish, French, and Latin prayers\n\n•Correctly recommends the Mystery to pray based on the LITURGICAL YEAR\n\n•PLEASING sound cues and vibration\n\n•Use with EITHER HAND by moving the beads to the left or the right\n\n•Always REMEMBERS your place\n\n•Uses the same set of prayers listed on the VATICAN website\n\n•The same number of beads as a STANDARD Rosary (between bead prayers fold out)\n\n•Push beads back to return to a PREVIOUS prayer\n\n•The LUMINOUS mysteries can be turned on or off\n\n•Includes the CHAPLET of Divine Mercy and Loreto LITANIES\n\n•A DYNAMIC interface which moves, slides, and rotates to your gestures\n\n•We use iRosary every day ourselves.\n\niRosary is a wonderful compliment to the Holy Bible!\n\n--------------------\nKeywords: God, Jesus, Religion, Religious, Pray, Prayer, Hail Mary, Bible, Christian, Holy Rosary\n\n--------------------\nLANGUAGES:\nEnglish, Spanish"

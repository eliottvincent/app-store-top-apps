      "label": "SkySafari 6 Plus goes beyond most basic astronomy apps by providing you with a full-featured space simulator with telescope control and Augmented Reality (AR) mode.\n\nNote that there is no discount upgrade path from SkySafari 6 Plus to SkySafari 6 Pro. Choose carefully!\n\nHere's what's new in version 6:\n\n1) Complete support for iOS 13 and iPhone 11. We got you covered and release regular updates.\n\n2) Clouds and Astronomy. Two words that rarely go together. Rewritten from the ground up, SkySafari 6 Plus will (optionally) back up all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n3) We Have The Best Stars. Precise, modern and deep. We’ve updated our star catalog to use the latest and greatest, UCAC5 star catalog.\n\n4) Observers First. A redesign of our tools puts the active observer first. Quick access to features like your equipment, observing sites, lists, and observations make it easy and enjoyable to get out, observe, and record your observations.\n\n5) Graph It. The completely new graph tool will give a quick visual representation of an object’s altitude above the horizon. Essential for planning your night’s observations.\n\n6) Plan It. Make the most of your time under the stars. Our updated planner is a powerful tool that lets you create a list of targets for your observing session with filters like object types, specific time ranges, constellation, catalog, and more. Plan it and get more done.\n\n7) Say It. Ever just wanted to just yell at your device and tell it what to do!? SkySafari 6 adds basic voice control for a wide range of operations. Say “select Jupiter,” “search for Titan,” “center on Polaris” and SkySafari will do the work for you. Yelling optional. \n\n8) Tilt It. Every old astronomy app these days lets your tilt and pan your device to show different parts of the sky, but who else lets you control your telescope that way!? “Tilt to slew” is an optional mode allowing you to keep your eye in the eyepiece, and, using the accelerometers in your device, gently translate the movements of your hands into smooth telescope motion.\n\n9) Share It. SkySafari 6 is more than just a mobile app, it’s a new system to help organize and share your observing experiences. With a free signup, you can see and share your observing data from our web portal, LiveSky.com! Affordable premium memberships add online editing, so you can not only view, but edit your observations, add new observing sites, manage your equipment and more. Finally, (coming soon) you can view, edit and manage your settings files with SkySafari Web, our fully functional web version.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 6 Plus before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n• Hold your device up, and SkySafari 6 Plus will find stars, constellations, planets, and more!\n\n• Simulate the night sky up to 10,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n• Learn the history, mythology, and science of astronomy! Browse over 1500 object descriptions and astronomical images. Explore NASA space missions! Stay up-to-date with SkyWeek for all major sky events every day!\n\n• Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n• Night Vision  – Preserve your eyesight after dark.\n\n• Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n• Time Flow – Follow the motion of sky objects as days, months, and years are compressed into a few seconds.\n\n• Advanced Search – Find objects using properties other than their name.\n\n• Support for Apple Watch!\n\n• Tonight at a Glance: the Sun, Moon, Planets, ISS, and Iridium flares in one handy view!\n\n• Notifications when the ISS will pass overhead, when Iridium satellites flare, and more!\n\n• Much more!\n\nFor even more features, and a gigantic database aimed at the most dedicated amateur or professional astronomer, check out SkySafari 6 Pro!"

Many species are represented with multiple call examples showing the full range of vocalizations.\n● The ability to compare any two images, maps, or sounds, side by side on the screen. The ability to filter by geographic location, so that you see only the species likely to occur in your location, and to further reduce the possibilities to usual or vagrant species in the selected area.\n● A “Smart Search” that gives the ability to search by distinguishing features such as size, colour, physical features, habitat and exclude certain types of birds (eg. Passerines).\n● A basic personal species list that stores your sightings saved to the device* (ability to upload list coming soon)\n● A comprehensive help and introduction section to help you if you get stuck or don’t understand how a certain feature works.\n\n*Uninstalling/reinstalling the program will result in the loss of your list, it is recommended that you keep your own backup (master list) separate from the application.\n\nWe invite all users to share their comments and ideas on our forum at www.mydigitalearth.com \n\nNB. This Application WILL ONLY work on an iPhone or iPod Touch running iOS V7.1 or higher NOT A NORMAL IPOD CLASSIC/NANO and the download is about 320MB."

Consequently, they play significant roles in the landscape, in the ecology of our land, in forestry, in apiculture and in horticulture.\n\nEUCLID provides complete descriptions of 934 species and subspecies of Angophora, Corymbia and Eucalyptus plus an interactive identification key using Lucid software. It covers all Australian States and Territories. Over twelve thousand images are used to assist interpretation of species features and the species themselves as well as their geographic distribution. \n\nThis innovative application makes identification a breeze. The process begins by choosing from simple characteristics of the eucalypt you are trying to identify. For example, answer questions such does it have rough or smooth bark, leaf shapes and flower types. If you’re not sure what to look at next the Lucid application can even recommend features to guide you through to the fastest identification possible. EUCLID is a treasure-trove of information. The application brings together beautifully illustrated features states to help visualise your choices as well as fact sheets and images of every species – all at your fingertips. \n\nThe App edition of EUCLID still functions without an internet connection, making it especially valuable for people working in the field."

      "label": "The PIZZEY AND KNIGHT BIRDS OF AUSTRALIA Digital Edition for iPhone and iPad is a comprehensive and interactive application that combines images and sounds on over 900 Australian bird species with seven interactive modules for every aspect of mobile birding.  A slide menu facilitates easy navigation between all modules.\n\nThe app can be used as a FIELD GUIDE (like the book) or as a BIRD LIST, with essential functions such as view bird page, distribution map or text, play the sound, add to your list, and view similar birds available directly in both.  \n\nThe FIELD GUIDE displays the full field guide (family) pages of the book. You can browse the pages, select from the family list, or search for a specific species in the bird list.  Selecting a bird links to the full functions toolbar.\n\nThe BIRD GUIDE includes a full bird list and links to individual BIRD PAGES for over 900 species, with illustrations, species text, colour-coded distribution maps, photographs and sounds.  Selecting a bird in the list opens the full functions toolbar.  Optional settings for the BIRD LIST include regional lists, bird names from either IOC or Birdlife, alphabetical or taxonomic sort order, and text and thumbnail size.\n\nSIMILAR BIRDS loads a list of birds for comparison and identification. \n\nCOMPARE BIRDS displays the bird pages side by side for direct comparison.\n\nIDENTIFICATION uses location, habitat, bird shapes and plumage to shortlist possible species for identification, or viewing with the Compare Birds function. \n\nMY LOCATION is an interactive map for generating bird lists and locating birding sites near you. You can use current location or drop a pin for a new location with GPS co-ords and bird list. Birding sites are displayed with links to a list and site description.\n\nMY LISTS is a personal list manager that includes a life list and sub-lists that report to your life list. Sighting details include place, date, GPS co-ords, and sighting notes.  You can sync your lists to iCloud for backup, and also sync to linked devices. New SIGHTINGS SUMMARY for a selected species displays a summary list of sightings or displays sightings on a map.\n\nBIRDING SITES includes descriptions and photos of over 270 birding sites from around Australia, with functions for a bird list and ‘show on map’.\n\nMY PHOTOS links your personal bird photos to your sightings and lists, displays thumbnails on the bird pages and links to a photo viewer.\n\nThe MULTIMEDIA DATA includes • over 250 field-guide pages • over 900 individual bird pages • all the ‘new’ bird species and names • over 2500 illustrations, 4000 photos, and 1500 bird sounds • colour-coded distribution maps • seasonal status bar • endemic and red data species • rare bird maps.\n\n# This app can be used in the bush and remote locations. It does NOT require a wifi, phone or internet connection to operate. \n\nFor more detail on the PIZZEY AND KNIGHT BIRDS OF AUSTRALIA DIGITAL EDITION and to take a tour of the app, please visit www.gibbonmm.com.au."

Shop with a clear conscience!\n\nThe most comprehensive guide to ethical shopping in Australia, Shop Ethical! has been designed to provide consumers with the easiest way to make informed purchasing decisions. \n\nThe Shop Ethical! app provides consumers instant access to over 5,000 products with related company information and lets them make an informed and ethical decision whenever they shop.\n\nBy shopping ethically consumers can send a strong message for change and help support the practices that make our world a better place to live in.\n\nThe Shop Ethical! app uses the latest data from the Shop Ethical! website (ethical.org.au) and is also available as a book. The Shop Ethical! app has been downloaded thousands of times since 2010, and the Shop Ethical! book has sold over 135,000 copies since 2008.\n\nCompany ratings are based on information gathered from over 50 sources including the work of organisations such as Greenpeace, Choose Cruelty Free, WWF, Rank a Brand and Friends of the Earth.\n\nShop Ethical! is a collaboration between the Ethical Consumer Group and Outware Mobile. \n\nAS FEATURED ON CHANNEL 7 NEWS!  \n\nCUSTOMER TESTIMONIALS : \n  Best app I have, I use it daily and it's changed the way I see the world. \n Emma, VIC \n\n  Simply, \"Thank you.\" I am so grateful that you have done all the hard work, so that lazy/tired/child-distracted mothers like me can confidently tell their whining 8 year olds \"no, we are not buying that, because the people who will get our money hurt other people and/or animals\".  I have always wanted this information but have never had the spare energy to go and find it myself. You have done a brilliant job. Please let me know if you have a panel of testers or proof readers which requires more members, or any other way in which I can contribute to your efforts from home while Miss 8 sleeps. I have been forwarding your \"tell a friend\" message onto everyone I know who has an iPhone.  \nAnnie, Boronia, VIC   \n\nAWESOME app!! Thanks guys. I'm a naturopath that tries to educate my patients on the benefits of ethical shopping and living sustainably. Will definitely be recommending this app to my patients. Great work! \n Elise, Vic   \n\nThank you big time for this app!! It's so easy to use at the supermarket and clarifies so many of the issues surrounding products and companies, making the weekly shop fit better with my conscience. My kids are also able to look and see if their favourite things are positive or negative and can make their own ethical shopping decisions. Brilliant!!!  \nSara, Canberra\n\nThis app works on both iPhone and iPad. It is optimised for smartphones, not tablets."

      "label": "Australian Snake ID by Hal Cogger\n\nAustralia boasts a rich snake fauna of about 180 species of land snakes, with a further 36 species of venomous sea snakes in its surrounding oceans. Identifying a snake that has been observed in the wild before disappearing into the bush [or ocean], and so cannot be examined close-up, is fraught with difficulties. Some groups of snakes, such as the seven (7) different kinds of death adders that occur throughout continental Australia, share a distinctive shape and form of tail, and are instantly recognisable. The 47 worm-like blind snakes (Family Typhlopidae), with their unformed eyes and nearly always a distinctive blunt spiny tip to their tails, are also instantly recognisable as a group, but immensely difficult to identify to species without the aid of a microscope.\n\nTo a specialist familiar with them, subtle differences in body form (i.e. slender or heavy build, narrow neck, broad head) will often allow the recognition of a snake species at a glance, or the colour or pattern alone may be quite distinctive and diagnostic. But to accurately identify the majority of Australia's snakes requires checking finer details of body features - the number of scales around the middle of the body or along the belly and tail, or the configuration of the scales on the head, or the nature of the individual scales - characteristics that can only be observed if the snake is in hand. Consequently the ease and accuracy of identifying an Australian snake depends on being able to closely examine the finer details of its physical characteristics.\n\nWhere up-close examination of a snake is not feasible, this guide asks for some basic information (approximate size, dominant colour(s), location, etc) and presents the user with a series of photographs of species likely to be encountered at the location where the observation was made, and that can roughly match the few characters observed. The user is then invited to work through the gallery of potential species to find the one (or more) that most closely resembles the snake observed. Information about other features of these species (their habits and habitats) can then be used in an attempt to eliminate as many species as possible from the list of 'possibles'.\n\nIf the snake to be identified has been killed or captured, its identity can be established with a much higher level of accuracy and certainty. This will usually involve first becoming familiar with the characters most often used in snake identification, by following the diagrams and examples provided - a task that becomes much easier with practice and familiarity. But whenever you end up with two or more \"possibles\" at the end of an identification session, then do as suggested in the absence of a specimen - work through the gallery of remaining \"possibles\" to find the one that most closely resembles the snake in hand.\n\nToday an increasing number of species - of snakes and other animals - are being identified on genetic grounds by comparing the DNA of specimens from a range of localities. Sometimes, species identified by this method may be physically similar to, or externally indistinguishable from, related species, making their identification in the field either ambiguous or impossible. However, if their geographic ranges don't overlap then location itself may be a diagnostic distinguishing feature. It is for this reason that regional location is a critical early character used in this app.\n\nAuthorship: Dr. Hal Cogger\n\nThis app was created using Lucid Builder v3.6 and Fact Sheet Fusion v2.

      "label": "The Lost Person Behavior App is based upon the Search and Rescue (SAR) international gold standard reference tool on where to look for lost and missing persons. Every Public Safety Official needs to know where the missing person might be, what to ask, where to look, and what to do when minutes matter. The app was built around the field needs of Public Safety Officials.  No matter how remote the location, the app continues to function since no network connection is required, once installed.\n\nThis life-saving information is customized for 41 different subject categories. The categories are organized into a hierarchy of groups including external factors (abductions, aircraft), water incidents (boats and persons in the water), wheeled incidents (ATV, mountain bikes, vehicles, etc.), mental states (autism, dementia, despondent, intellectual disability, mental illness, substance intoxication), children (in five different age groups), and eighteen outdoor activities (hiker, hunter, climber, gatherer, skier, etc.).\n\nThe app guides the user in selecting the correct subject category by several means. The subject category wizard allows the user to select potential scenarios and then will suggest the best match for the subject category.  For example, if a child was riding his bicycle and was then known to be abducted, the user could select Child, Wheel/Motorized, and Abduction; the wizard would suggest using the abduction category. Alternately, the user can go straight to a subject category by using favorites, an alphabetical list, or the hierarchy list. Once the subject category is selected, the Lost Person Behavior App provides the user with: \n•\tbehavioral profiles\n•\ttactical briefings\n•\tspecific investigative questions\n•\tspatial and survival statistics\n•\tsuggestions for initial tasks (reflex tasking).\n\nThe all-new tactical briefings distill the statistics and profiles to the key points that every field searcher must know. The more extensive profile, full statistics, and suggested initial tasks assist even the seasoned search planner. The highly detailed questions for the investigation resulted from decades of SAR experience and thousands of missions.\n\nThe app even allows you to email a checklist of these critical tasks and interview questions so that you may print them out.  The email could also be used for providing remote support or documenting tasks that have been completed.\n\nDetermining where to look is one of the major functions of the search statistics, which are now provided in a graphical and tabular format.  The statistics from thousands of SAR missions allow the search planner to see where similar previous search subjects were found. The SAR statistics include:\n•\tDistance from the Initial Planning Point\n•\tElevation model (likelihood of going up, down, or staying at the same elevation)\n•\tMobility model (how long will the subject keep moving)\n•\tDispersion angle (given a direction of travel, how well does that predict subject’s location)\n•\tTrack Offset model (how far away from a feature such as a road or trail is subject found)\n•\tFind location (at what type of geographic feature was the subject found)\n•\tScenario (what caused the subject to become missing)\n•\tSurvivability overall (what is the overall chance of finding the subject alive or injured)\n•\tSurvivability rate (how does survivability rate change in 24-hour increments).\n\nThe Lost Person Behavior App can be easily customized to only show the statistical information you actually need. The user can customize for ecoregion, terrain, and urban incidents. The user can view the data in both metric and English units. Several additional helpful tools are built into the app. Contextual help is provided on every page with additional information boxes, which explain every element of the app on the page you need.  The information page provides information about the bike wheel model used to describe initial tactical deployment (reflex tasking), a glossary, help, and contact information."

No truth is more evident to my mind than that the Christian religion must be the basis of any government intended to secure the rights and privileges of a free people.\"\n\nNoah Webster, the Father of American Christian education, wrote the first American dictionary and established a system of rules to govern spelling, grammar, and reading. This master linguist understood the power of words, their definitions, and the need for precise word usage in communication to maintain independence. Webster used the Bible as the foundation for his definitions thus making the 1828 Dictionary a work that contains more Biblical definitions than any other reference work.\n\nThis app is an essential tool for students of all ages."

It also includes tables to calculate the amount of oil or gas to add to an existing premix to change it to another ratio. To use:\n• Tap the table most applicable to your search,\n• Scroll to find your desired value,\n• View the calculated value. Done!\n\nUseful for:\nTwo-stroke (two-cycle) engines that require the user to premix the gas with a specific amount of oil. Given a ratio of gas to oil, the user needs to calculate the amount of oil to be added to the amount of gas they have. \nMany applications, including: Golf carts, Motorcycles, Snowmobiles, Blowers, Chainsaws, Tillers, Rotary plows, Utility Tractors, Garden tools, Motorscooters, some Genetators, Marine Outboard motors.\nUsers needing to change an exsiting premix from one ratio to another i.e. if they have two two-stroke engines that require different gas-to-oil ratios. If one of those engines runs out of fuel, then in order to make the correct gas/oil mix for that engine, a calculation will need to be done to work out how much oil or gas needs to be added. \n\nIncrements & Accuracy \n• Tap the bottom bar buttons to choose alternative increments (e.g. 1 gal, 0.1 gal, 0.01 gal). \n• The table defaults to the largest increment available. \n\nMore Units \n• Some tables have too many 'to' units to fit in the iPhone portrait position. Rotate your iPhone to the landscape position to show more conversion units (where available). \n\nBroad Categories \n• Create Premix with US, UK and Metric volumes of gas, with various ratios.\n• Change Ratios of US, UK and Metric volumes of gas, to a range of new ratios.\n\nSpecific Units Included \n• US Fluid Ounces, Gallons \n• UK Fluid Ounces, Gallons \n• Milliliters, Litres \n\nUniversal App \nThis means you only need to buy it once to be able to install it on all your devices (iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad). \n\nIf you find this app useful, please leave a review on the App Store. \n\nIf you have suggestions, feature requests, or need support, feel free to contact us through the Settings menu within our apps."

      "label": "There has never been an easier way to read the Bible in one year. Now, with the NIV Bible in One Year app from Hodder & Stoughton, you can both read it and listen to it on the move via your iOS device. \n\nThe NIV Audio Bible in One Year app includes the full text of the NIV Bible (British Text) and the award-winning audio narration by British actor, David Suchet. The Bible text is arranged into 365 manageable daily readings. Each day includes portions from the Psalms or Proverbs, and New and Old Testaments. \n\nThe app also includes a journalling feature in which you can make notes next to the text as you study and bookmark your favourite passages for easy reference. The app also allows you to share notes and Bible verses with friends and family or yourself by SMS (text), email, Twitter and Facebook.\n\nINSTALL NOTE: The price of this app includes the full 80 hours of audio for the NIV Bible read by David Suchet (which amounts to 1.3GB) but it does not automatically download when you purchase the app. Users can download each month’s audio content from within the app to suit their storage limitations. \n\nLISTEN TO THE BIBLE IN ONE YEAR\n- Listen to British actor David Suchet read his award-winning recording as you read the Bible in One Year or while multitasking.\n- Download all the audio at once, or one month at a time, depending on the space available on your device.\n- Follow the verses as they are narrated by selecting ‘Highlight verse with audio’. \n- Turn off the audio capability entirely if you wish to use the app for reading only. \n- Use the Sleep Timer to play the audio for a set number of minutes. \n- The NIV Audio Bible read by David Suchet won 'Bible of the Year' at the 2015 Christian Resources Together Awards.\n\nREAD THE NIV BIBLE IN ONE YEAR EVERYWHERE \n- The NIV Bible in One Year app is available on all iOS devices. \n- The app will automatically open on today’s reading. \n- Switch off ‘Always show today’s reading’ in the Settings menu. \n- Simple navigation: select any day of the year via ‘Find a Day’ in the main menu, or the scroller menu at the top of the screen. \n- Clear, readable layout: the Bible text matches the printed NIV 2011 Bibles. \n- Full Bible text included so no need for a network connection to use any of the app features. \n- Full-text keyword search allows you to find all entries for a particular word in the Bible. \n- Turn off toolbars to give you an uninterrupted reading experience. \n- Adjust text size and brightness to make reading more comfortable. \n\nJOURNALLING\n- Make notes next to the text as you study the Bible in One Year. \n- Bookmark your favourite passages for easy reference. \n- Notes and Bookmarks tabs list of all your entries so you can quickly jump to the one you want. \n- Share notes and verses with friends and family or yourself by SMS (text), email, Twitter and Facebook.\n\nNEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION\nWith over 400 million Bibles in print, the New International Version is the world’s most popular Bible in modern English. Setting the highest standards of reliability and readability, the NIV is ideal for personal reading, public teaching and group study. \nRoyalties from all sales of the NIV help Biblica in their work of translating and distributing Bibles around the world.\n\nThis Anglicised NIV Bible in One Year app has been developed in the UK by Aimer Media in collaboration with Hodder & Stoughton. Due to the terms of Hodder’s NIV license, the app cannot be purchased in the USA or Canada. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.\n\nDAVID SUCHET\nDavid Suchet CBE is an acclaimed British actor. He has enjoyed great success with the RSC and in London's West End. He is best known in television for his portrayal of Agatha Christie's detective Hercule Poirot. He is also a practising Anglican.

      "label": "The Wattle - Acacias of Australia app (WATTLE ver. 3) enables users to identify wattle plants that occur anywhere in Australia or elsewhere in the world where they are grown. It includes 1,057 formally described species of Acacia, plus several hybrids and informal taxa of this genus. It also includes two species of Acaciella, four species of Senegalia and nine species of Vachellia that occur in Australia and which were previously included in Acacia.\n\nWATTLE ver. 3 builds upon two previous versions of WATTLE, namely, the original version that was published in 2001 on CD and version 2 that was published in 2014 on the Lucidcentral website. Compared with earlier versions, which are no longer available, WATTLE ver. 3 contains more species, updated coding and new or updated descriptions for each taxon, together with photographs and improved distribution maps.\n\nAt the heart of WATTLE is a powerful Lucid identification key which helps people of all ages to quickly and accurately identify species. The key is a truly random access tool, one that allows users to enter, in any order, the characteristics of a specimen that they wish to identify. The key then lists those species possessing the characteristics nominated, rejecting those that do not match the criteria entered. By progressively providing additional characteristics about the unknown specimen, users can narrow the search, eventually ending up with just one or a few species.\n\nThe key provides context-relevant information (text and images) that assist users to correctly interpret the characteristics of the plant they are attempting to identify. For those who want information about the species that has been identified, WATTLE ver. 3 provides fact sheets containing illustrations, detailed descriptions, photographs and maps that can be accessed directly. Hyperlinks provide simple navigation between fact sheets of related or similar species.\n\nWATTLE ver. 3 is jointly published by the Australian Biological Resources Study (ABRS), Canberra, The Western Australian Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (formerly CALM) and Identic Pty Ltd, Queensland. WATTLE complements the Flora of Australia (www.ausflora.org.au)."

      "label": "\"...anyone grappling with the sort of evil cryptics with no black squares will appreciate its power.\" - The Sunday Times\n\nThe Advanced Crossword Solver is a combination of a powerful regular expression-style word matcher and a user-customisable database of nearly 300,000 words and phrases. \n\nIt is specifically designed to help with solving advanced thematic crosswords such as The Times’ Listener and The Sunday Telegraph’s Enigmatic Variations, but is also useful for word games such as Scrabble and Boggle, and indeed for any other word puzzles or games, for logic problems and as an aid to crossword setting.\n\nUnlike most crossword solving programs, this is far more than a simple pattern matcher for unknown letters. It can be used as a pattern matcher, and can solve simple anagrams, but in addition, some of its more powerful features include:\n\n• search for a combined pattern and anagram, when you know the answer is an anagram, and you also know where some of the letters are.\n• search with wildcards, when you know that an answer includes a particular letter or string of letters, but not where in the word they are.\n• solve partial anagrams, when you know that some of the letters of an answer are an anagram, but other letters are unknown. \n• solve subset anagrams, when you want to find the longest word you can make from a given set of letters.\n• search with multiple possibilities for letters, when you know a letter is one of a few possibilities, but not which one it is.\n• search with letter variables, when you know that several letters are the same, but not which letter it is.\n• search with vowel and consonant symbols, when you know that a letter is either a vowel or a consonant, but not which letter it is.\n• search for all the words which are one misprinted letter away from another word.\n• search for words which match a given pattern but which have one or more misprinted letters.\n• search for pairs of words (across and down) which cross at an unknown letter.\n\nUsing the simple input syntax, complex combinations of the above can be searched to quickly narrow down to a solution. Even the most complex search takes no more than a few seconds, and results are clearly presented in a scrollable list.\n\nTapping on a result from the solver shows a menu which allows the result to be looked up in a choice of iPhone dictionary and thesaurus applications, including Chambers and WordWeb, or online. This menu can be customised to add your own choice of applications and websites. (Note that in order to link to a dictionary, it must offer a URL that can be used by other apps - check with the publisher of your chosen dictionary that this is the case.)\n\nThe word list used by the Solver is a combination of  the UK Advanced Cryptics Dictionary (UKACD) and the Enhanced North American Benchmark LExicon (ENABLE). The UKACD is compiled by a crossword puzzle enthusiast from the words and phrases that are found in typical British advanced cryptic puzzles. ENABLE is an authoritative list of Scrabble words valid in both US and UK games. Between the two lists, the program searches a database of over 298,000 words and phrases.\n\nThe word list used by the solver is stored as plain text files, and the files can be accessed via iTunes to allow them to be customised to your own requirements - words can be added or removed, or the entire word list can be replaced if desired. In addition, the symbols used to denote the input syntax can also be changed, making the entire operation of the solver customisable to your own requirements.\n\nIf your taste in puzzles extends to the truly challenging, this is the application for you."

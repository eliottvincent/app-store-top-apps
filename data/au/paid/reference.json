Many species are represented with multiple call examples showing the full range of vocalizations.\n● The ability to compare any two images, maps, or sounds, side by side on the screen. The ability to filter by geographic location, so that you see only the species likely to occur in your location, and to further reduce the possibilities to usual or vagrant species in the selected area.\n● A “Smart Search” that gives the ability to search by distinguishing features such as size, colour, physical features, habitat and exclude certain types of birds (eg. Passerines).\n● A basic personal species list that stores your sightings saved to the device* (ability to upload list coming soon)\n● A comprehensive help and introduction section to help you if you get stuck or don’t understand how a certain feature works.\n\n*Uninstalling/reinstalling the program will result in the loss of your list, it is recommended that you keep your own backup (master list) separate from the application.\n\nWe invite all users to share their comments and ideas on our forum at www.mydigitalearth.com \n\nNB. This Application WILL ONLY work on an iPhone or iPod Touch running iOS V7.1 or higher NOT A NORMAL IPOD CLASSIC/NANO and the download is about 320MB."

A slide menu facilitates easy navigation between all modules.\n\nThe app can be used as a FIELD GUIDE (like the book) or as a BIRD LIST, with essential functions such as view bird page, distribution map or text, play the sound, add to your list, and view similar birds available directly in both.  \n\nThe FIELD GUIDE displays the full field guide (family) pages of the book. You can browse the pages, select from the family list, or search for a specific species in the bird list.  Selecting a bird links to the full functions toolbar.\n\nThe BIRD GUIDE includes a full bird list and links to individual BIRD PAGES for over 900 species, with illustrations, species text, colour-coded distribution maps, photographs and sounds.  Selecting a bird in the list opens the full functions toolbar.  Optional settings for the BIRD LIST include regional lists, bird names from either IOC or Birdlife, alphabetical or taxonomic sort order, and text and thumbnail size.\n\nSIMILAR BIRDS loads a list of birds for comparison and identification. \n\nCOMPARE BIRDS displays the bird pages side by side for direct comparison.\n\nIDENTIFICATION uses location, habitat, bird shapes and plumage to shortlist possible species for identification, or viewing with the Compare Birds function. \n\nMY LOCATION is an interactive map for generating bird lists and locating birding sites near you. You can use current location or drop a pin for a new location with GPS co-ords and bird list. Birding sites are displayed with links to a list and site description.\n\nMY LISTS is a personal list manager that includes a life list and sub-lists that report to your life list. Sighting details include place, date, GPS co-ords, and sighting notes.  You can sync your lists to iCloud for backup, and also sync to linked devices. New SIGHTINGS SUMMARY for a selected species displays a summary list of sightings or displays sightings on a map.\n\nBIRDING SITES includes descriptions and photos of over 270 birding sites from around Australia, with functions for a bird list and ‘show on map’.\n\nMY PHOTOS links your personal bird photos to your sightings and lists, displays thumbnails on the bird pages and links to a photo viewer.\n\nThe MULTIMEDIA DATA includes • over 250 field-guide pages • over 900 individual bird pages • all the ‘new’ bird species and names • over 2500 illustrations, 4000 photos, and 1500 bird sounds • colour-coded distribution maps • seasonal status bar • endemic and red data species • rare bird maps.\n\n# This app can be used in the bush and remote locations.

The App will then display rich information about the species scanned, including the name, distribution, a photo and interesting facts. The South West Nature Guide has been developed in partnership with DPAW.\n\nWhether you’re standing near a plant or a magnificent old tree, overlooking an expansive view, or looking out for wildlife, learning more about the natural world is easy with the South West NatureGuide helping you along the way \n\nThe App contains over 130 entries on local flora, fauna, history and geology. Tagged trails can be found at: \n\n- The Tree Top & Ancient Empire Walks – 17km east of Walpole\n- The Diamond Tree  - just south of Manjimup\n- The Gloucester Tree – near Pemberton\n- Hill Top - 5km east of Walpole\n- William Bay National Park – 10km west of Denmark\n- Horse Yard Hill - behind the Walpole Visitor Centre\n- The Dave Evans Bicentennial tree – In Beedelup National Park near Pemberton; and\n- King Jarrah – just outside the town of Manjimup\n\nThe number of tagged trails and entries is growing all the time. \n\nThe App contains maps of the trails that are currently tagged.  We recommend you download offline versions of some maps where mobile network coverage is poor. Having an offline version means that you will be able to see the map; and your location on it, even without mobile network coverage.\n\nTo download maps, select the Maps option and then Download Offline Maps. This will display a list of maps where there is poor network coverage. Downloading the maps takes a couple of minutes each. The App is currently 100MB of which 75MB are the maps."

Consequently, they play significant roles in the landscape, in the ecology of our land, in forestry, in apiculture and in horticulture.\n\nEUCLID provides complete descriptions of 934 species and subspecies of Angophora, Corymbia and Eucalyptus plus an interactive identification key using Lucid software. It covers all Australian States and Territories. Over twelve thousand images are used to assist interpretation of species features and the species themselves as well as their geographic distribution. \n\nThis innovative application makes identification a breeze. The process begins by choosing from simple characteristics of the eucalypt you are trying to identify. For example, answer questions such does it have rough or smooth bark, leaf shapes and flower types. If you’re not sure what to look at next the Lucid application can even recommend features to guide you through to the fastest identification possible. EUCLID is a treasure-trove of information. The application brings together beautifully illustrated features states to help visualise your choices as well as fact sheets and images of every species – all at your fingertips. \n\nThe App edition of EUCLID still functions without an internet connection, making it especially valuable for people working in the field."

The Shop Ethical! app has been downloaded thousands of times since 2010, and the Shop Ethical! book has sold over 135,000 copies since 2008.\n\nCompany ratings are based on information gathered from over 50 sources including the work of organisations such as Greenpeace, Choose Cruelty Free, WWF, Rank a Brand and Friends of the Earth.\n\nShop Ethical! is a collaboration between the Ethical Consumer Group and Outware Mobile. \n\nAS FEATURED ON CHANNEL 7 NEWS!  \n\nCUSTOMER TESTIMONIALS : \n  Best app I have, I use it daily and it's changed the way I see the world. \n Emma, VIC \n\n  Simply, \"Thank you.\" I am so grateful that you have done all the hard work, so that lazy/tired/child-distracted mothers like me can confidently tell their whining 8 year olds \"no, we are not buying that, because the people who will get our money hurt other people and/or animals\".  I have always wanted this information but have never had the spare energy to go and find it myself. You have done a brilliant job. Please let me know if you have a panel of testers or proof readers which requires more members, or any other way in which I can contribute to your efforts from home while Miss 8 sleeps. I have been forwarding your \"tell a friend\" message onto everyone I know who has an iPhone.  \nAnnie, Boronia, VIC   \n\nAWESOME app!! Thanks guys. I'm a naturopath that tries to educate my patients on the benefits of ethical shopping and living sustainably. Will definitely be recommending this app to my patients. Great work! \n Elise, Vic   \n\nThank you big time for this app!! It's so easy to use at the supermarket and clarifies so many of the issues surrounding products and companies, making the weekly shop fit better with my conscience. My kids are also able to look and see if their favourite things are positive or negative and can make their own ethical shopping decisions. Brilliant!!!  \nSara, Canberra\n\nThis app works on both iPhone and iPad. It is optimised for smartphones, not tablets."

Search for answers in HSVG, a massive & constantly growing database of equine health info – conveniently available to you “horse side.” \n\nHSVG was created by Doug Thal DVM DABVP, a lifelong horseman & veterinarian that has practiced exclusively equine veterinary medicine for over 20 years & is board certified in equine practice.  \n\nHSVG provides helpful information about equine health from the moment you notice a problem with your horse - My Observation.  It contains practical advice, suggested skills, and questions to discuss with your vet.\n\nHSVG is of value in an emergency and non-emergency, and it helps you distinguish between the two. HSVG also contains dozens of high quality instructional videos, and other media designed to enable you to become an active participant in ensuring your horse’s good health.  \n\nHowever, HSVG is not structured as a simple decision tree that takes you down a singular path based on your input. It is not a substitute for your local equine veterinarian. It does not, and cannot, anticipate and address all of the subtle variations and unique circumstances associated with your horse’s health. That is your veterinarian's job.\n__________________________\n\n- Make better decisions about your horse’s health.\n- Increase the quality of communication between you and your vet.\n- Follow a logical thought process for addressing any equine heath care problem.\n- Utilize a quality alternative to Dr. Google.\n\nOk – so what is Horse Side Vet Guide exactly? \n\nHSVG is a custom-built relational database of equine health information that contains concise information about common problems to rare diseases.  Records are contained in 1 of 9 categories:\n\n- My Observations\n- Vet Diagnostics\n- Vet Diagnoses\n- Vet Treatments\n- My Skills\n- My Supplies\n- Terms & Topics\n- Media\n- Outside Resources\n\nThese records are extensively interlinked, providing a uniquely contextualized approach to any equine health issue. \n\nWe continuously add and update the records in HSVG. We have placed great emphasis on completing the MY OBSERVATIONS records first. You can find \"full access\" records with a keyword search, in the alphabetical browse lists, and hyperlinked inside other records. Incomplete (or \"partial access\") records are listed inside full access records, with no hyperlink. Many other records are hidden from view, and will be available later. After we complete a partial or hidden record we change it to \"full access\" and it becomes immediately available to you after the app has been synchronized to your mobile device. \n\nPlease see our website www.horsesidevetguide.com for more information about this application."

      "label": "Accurately Grade and Measure Stamp Perforations\n\nThe Stamp Analyser digitally measures the stamp perforations, the stamp frame and the balance among the four margins to determine the centering grade of the stamp. It also allows you to measure the distance between any two points on a scanned or photographed image. The Stamp Analyser provides this information based on accurate measurement; no more guesswork. All you need to do is to provide a good scan or a good photograph of the stamp and the Stamp Analyser does the rest.\n\nOptionally, you can add the stamp Soundness and Eye Appeal components to obtain the final grade. The Soundness and Eye Appeal components are based on the PSE Grading Guide.\n\nThe Stamp Analyser user interface has been designed to be intuitive and simple. On the Mac, you simply drag and drop your stamp image into the Stamp Analyser. On the iPad and iPhone, you can either take a photo of the stamp or select it from the photo library.\n\nIOS 11 or higher required.\n\nMore detail on Rakium.com"

      "label": "The IAP Bushings & Tubes app provides a searchable and sortable interface to over 4000 pen kits from most of the major kit suppliers. The app displays detailed tube and bushing specifications and drill bit requirements for every kit in the app database. These kit details can be emailed or printed via Air Print. You can create a favorites list of your most frequently used kits for faster access to those kits rather than searching through the entire app database every time you need to reference those kits. You can also reorder the database by your preferred supplier order.\n\nThe app also includes a drill bit converter for converting between inch fractional, inch decimal, metric and gauge drill sizes. Conversions to inch fractional are made to the nearest 1/64\" and conversions to gauge drill size are made to the nearest gauge drill size (107-1 and A-Z). An error factor is displayed for inexact conversions to inch fractional and gauge drill size.\n\nA 30-digit, 4-function calculator is included in the app. It has several advanced features not found in many simple calculators including a memory cell and the ability to display data in decimal or scientific notation.\n\nPhotos, Instructions and Bushing Drawings are available for most of the kits. When instructions or bushings are available, they may be viewed, mailed or printed.\n\nThe app also contains several lists of useful references: Worldwide Suppliers of pen kits with links to take you directly to their web site; Helpful Penturning videos with links that will take you directly to the video; and Penturning Tutorials with links that will download the tutorial to your device for viewing in the app or to email or print.\n\nThe app will automatically download database updates and the kit reference files from the IAP server."

      "label": "In The Birds of Brazil all species of birds regularly found in Brazil (>1,700) are described, and their approximate size given in inches and tenths of inches.\n\nA brief account of each family is given in the list of families. The range of each species is described in detail (instead of range maps). In addition to the birds‘ geographical ranges, the altitudinal zones which they inhabit are given. The zones and their limits are:\n\n• Tropical Zone:\n  sea level to 4500–5000 ft (1,400 to 1,500 m)\n  \n• Subtropical Zone:\n  4500–5000 to 7500–8500 ft (1,400–1,500 m to 2,300–2,600 m)\n  \n• Temperate Zone:\n  7500–8500 to 9500–11,500 ft (2,300–2,600 m to 2,900–3,500 m)\n  \n• Páramo or Puna Zone:\n  9500–11,500 ft (2,900–3,500 m) to snow line \n\nThe current app version contains the descriptions and images of 1,700+ bird species found in Brazil. Moreover, an ornithological dictionary (English, French, Spanish, Portuguese) and detailed illustrations and drawings of bird anatomy are included.\n\nThe app features a modern, intuitive graphical user interface with functions for searching the birds‘ names and in the full text, switching the sorting language for the listings and sort by English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, or the scientific (Latin) notation. In addition to the bird descriptions, the name of the birds in many languages can be displayed.\n\nAnother clever feature is the Field Note Editor, which allows you to record your bird sightings with predefined locations settings (which can be overwritten by the user) and many other commonly recorded data items.\n\nApart from using the optional backup and restore functions for Field Notes and Favorites, the app runs completely offline and there is no need for an internet connection during usage in the field.\n\nAs with The Birds of South America, which contains more than 3,000 birds found on the entire continent, also The Birds of Brazil runs on any iOS device and can exchange Field Notes and Favorites list between identical app versions on two or more devices via Bluetooth."

      "label": "Australian Snake ID by Hal Cogger\n\nAustralia boasts a rich snake fauna of about 180 species of land snakes, with a further 36 species of venomous sea snakes in its surrounding oceans. Identifying a snake that has been observed in the wild before disappearing into the bush [or ocean], and so cannot be examined close-up, is fraught with difficulties. Some groups of snakes, such as the seven (7) different kinds of death adders that occur throughout continental Australia, share a distinctive shape and form of tail, and are instantly recognisable. The 47 worm-like blind snakes (Family Typhlopidae), with their unformed eyes and nearly always a distinctive blunt spiny tip to their tails, are also instantly recognisable as a group, but immensely difficult to identify to species without the aid of a microscope.\n\nTo a specialist familiar with them, subtle differences in body form (i.e. slender or heavy build, narrow neck, broad head) will often allow the recognition of a snake species at a glance, or the colour or pattern alone may be quite distinctive and diagnostic. But to accurately identify the majority of Australia's snakes requires checking finer details of body features - the number of scales around the middle of the body or along the belly and tail, or the configuration of the scales on the head, or the nature of the individual scales - characteristics that can only be observed if the snake is in hand. Consequently the ease and accuracy of identifying an Australian snake depends on being able to closely examine the finer details of its physical characteristics.\n\nWhere up-close examination of a snake is not feasible, this guide asks for some basic information (approximate size, dominant colour(s), location, etc) and presents the user with a series of photographs of species likely to be encountered at the location where the observation was made, and that can roughly match the few characters observed. The user is then invited to work through the gallery of potential species to find the one (or more) that most closely resembles the snake observed. Information about other features of these species (their habits and habitats) can then be used in an attempt to eliminate as many species as possible from the list of 'possibles'.\n\nIf the snake to be identified has been killed or captured, its identity can be established with a much higher level of accuracy and certainty. This will usually involve first becoming familiar with the characters most often used in snake identification, by following the diagrams and examples provided - a task that becomes much easier with practice and familiarity. But whenever you end up with two or more \"possibles\" at the end of an identification session, then do as suggested in the absence of a specimen - work through the gallery of remaining \"possibles\" to find the one that most closely resembles the snake in hand.\n\nToday an increasing number of species - of snakes and other animals - are being identified on genetic grounds by comparing the DNA of specimens from a range of localities. Sometimes, species identified by this method may be physically similar to, or externally indistinguishable from, related species, making their identification in the field either ambiguous or impossible. However, if their geographic ranges don't overlap then location itself may be a diagnostic distinguishing feature. It is for this reason that regional location is a critical early character used in this app.\n\nAuthorship: Dr. Hal Cogger\n\nThis app was created using Lucid Builder v3.6 and Fact Sheet Fusion v2.

Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

      "label": "The release of Australian Tropical Rainforest Plants Edition 8 (RFK 8) represents another significant milestone in the development of this information system for identifying and learning about plants in Australian tropical rainforests. Each edition of the system since 1971 has made significant advances in the coverage of plant groups, the numbers of species included, the effectiveness of the identification system, and in the utilisation of current technology. As always, the aim of this new edition is to enable as many people as possible to simply and accurately identify and learn about plants in Australia’s tropical rainforests.\n\nWhat is new?\n\nThe main goal for Edition 8 of Australian Tropical Rainforest Plants was to move to a mobile application platform that is available both online and downloadable to electronic devices. The coverage of the key includes the rainforests of the whole of the Australian tropics. A second goal was to continue adding taxa from regions already covered that had not been included in previous editions primarily due to lack of specimens for coding, and to update the nomenclature and distribution information for all taxa as required.\n\nAustralian Tropical Rainforest Plants Edition 8 includes 2762 taxa in 176 families and 48 new name changes. All flowering plant species are included - trees, shrubs, vines, forbs, grasses and sedges, epiphytes, palms and pandans – except most orchids which are treated in a separate key (see below), and a few other species for which specimens suitable for coding features are lacking.\n\nAll rainforest orchids are included in a dedicated orchid module (Australian Tropical Rainforest Orchids) now also delivered online. The need for a separate module was due to the unique morphology of the Orchidaceae family and the distinct set of features required for effective identification to species level. Nine species of orchid have been included within RFK8, mainly terrestrial species that reach more than one metre in height, or climbers.\n\nSimilarly, the ferns are currently under development as a separate module, Ferns of Northern Australia. Again, the unique morphology, terminology and features required for effective identification of ferns have dictated that a stand-alone module be developed.\n\nThe number of images in the key continues to increase, now numbering over 14,000. Most of images were gathered by CSIRO staff as part of this long-running research project. Significant numbers of new images have been provided by various photographers listed in the Acknowledgements section, most notably Garry Sankowsky, Steve Pearson, John Dowe and Russell Barrett. All donors of images for this project are gratefully acknowledged."

God is a God of order as evidenced in His works of creation and redemption. Consequently, order belongs to the essence of His church. Order is achieved through principles and regulations that guide the Church in its internal operations and in fulfillmenting its mission to the world. In order for it to be a successful ecclesiastical organization at the service of the Lord and humanity, it needs order, rule, and discipline. Scripture affirms that “all things be done decently and in order” (1 Cor. 14:40)."

      "label": "The Wattle - Acacias of Australia app (WATTLE ver. 3) enables users to identify wattle plants that occur anywhere in Australia or elsewhere in the world where they are grown. It includes 1,057 formally described species of Acacia, plus several hybrids and informal taxa of this genus. It also includes two species of Acaciella, four species of Senegalia and nine species of Vachellia that occur in Australia and which were previously included in Acacia.\n\nWATTLE ver. 3 builds upon two previous versions of WATTLE, namely, the original version that was published in 2001 on CD and version 2 that was published in 2014 on the Lucidcentral website. Compared with earlier versions, which are no longer available, WATTLE ver. 3 contains more species, updated coding and new or updated descriptions for each taxon, together with photographs and improved distribution maps.\n\nAt the heart of WATTLE is a powerful Lucid identification key which helps people of all ages to quickly and accurately identify species. The key is a truly random access tool, one that allows users to enter, in any order, the characteristics of a specimen that they wish to identify. The key then lists those species possessing the characteristics nominated, rejecting those that do not match the criteria entered. By progressively providing additional characteristics about the unknown specimen, users can narrow the search, eventually ending up with just one or a few species.\n\nThe key provides context-relevant information (text and images) that assist users to correctly interpret the characteristics of the plant they are attempting to identify. For those who want information about the species that has been identified, WATTLE ver. 3 provides fact sheets containing illustrations, detailed descriptions, photographs and maps that can be accessed directly. Hyperlinks provide simple navigation between fact sheets of related or similar species.\n\nWATTLE ver. 3 is jointly published by the Australian Biological Resources Study (ABRS), Canberra, The Western Australian Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (formerly CALM) and Identic Pty Ltd, Queensland. WATTLE complements the Flora of Australia (www.ausflora.org.au)."

It is a valuable resource for all those concerned about environmental weeds: weed and biodiversity researchers, trainers, advisors, weed control officers, environmental community groups, weed management practitioners, and anyone with an interest in environmental weeds.\n\nWhile Australian focused, this key provides an excellent resource to users in other countries. Both plain English and botanical terms (usually in brackets) are used throughout the App to make it applicable to as wide an audience as possible. \n\nAt the core of this App is an interactive Lucid identification key to 1020 plant species that are either significant or emerging environmental weeds in Australia. To help confirm the identification of weed species the app  provides over 10,000 photos and a wealth of information on each weed species and how to distinguish between very similar species. In many cases,  links are provided to websites that have relevant information about the management of specific weed species."

It is perhaps the most widely used and admired book for use in rehearsals today – and is now available on your iPhone or iPad to help you find exactly the right action word within seconds.\n\nActors need actions. You cannot act moods. You need to be doing something with every line. You need an aim to achieve, and an action selected to help achieve that aim. ‘Actions’ are active verbs. In order to play a line truthfully, you need to discover the action that suits that particular situation and that particular line. That is where this app comes in…\n\nIt is a fully searchable, easy-to-navigate thesaurus of active verbs, that will help you refine your acting choice until you find the action you require to make each line come alive.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n·  A to Z search, and predictive search function\n·  Emotional groupings to help you pinpoint the action you require\n·  Bookmark, note-making and random word functions\n·  Share your actions on social media or by email\n·  Full instructions on how to use actioning in rehearsal, plus how to use the app\n\nFor actors at all levels and of all ages, Actions: The Actors’ Thesaurus will revolutionise how you rehearse. Once you’ve started using it, you’ll wonder how you ever managed without it.\n\n‘If you want to act, or act better, Actions will take you a long way on the journey to excellence’ Terry Johnson\n\n'Actioning ain't easy – but it's so useful' Zawe Ashton\n\nBased on the bestselling book Actions: The Actors’ Thesaurus by Marina Caldarone and Maggie Lloyd-Williams"

The number and scope of the videos and content will continue to increase.\n\nR Instructor will teach you how to use R, how to make and modify plots and run statistical tests. Each example includes a very brief (and easy to understand!) description of the function or test, any statistical assumptions, how to structure your data in R, the R scripts (code) and, links to other free and online resources.  Where appropriate, the Mac, Windows and RStudio versions of the R interface are explained separately.\n\nR Instructor also allows you to run RStudio through the web from your iPad or iPhone (Note: This is a public server that requires an internet connection -- do not expect to accomplish serious computing)\n\nIn addition, R Instructor comes complete with 10 Quick Reference guides and the \"Which Test?\" feature. The \"Which Test?\" feature guides you to the correct statistical test after you answer questions related to your data.\n\n\nSee a demonstration of R Instructor at, www.Rinstructor.com\n\nUse R Instructor to...\n\nRun a public web server implementation of RStudio (do not expect serious computing power -- this server is for testing and debugging scripts)\n\n\nLearn R's fundamentals:\n- R's interface\n- Create objects\n- Install libraries\\packages\n- Import and export data and plots\n- Merge data frames\n- Exclude redundant data between datasets\n- Import dates\n- Create custom functions\n- Summarize data frames and matrices\n- Perform calculations\n- and more...\n\nLearn how to make and customize plots:\n- qplots from ggplot2\n- Box plots\n- Bar plots\n- Histograms\n- Line charts\n- Scatter plots and scatter plot matrices\n- Add and customize legends\n- Add custom axis labels\n- Modify the size, shape and colour of point markers\n- Add axis titles\n- Add lines, text or points to an existing plot\n- Add colour to the plot background, border lines… and just about anything else!\n\n\nLearn these (and more) statistical tests:\n- One-sample t-test\n- Two-sample t-test\n- Paired t-test\n- Correlation\n- Rank correlation\n- Linear regression\n- Multiple regression\n- Logistic regression\n- Log-linear models\n- F-test\n- One-way ANOVA\n- Two-way ANOVA\n- One-way repeated measures ANOVA \n- Two-way repeated measures ANOVA  \n- Regression and Classification trees\n- ANCOVA\n- MANOVA\n- Principal Components Analysis\n- Linear discriminant function analysis\n- Redundancy analysis\n- Friedman test\n- Wilcoxon signed rank test\n- Kruskal-Wallis test\n- Chi-square test of independence\n- Binomial test\n- Hierarchical clustering\n- and more…\n\nPlus,\n- Over 35 videos (that's over two hours)\n- 10 Quick Reference Guides\n- The \"Which test?\" feature – An assistant to guide you to the appropriate statistical test"

In this way the Strong's Concordance provides an independent check against translations, and offers an opportunity for greater, and more technically accurate understanding of the Bible text.\n\nWant to see it in action before you buy? Try Strong's Concordance Lite which provides a 100% functional demo of Matthew and Genesis.\n\nThis program does not require internet access, everything you need is all stored on the iDevice.\n\nFeatures:\n* Search for English words, and lookup Greek/Hebrew dictionaries.\n* Proper concordance, listing how the word was translated in other bible verses.\n* Full King James Text is included\n* Click on any blue word for concordance text.\n* Night mode for those that like to read at night (White on black)\n* iPad support\n\nPlease note: This version is not an \"exhaustive\" concordance, and does skip smaller words such as \"and, or, the, a\" as well as some other words. Though we think you'll find it has most (if not all) the words you'll ever need.\n\nWe're open to suggestions for improvement in future versions. Send comments and suggestions to strongs at orionsys.org."

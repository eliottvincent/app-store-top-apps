      "label": "The Bicycle Maintenance Guide differs to other repair apps on the AppStore because it is one of the only apps to be packed with quality video content. Most other apps just content text and images.\n\nThe Bicycle Maintenance Guide app is unique and differs to other content found online, such as YouTube and Parktool, because the majority of the apps content can be found and accessed with no internet connection. This means you can use the app to help repair your bike even when you're out in the sticks with no internet connection, to get you home or to your local bike shop. \n\nThe app is the most expansive bicycle repair guide in the App Store with over 100 sections, 60 professionally filmed videos containing over 7.5 hours of footage, 180+ high resolution images and over 50,000 words. \n\nThe Bicycle Maintenance Guide app is a complete guide to bicycle repairs, shown and instructed by two world class bike mechanics - Mike Rawson and Chuck Buckley.\nMike is a Senior Service Technician at a top end bicycle company and was a Team GB Mechanic for 7 years, where he covered the Olympic Games, World Championships and European Cycling Tours.\nChuck was a Head Mechanic of a UK professional cycling team for a long period before returning to NZ where he now owns and runs a bike shop.\n\nThe app is broken up into 5 areas, these are:-\n\nREPAIRS\n• Exclusive access to our private YouTube channel featuring 60 professionally shot HD video tutorials. These videos are not available on-line without this app.\n• Each video tutorial is backed up with a list of tools required and fully presented step by step instructions with hi-resolution photographs.\n• Comprehensive written tutorials backed up with high quality imagery to illustrate how to perform your own repairs\n\nAT THE ROADSIDE\n• An additional 8 video tutorials which can be viewed in an emergency whilst out riding.\n• A unique feature with ‘get out of jail’ tricks that will get the rider home after a major breakdown at the roadside. One video shows how to use a £5 note to repair a torn tyre.\n• Each of these videos also backed up with a list of tools required and fully presented step by step instructions with hi-resolution photographs.\n\nCOMPONENTS\n• Annotated and clearly labelled hi-resolution photographs of each component on a bicycle. By fully explaining what each part does, the user will have a fuller understanding of the components, giving them the confidence to adjust and maintain that part.\n\nFAULT DIAGNOSTICS\n• Easy to follow steps to help diagnose and remedy those common problems with your bicycle.\n\nSERVICING\n• Exclusive servicing guide written by Chuck Buckley encompassing weekly, monthly and annual servicing of your bicycle.\n\nOTHER FEATURES\n• Links to our social media pages and website.\n• Link to email us with any questions or offer your feedback. We are always looking at ways to improve.\n• Simply and fully explained instructions in plain English for both casual and serious riders alike.\n\nNB.

By freedivers, for freedivers, our freedive apnea trainer helps you with static apnea tables and lung capacity training so you can effectively increase the time when diving underwater.\r\nSee why STAmina Apnea Trainer is one of the best apnea apps to improve the breath-holding time for freediving, scuba diving and spearfishing, as well as surfing, running, and other water sports with 6 different apnea tables types.\n\n\r\n■ FREEDIVING & SPEARFISHING APNEA TRAINER FEATURES:\n\n\r\n◉ 6 APNEA TABLE OPTIONS \r\nSTAmina Apnea Trainer can create / generate custom apnea (exercises that are automatically created based on the maximum breath-hold and match the user’s level) or let you select from the following customizable table types:\r\n\r\n- O2 deprivation table – accustoms a body to lower oxygen levels. This is achieved by increasing the amount of time that you hold your breath on each attempt, while the resting time is fixed.\r\n\r\n- CO2 Tolerance table – helps a body to adapt to high carbon dioxide levels. This is achieved by decreasing the length of resting time between fixed breath-hold periods.\r\n\r\n- Wonka table – a variation of CO2 tables. Apnea timer starts after the first contraction, the rest time takes one breath.\r\n\r\n- Mix table – tables where apnea time increases and rest time decreases with each round.\r\n\r\n- Custom table – allows mixing of different approaches to create a custom training, thus generating the most effective training program.\r\n\r\n- Pranayama – a breathing technique to decrease stress in the body and relax the nervous system.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ APPLE HEALTH SYNCRONIZATION \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED TRAINING WITH VARYING DIFFICULTY\r\nWhen you start working with the application, you set your personal record in breath holding. Based on this data, the app will offer a personalized training program with exercises of 3 difficulty levels to choose from: easy, normal, and hard.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED EXERCISE SETTINGS \r\nEach exercise can be edited by setting your own number of repetitions, breath hold time, rest time, etc.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ TRAINING REMINDERS \r\nGet the notification to start your apnea training. Set a reminder in the apnea diver app for the day and the time & get a notification to do a breath holding training session.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONAL STATISTICS AND DETAILED TRAINING HISTORY\r\nAll your workouts and exercises are recorded in the freedive trainer app to track the detailed progress of each training.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ VOICE GUIDANCE\r\nTraining may be accompanied by voice guidance with male/female voices recorded by professional voice actors. STAmina supports English, French, Russian voice guidance.\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n◉ HEART RATE AND OXYGEN SATURATION TRACKING\r\nTrack your heart rate while doing breath holding exercises (a compatible HR monitor or pulse-oximeter is required) \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CONTRACTIONS TRACKING \r\nUse our freedive trainer to track unlimited contractions, analyse captured data after exercises\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CLOUD SYNC / BACKUP\r\nAccess your data on multiple devices and easily restore it in case you switch devices/phones.\n\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\nStamina Apnea Trainer allows training breath hold effectively for anyone who cares about all kinds of diving including:\r\n> beginner or professional freedivers;\r\nspearfishers;\r\n> scuba divers to learn how to dive longer on one tank;\r\n> surfers in case of unexpected breath hold;\r\n> underwater sports athletes such as underwater rugby, hockey, etc.\r\n> runners who want to train breath holding & high tolerance to CO2 while running\r\n\r\n_______\r\nInfo https://getstamina.app/\r\nContact https://www.facebook.com/staminamobile/\r\nSupport hello@squarecrowdapps.com"

      "label": "Flyskyhy forms your flight instrument during flight and shows all information you need for that. You get the normal data like altitude, climb rate, ground speed, and glide angle. But it also calculates and shows the current wind direction and strength, very important for your safety.\n\nA moving and rotating map shows your current flying position and flight trail. It indicates where you have gone up (in a thermal), and where you have had faster than normal decline. With that, you can easily find back that thermal that you lost. The map also shows the nearest known landing spots, and whether they are reachable by normal glide, given your current altitude and wind direction.\n\nIntegration with Bluetooth varios SensBox, FlyNet, GoFly iPico, XC-Tracer, BlueFlyVario, or SkyDrop gives accurate altitude and lift information. That turns your iPhone into an full-fletched GPS-vario, including vario tones.\n\nThe app makes a full log of your flight, that can be analyzed afterwards. Besides normal data like start and landing positions, duration of flight, and an altitude graph of the flight, Flyskyhy also calculates the scoring distances for you. So you can immediately see whether you have broken that FAI triangle record.\n\nYour live location is reported on livetrack24.com or loctome.com if you desire, so anybody can follow your flight while it is happening. If you are flying together with friends, then their location is shown on your map during your flight. So you never have to wonder anymore whether they are in front of or behind you.\n\nThe flight display has multiple screens which are all fully configurable. You can move all elements to other spots, delete and add elements, and resize them.\n\nThrough in-app purchases, the app also supports airspaces and waypoints.\n\nThe app is optimised for paragliding and hang gliders, but can be used with all  kinds of airsports.\n\nMain features during the flight;\n• Altitude, climb rate, ground speed, air speed, direction, glide angle and many more\n• Wind strength and direction\n• Moving map of the flying area\n• Spots where you have had lift, great for thermal coring\n• Shows whether you can still reach a landing spot with the current altitude and wind\n• Live tracking of your flight on livetrack24.com or loctome.com\n• Shows live location of your friends during flight\n\nAfter the flight:\n• Full logbook of all your flights\n• Basic flight data like start/landing, duration, height difference, distance flown, and many more\n• Calculation of 5-points, open triangle, and FAI triangle distances\n• Graph of altitude and climb rate\n• Signed IGC and KML log files of flights\n• Transfer the log to iTunes or send by email\n• Upload the flight directly to XContest, ParaglidingForum, DHV-XC, and other Leonardo servers\n• Open flight in Google Earth on the iPhone\n• Replay the flight and relive it!\n\nBy purchasing the Waypoints Extension you get access to:\n• A fully zoomable and scrollable map with the waypoints and optimised route. The map also shows start and landing spots, as well as restricted airspaces (with the Airspace Extension)\n• Enter new waypoints, either on the map or by specifying the parameters\n• Full route support with start time, goal, entry/exit points, etc. \n• Many instruments to guide you along the route\n• Visible and audible indication when a waypoint has been reached\n• Complete waypoints organiser\n• Import and export of various waypoint file formats\n\nBy purchasing the Airspace Extension you get access to:\n• Airspaces of 30 countries\n• Display of airspaces on the map with configurable colors and formats\n• Display of your vertical position w.r.t. airspaces\n• Visible and audible warnings when approaching and entering an airspace\n• Shows local airspaces by touching a spot on the map\n\nNote: a live internet connection is required for live tracking of your and your friends locations\nNote: continuous GPS and screen usage makes the battery drain faster than normal"

Wouldn’t it be great to be able to dive deeply with one big breath and take incredible pictures for your friends at home? The Apnea Trainer makes it possible! By using it to train three times a week, you can quickly double your underwater time.\n\nThis is the same training principle used by apnea divers. It’s based on a yoga technique which strengthens the diaphragm muscles allowing you to fill your lungs with more oxygen and releasing more carbon dioxide while exhaling. The system is relatively simple and depends on finding the right time intervals which are provided by the program, thus letting you relax and concentrate on your breathing. This will guarantee maximum training success.\nThe program will also come in handy just before the actual dive since a pranayama mode is already included. The Apnea Trainer will help you keep your whole body calm and give you the perfect preparation for those amazing, long-lasting dives. \n\n\nFeatures:\n+ Training to improve free diving time\n\n+ Pranayama mode to calm your body before diving or snorkeling\n\n+ Custom time settings for pro divers\n\n+ Optical and Audio instructions\n\n+ Easy to use interface\n\nUpdated user interface with the help of Bjoern Maser by www.minimalist.ch."

Internal barometer is used on supported devices for better precision. Application can run without GPS, WiFi and internet, in this case the user has to enter weather data manually.\n\n• For each carburetor configuration, the following values are given: high speed screw position, low speed screw position, pop-off pressure, optimal exhaust length, spark plug, optimal exhaust temperature (EGT)\n• Fine tuning for high and low speed screws\n• History of all your carburetor configs\n• Graphic display of fuel mix quality (Air/Flow Ratio or Lambda)\n• Selectable fuel type (gasoline with or without ethanol, Racing fuels available, for example: VP C12, VP 110, VP MRX02, Sunoco)\n• Adjustable fuel/oil ratio\n• Mix wizard to get the perfect mix ratio (fuel calculator)\n• Carburetor ice warning\n• Possibility of use automatic weather data or a portable weather station\n• If you don't want to share your location, you can manually select any place in the world, the carburetor config will be adapted for this place\n• let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, meter and feet for altitude, liters, ml, gallons, oz for fuel, and mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg atm for pressures\n\nThe application contains four tabs, which are described next:\n\n• Results: In this tab high speed screw position, low speed screw position, pop-off pressure, optimal exhaust length, spark plug, optimal exhaust temperature (EGT) are shown. These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine configuration given in the next tabs. This tab lets do a fine tuning adjustment for all this values to adapt to the concrete engine. Also the air density, density altitude, relative air density, SAE - dyno correction factor, station pressure, SAE- relative horsepower, volumetric content of oxygen, oxygen pressure are shown too. On this tab, you can also share your settings with your colleagues. You can also see in a graphic form the calculated ratio of air and fuel (lambda).\n• History: This tab contains the history of all carburetor configs. This tab also contains your favorite carburetor configs.\n• Engine: You can configure in this screen the information about the engine, that is, engine model, type of restrictor, model of carburetor, spark manufacturer, fuel type, oil mix ratio\n• Weather: In this tab, you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. Also this tab allows to use the GPS to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service (you can choose one weather data source from several possible) to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity). In addition, this application can work with a pressure sensor built into the iPhone. You can see if it is available on your device and turn it on or off. Also, on this tab, you can enable alerts about possible carburetor icing.\n\nIf you have any doubt about using this App, please, contact us. We answer every question, and we take care of all comments from our users to try to improve our software. We are also users of this application."

Simple and straightforward to use, the app uses the sound generated by tapping the strings to calculate the tension with high accuracy. In addition, the interactive swingweight calculator aids in customizing your racquet to fit your own stroke pattern, while the stiffness calculator allows you to simulate different racquet configurations. \n\nRacquetTune not only makes it easier to decide when it is time to restring, it is also an invaluable tool when testing different racquets and strings and in identifying which of your racquets is best suited for different types of games. RacquetTune also allows you to check whether your stringer is consistent in his work. \nRacquetTune includes the following user-friendly tools:\n\nTension measurement \n- Quickly determines the tension and stringbed stiffness. \n- Able to detect changes in tension as small as 0.1 kg/0.2 lb.\n- An accuracy indicator ensures results are consistent. \n- Graphical presentation of sound waves helps you find the ideal way of tapping the strings. \n- Settings can be customized to serve tennis, squash, racquetball and badminton racquets, respectively. \n- View the tension history for each racquet as a list or a graph.\n- Email a spreadsheet with test data.\n\nSwingweight calculator \n- Add as many weights as you wish to the frame. \n- Move and change weights to visualize how swingweight, balance and sweet spot location are affected.\n- Enter target values for the racquet and let RacquetTune distribute the weights automatically.\n\nStiffness calculator \n- Simulate various racquet and string configurations\n- Vary tension, string type and racquet head size. \n- Shows load-displacement curves, stiffness and elastic energies \n- Handles the large deformations encountered in actual play \n\nView a demo video at racquettune.com\n\nRacquetTune has been featured in tennis magazines in USA, Italy, France, Germany, Sweden and Norway. \n\n\"The app is very, very impressive. I get more tension diagnostic questions than just about anybody in the universe, so this is a very good thing to be able to recommend.\" \nJonathan Wolfe \nUS Racquet Stringers Association\n\nNote, that the actual string tension in the racquet and the setting seen on a stringing machine are two different things and therefore incomparable - more information can be found at racquettune.com."

Validation published on the Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research and Journal of Sports Sciences*****\n***Featured by Apple under ‘Best New Apps’ in 100+ countries***\n***The only app which calculates the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method***\n \nMy Jump 2 is the first app scientifically developed to measure your jump height. With a great design and validated by sport scientists, My Jump 2 is as reliable as a 10000$ force platform. Scientifically probed!\n\n------------------------------\n \nPierre Samozino (PhD, sport scientist, University of Savoy): “My Jump 2 makes possible the determination of the jump height with a high accuracy, which has been validated in very recent scientific study. The other, and I think the main added value of this app is to propose the determination of the Force-Velocity-Power profile of each athlete and its own imbalance between force and velocity qualities. Very useful to optimize your strength training and improve your explosive performances.”\n\nJean-Benoit Morin (PhD, sport scientist, University of Nice): “My Jump 2 is the cutting edge, scientifically validated and most practical application to measure athletes vertical jumping performance, and the only one to include the complete \"Optimal Force-Velocity Profile\" analysis we recently validated. I'm using it with athletes, students, and research subjects. The entire Jumping Force-Velocity-Power and Optimal F-V Profile approach in your pocket!”\n \n------------------------------\n \nMy Jump 2 gives you advanced information of your jumps using the camera on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. Just record a jump, select accurately its take off and landing and lets My Jump do its magic. My Jump 2 calculates the height, flight time, velocity, force and power of your vertical jumps. Also, it gives you the contact time, vertical stiffness and reactive strength index (RSI) of your Drop Jumps. Moreover, it allows you to calculate your Force-Velocity profile using Samozino's method. Complete analysis of your jumps right on your hand!\n \nFEATURES:\n \n• Accurate measurement of your vertical jumps. Scientifically demonstrated!\n• Calculate the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method. You can know your maximal theoretical force, velocity, power and how far you are from your optimal capabilities! You can even get information about which quality (force or velocity) you should work to increase your explosive performance.\n• Record stunnig slowmo videos up to 240fps or import as much as you like from your camera roll.\n• Different jump types: countermovement jump (CMJ), squat jump (SJ), drop jump (DJ), CMJ free arms, horizontal jumps and repeated jump test!\n• Annotate the external load used (CMJ & SJ) or the height of the box (DJ) to organize your best performances in different categories.\n• Multi-user. My Jump 2 allows you to create as many users as you want. Monitor all your team on your iDevice!\n• iCloud sync (iOS 13+)\n• History. Record as many jumps as you want for each user created. With My Jump 2 you can analyze the evolution of your performance during time. You can even observe exactly how much you have improved!\n• Export your data to Excel, Numbers, Google Drive and more!\n• Beautiful, intuitive like design.\n• Universal app: purchase once and install it on your iPhone, iPad and Mac (10.15+)\n \nNote: My Jump 2 works better with slow-motion videos.\n \nMY JUMP 2, A JUMP PLATFORM RIGHT ON YOUR HAND!"

A great hands-free way to use SkyDroid.\n\n• Book discounted tee times directly through SkyDroid.\n\nNo other fees are involved, and you can download as many courses you want without any other charges. \n\nWith SkyDroid – Golf GPS, our simple-to-use design will have you spending your time on your golf game, not on clicking buttons. \n\nView all our courses at www.skydroid.net/courses.php\n\nView our FAQ at www.skydroid.net/faq.php\n\n\nUSAGE NOTES:\n\n• SEARCHING for Courses: When searching for courses by name, you can just search for \"Aug\" instead of \"Augusta National Golf Course\" (leave out the quote marks).\n\n• SEARCHING for Courses: Radar button will find Mapped courses within 25mi/40km of your current location.\n\n• To save battery power, click your power button to turn off the screen when not in use.\n\n• Set your GPS Keep Alive in the SkyDroid settings to control how long GPS stays active when SkyDroid is in the background. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n• GPS accuracy can vary over time (click the GPS signal strength icon at any time to see your accuracy).\n\n• Before playing a course preview its mapping by clicking the link for the course name at www.skydroid.net/courses.php (best done using a large screen). Let us know of any mapping issues, or make changes yourself.\n\n• If we don’t have your course, you can add it as long as there is a satellite image of the course available in Course Mapper.\n\n• Change distance measurement (yards/meters) in the app Settings available on the in-app Menu.\n\n• While playing golf you will only incur data usage while using the Satellite View screen. Course downloads can be done at home over Wi-Fi and are small in size.\n\nEnjoy your round!!"

      "label": "Pickleball Score Keeper is the first Pickleball app designed for Apple Watch. It turns your Apple Watch into a simple and easy-to-use score tracking device. All matches are stored on your iPhone and key statistics give you insights on how to improve your game.\n- Keep track of all your matches (with or without an Apple Watch)\n- Singles and doubles match modes\n- Identify teammates and opponents\n- Track your unforced errors\n- Service statistics\n- Player database to keep notes on opponent strengths and weaknesses\n- Follow live matches point by point\n- Integrates with Health app (steps taken, running distance, maximum heart rate, calories burned) to help you gain insight into your Pickleball workouts as well as to monitor how hard your opponents make you work\n\n---\nHow to use the Watch app:\nIt is so simple. Just start the app from your Apple Watch.\n- Select game setup (i.e.: Doubles, Game to 11, Win by 2)\n- Swipe towards you when you win a rally.\n- Swipe away from you when you lose a rally.\n- Swipe right to record an unforced error.\n- Swipe left to undo.\n- Press down on the watch face to end session or restart a game.\n\nTIP! Swipe from the middle of the watch, not the edge.\n\nScores are spoken aloud and gentle vibrations allow you to continue play without looking at your watch.\nPlayer positions and current server are shown on the watch face in case you lose track.\n\nIMPORTANT:\nThe watch is by default set to wake on wrist raise. If Pickleball Score Keeper does not open on Wrist Raise gesture during a match, please do the following from the watch home screen:\n1. Tap Settings > tap General > tap Wake Screen \n2. Make sure that \"Wake Screen on Wrist Raise\" is turned on. \n3. Scroll down to \"Resume to: Previous Activity\" and checkmark.\n\nPlease don’t be shy to use the Feedback button on the Pickleball Score Keeper iPhone app to contact us with ideas and suggestion.  We welcome your feedback."

Internal barometer is used on supported devices for better precision. Application can run without GPS, WiFi and internet, in this case the user has to enter weather data manually.\n\n• For each carburetor config, the following values are given: high speed screw position, low speed screw position, pop-off pressure, optimal exhaust length, spark plug, spark plug gap, optimal exhaust temperature (EGT), optimal water temperature\n• Support Kestrel DROP, Kestrel 5x00, WeatherFlow WEATHERmeter, Skywatch BL bluetooth weather stations\n• Fine tuning for high and low speed screws\n• History of all your carburetor configs\n• Graphic display of fuel mix quality (Air/Flow Ratio or Lambda)\n• Selectable fuel type (gasoline with or without ethanol, Racing fuels available, for example: VP C12, VP 110, VP MRX02, Sunoco)\n• Adjustable fuel/oil ratio\n• Mix wizard to get the perfect mix ratio (fuel calculator)\n• Carburetor ice warning\n• Possibility of use automatic weather data or a portable weather station\n• If you don't want to share your location, you can manually select any place in the world, the carburetor config will be adapted for this place\n• let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, meter and feet for altitude, liters, ml, gallons, oz for fuel, and mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg atm for pressures\n\nThe application contains four tabs, which are described next:\n\n• Results: In this tab high speed screw position, low speed screw position, pop-off pressure, optimal exhaust length, spark plug, spark plug gap, optimal exhaust temperature (EGT), optimal water temperature are shown. These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine configuration given in the next tabs. This tab lets do a fine tuning adjustment for all this values to adapt to the concrete engine. Also the air density, density altitude, relative air density, SAE - dyno correction factor, station pressure, SAE- relative horsepower, volumetric content of oxygen, oxygen pressure are shown too. On this tab, you can also share your settings with your colleagues. You can also see in a graphic form the calculated ratio of air and fuel (lambda).\n• History: This tab contains the history of all carburetor configs. This tab also contains your favorite carburetor configs.\n• Engine: You can configure in this screen the information about the engine, that is, engine model, type of restrictor, carburetor, spark manufacturer, fuel type, oil mix ratio\n• Weather: In this tab, you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. Also this tab allows to use the GPS to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service (you can choose one weather data source from several possible) to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity). In addition, this application can work with a pressure sensor built into the iPhone. Also, on this tab, you can enable alerts about possible carburetor icing.\n\nIf you have any doubt about using this App, please, contact us."

      "label": "THE BEST VIDEO REPLAY APP!\n- Number 1 in the Sports iPad Category!!!\n- Trusted by the US major league baseball and basketball teams.\n\nAre you frustrated by making the same mistakes and wasting time on your practice? Video Delay Instant Replay is a fantastic way for athletes to receive instant feedback on their performance. Analyze your form, build good muscle memory, and get faster results. \n\nMake every practice satisfying and effective!\n\nThere are three main features: the DELAY, the SLO-MO, and the REPLAY.\n\nThe DELAY Mode continuously shows the delayed video during practice. After setting the buffer time, there's no need to record and replay manually. The video feedback will be on until you reset the buffer or hit the exit button.\n\nThe SLO-MO Mode captures a short video and instantly replays it in slow motion. It works best for quick activities, like punch or shoot. To adjust the speed rate, use the slider. The recording will get you short slow-motion videos of every repetition. \n\nThe REPLAY View* allows frame-by-frame analysis of athlete moves, including measuring the angles. You can also export a short part of the replay video using AB selection.\n* It works only with Delay mode and a buffer time longer than 1 second.\n\nImprove your skills and get faster results:\n1. Set the Buffer time.\n2. Do your action.\n3. Watch the video feedback.\n4. Immediately correct your posture and repeat!\n\nCoaches and teachers! \nUse the app with an external screen for even better feedback during practice! Watch the Replay video with your team, analyze your players' performance, and correct errors. Add lines on the screen to check out the angles. Trim the video, so it only shows what you want your students to concentrate on. Record only necessary parts of the practice. Instant Feedback also helps to settle disputes between players.\n\nBasketball, baseball, and football players! \nPractice by repetition -  improve your shooting form by copying your favorite players' moves. Make out the best of your hitting drill. Take a quick look at the footage, correct your posture, and return to the action. No need to rewind or touch the device; the video will play instantly. You will be able to see if your pose is good and if your fake moves are effective. \n\nGolf and tennis players! \nUse a motion-detection grid and correct your swing or backhand instantly! Perform proper movements and maintain good posture while exercising. Build better muscle memory and improve your game!\n\nTraining martial arts, archery, or shooting? \nStudy your form with delayed video feedback. Set a short delay time and analyze your moves in slow motion. See what to correct in your kicks or punches.\n\nPilates or yoga fan? \nCheck out poses you won’t see in the mirror, like dog or pigeon. Make sure you are true to form and protect yourself from injury.\n\nActors and performers!\nReplay yourself performing and improve your acting skills. Check out your gestures in slow-motion and make them the best!\n\nFor information on how to use the VDIR, please check out the User Guide in the app!"

It is a climber's mecca necessitating a pilgrimage at least once in every climber's life.\n\nThe app uses the interactive functions available in iPhone and iPod touch to provide a unique, portable and effective climbing guide. The app content is derived from the high quality climber’s guide to Mt Arapiles: Arapiles Selected Climbs by Open Spaces Publishing and contains over a thousand of Arapiles' best climbs.\n\nHaving your climbing guide on your iPhone or iPod touch gives you the ultimate in portability. You can comfortably carry it in your pocket up multi-pitch routes or flick through it during boring moments in your workday. \n\nUnlike all other climbing guide apps that simply show the information from the hardcopy guide in much the same static format, iCrag leverages the iPhone and iPod touch interactive capabilities producing a unique user experience. Navigate the guide with hotspot links on the wall images themselves. Zoom images using the pinch or double tap gestures to get a closer look at the next pitch. Touch on a route line to pop up its description. Use the indexes and search function to find routes that fit your needs.\n\niCrag have created the next generation of climbing guides.

With a waterproof case, you can get real-time data during your workout and even relay it to your coach.\n\nUsing the accelerometer in your device, CrewNerd is able to accurately calculate your stroke rate as well as how much bounce (vertical movement) and stern check you are producing.  Speed, pace and distance are calculated via GPS.\n\n• Configurable display\n\nIn landscape mode there are up to six configurable data fields, and in portrait mode there are up to ten. Choose from the following:\n  • Stroke rate\n  • Elapsed time\n  • Distance\n  • Speed or pace\n  • Average speed or pace\n  • Heart rate\n  • Stroke count\n  • Interval count\n  • Meters per stroke\n  • Total distance\n  • Projected time and distance\n  • Check\n  • Bounce\n  • Course (direction)\n  • Time of day\n\nSet the top line to be double-height to make the most important data stand out. In portrait mode, the top two lines can both be made double-height.\n\n• Custom workouts\n\nSelect from one of the provided workouts, or create your own based on distance, time or strokes.  An auto-start feature starts the timer when the first stroke is taken, or you can set a “countdown” of 15 or 30 seconds before the timer starts to allow you to build up speed before starting a piece.\n\n• Custom courses\n\nCreate custom by plotting your start and finish lines on a map. The application will start the timer automatically when you cross the start line and stop when you reach the finish. This is great for hands free operation in long distance races or for set routes you routinely use.\n\n• Review your data\n\nAll workout data is recorded and can be reviewed on the device or uploaded directly to Strava, Concept2, TrainingPeaks, Sportlyzer, or the Apple Health app. On the history page for your practice, press \"Select export type\" to choose one of these options.\n\nYou can also export data as GPX, KML, TCX, or CSV. You can view a map of your workout or view an interval data chart with configurable distance markers showing split times on your phone.\n\n• Heart rate\n\nCrewNerd supports all Bluetooth Smart heart rate monitors.\n\n• Live position tracking\n\nStream your workout data as it happens to any web browser via CrewNerd.com.\n\n• VoiceOver support\n\nFor blind and vision-impaired athletes, CrewNerd provides audible feedback during your workouts. Configure the content and timing of the announcements to meet your needs.\n\n• For coaches\n\nUse custom workouts to keep your practices on target. In coach mode, you can tap anywhere on the screen to check stroke rate. CrewNerd can also be used on the iPad for a larger display.\n\nWaterproof cases are available to protect your iPhone on the water. See our web site for more information."

      "label": "The most advanced sports timer in the AppStore! \nFeatured by Apple in the TV-ad \"Strength\". \n\nSprintTimer is a unique sports timer and photo finish app that employs the same techniques as the fully automatic timing equipment (FAT) used at the Olympics. Start the timer and point the camera towards the finish line. The app creates an image where you can scroll to get the time for each competitor with a 0.01 s accuracy*. SprintTimer also includes a motion/human-activated Video Finish for longer races and a Start Sender for wirelessly controlling SprintTimer from another device.\n\nSprintTimer is used by coaches, teachers, and athletes all over the world for practice and competition in, for example, track & field, cycling, skiing, speed skating, car racing, rowing, kayaking, horses or greyhound racing. \n\nSprintTimer has several advantages over a manual stopwatch: \n- One person can time all participants\n- Higher accuracy*\n- Easier to determine the order\n- The image and the results can be saved\n- Can operate \"hands-free\" when started\n- The timer can be started manually, with a sound, or remotely from another device\n\n*See webpage: sprinttimer.app/accuracy\n\n——— Reviews and Comments ———\n\n\"Without a doubt the best App available on the market for sprinters and coaches who want accurate timing to see their development.\"\nspeedendurance.com\n\n\"AMAZING\"\nthepegeek.com\n\n\"Amazing app for physical education teachers or coaches!  I have used it for timing during our track and field, speed quickness & agility, fitness testing, & many more units.  It is very accurate and easy to use and gets the job done quickly!  A must-have!\"\nmertonphysed.weebly.com\n\n \"The app is very professionally set up and you can very easily capture your whole Track event.\"\nwww.melhamada.com\n\n\"Very useful app for measuring and/or verifying close finishes to track and field or road races.\"\nphysedreview.weebly.com\n\nSatisfied users from all over the world:\n- Brilliant.  A fantastic app for use in school athletics lessons\n- Amazing. This application is awesome and the results are really accurate.\n- What a brilliant app! Our £9k photo finish camera broke down and this app was a real lifesaver and worth way more than £1.50!

      "label": "Keep track of your players' time on the field with Coach's Clock.\n\nDesigned with input from a youth soccer coach who manages multiple teams each season, Coach's Clock is a very simple application that runs on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. It keeps track of all of the players on your team, where they are supposed to be on the field, and how long they've been playing since they were last substituted into the game.\n\nJust enter in your team name and your player roster. Drag your players on and off the field and tap the clock to start it running. Players on the field accrue elapsed time. Players off the field do not. It's that simple.\n\nWhat Coach's Clock does:\n\n* It tracks how much time has elapsed in the current play period.\n* It tracks the position of every player on your team.\n* It keeps track of how long each player has been on the field.\n* It helps you plan player substitutions.\n* It has field backgrounds for basketball, field hockey, football, hockey and soccer but it could also be used for any similar sport.\n* It supports an unlimited number of teams.\n* It has detailed usage instructions right inside the app.\n* It's a \"universal app\" so one purchase is good for all your iDevices!\n\nWhat it doesn't do:\n\n* Coach's Clock doesn't force you to keep the app running throughout your game. You are free to close it, open other apps, take phone calls, or whatever you like. You only need to run it when you want to refer to it or when you need to make a change. The clocks keep time even when the app isn't running.\n* Coach's Clock is not a replacement for your whiteboard or playbook. (There are plenty of other fine apps which can do that for you.)\n\nCoach's Clock may seem like a pretty simple app, and it is! But that's the beauty of it. It doesn't try to do everything for you; instead it tries to do a few essential things very well. It doesn't try to change the way you coach your team; it just makes your job a little easier."

      "label": "The 'YO YO Endurance Test' provides an important instrument for determining the level of physical efficiency of an athlete.\nThe physical capacity is evaluated quickly and easily by placing two cones spaced 20 meters each other.\nThe athlete has to run at full speed from one cone to another and then return again on the first cone. This path must be repeated for six times without any break, and get  the split times every time the athlete passes on the first cone.\n\nThis application will track all the split time and at the end will be calculated two parameters that determine the outcome of the test. More these values are low and better will be the athlete's performance.\n\nBasically the final result is given by a mathematical formula that processes the delta between the averages of the last two split times and the first two split times  and thereby the athlete's ability to maintain its maximum speed for a certain period of time.\n\nThe second value obtained on completion of the test, is the first result considering also the total time of the test.\n\nThe 'YO YO Endurance Test' can be used to determine the level of athletic in all sports (football, running, basketball, volleyball, cycling, tennis etc.)\nAt the end of the test you can get for each athlete the final result (eg. \"Above average\" or \"Poor\") and the Vo2Max estimate\n\nYou can manage more Athletes and save personal data and notes.\nYou can analyze test results.\nAutomatic Sync between devices thanks to iCloud\nInfo section where you can better understand how prepare the test and you can visit linked website and video where get more info about YO-YO Endurance Test\n\nIf you find this application useful, please give a positive review in the AppStore, so we can further improve and develop new options.\n\nFor any further information, please send an email to:\nsupport@bitandweb.com\n\nThanks"

      "label": "Dive Log is designed to work either as your primary SCUBA diving logbook application or in conjunction with compatible 3rd party desktop logbook applications. You can use Dive Log at the dive site or on the dive boat to capture the information about the site while it is fresh in your mind (or your dive guide's mind). You can even capture the GPS coordinates of the dive site using the built in location services of your iOS device. Details about your actual dive can be added immediately after your dive or at the après dive event and later be saved to your desktop computer. The dive buddy feature is fully integrated with Contacts on your iPhone or iPad, letting you capture information about your newest dive buddy or quickly add an existing buddy to a particular dive. The dive data and statistics features let you have an immediate answer the next time your dive guide asks how much weight you used on your last dive or have all the information you need about your dive history when you fill out that next dive waiver.  Metric and Imperial values are supported for all appropriate logbook fields. You can easily enter values using the appropriate units for the situation and view them in your preferred measurement system. You can even explore detailed dive profiles from popular dive computers that you download with your desktop software and later upload to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad. Dive profile data can also be transferred directly from certain dive computers directly via Bluetooth or using a supported Bluetooth accessory and an associated in-app purchase.  \n\nOn Windows, Diving Log 6.0 (www.divinglog.de) is fully integrated with Dive Log on iPhone/iPad and has built in synchronization. Diving Log 6.0 has extensive support for importing data from dive computers and other dive log applications. \n\nOn Mac OS X, logbook information can be imported to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad from a number of compatible applications using the free Dive Log Manager application available from More Mobile Software (www.moremobilesoftware.com/divelog-sync). Dive Log DT (available on the Mac App Store) can be used to directly import a number of dive computers and file formats and can synchronize with Dive Log on iOS.\n\nDive data can be directly downloaded on a Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch from Bluetooth LE capable dive computers such as the Suunto EON Steel, Suunto EON Core, Suunto D5, Scubapro Galileo 2 (G2), Aladin Sport (Matrix), Aladin H (Matrix), G2 HUD, Aladin A1, Shearwater Teric, Peregrine, Petrel 2, Perdix, Perdix AI, NERD 2, Oceanic VTX, Pro Plus 4, Geo 4.0, VEO 4.0, Aeris A300CS, Aqualung i300C, i550C, i750TC, i770R, Sherwood Wisdom 4, Mares Genius and certain heinrichs weikamp OSTC computers as well as the DiveNav Inc. bluebuddy and Tech Buddy dive logger accessories. Supported Bluetooth LE accessories are available separately.\n\nMares Bluelink Pro is a Bluetooth LE accessory by Mares and available for purchase separately (www.mares.com). The Bluelink Pro allows you transfer dive data from certain Mares dive computers (Puck Pro, Smart, Smart Air, Quad and Quad Air) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nDive Computer Buddy (aka DCbuddy) is a Bluetooth LE accessory by DiveNav Inc. (note that the DCbuddy itself is no longer available). The DCbuddy allows you transfer dive data from certain dive computers (including models from Suunto, Oceanic, Aqualung, Aeris, Sherwood, Tusa and Mares) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch."

      "label": "This is the only app for hikers either walking or thinking of walking the iconic Thorsborne Trail on World Heritage listed Hinchinbrook Island in Far North Queensland, Australia. It is the perfect electronic guide and provides a rich set of features. The Island has very limited cellular access so the app aims to provide  the hiker all of its comprehensive information without the need of mobile connection. \n\nThe app provides the hiker with both an on and off-line accessible topological Island map. This map can be zoomed and panned to show different perspectives of the trail and a satellite view is available when on-line. The map provides key trail-specific GPS generated features. These include the actual trail itself and useful metrics such as the distance walked so far, distance to the nearest water source and camp site. The app also provides a selectable set of icons that mark key locations on the trail for all season water sources, hiking season water sources, tidal creeks and locations for limited cellular access and also campsites. The hikers exact positional latitude and longitude is also provided by the map should that information be needed. The information provided by the app is a distillation of local knowledge some of which cannot be found anywhere else.\n\nThe app also provides the user with comprehensive trail notes in both directions of the walk. The hiker can switch between the map metric view and the route notes with a simple tab touch and both directions of the walk are covered by the guide in a simple clear format designed for reading. \n\nThe app emphasises safety on the trail - Hinchinbrook is a wild and unspoilt island with a few hazards which are identified by the app and should an emergency arise it will provide assistance in providing you not only your exact position but also locations on the trail where a call can be made. The app also provides off line BOM Lucinda tidal charts for the year. Knowing the tidal range for the days of your hike and where the tidal crossings are, including safe water levels which vary by creek, will ensure that you can plan a safe and unhindered walk. The app provides all this information to hikers.\n\nFor those wanting to see what a North to South Hike may look like from the comfort of your home there is a \"Walk Simulation\" feature in the settings menu - this shows an accelerated version of what the app will look like on the trail itself and will be a feature that is developed further in future releases to provide more information to the hiker for trip planning.\n\nThe app is perfect for those just thinking of doing the walk -  the menu provides all the information you need to book the trail and the transfers required to get there along with a host of other useful information. There is even a gallery of  our favourite spots on the Island and I'm sure when you see them you will understand why this walk deserves its own app - quite simply its one of the best in the world. Happy Hiking!"

Manage and organize multiple teams fairly and efficiently, with less stress and more time to enjoy the truly rewarding experience that being a Soccer Dad brings. Click “...More” to learn why you should download this App today!\n\nBest soccer app - *****\nby Ciaran O'Shaughnessy - Dec 11, 2010\n\n\"I have downloaded and tried maybe 15 or more apps to help manage games, players (rotations, time played etc) and track stats for players on my Recreational and Club team.\nWhile there are probably 3 that are worthwhile. One is good and has 90% of what I needed, but is not user friendly and difficult to use. The second is great and easy to use, but only has 80% of what I needed. This app has 99% of what anyone needs, is easy to use and is user friendly. In addition the developer is quick to respond and eager to find out what else would improve the product.\nI would have given this 10 stars as a rating, but unfortunately 5 is the most one can give.\"\n\nThe whistle blows and your team springs into action. As you watch them play, you can’t help but feel proud of those kids. They’ve come so far since the beginning of this year’s soccer season. Thankfully, as their coach, you have, too.\n\nWhen you first started coaching kids’ soccer, you manually made up schedules, juggled rotations, organized events and volunteers. You did it all, including reports and communicating with parents. It was a lot of work but seeing the kids improve and grow was satisfying and worth all that effort. Sadly, it didn’t give you much time to enjoy your role as much as you were hoping.\n\nThanks to the Soccer Dad app, you can now take care of all your team’s administration needs in a much easier way. You’ll be so organized and efficient, that you’ll enjoy coaching even more. Communicating with parents and players is a breeze too, because the app holds the full contact information of everyone you may need to get in touch with.\n\nEver need to schedule or reschedule games and practices? Of course you do. No problem, Soccer Dad can help you with that and will even mark the dates on your built-in iPhone calendar. You also have the option of having Soccer Dad issue reminders about those dates. \n\nJust look at how Soccer Dad can help you and your team:\n* Fairly and efficiently manage and organize multiple teams by season\n* Easy access of player contact information – quickly communicate with parents\n* Organize events and have them display in your iPhone calendar\n* Keep track of volunteers\n* Replace your stopwatch and clipboard – lets you know when it’s time to change players, even if it’s in your pocket.\n* Send emails without ever leaving the app\n* Use the camera and photo library for player pictures\n* Optimized for the iPhone and iPad retina display\n\nIf you’re one of those special people who coaches kids’ soccer, let this helper app make the season and administrative tasks a little more comfortable and less labor intensive. Then you’ll have time for what’s truly important – the kids.\n\nDownload Soccer Dad now.\n\nSee this App in action here:  http://www.youtube.com/soccerdadapp\n\n- Support -\n\nIf you have questions/issues/feedback regarding the app, please contact me through my support link below.\n\n(Unfortunately, I can't respond to App Store reviews because there's no way to contact reviewers.)"

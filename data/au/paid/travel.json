It's built by local Western Australians who have walked the Track several times and live only a few km from the Track. We know the area!\r\n\r\nThe guide works 100% without needing mobile phone reception or Internet access. The offline maps are very detailed, show the Cape to Cape Track, show where you are via GPS, and are marked up with camping areas, sightseeing, water sources, places to swim, some accommodation, restaurants and food shops, the best beachs, sights and many other points of interest. The App shows you how many kilometres you are from places like camping area and towns, and has an interactive elevation graph so you can see what hills are between you and places. \r\n\r\nThe App has advice on how to prepare for your trip, what gear to bring, when to walk, possible itineraries and suitable food. It has many other features, photos and information, as described below.\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n- Very detailed offline maps. They ALWAYS work, even when mobile phone coverage and Internet are not available.\r\n- The map is tuned to look great on a small phone screen and show details that a walker in the bush needs. You'll see details such as minor tracks at map zoom levels where most other maps hide them. So zoom out and tracks don't disappear from your map! Great for your safety and easier for you to navigate even with a tiny screen.\r\n- Contour lines are shown on the map as you zoom in a little.\r\n- Uses GPS to show your location.\r\n- The map has extra markers for towns, camping areas, sights, places where you can get food, attractions, swimming spots and other points of interest.\r\n- Map markers also show you where to get water and the location of toilets.\r\n- Tap place markers on the map and be shown your distance from them along the track. See how far away that camping area is!\r\n- An elevation graph that you can zoom-and-swipe to see all the hills and valleys along the track. \r\n- The elevation graph shows your location and has markers for towns, camping and other places. Use it to see if you have to walk up any big hills to get to that next camping area?\r\n- Tap town, sightseeing, camping and other markers on the map to get detailed information and photographs for those places.\r\n- Has descriptions and pictures of each section of the Track.\r\n- Provides information on paid accommodation options. For those who want a bit more luxury than camping!\r\n- Has a track overview, and information about camping, drinking water, safety, weather, animals and history of the Cape to Cape Track.\r\n- Detailed advice and information on how to prepare for a multi-day trip, when to do your trip, what gear you need and suitable food.\r\n- Describes transportation options such as buses and companies that provide shuttle services.\r\n- No mobile phone coverage or internet is needed for the App to work. Put your phone in Airplane Mode to save battery power and continue to use the App (your phone's GPS will still work in Airplane Mode).\r\n- The App turns off GPS when the screen is turned off, so will not use phone power when you are not using it.\r\n- The guide has loads of beautiful photographs of the Track to inspire you!\r\n\r\nYou should never get lost because the maps always work and show you where you are, even when you stray from the Track. The great detail on the maps make it easy to follow bush tracks and paths to get back to the track.\r\n\r\nThis App was built by a small Western Australian software company located only 8 km from the northern termination of the Track. We know the track and the area intimately. We're confident our Cape to Cape Track Guide App will make your trip easier to plan, safer and more fun."

All updates are free.\n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Portugués and its three most common variations; the Central Route, the Coastal Route, and the Variante Espiritual. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 400 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?

      "label": "Take this guide with you when riding the Munda Biddi Trail. It has all the information you need to both navigate and prepare for the Trail. It's built by local Western Australians who have ridden the Trail several times and LOVE bike packing!\n\nThe guide works 100% without needing mobile phone reception or Internet access. The offline maps are very detailed, show the Munda Biddi Trail, show where you are via GPS, and are marked up with huts, camping areas, places to get water, alternative accommodation and many points of interest. The App map shows you how many kilometres you are from places like huts and towns, and has an interactive elevation graph so you can see what hills are between you and places. \n\nThe App has advice on how to prepare for your trip, what gear to bring, what bike to ride and suitable food. It's a complete \"how to do the trail\" guide. It has many other features, photos and information, as described below.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Very detailed offline maps. They ALWAYS work, even when mobile phone coverage and Internet are not available.\n- The map is tuned to look great on a small phone screen and show details that a cyclist in the bush needs. You'll see details such as minor tracks and trails at zoom levels where most other maps hide them. So zoom out and tracks don't disappear from your map! This makes following trail redirections easy. And getting back to the trail if you lose it becomes trivial. Great for your safety and easier for you to navigate even with a tiny screen.\n- The map has contour lines.\n-  Uses GPS to show your location on the map.\n- The map has extra markers for huts, towns, camping areas, places where you can get food, attractions, swimming spots and other points of interest.\n- Tap places on the map and be shown your distance from them along the track. See how far away that hut is!\n- An elevation graph that you can zoom-and-swipe to see all the hills and valleys along the trail. \n- The elevation graph shows your location and markers for towns, huts and other places. Do I have to ride up any big hills to get to that hut?\n- Tap hut, town, camping and other markers on the map to get detailed information and photographs for those places.\n- Includes a map showing places where you can get drinking water. And a map showing toilets along the trail.\n- Has descriptions and pictures of each section of the Trail.\n- Provides detailed information on paid accommodation options outside towns. For those who want a bit more luxury than camping!\n- Has a trail overview, and information about the huts, drinking water, safety, weather, animals and history of the Munda Biddi Trail.\n- Detailed advice and information on how to train for a multi-day trip, choosing a bike, when to ride, what gear you need and suitable food.\n- Shows bike shops and other places that can supply bike parts or fix problems.\n- Describes transportation options such as buses and companies that provide shuttle services.\n- No mobile phone coverage or internet is needed for the App to work. Put your phone in Airplane Mode to save battery power and continue to use the App (your phone's GPS will still work in Airplane Mode).\n- The App turns off GPS when the screen is turned off, so will not use phone power when you are not using it.\n- The guide has loads of beautiful photographs of the Trail to inspire you!\n\nYou should never get lost because the maps always work and show you where you are, even when you stray from the Trail. The great detail on the maps make it easy to follow bush tracks and paths to get back to the Trail.\n\nThis App was built by a small Western Australian software company. We've ridden the Trail and have extensive bike packing experience. We're confident our Munda Biddi Trail Guide App will make your trip easier to plan, safer and more fun.\n\nA portion of the earnings from this App are given to the Munda Biddi Trail Foundation."

It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales; with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 900+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

      "label": "This App is based on content licensed from Mayo Clinic and helps travelers safeguard their health before, during and after travel. This App is developed by experienced travel medicine consultants from Mayo Clinic focusing on your health during travel and provides tips for preventing and handling illnesses while traveling. Providers refer their patients to this App so that travelers have the information when they need.\n\nThe App is easy to use:\n\n1. Find your destination by browsing or searching from the home screen.\n2. When you find your destination country, press “Add This to My Trips” \n3. Get a list of recommended vaccines by pressing “Health and Vaccinations”. (If you have not received the recommended vaccines for this trip, contact your healthcare provider). This section also tells you if you need to take medicine for malaria prevention (an infection transmitted by mosquitoes that attacks and breaks down red blood cells in your body).\n4. “Packing List” recommends things you should carry with you for that trip (touching the radial buttons marks those items complete). You can modify this list and add new items.\n5. “To Do” section reminds you of important travel and health related preparations you need to make before your trip. Add or delete items based on your needs.\n6. Save your travel documents and health related information in “My Stuff” section.\n\nDetails of App features:\n\nCustomized recommendations for travel health based on your travel itinerary.  Recommendations on safe travel for sick travelers.\n\nLicensed Mayo Clinic's content for \"Health\" section provides information on symptoms and prevention strategies for a broad range of travel related illnesses including Jet Lag and Sleep, Motion and Altitude Sickness, Travel Diarrhea, insect transmitted illnesses and many more. \n\nLatest safety alerts are a touch away. Navigate to Travel Alerts and Warnings issued by US Department of State (links provided in the app). While in this section, enroll in Smart Travel Enrollment Program (STEP), a free service to allow U.S. citizens/Nationals traveling abroad to enroll with the local U.S. Embassy.\n\nThe app provides simple exercises that can be performed with limited leg space on board aircraft. How? Well, we've got pictures to show you how. Stay fit while on board aircraft and prevent the dreaded blood clots in the legs.\n\nWhat if you lose your passport while traveling? We've got you covered. Store all your travel documents in \"My Stuff\" section. \n\nThe app lets you store Immunization records, your doctor’s contact information, list of allergies, medication information (pictures of pills, dosages, frequency) and your health insurance information.  This information can be life saving in case you lose your luggage and medications kept in it (Trust us, it happens more frequently than you think).\n\nStore unlimited customized items with pictures in the “My Stuff” Custom Item section of the App.  It is up to your imagination as you can use the packing list as your shopping list.  All information is stored on your device, making it available when needed and eliminating cloud-based document storage risk.\n\nUpon return, archive the trip and you can use your customized lists for your next destination (a great feature for frequent fliers).\n  \nFriendly reminder: Keep in mind that this app is not a replacement for consultation with a Travel Medicine Doctor or your primary healthcare provider. Your medical condition may warrant precautions that your Doctor may tell you.  So pay a visit before travel.\n\nThis is the only App that has information on Hajj and Umrah."

No Login. \n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Francés, the most popular route across Spain. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 900 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 900+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

It includes over 700 species profiles detailing physical characteristics, behaviours and locations, and each is accompanied by breathtaking photography to aid identification. The 700+ species profiles cover:\n- All 148 mammal species ever recorded in Kruger, including the best places to find them.\n- Over 60 footprint graphics so you can identify wildlife spoor.\n- 500+ bird species, including all of Kruger’s resident, migrant visitor and vagrant records since 2010. Stunning bird photography includes male, female, juvenile and breeding plumage where relevant.\n- Over 500 bird audio files bring the sounds of the bush to life.\n- 60+ profiles of commonly encountered reptiles and invertebrates, including crocodiles, snakes, lizards, tortoises, butterflies, spiders & much more.\n\nThe Guided Routes use our experience from many years exploring Kruger to create 70+ incredible journeys through the park:\n- The routes are like having an in-person guide in your pocket. Each includes extensive commentary that doesn’t just say, “Take that road because it’s good for lions,” but instead explains the geology of each area, which in turn informs the flora that grows there, the herbivores that eat that flora and, ultimately, the predators that hunt those herbivores.\n- Each route will help you develop an intimate insight into Kruger’s incredible wilderness.\n- Each of the rest camps and entrance gates is covered with short, medium and full-day routes to explore.\n\nThe Maps are the most detailed and up-to-date available:\n- They include newly opened roads and correct errors found in the maps available in the park shops. \n- For first-time visitors to Kruger, note that you are not provided with a map and must buy one from a park shop at a cost similar to this App.\n- The live GPS map means you'll never get lost.\n\nWith over half a million words of content, KrugerExplorer is the most comprehensive and unparalleled encyclopedia for the Greater Kruger ever created.\n\nSince launching in 2019, the App has had a superb reception from fans and received wonderful accolades:\n- Downloads in over 80 countries\n- App Store “App of the Day”\n- “Recommended” commendation by BirdLife South Africa\n- “Highly Recommended” by Getaway Magazine\n\nKrugerExplorer is also a global community of wildlife lovers. You can enjoy the stories, photos and experiences of our 200,000+ followers on Facebook & Instagram. We look forward to seeing you there!\n\nFrequently asked questions:\n- Yes, the App works 100% offline once fully downloaded. You can put your device into flight mode, escape to the bush and still make full use of the App!\n- Yes, this App is a one-time purchase, with no further in-app purchases or ongoing subscriptions required.\n- This is an English language app.\n\nHappy exploring,\nDanny & Charlotte"

Made possible by our amazing data provider ADSBExchange, the world's largest source of unfiltered flight data.\n\nLocal & Worldwide\nView aircraft around your current location or jump to any airport in the world. Use the digital crown to zoom in on a busy LAX or watch aircraft taking off and landing at JFK.\n\nAircraft Details\nSimply tap on an aircraft to see all its details: flight name, registration, type, category, operator, altitude, speeds and more (depending on data availability).\n\nAircraft Following\nInterested in a single aircraft? Follow it as it proceeds among the other traffic. Just tap the small blue dot to exit follow mode and return to the main map.\n\nMultiple Filters\nJust want to see aircraft below 10'000 feet, Boeing 747s or only planes from a certain airline? You can filter by altitude, type, callsign or registration. Filters can be combined, too.\n\nCustomizability\nCustomize the display using many options. You only want to see helicopters and hide all small airports? You can do that and much more...\n\nComplications Support\nWith many different complications available, designed to fit into all color schemes, PlaneWatcher is always just a tap away.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.planewatcher.app/privacy.html\nTerms of Use: https://www.planewatcher.app/terms.html"

      "label": "eCurrency is far more than an easy to use currency converter and handy calculator.

Just start the application and type in the amount you want to convert and eCurrency converts instantly. Tap on one of the flags to change the currency you want to convert to. A built-in calculator allows for math calculations. The current exchange rate and rate change compared to the previous day is conveniently displayed in the main interface.\n\n==Favorites Support==\neCurrency supports over 200 currencies. The “Favorites” functionality allows you to define the currency pairs you use as favorites. To create a new favorite go into the “Settings” and touch the “+” Button.

In map view, you can tap any wifi icon where wireless information is available, and use the button to copy the password to the clipboard. The map is available offline so you don’t need an Internet connection to use WiFox when you’re traveling.\n\n*Click Copy to easily paste passwords into wireless network settings.\n\n*Users can also add passwords they find from airports around the world. Those passwords are then sent to foXnoMad for verification and approval before they are added to the map.\n\n*In ‘List View’ you can update passwords for airports already added (when you’ve noticed some changes). As you travel you can also rate the wireless hotspot information to let us know if the details worked for you or not. Based on traveler feedback, the connection information is updated, verified, or removed.\n\n*WiFox icons indicate how fresh, reliable, and highly rated a given airport wireless network’s information is.\n\n*WiFox is updated continuously with information travelers, pilots, and other users send through the WiFox app, foXnoMad website, and foXnoMad Facebook and Twitter accounts. WiFox currently has wireless Internet information for over 700 airports around the world.\n\n*The map is updated automatically upon opening the app (when you have Internet access) or by clicking the ‘Update’ button on the map or refresh icon on the List View.\n\n*WiFox also protects users on free (open) wifi networks by telling you the proper network name, so you don't unintentionally connect to a rogue or malicious access point.\n\nWiFox Premium subscriptions unlock the following features:\n\n* Automatic notifications of the highest rated password, with network connection information, as soon as you land. WiFox Premium detects the airport you're at and displays the most relevant wifi network name and password so you can get online as soon as you step off the plane.\n\n* View password ratings to see which passwords work best throughout an airport so you can connect to the strongest and most reliable connection.\n\n* Be able to add your own password ratings within WiFox. Premium user priority ratings ensure the best wifi passwords are always displayed.\n\nAfter a 30-day free trial period a $24.99/year purchase will be applied to your iTunes account following confirmation of a Premium upgrade. Subscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can cancel anytime with your iTunes account settings.

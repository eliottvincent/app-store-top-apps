      "label": "Take this guide with you when riding the Munda Biddi Trail. It has all the information you need to both navigate and prepare for the Trail. It's built by local Western Australians who have ridden the Trail several times and LOVE bike packing!\n\nThe guide works 100% without needing mobile phone reception or Internet access. The offline maps are very detailed, show the Munda Biddi Trail, show where you are via GPS, and are marked up with huts, camping areas, places to get water, alternative accommodation and many points of interest. The App map shows you how many kilometres you are from places like huts and towns, and has an interactive elevation graph so you can see what hills are between you and places. \n\nThe App has advice on how to prepare for your trip, what gear to bring, what bike to ride and suitable food. It's a complete \"how to do the trail\" guide. It has many other features, photos and information, as described below.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Very detailed offline maps. They ALWAYS work, even when mobile phone coverage and Internet are not available.\n- The map is tuned to look great on a small phone screen and show details that a cyclist in the bush needs. You'll see details such as minor tracks and trails at zoom levels where most other maps hide them. So zoom out and tracks don't disappear from your map! This makes following trail redirections easy. And getting back to the trail if you lose it becomes trivial. Great for your safety and easier for you to navigate even with a tiny screen.\n- The map has contour lines.\n-  Uses GPS to show your location on the map.\n- The map has extra markers for huts, towns, camping areas, places where you can get food, attractions, swimming spots and other points of interest.\n- Tap places on the map and be shown your distance from them along the track. See how far away that hut is!\n- An elevation graph that you can zoom-and-swipe to see all the hills and valleys along the trail. \n- The elevation graph shows your location and markers for towns, huts and other places. Do I have to ride up any big hills to get to that hut?\n- Tap hut, town, camping and other markers on the map to get detailed information and photographs for those places.\n- Includes a map showing places where you can get drinking water. And a map showing toilets along the trail.\n- Has descriptions and pictures of each section of the Trail.\n- Provides detailed information on paid accommodation options outside towns. For those who want a bit more luxury than camping!\n- Has a trail overview, and information about the huts, drinking water, safety, weather, animals and history of the Munda Biddi Trail.\n- Detailed advice and information on how to train for a multi-day trip, choosing a bike, when to ride, what gear you need and suitable food.\n- Shows bike shops and other places that can supply bike parts or fix problems.\n- Describes transportation options such as buses and companies that provide shuttle services.\n- No mobile phone coverage or internet is needed for the App to work. Put your phone in Airplane Mode to save battery power and continue to use the App (your phone's GPS will still work in Airplane Mode).\n- The App turns off GPS when the screen is turned off, so will not use phone power when you are not using it.\n- The guide has loads of beautiful photographs of the Trail to inspire you!\n\nYou should never get lost because the maps always work and show you where you are, even when you stray from the Trail. The great detail on the maps make it easy to follow bush tracks and paths to get back to the Trail.\n\nThis App was built by a small Western Australian software company. We've ridden the Trail and have extensive bike packing experience. We're confident our Munda Biddi Trail Guide App will make your trip easier to plan, safer and more fun.\n\nA portion of the earnings from this App are given to the Munda Biddi Trail Foundation."

It includes over 700 species profiles detailing physical characteristics, behaviours and locations, and each is accompanied by breathtaking photography to aid identification. The 700+ species profiles cover:\n- All 148 mammal species ever recorded in Kruger, including the best places to find them.\n- Over 60 footprint graphics so you can identify wildlife spoor.\n- 500+ bird species, including all of Kruger’s resident, migrant visitor and vagrant records since 2010. Stunning bird photography includes male, female, juvenile and breeding plumage where relevant.\n- Over 500 bird audio files bring the sounds of the bush to life.\n- 60+ profiles of commonly encountered reptiles and invertebrates, including crocodiles, snakes, lizards, tortoises, butterflies, spiders & much more.\n\nThe Guided Routes use our experience from many years exploring Kruger to create 70+ incredible journeys through the park:\n- The routes are like having an in-person guide in your pocket. Each includes extensive commentary that doesn’t just say, “Take that road because it’s good for lions,” but instead explains the geology of each area, which in turn informs the flora that grows there, the herbivores that eat that flora and, ultimately, the predators that hunt those herbivores.\n- Each route will help you develop an intimate insight into Kruger’s incredible wilderness.\n- Each of the rest camps and entrance gates is covered with short, medium and full-day routes to explore.\n\nThe Maps are the most detailed and up-to-date available:\n- They include newly opened roads and correct errors found in the maps available in the park shops. \n- For first-time visitors to Kruger, note that you are not provided with a map and must buy one from a park shop at a cost similar to this App.\n- The live GPS map means you'll never get lost.\n\nWith over half a million words of content, KrugerExplorer is the most comprehensive and unparalleled encyclopedia for the Greater Kruger ever created.\n\nSince launching in 2019, the App has had a superb reception from fans and received wonderful accolades:\n- Downloads in over 80 countries\n- App Store “App of the Day”\n- “Recommended” commendation by BirdLife South Africa\n- “Highly Recommended” by Getaway Magazine\n\nKrugerExplorer is also a global community of wildlife lovers.

We look forward to seeing you there!\n\nFrequently asked questions:\n- Yes, the App works 100% offline once fully downloaded. You can put your device into flight mode, escape to the bush and still make full use of the App!\n- Yes, this App is a one-time purchase, with no further in-app purchases or ongoing subscriptions required.\n- This is an English language app.\n\nHappy exploring,\nDanny & Charlotte"

What one person describes as working another may describe as broken.\n\nFeatures:\n- Location database is included with the app, so all locations are visible when offline.\n- Filter what type of location to display. List only free dump stations from the filter.\n- Show a route between your location and the selected RV dump station.\n- View the dump stations in list view; easily search the list.\n- Get the local weather for the location.\n- Internet searches and more for each location.\n- Import routes from GPX files.  This makes it much easier to find RV dump stations along a route you've created in another app such as Road Trip Planner.\n- Send a dump station location to our app Road Trip Planner.  This helps in routing your travels (requires separate purchase of the Road Trip Planner app).\n\nWe want to expand our RV dump station database as much as possible, so we have made it easy for you to easily submit a new RV dump station - simply tap the + button below the map.  To correct or update dump station information, tap “Location Comment” in the detail view. We will be updating the database often.\n\nDue to the nature of dump stations constantly changing their status it's recommended you contact the dump station prior to using it to verify its existence."

The App shows you how many kilometres you are from places like camping area and towns, and has an interactive elevation graph so you can see what hills are between you and places. \r\n\r\nThe App has advice on how to prepare for your trip, what gear to bring, when to walk, possible itineraries and suitable food. It has many other features, photos and information, as described below.\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n- Very detailed offline maps. They ALWAYS work, even when mobile phone coverage and Internet are not available.\r\n- The map is tuned to look great on a small phone screen and show details that a walker in the bush needs. You'll see details such as minor tracks at map zoom levels where most other maps hide them. So zoom out and tracks don't disappear from your map! Great for your safety and easier for you to navigate even with a tiny screen.\r\n- Contour lines are shown on the map as you zoom in a little.\r\n- Uses GPS to show your location.\r\n- The map has extra markers for towns, camping areas, sights, places where you can get food, attractions, swimming spots and other points of interest.\r\n- Map markers also show you where to get water and the location of toilets.\r\n- Tap place markers on the map and be shown your distance from them along the track. See how far away that camping area is!\r\n- An elevation graph that you can zoom-and-swipe to see all the hills and valleys along the track. \r\n- The elevation graph shows your location and has markers for towns, camping and other places. Use it to see if you have to walk up any big hills to get to that next camping area?\r\n- Tap town, sightseeing, camping and other markers on the map to get detailed information and photographs for those places.\r\n- Has descriptions and pictures of each section of the Track.\r\n- Provides information on paid accommodation options. For those who want a bit more luxury than camping!\r\n- Has a track overview, and information about camping, drinking water, safety, weather, animals and history of the Cape to Cape Track.\r\n- Detailed advice and information on how to prepare for a multi-day trip, when to do your trip, what gear you need and suitable food.\r\n- Describes transportation options such as buses and companies that provide shuttle services.\r\n- No mobile phone coverage or internet is needed for the App to work. Put your phone in Airplane Mode to save battery power and continue to use the App (your phone's GPS will still work in Airplane Mode).\r\n- The App turns off GPS when the screen is turned off, so will not use phone power when you are not using it.\r\n- The guide has loads of beautiful photographs of the Track to inspire you!\r\n\r\nYou should never get lost because the maps always work and show you where you are, even when you stray from the Track. The great detail on the maps make it easy to follow bush tracks and paths to get back to the track.\r\n\r\nThis App was built by a small Western Australian software company located only 8 km from the northern termination of the Track. We know the track and the area intimately. We're confident our Cape to Cape Track Guide App will make your trip easier to plan, safer and more fun."

All updates are free.\n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Portugués and its three most common variations; the Central Route, the Coastal Route, and the Variante Espiritual. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 400 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

Whether you're backpacking overseas, or exploring your local neighborhood, GPS Log gives you everything you need to capture your travels, share your favorite places with your friends, and find your way back again!\n\nHow it works:\n\n1. GPS Log gets your location from your device in seconds.\n2. You add photos, text, and tags (if you like).\n3. Later, browse the list of saved log entries or search by text and tags.\n4. Easily view logged locations on a map and get directions to return.\n5. Connect with your friends by sharing single records (what we call spikes), trip maps and lifetime travel maps using our own website Geospike, and on social media.\n\nTry 'GPS Log' risk free with the 'GPS Log LITE' version. \n\nTraveling around the world and want to remember where you went? Or, going to a new coffee shop in your neighborhood? Use GPS Log to record all your adventures, great and small.\n\nGPS Log works with no data connection, great when you're far from civilization, or roaming. GPS Log preserves your battery life. Unlike some tracking tools, with GPS Log you power it up when you want to log a location - then you power it down immediately. Saving your precious battery.\n\nLog the cities you visit, rate the restaurants in your city, geotag your photographs, remember where you parked your car, or where you went out. Record the mountain, river, or run you conquered, and much much more. With GPS Log, you can log just about anything.\n\nNOTE: GPS Log works best on devices with actual GPS receivers such as the iPhone, and iPads with Cellular Data.  Locations obtained on other devices may be less accurate.\n\nIf you experience any issues using GPS Log, PLEASE use the links on GPS Log's Settings screen to contact us by email. When issues are left as reviews, we are unable to contact you to help."

      "label": "Ship's Bell is primarily an acoustic clock that sounds half-hourly or hourly time signals. Without taking the phone out of your pocket you can easily keep track of time.\n\nThe principle of this bell was founded in traditional seafaring. Seafarers used the bell to keep track of their four-hourly duty watches. The first half hour is signaled by a single bell strike. Another bell strike is added every half hour, ending with eight bell strikes. To hear the bell strikes better, they are grouped into double chimes. Eight bell strikes signaled a watch change – at midnight, 4 am, 8 am, 12 pm, 4 pm and 8 pm. With just eight different signals, being repeated in six cycles during the day, you will know what time it is every half and full hour.\n\n• Ship's bell according to the seafaring tradition\n• Two different kinds of chimes: classic bell or a modern synthesized sound\n• Option to strike only once each hour\n• Two different chimes for hourly signals: a single beep or a triple signal counting down to the full hour\n• Displays the current time on a maritime 24-hour clock face\n• Shows Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)\n• Switch to quickly enable or disable the acoustic signals\n\nA new addition in version 3.0 is the Tide Clock.\nAn additional clock hand and a tide ring can now be activated on the two dials of the glass clock (12-hour or 24-hour dial). This makes it possible to estimate the time until the next high or low tide in the style of a mechanical tide clock. The tide clock hand makes one revolution within 12 hours and 25 minutes independently of the hour clock hand and thus shows the average time between two high or low tides. The indices on the tide ring show the hours before and after a coming or past high or low tide.\n\nDear customers,\nIf there are any issues with this app, please send an email to our support team. We will get back to you as soon as possible!"

The buttons at the top of the screen allow you to navigate between different places.\n\nOn the first level is an Overview which divides the Camino into nine sections, starting and ending in major places along the route.\n\nOn the second level is a list of the places with pilgrim accommodation in the section you selected.\n\nThe third level gives detailed descriptions of individual places with pilgrim hostels, services, places to eat, sights and history with a link to Apple Maps with the important pilgrim facilities highlighted."

      "label": "eCurrency is far more than an easy to use currency converter and handy calculator. It supports over 200 popular currencies; works without active internet connection and even supports custom rates. eCurrency offers rich graphical charts for all exchange rates and supports calculations with historical exchange rates, making this the perfect tool for business, overseas travel and for anyone interested in currency trading.\n\neCurrency offers the following features:\n\n► Easy-to-use appealing interface\n► One screen for all major functionalities\n► Designated keypad for fast number entry; plus a handy built-in math’s calculator\n► Configures up to 8 converters; swipe through as on the iPhone‘s home screen\n► Supports over 200 currencies (for a full list see: http://bit.ly/knBkeS)\n► Detailed graphical charts for all exchange rates (1-week, 1-month, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, and 5-years)\n► Automatic setting of home currency and number formatting \n► Reliable functionality: No active internet connection required\n► Exchange rates automatically updated on startup (Automatic update can be deactivated to avoid roaming costs)\n► Supports custom exchange rate entry\n► One touch reverse currency conversion\n► Special ‘shake to inverse calculation’ feature\n► Select and create a list of preferred currencies for fast access\n\n\n==Easy to use interface==\neCurrency interface is designed for ease of use. Just start the application and type in the amount you want to convert and eCurrency converts instantly. Tap on one of the flags to change the currency you want to convert to. A built-in calculator allows for math calculations. The current exchange rate and rate change compared to the previous day is conveniently displayed in the main interface.\n\n==Favorites Support==\neCurrency supports over 200 currencies. The “Favorites” functionality allows you to define the currency pairs you use as favorites. To create a new favorite go into the “Settings” and touch the “+” Button. You can swipe through all your favorites on the main calculation interface just as you swipe the pages on the iPhone’s home screen.\n\n== Charts and Historic Rates==\neCurrency provides detailed historical charts for all exchange rates.

The application obtains its exchange rates from our self-developed Currency-Provider-engine that aggregates rates data from multiple sources to secure the reliability of exchange rate updates.\n\n== Tutorial & Support==\nOn the first startup a short self-running demo is displayed to introduce you to the app. We appreciate any reviews or comments you may have on eCurrency in iTunes. If you have any questions please contact us directly, as we are unable to respond to your enquiries via iTunes."

It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 900 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 900+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

In map view, you can tap any wifi icon where wireless information is available, and use the button to copy the password to the clipboard. The map is available offline so you don’t need an Internet connection to use WiFox when you’re traveling.\n\n*Click Copy to easily paste passwords into wireless network settings.\n\n*Users can also add passwords they find from airports around the world. Those passwords are then sent to foXnoMad for verification and approval before they are added to the map.\n\n*In ‘List View’ you can update passwords for airports already added (when you’ve noticed some changes). As you travel you can also rate the wireless hotspot information to let us know if the details worked for you or not. Based on traveler feedback, the connection information is updated, verified, or removed.\n\n*WiFox icons indicate how fresh, reliable, and highly rated a given airport wireless network’s information is.\n\n*WiFox is updated continuously with information travelers, pilots, and other users send through the WiFox app, foXnoMad website, and foXnoMad Facebook and Twitter accounts. WiFox currently has wireless Internet information for over 700 airports around the world.\n\n*The map is updated automatically upon opening the app (when you have Internet access) or by clicking the ‘Update’ button on the map or refresh icon on the List View.\n\n*WiFox also protects users on free (open) wifi networks by telling you the proper network name, so you don't unintentionally connect to a rogue or malicious access point.\n\nWiFox Premium subscriptions unlock the following features:\n\n* Automatic notifications of the highest rated password, with network connection information, as soon as you land. WiFox Premium detects the airport you're at and displays the most relevant wifi network name and password so you can get online as soon as you step off the plane.\n\n* View password ratings to see which passwords work best throughout an airport so you can connect to the strongest and most reliable connection.\n\n* Be able to add your own password ratings within WiFox. Premium user priority ratings ensure the best wifi passwords are always displayed.\n\nAfter a 30-day free trial period a $24.99/year purchase will be applied to your iTunes account following confirmation of a Premium upgrade. Subscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can cancel anytime with your iTunes account settings. Any unused portion of a free trial will be forfeited if you purchase a subscription.

Am I Going Down? will tell you how and why you have only a millions-to-one chance of crashing, allowing you to fight fear with information.  \n\nNew York Times\n“In most cases a normal flight will give you a one in five million, or one in 10 million, chance of crashing, so that tends to reassure most people.”\n\nThe Economist\n\"[The app] wants to reassure nervous flyers that they are all but guaranteed to reach their destination in one piece.\"\n\nDaily Mail\n\"'Am I Going Down?' app uses real flight statistics to analyse flight safety.\"\n\nBustle\n\"One of the only sources providing such in-depth coverage of safety statistics in the aviation world.\"\n\nAlso featured in: CNN, Washington Post, Daily Telegraph, Quartz, Forbes, Newsweek, Gizmodo, Business Insider, Gadget Show, and many more! \n\n—\nDisclaimer: While \"Am I Going Down?\" is based on published flight and crash statistics to give an indication of flight safety, the app is intended for entertainment purposes only. The odds presented are an estimate of historical risk and not a prediction of future performance. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact info@vanillapixel.com or follow @fearofflyingapp on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram."

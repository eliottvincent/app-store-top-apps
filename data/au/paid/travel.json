      "label": "Take this guide with you when riding the Munda Biddi Trail. It has all the information you need to both navigate and prepare for the Trail. It's built by local Western Australians who have ridden the Trail several times and LOVE bike packing!\r\n\r\nThe guide works 100% without needing mobile phone reception or Internet access. The offline maps are very detailed, show the Munda Biddi Trail, show where you are via GPS, and are marked up with huts, camping areas, places to get water, alternative accommodation and many points of interest. The App map shows you how many kilometres you are from places like huts and towns, and has an interactive elevation graph so you can see what hills are between you and places. \r\n\r\nThe App has advice on how to prepare for your trip, what gear to bring, what bike to ride and suitable food. It's a complete \"how to do the trail\" guide. It has many other features, photos and information, as described below.\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n- Very detailed offline maps. They ALWAYS work, even when mobile phone coverage and Internet are not available.\r\n- The map is tuned to look great on a small phone screen and show details that a cyclist in the bush needs. You'll see details such as minor tracks and trails at zoom levels where most other maps hide them. So zoom out and tracks don't disappear from your map! This makes following trail redirections easy. And getting back to the trail if you lose it becomes trivial. Great for your safety and easier for you to navigate even with a tiny screen.\r\n-  Uses GPS to show your location on the map.\r\n- The map has extra markers for huts, towns, camping areas, places where you can get food, attractions, swimming spots and other points of interest.\r\n- Tap places on the map and be shown your distance from them along the track. See how far away that hut is!\r\n- An elevation graph that you can zoom-and-swipe to see all the hills and valleys along the trail. \r\n- The elevation graph shows your location and markers for towns, huts and other places. Do I have to ride up any big hills to get to that hut?\r\n- Tap hut, town, camping and other markers on the map to get detailed information and photographs for those places.\r\n- Includes a map showing places where you can get drinking water. And a map showing toilets along the trail.\r\n- Has descriptions and pictures of each section of the Trail.\r\n- Provides detailed information on paid accommodation options outside towns. For those who want a bit more luxury than camping!\r\n- Has a trail overview, and information about the huts, drinking water, safety, weather, animals and history of the Munda Biddi Trail.\r\n- Detailed advice and information on how to train for a multi-day trip, choosing a bike, when to ride, what gear you need and suitable food.\r\n- Shows bike shops and other places that can supply bike parts or fix problems.\r\n- Describes transportation options such as buses and companies that provide shuttle services.\r\n- No mobile phone coverage or internet is needed for the App to work. Put your phone in Airplane Mode to save battery power and continue to use the App (your phone's GPS will still work in Airplane Mode).\r\n- The App turns off GPS when the screen is turned off, so will not use phone power when you are not using it.\r\n- The guide has loads of beautiful photographs of the Trail to inspire you!\r\n\r\nYou should never get lost because the maps always work and show you where you are, even when you stray from the Trail. The great detail on the maps make it easy to follow bush tracks and paths to get back to the Trail.\r\n\r\nThis App was built by a small Western Australian software company. We've ridden the Trail and have extensive bike packing experience. We're confident our Munda Biddi Trail Guide App will make your trip easier to plan, safer and more fun.\r\n\r\nA portion of the earnings from this App are given to the Munda Biddi Trail Foundation."

The application obtains its exchange rates from our self-developed Currency-Provider-engine that aggregates rates data from multiple sources to secure the reliability of exchange rate updates.\n\n== Tutorial & Support==\nOn the first startup a short self-running demo is displayed to introduce you to the app. We appreciate any reviews or comments you may have on eCurrency in iTunes. If you have any questions please contact us directly, as we are unable to respond to your enquiries via iTunes."

      "label": "This comprehensive guide shows you all you need to know to hike the Cape to Cape Track, which runs from Cape Naturaliste to Cape Leeuwin in the Margaret River Region of Western Australia.\n\nThis App has many innovative features that make it way more useful than a paper guidebook or a website!\n\nThe Cape to Cape Track is one of the best kept secrets in the world. If you have a chance to walk the Track, you will not be disappointed!\n\nThe App has beautiful photographs, extremely detailed information, built-in maps and GPS support. So you cannot get lost and will not miss anything.\n\nNO INTERNET OR MOBILE COVERAGE IS NEEDED to use this guide. This is very important because most of the track has no internet or mobile coverage. The excellent maps work without using any data, WiFi connection, or internet. So it's fast and won't cost you money. \n\nIt's very interactive; turn on your phone or tablet's GPS from within the App, then follow the track and you will never get lost again! Also see exactly where to park to take shorter day hikes, where to get water and food, and where the best sights, beaches and attractions are. Note that GPS works everywhere - you don't need mobile network reception for it to work.\n\nEach map is marked up to show you viewpoints, attractions, toilets, places to get water, the best beaches, where to camp and more. Tap any map marker to show much more information about that place.\n\nIt's like having your own personal tour guide in your pocket that is showing you exactly where to turn at those unmarked crossroads, and it can be quickly referenced to show you the name of the beach or town you are on or in. It is easier than using a paper guide book or a paper map and compass because you can instantly see where you are.\n\nWe suggest which way you should walk the track and give you the distances between campsites or paid (comfy!) accommodation to help you in planning your hike. \n\nFEATURES:\n- We describe beaches, sights, camping, accommodation and more\n- We give you lots of useful General Information to help you make your hike enjoyable and safe\n- We include a number of useful first-aid tips for the most common issues you may encounter on the Track\n- The guide has loads of beautiful photographs of the Track to inspire you!\n- It has detailed maps of hiking trails. With the phone's GPS enabled you cannot get lost!\n- It works without the internet. So there are no data roaming charges. And mobile black spots will not stop the App from working (unlike websites and most other Apps)\n- It uses very high-resolution maps\n- It describes several other hiking tracks and day walks nearby the Cape to Cape track.\n- All information has been researched and written by a local of the Margaret River region\n- Information is presented relative to your current location, so its very easy to find where you are and how far it is to your next camping area or town for that cold beer or chilled glass of white wine\n- Has a useful search feature. For example, search for \"shower\" to list everything in the App that uses that text\n- Quick reference entries show you all of the water sources and the locations of toilets along the track. Activate the GPS to show you how far to your next one\n- The guide is simple to use\n- This App automatically keeps it's content up to date by periodically downloading updates from \"the cloud\". You don't have to do anything to make this happen."

It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 900 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 900+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

Includes rest areas, truck stops, KOAs, campgrounds and more.\n\nDump station locations are displayed even when offline!\n\nDump station information is obtained from crowdsourcing and are therefore subjective in nature. What one person describes as working another may describe as broken.\n\nFeatures:\n- Location database is included with the app, so all locations are visible when offline.\n- Filter what type of location to display. List only free dump stations from the filter.\n- Show a route between your location and the selected RV dump station.\n- View the dump stations in list view; easily search the list.\n- Get the local weather for the location.\n- Internet searches and more for each location.\n- Import routes from GPX files.  This makes it much easier to find RV dump stations along a route you've created in another app such as Road Trip Planner.\n- Send a dump station location to our app Road Trip Planner.  This helps in routing your travels (requires separate purchase of the Road Trip Planner app).\n\nWe want to expand our RV dump station database as much as possible, so we have made it easy for you to easily submit a new RV dump station - simply tap the + button below the map.  To correct or update dump station information, tap “Location Comment” in the detail view. We will be updating the database often.\n\nDue to the nature of dump stations constantly changing their status it's recommended you contact the dump station prior to using it to verify its existence."

      "label": "No account necessary.  No hidden costs.  All updates are free.\n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Portugués and its three most common variations; the Central Route, the Coastal Route, and the Variante Espiritual. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 400 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

      "label": "Welcome to KrugerExplorer – the all-in-one encyclopedia to Kruger National Park.\n\nWhether you are planning your South African safari, need the perfect companion guide for your self-drive Kruger experience, or simply want to explore Kruger from the comfort of home, you will find everything you need in the KrugerExplorer App.\n\nThis App explores the Greater Kruger in unparalleled detail, and includes:\n- The most extensive Kruger wildlife Field Guide ever created.\n- Guided Routes that share our knowledge of the park’s roads from years of exploring Kruger.\n- The most up-to-date Kruger Maps available, helping you navigate the park’s 3,500km road network including several newly opened roads.\n- Live GPS map with downloadable offline maps so you always know your location.\n- Extensive sections on Kruger’s Rest Camps, Itineraries, Accommodation, plus exclusive Special Offers & Competitions.\n- Thousands of stunning photographic images and audio files to reveal all the beauty of Kruger’s wildlife.\n- And once downloaded, the App works 100% offline – perfect for exploring the Kruger!\n\nThe Field Guide section is unprecedented in its focus on Kruger’s wildlife. It includes over 700 species profiles detailing physical characteristics, behaviours and locations, and each is accompanied by breathtaking photography to aid identification. The 700+ species profiles cover:\n- All 148 mammal species ever recorded in Kruger, including the best places to find them.\n- Over 60 footprint graphics so you can identify wildlife spoor.\n- 500+ bird species, including all of Kruger’s resident, migrant visitor and vagrant records since 2010. Stunning bird photography includes male, female, juvenile and breeding plumage where relevant.\n- Over 500 bird audio files bring the sounds of the bush to life.\n- 60+ profiles of commonly encountered reptiles and invertebrates, including crocodiles, snakes, lizards, tortoises, butterflies, spiders & much more.\n\nThe Guided Routes use our experience from many years exploring Kruger to create 70+ incredible journeys through the park:\n- The routes are like having an in-person guide in your pocket. Each includes extensive commentary that doesn’t just say, “Take that road because it’s good for lions,” but instead explains the geology of each area, which in turn informs the flora that grows there, the herbivores that eat that flora and, ultimately, the predators that hunt those herbivores.\n- Each route will help you develop an intimate insight into Kruger’s incredible wilderness.\n- Each of the rest camps and entrance gates is covered with short, medium and full-day routes to explore.\n\nThe Maps are the most detailed and up-to-date available:\n- They include newly opened roads and correct errors found in the maps available in the park shops. \n- For first-time visitors to Kruger, note that you are not provided with a map and must buy one from a park shop at a cost similar to this App.\n- The live GPS map means you'll never get lost.\n\nWith over half a million words of content, KrugerExplorer is the most comprehensive and unparalleled encyclopedia for the Greater Kruger ever created.\n\nSince launching in 2019, the App has had a superb reception from fans and received wonderful accolades:\n- Downloads in over 80 countries\n- App Store “App of the Day”\n- “Recommended” commendation by BirdLife South Africa\n- “Highly Recommended” by Getaway Magazine\n\nKrugerExplorer is also a global community of wildlife lovers. You can enjoy the stories, photos and experiences of our 200,000+ followers on Facebook & Instagram. We look forward to seeing you there!\n\nFrequently asked questions:\n- Yes, the App works 100% offline once fully downloaded. You can put your device into flight mode, escape to the bush and still make full use of the App!\n- Yes, this App is a one-time purchase, with no further in-app purchases or ongoing subscriptions required.\n- This is an English language app.\n\nHappy exploring,\nDanny & Charlotte"

      "label": "This GPS Tour Guide caters to the YOUNG and YOUNG AT HEART who like hiking, swimming in the pools of waterfalls, and ADVENTURE.  Other Hana tour guide apps \"must stops\" are almost all scenic views.  Scenic views are great and we tell you about those too, but we also tell you about hidden waterfalls, swimming holes, waterfalls upstream that you wouldn't know about without the tour.  This audio tour is also for those who like to plan ahead.  This PREMIRE app includes description, multiple pictures, and map for EVERY attraction as well as GPS commentary that plays automatically as you drive for EVERY attraction.  This app is designed to educate and inform you about Maui history and facts and guide you along the Road to Hana.  You can customize your tour and be notified when a stop has your interests.  Works with iPhone, iPad and iPod.  Check out our screen shots and see for yourself.\n\nThe Road to Hana is one of the top rated activities on Maui.  When you purchase this app, for each attraction you will receive-\n\nA personal tour guide telling you about upcoming attractions, hidden falls, unknown hikes, and Maui history and culture\nMultiple pictures of each attraction\nDescription of the stop\nMap showing each stop and where you are in relation to the stop\nThe ability to customize your interests and be notified when you are at a location with your interests\nA rating for each attraction\nAutomatic GPS audio that will begin as you near each location, as well as the ability to start it on their own for those without GPS\nThe ability to replay the audio if you missed something\nThe ability to read along with the audio as it plays\nThe amount of time you can expect to spend at each location\nMile marker of each attraction\nA chime that will go off when you are at one of the attractions so you will never be wondering where the stop is\n\nOne mistake people make as they travel the Road to Hana is to try and read a book telling them about the sights.  Unfortunately, the combination of reading and this winding road makes for a miserable time with carsickness.  When you buy this app, you will be able to sit back and enjoy your travels as you listen to the commentary about the beaches, waterfalls, hikes, history, and interesting facts about Maui.  You also have the option to look ahead and view the pictures and read the descriptions to see which attractions look most interesting to you.  As you begin your tour you will also be given the opportunity to select your interests.  The tour guide will inform you as you reach an attraction with your interests.  \n\nDon’t have GPS?  No worries.  If you are using and iPod or iPad without GPS, you will still be able to enjoy the tour, you will just have to play the information manually as you travel.  Fortunately, each location information page has the mile marker, so you will know when you are getting close to a particular attraction and can play the audio\n\nIt is recommended to bring a phone charger with you.  Though you will not be using cellular service or have data charges, you’re phone will be constantly searching for a GPS signal and thus wear out the battery quickly.  If you don’t have one, try to pick one up at the Walmart or Kmart in Kahului before you leave.  Try to get on the road by 7:00 to avoid the heavy crowds and have the whole day to spend seeing the sights.  Have a fun and safe trip.  Mahalo!\n\nPlease visit http://www.GuideMetravel.com for more information."

      "label": "Love exploring Joshua Tree but hate that you can't get a cell signal in the park, making it nearly impossible to find the best sights? Well, today's your lucky day!\n\nIntroducing our new offline Joshua Tree National Park (and surrounding areas) photo guide. Now you can get all the great photos, content, and exact locations that you already love in Fotospot, but with one big difference - offline maps! When you have a working WiFi connection, simply download our offline guide to your device and, like magic, the app will now work when you don't have an internet connection. You'll be able to check in, save attractions for later, add new photos, and - best of all - find the exact locations of all the coolest Joshua Tree spots including Heart Rock, Lost Horse Mine, Barker Dam, and Skull Rock - all without having a working cell signal!\n\nPlease note, some of these attractions can be found in our flagship app, Fotospot, but with two huge differences:\n\n1. Exclusive Content \nSome of the coolest (and hardest to find) attractions can only be found here like the Iron Door Cave, Penguin Rock, Eagle Cliff Boulder House, Samuelson Rocks, the Freak Brothers, and Garrett's Arch (the largest arch in the park!), plus a ton more.\n\n2. Offline Maps\nUnlike Fotospot, our Joshua Tree photo guide works even when you don't have a working cell signal (and that's basically the entire park).\n\nOne-time payment:\nWe don't have any upsells, in-app purchases, or subscriptions in this app, so for a simple one-time purchase, all of this can be yours for life. Plus, you'll automatically get any new future attractions we add to the app for FREE!\n\nLeave no trace:\nWhen visiting any attraction (in our app or not) please be responsible and leave it exactly how you found it. Take only photos and leave only footprints. To learn more please visit LNT.org.\n\nHappy exploring,\nThe Fotospot Team\n\n#fotospotting\n#fotospotapp"

The map is available offline so you don’t need an Internet connection to use WiFox when you’re traveling.\n\n*Click Copy to easily paste passwords into wireless network settings.\n\n*Users can also add passwords they find from airports around the world. Those passwords are then sent to foXnoMad for verification and approval before they are added to the map.\n\n*In ‘List View’ you can update passwords for airports already added (when you’ve noticed some changes). As you travel you can also rate the wireless hotspot information to let us know if the details worked for you or not. Based on traveler feedback, the connection information is updated, verified, or removed.\n\n*WiFox icons indicate how fresh, reliable, and highly rated a given airport wireless network’s information is.\n\n*WiFox is updated continuously with information travelers, pilots, and other users send through the WiFox app, foXnoMad website, and foXnoMad Facebook and Twitter accounts. WiFox currently has wireless Internet information for over 700 airports around the world.\n\n*The map is updated automatically upon opening the app (when you have Internet access) or by clicking the ‘Update’ button on the map or refresh icon on the List View.\n\n*WiFox also protects users on free (open) wifi networks by telling you the proper network name, so you don't unintentionally connect to a rogue or malicious access point.\n\nWiFox Premium subscriptions unlock the following features:\n\n* Automatic notifications of the highest rated password, with network connection information, as soon as you land. WiFox Premium detects the airport you're at and displays the most relevant wifi network name and password so you can get online as soon as you step off the plane.\n\n* View password ratings to see which passwords work best throughout an airport so you can connect to the strongest and most reliable connection.\n\n* Be able to add your own password ratings within WiFox. Premium user priority ratings ensure the best wifi passwords are always displayed.\n\nAfter a 30-day free trial period a $24.99/year purchase will be applied to your iTunes account following confirmation of a Premium upgrade. Subscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can cancel anytime with your iTunes account settings.

Enter your flight details, and using real flight data, the app perfectly demonstrates the unlikelihood of your flight going down.\n\nHow safe is your next flight? \n\nCrashes may make the headlines, but they’re incredibly rare, and when they do happen, seldom lead to injury. With those facts, there’s no need for nervous flyers to fall back on anything but the statistics. Am I Going Down? will tell you how and why you have only a millions-to-one chance of crashing, allowing you to fight fear with information.  \n\nNew York Times\n“In most cases a normal flight will give you a one in five million, or one in 10 million, chance of crashing, so that tends to reassure most people.”\n\nThe Economist\n\"[The app] wants to reassure nervous flyers that they are all but guaranteed to reach their destination in one piece.\"\n\nDaily Mail\n\"'Am I Going Down?' app uses real flight statistics to analyse flight safety.\"\n\nBustle\n\"One of the only sources providing such in-depth coverage of safety statistics in the aviation world.\"\n\nAlso featured in: CNN, Washington Post, Daily Telegraph, Quartz, Forbes, Newsweek, Gizmodo, Business Insider, Gadget Show, and many more! \n\n—\nDisclaimer: While \"Am I Going Down?\" is based on published flight and crash statistics to give an indication of flight safety, the app is intended for entertainment purposes only.

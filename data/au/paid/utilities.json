Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here. Chromecast is a trademark of Google LLC."

Within seconds Antenna Mate will accurately* point to the direction of your best** TV reception from anywhere in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. Antenna Mate is used by professional installers, caravaners, and DIYers from city and country areas.\n\nWE HAVE GOT YOU COVERED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM\n\n* 1,151 broadcasting sites.\n* 3,698 digital transmitters.\n* All cities and towns in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands where digital terrestrial television is available*****\n\nWE HAVE GOT YOU COVERED IN AUSTRALIA\n\n* 597 broadcasting sites.\n* 2,841 digital transmitters.\n* All cities and towns in QLD, NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, SA, WA and NT where digital terrestrial television is available***\n\nWE HAVE GOT YOU COVERED IN NEW ZEALAND\n\n* 35 broadcasting sites.\n* 344 transmitters\n* All cities and towns in the North and South Islands where digital terrestrial television is available****\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nUsing your current location, your device's compass, and the target site's effective radiated power, Antenna Mate instantly estimates the signal strength of all nearby sites and automatically plots a bearing to the best one**.\n\nUnder normal circumstances you should get an initial result within seconds. The longer you leave Antenna Mate open, the more accurate it will become. For best results use Antenna Mate outside in an open space and away from objects which cause interference.\n\nAntenna Mate doesn't need an internet connection, that's one of the reasons why it's so fast.\n\nDETAILED TRANSMITTER INFO\n\nComplete listings of all digital terrestrial transmitters are available at each site. Listings include the callsign, frequency (MHz), channel, polarisation, and effective radiated power (kW).\n\nALL SITES BY STRENGTH OR DISTANCE\n\nPrefer to align your TV antenna with another broadcasting site? No worries! Sites can be listed from strongest to weakest, or closest to furthest away. Pick any site from the list and Antenna Mate instantly plots a new bearing to the targeted site.\n\nUsing an amplifier or high gain antenna? You can increase the search radius up to 200 km (120 mi) from your current location.\n\nLIGHT AND DARK DISPLAY SWITCHING\n\nWhen your device is in direct sunlight Antenna Mate will automatically switch to a light display making the arrow easy to see. Perfect for performing an alignment during the middle of the day.\n\nUSE IT UPSIDE DOWN, OR THE RIGHT WAY UP\n\nAntenna Mate is smart enough to know when your device is being held upside down, or the right way up. Either way, it will always point to the targeted site.\n\nSUPPORT AND FEEDBACK\n\nWe would love to hear your feedback or help you troubleshoot. Send an e-mail to support@antennamate.com or tweet @antennamate. Follow us on Twitter to get notified when transmitter data is updated.\n\n* Time taken to find best broadcasting site and directional accuracy will vary based on device and external environmental factors.\n\n** Best broadcasting site is measured by estimating maximum theoretical field strength in free space (No obstructions or reflections). Actual field strength will be lower. Closest broadcasting site is measured by estimating distance using line of sight. Distance is only an approximation.\n\n*** Based on Australian Communications and Media Authority data.\n\n**** Based on Radio Spectrum Management and OpenStreetMap data.\n\n***** Based on Ofcom data."

      "label": "Necrophonic is an ITC app used for spirit communication and EVP research.\n\n8 Sounds Banks:\n\nThe audio has been mastered in a way to bring out various sound properties . \nUsing Pro Tools I was able to enhance high, mid, and low range frequencies. I also applied \nother filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an \nenvironment suitable for spirit communication.\n\nThe audio itself is made up of phonemes, \npartial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help \nspirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.\nthere are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.\n\nThese sounds banks play in a similar\nway to that of my other app \"Spiritus Ghost Box\" but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has\n8 active sound banks.\n\nWhite Noise Sound Bank:\n\nThis app also has an optional 9th sound bank called \"White noise\". \nThis bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This \naudio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the \n\"Holy Grail\" of EVP recorders. This is not a White Noise Generator, this is a normal sound bank like the others but this one contains white noise from the DR60.\n\nAudio Effects:\n\nThis app does contain Echo and Reverb audio effects. These have been proven \nto be the best effects to apply to ITC sessions. The echo can create audio that can be \nmanipulated within the echo itself. Echo can also help in live, real time communication by \nrepeating the audio and allowing you to better hear whats coming through. Reverb can be \napplied to the audio to create a spacious sound environment that will enhance audio manipulation."

      "label": "Noir is a Safari extension that automatically adds a dark mode to every website you visit.\n\nIt makes browsing the web at night so much better. With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.\n\nAnd the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it is – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop. And with over 20 built-in themes and the ability to create your own, you can customize the results exactly the way you want.\n\nNoir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!\n\nBuilt from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Focus Filters and Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows. And your settings are automatically synced to all your devices using iCloud.\n\nAnd just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data. Period.\n\nNoir is made by a solo iOS developer. It does not include any subscriptions or ads. Buy Noir once, use it forever.\n\nNotes:\n• Found a website where Noir’s dark mode doesn’t look just right? Let me know by reporting it. The app will be frequently updated to address issues that are reported.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\n• The Noir extension requires access to the websites you visit to analyze the existing style of the page and to override it with Noir's dark style.\n• Noir never collects your browsing data. The only data Noir ‘collects’ are your settings, and those will never leave your device.\n• You can read Noir’s full Privacy Policy at https://getnoir.app/privacypolicy"

Huh?\n\nBlood Alcohol Content, or BAC, refers to the percentage of alcohol in a person's bloodstream, and can be measured within 30-70 minutes after drinking. Contrary to popular belief, nothing can lower BAC except time; coffee, cold showers, and chugging glasses of water will not help you sober up any faster. \n\nProduct vision\n\nCurious what your BAC might be? You'll be able to use this app to estimate, but don't forget that everyone metabolizes alcohol (beer, wine, liquor) differently. Our calculator can give you an approximate BAC level, but do not rely upon it to determine if you're fit to drive or work.\n\nI deeply believe this tool could really help people make smarter choices. It'll be a constant reminder of the dangers of drunk driving and the price they'll have to pay in the eventuality of being convicted."

Maintaining husbandry tasks, testing, stability, water changes, inhabitant stats etc. are all vital to keeping successful aquariums. \n\nPocket Marine was designed to make inputting, storing and keeping all information with you at ease. Often, any issues that we have with our aquariums can be linked to actions that were performed a short time beforehand. For this reason, a log of changes made, actions performed or additions can be vital when trying to decipher a problem that may be in play. Pen and paper has always been a great way to keep this information at hand but, Pocket Marine offers a place to store this somewhere that, this day and age, is with us at all times.\n\nNot just for tracking events. Pocket Marine is a great way to help you log your inhabitants into specific tanks, record your latest water change for your mixed reef tank or simply log your latest maintenance action performed on the fish only office tank. Recording your information couldnt be easier and keeping it on your mobile device saves on that frantic search incase of needing the information at a later date.\n\nHelp with that last second impulse buy at the store. With an in depth library of over 800 species of fish, invertebrates and coral and being added to daily, you will always have the information on hand that you need to make that informed decision on a purchase. \n\nWe hope you enjoy using the app and that we can help with your success in the hobby and welcome any feature requests you may have.\n\nHappy Reefing!"

      "label": "StopTheMadness is a Safari extension that stops web sites from making your browser harder to use. And it protects your privacy on the web. StopTheMadness is not an ad blocker: it offers unique features not available from ad blockers or any other apps. StopTheMadness is one of a kind!\n\nMade by indie developer Jeff Johnson. The support link has documentation and my email address.\n\nMany web sites deliberately disable user interface features in Safari that you normally expect to work. StopTheMadness re-enables those features for you in Safari:\n• opening contextual menus\n• selecting, copying, cutting, and pasting of text\n• drag and drop\n• AutoFill/autocomplete of passwords, emails, etc.\n\nStopTheMadness also protects your privacy on the web:\n• Stops Google AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages)! Automatically loads the original \"canonical\" web site page instead of Google AMP.\n• Removes tracking tags such as utm_source, gclid, and fbclid from the end of URLs.\n• Stops clickjacking in Google Search, Gmail, Facebook, and DuckDuckGo.\n• Stops hyperlink auditing (anchor \"ping\").\n• Stops tracking beacons (Navigator.sendBeacon).\n• Stops sites from using the Page Visibility API to know when a tab is visible on your screen.\n• Stops URL shorteners. Checks the links you click in Safari for well-known link shorteners — bit.ly, tinyurl.com, l.facebook.com, t.co, etc. — and loads the unshortened destination URL instead of the shortened URL. This occurs without setting any cookies or other site data, so you can't be tracked by your click.\n\nBonus Features:\n• Stop videos from autoplaying. This works even on sites where Safari doesn't stop autoplay, such as YouTube. And YouTube video ads are automatically skipped! Also stops videos from following you down the page when you scroll on many sites.\n• Stop sites in Safari from pausing your audio in a background app such as Apple Music.\n• Show native video controls. Use Picture-in-Picture from Safari on sites that don't normally support it, including YouTube!\n• Automatically select the highest video quality on YouTube!\n• Hides the annoying popup banners prompting you to get the app on Google, Google Maps, DuckDuckGo, IMDb, Instagram, Quora, Reddit, and Tumblr!\n• Add your own site-specific CSS and JavaScript to web pages!\n• Custom URL redirects! Redirect new Reddit to old Reddit, Twitter to Nitter, YouTube to Invidious, etc. You can create any redirect that you want!\n• Stop keyboard page zoom. Stops the page from zooming in when you show the software keyboard!\n• Enable pinch-to-zoom on sites that prevent it, such as old reddit.\n• Stops \"Are you sure you want to leave this page?\" alerts. Close your tabs without getting stopped by the site!\n• Force external links to open in the current tab instead of a new tab. Remove target=\"_blank\" from links so that they no longer automatically create a new tab.\n• Force external links to open in a new tab instead of the current tab. This is great if you're scrolling through a list of links and want to open each one in a new tab.\n• Force images to the front. Bypass the transparent overlay on sites such as Instagram that prevents you from dragging and opening the contextual menu on images.\n• Warns when you paste or type beyond the maximum length in a password field or other text field. Stops you from accidentally losing characters!"

It can also alert people that you are monitoring the device, discouraging any malicious access.  \n\nNo one can access your device without the password. But...\n\nWhat happens if your sneaky colleague or friend peeks while you type it in? \nWhat if your partner or parents simply demand it? (\"Why don't you give me your password, are you hiding something?\".... does this sound familiar?). \nWhat if someone uses your fingerprint to unlock your device while you sleep? (yeah, it has happened, check the press).\n\nThey would have access to your entire life: pictures, videos, contacts, whatsapp conversations, facebook chats, emails (which mean access to any of your online accounts via password reset), etc.\nThey might even install malware to spy on you remotely!\n\nTHE WORST PART IS YOU WILL NEVER KNOW THAT SOMEONE HAD ACCESS TO YOUR DEVICE. \nThat you need to change your password. That a tracking virus is running on your device. That you have to alert your bank. That your competitor has stolen your confidential data.

With Number Shield, block an entire group of numbers at once.  Just enter a wildcard for each digit you want to block.\n\nFor example, if your number is 714-555-1234, scammers might use a number like 714-555-6789.  Block all similar numbers by entering 714-555-####.  Wildcards and numbers can be combined in any order you choose.  Block international numbers, too!\n\nUse the \"Allow Contacts\" option to make sure you don't miss calls from your family and friends.\n\nBlock numbers directly from your phone's missed calls screen.  Just follow these steps:\n\n1. Tap the “ i ” button next to the missed call.\n2. Tap “Share Contact”.\n3. Tap “Block Similar Numbers”.  (If you don't see this action, tap “Edit Actions...“ to enable it.)\n4. Now you'll see the Number Shield number entry screen.  Tap “Done” to block calls from similar numbers.\n\nPlease note:\n\n• Each number pattern can contain up to 7 wildcards, and up to 50,000,000 phone numbers can be blocked.\n• Blocked calls are sent directly to voice mail.\n• Blocked text messages are sent to the “Junk” filter in the Messages app.\n• iMessage messages are not blocked.\n• When “Do Not Disturb” is enabled on your phone, calls that should be blocked may appear in your phone's list of missed calls.\n\nMore information about caller ID spoofing in the United States is available from the FCC:\n\nhttps://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/spoofing-and-caller-id"

      "label": "iCab Mobile is a web browser for the iOS. It provides many unique and useful features you won't find in other iPhone browsers.\n\nAPPLE WATCH:\nThe Watch App is a remote control for iCab Mobile, so you can navigate, zoom, scroll, open bookmarks, links, the homepage, switch tabs or sitch on/off the fullscreen mode. Since watchOS 6.2 you can also open web pages and browse the Web directly on the Apple Watch. But there are a few limitations: The watchOS will always show a privacy warning when starting a browsing session and there are no navigation buttons (back/forward) available.\n\nFILE UPLOADS:\niCab Mobile can upload any files on web pages.\n\nSEARCHING:\niCab Mobile comes with several default search engines you can choose from. You can easily add new search engines. \n\nFILLING OUT FORMS:\niCab Mobile can save web forms and restore the form content later (manually or automatically). The saved forms data can be password protected. Supports many third-party Password Manager Apps as well.\n\nFILTERS:\nThere’s a built-in fully customizable filter feature. It allows to block resources, ads, banners, user tracking scripts, cookies etc. Supports AdBlock Plus/EasyList filters as well.\n\nTABS:\niCab Mobile supports Tabs, so you can open multiple web pages at the same time. Links can be opened in Tabs (in the foreground or background) manually or automatically. \n\nBOOKMARKS:\nBookmarks can be organized in folders.

No screen space is wasted for toolbars. \n\nDOWNLOADS:\niCab Mobile has a built-in Download Manager so you can download almost all files from the internet. The downloads can be easily transfered to a Mac/PC/Linux computer but also to other Apps on the device which can open these files\n\nMULTIUSER SUPPORT\nYou can create multiple user accounts, each user has its own private bookmarks, filters, settings, etc.\n\nDROPBOX\niCab Mobile supports Dropbox. Export/Import bookmarks; transfer downloads, images, files, web pages to your Dropbox account.\n\nTWIN BROWSER:\nIn this mode, you can have two browsers side by side on the iPad. This is especially useful on the large iPad Pro.\n\nVOICEOVER\nThe App is also accessible for visually impaired and blind users. If VoiceOver is enabled, the App plays soft ticks while a page is loading, so blind users are able to identify when the page load has finished. \n\nOTHER FEATURE:\n- Configurable multi-touch gestures\n- QuickStarter feature\n- AirPrint support \n- Browser ID (UserAgent) is configurable\n- iCab Mobile fully supports international domain names\n- Cookie Manager\n- Private Browsing (no history and no cookies are stored)\n- Privacy settings allows to delete all kinds of private data (history, cookies, databases, saved forms, passwords etc.)\n- URL autocompletion \n- Simple built-in RSS reader\n- Save images, whole web pages, PDF files\n- Kiosk Mode - a restricted variation of the fullscreen mode for Kiosk environments. \n- History\n- Addressbook support lets you access the web pages from the addressbook. \n- When launching iCab can either open an empty page, the homepage or restore the Tabs which were open the last time\n- There are different color schemes and designs\n- Document Sharing lets you pass downloads and files to other Apps in the device\n\n\n\nThe App includes a store providing several InApp purchases. These are meant as a tip jar. The InApp purchases are available for different prices, so you can pick the amount for the tip yourself. Doing so will unlock a few cool features as a reward, these are always the same, regardless of the amount of the tip. Users who have purchased the App within the last 12 months do get all these features for free, no need to buy one of the InApp purchases. Though they can nevertheless give me a tip, if they want to... ;-)"

Plus it's easy and intuitive to use, with no need for WiFi or Internet connectivity.  \n \n\nKey Features\n\n•  Allows the accurate setting and matching of critical speaker angles for optimum sound quality.\n\n•  As you adjust a speaker in the room, on-screen speaker icons move and continuously update to display the current speaker angle.\n\n•  Onscreen number boxes change color to let you know when left and right speaker toe-in angles are identical.  \n\n•  Includes user guide that can be printed or shared. \n\n•  Projects are automatically saved as you work and can be freely renamed and recalled. \n\nTo use SpeakerAngle, simply create a stereo or surround sound project and name it. Then adjust your speakers so they are facing straight ahead. Place your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch on top of one of the speakers and press the corresponding onscreen icon, then rotate that speaker towards the listening position. \n\nAs you do so, SpeakerAngle's onscreen display shows you the angle, using red-green color coding to guide you through a range of recommended angles. Next, do the same for the paired speaker in your system until its icon's number box becomes yellow in color, indicating that both speakers are identically angled. A handy onscreen Reset button allows you to start from scratch at any time and experiment with different toe-in angles.\n\nWhen you're ready to fine-tune your system, a menu option allows you to purchase our companion app, SpeakerPro, which allows you to take precise distance measurements and receive intelligent toe-in recommendations.

      "label": "NOTE! You phone/tablet MUST have a built in Magnetometer and Accelerometer sensor for the app to work. More info: https://www.laxton.se/ghost-tracker-emf-evp-recorder-app/faq/#info\n\n3-in-1 ghost hunting app developed by Sweden's most popular paranormal investigation team \"LaxTon Ghost Sweden\". More than 30.000 satisfied users have given the app 4.5 out of 5 in average rating.\n\nLaxTon Ghost Sweden has +30 years of combined experience in the paranormal area and more than 100.000 subscribers on their YouTube channel. When developing this application they wanted to select the 3 most useful basic functions used in a ghost hunt.\n\nThe app contains a EMF-scanner, a Motion Detector and a EVP / Voice recorder that will help you to easily detect EMF (Electromagnetic Fields), Motion and EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon). With this tool you will have a much greater chance to succeed with your ghost hunts - a ghost tracker app based on scientific sensors in your smartphone / tablet!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nEMF METER -  ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD DETECTOR / SCANNER\n\nNOTE! The EMF function requires a Magnetometer sensor.\n\nWe are all surrounded by various electrical devices that create natural electromagnetic fields that are affecting us to varying degrees. Some EMF fields, however, lack natural source and these are extra interesting for ghost hunters. Until the day the researchers succeed in presenting scientific evidence for these EMF fields, the phenomenon is paranormal.\n\nThere is a theory within the paranormal society that you can measure EMF that doesn’t have a natural power source and this can be paranormal activity. This EMF meter allows you to measure and view your EMF value and communicate with the help of the light that shows how strong EMF value the tool is capturing. \n\nEasy to use, click the button and scan the area around you.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nMOTION DETECTOR / VIBRATION INDICATOR \n\nNOTE! The motion detector requires an Accelerometer sensor.\n\nSometimes you can feel small bangs and vibrations in the floors, stairs, chairs and tables. Within the paranormal society we try to capture these vibrations. With this motion detector you can easily register all vibrations and collect the data for later use. \n\nEasy to use, just place the device where you want to capture motion and then click the button to start collecting motion data.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nEVP Recorder - Electronic Voice Phenomenon\n\nElectronic voice phenomena - test record voices from the dead. With this tool you can run EVP sessions, save the data and evaluate / listen at a later time. Within the paranormal society, EVP recorders are used to capture voices considered to come from the other side, ghosts, lost souls, spirits, scary demons, or whatever you choose to call the phenomenon.\n\nEasy to use voice recorder - click the button to record and ask questions, then listen through if you managed to capture voices from the other side.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nDISCLAIMER\n\nMeasurements performed by this app are based 100% on data from sensors in your phone / tablet. There are no false indications or sound effects. The results are completely dependent on the quality of your phone / tablet sensors.\n\nWe do not recommend replacing dedicated (and much more expensive) equipment with this app (because that type of equipment has stronger sensors).\n\nBecause the results are not scientifically reviewed, we MUST write this; The app should only be used for entertainment."

      "label": "This professional tool called Clinometer is the most precise (all you can get with some calculations) slope measurement tool for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad using all sides of the device plus the camera. It can be used for simple applications like aligning a frame as well as for more sophisticated fields of applications where an arbitrary slope needs to be measured exactly. Read the reviews (and write your own) for all the applications you find! Thank for all your positive feedback! Please use our support link if you have questions and suggestions, we don't read the iTunes reviews every day!\n\nWith this tool, the slope can be measured by all edges of the device and through the camera. The current features include:\n\n◆ 3 Modes (incl. auto switching): Clinometer mode (auto when holding upright), Camera mode (any direction, manual activation) and Bubble level (smoothly fading in when holding flat).\n\n◆ Relative angles: Besides measuring absolute angles, for every mode you can measure the relative angle between device positions\n\n◆ Advanced two way calibration on all sides: For every 4 sides plus the bubble mode you can calibrate in two steps, which allows you to calibrate exactly even on non-level surfaces. Each direction can be calibrated individually to achieve the optimal precision. \n\n◆ Speech synthesis: The device will speak the current reading, so you don't have to watch the display while measuring/aligning your object.\n\n◆ Five different unit modes: The device can display the slope in degrees (rounded or in tenth of degrees), percentage, rise over run (common for roof slope measurement in :12) and 1V:H (common in engineering)\n\n◆ Dial Rotation: You can smoothly rotate the background dial and thus define which side of the device represents 0° and 90° degrees. \n\n◆ Motion-sensitive Lock feature: Besides the common instant simple tap hold mechanism you can activate the motion-sensitive lock. If activated the device waits for the final lock until you hold your device steady enough for at least 2 seconds. You can set the lock sensitivity between 0.1° and 1.0° degrees. \n\n◆ Peer Mode: Use two devices to measure angles: One as a display, the other as the measurement device that can be attached to the hardware you want to align. \n\n◆ Fullscreen Mode: The full screen mode can be toggled by tapping the center of the screen and by the upper and lower arrows in the center. This prevents you from erroneous inputs while measuring.\n\n◆ Different color schemes: Press the S/C Button to instantly switch the color. The color can be selected differently for the bubble and the clinometer mode. The predefined color sets include day and night color schemes (Black on White, White on Black and Red). \n\n◆ Adjustable Auto-Lock: You can prevent the device from turning into the sleep mode. \n\nAccording to wikipedia: An inclinometer or clinometer is an instrument for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or inclination of an object with respect to gravity. It is also known as a tilt meter, tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. \n\nFor recreational use only. After the calibration it CAN (!) be very accurate especially for the main axis after calibration. The measurement is performed as well as possible (we try our best) by using the three inbuilt accelerometers. \n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! \n\nWe will improve the application long-term. This was the first application of this kind shortly after the opening of the App Store. Since then it is continuously updated and enriched with new features."

See the full list of devices at the bottom of this description.\n\nSEE IN THE DARK\nWith the LiDAR & Infrared Night Vision app, you can use the front camera on devices with FaceID, and the front and back cameras on iPhone 12 Pro, iPad Pro, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max in complete darkness! The front-facing camera will use the infrared sensor in the TrueDepth camera. The rear-facing camera will use the new LiDAR sensor. The LiDAR & Infrared Night Vision app turns the world around you into a depth map, where different colors represent distances from your device.\n\nSCARE YOUR FRIENDS \nTrigger scare-mode and set your friends up for a huge scream.\n\nFor best results, be in complete darkness in a room with space behind you. Explain to your friends how the cool new app shows things around the room you can’t see with the naked eye. Make sure your friend’s face is on the screen, and after 30 seconds, a jump-scare flashes on screen, and captures the terrified face.  \n\nAPPLICATIONS\nSee in the dark without turning on your flashlight\nShow off your new phone capabilities\nScare Your Friends\nMake Your Friends Cry\nShare your friend’s terror with a captured picture or video.\nExplore how LiDAR and infrared technology works\nLearn about depth maps and seeing without light\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nUnlike a regular camera, LiDAR and infrared sensors do not need ambient light.  They both generate their own light, which you cannot see. Therefore, both sensors will work in complete darkness.\n\nOTHER DEVICES\nThis app will work on devices that don’t have LiDAR. It will use the front TrueDepth camera to provide a depth map of yourself and objects behind you. The rear-facing display will not work without an iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro, or iPad Pro (4th Generation).\n\nWorks on any iOS device with FaceID/TrueDepth including: iPhone X, iPhone XS, iphone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro Max, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro Max, iPad Pro (3rd generation), iPad Pro (4th generation), iPad Pro 2021"

      "label": "SpeakerPro is the first app that allows you to precisely measure speaker distances and toe-in angles with your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch. Ideal for audio enthusiasts, home recordists, and professionals alike, SpeakerPro works with any stereo or surround sound system, and with any make or model of speaker. It employs groundbreaking patented technology that enables you to get the most out of your audio system.\n\n\nKey Features:\n\n•\tUse your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch for precise measurement and adjustment of critical speaker-to-listening position and speaker-to-speaker distances.\n\n•\tEasy and intuitive to use.\n\n•\tIntelligently recommends speaker toe-in angles for your particular system's layout with color coding and continuously updated onscreen icons.   \n\n•\tWorks anywhere -- no need for WiFi or Internet connection.\n\n•\tDistance measurements are accurate within fractions of an inch. \n\n•\tTable view shows multiple distance measurements, which can be printed or shared.\n\n•\tReference calibration automatically compensates for latency (delay) in the signal path of the audio system.\n\n•\tProjects are automatically saved and can be renamed and recalled. \n\n•\tIncludes user guide that can be printed or shared. \n\n(Note: Distance measurement requires an appropriate audio cable to connect your device's headphone jack to the inputs of your speaker system.)\n\n\nMeasuring speaker distances and angles with SpeakerPro is easy. Begin by using an appropriate audio cable to connect the headphone output of your device to individual speakers or to your audio system. After taking a simple reference calibration, select the speaker you want to use as the starting point by touching its onscreen icon. Then place your device at the listening position (or next to another speaker) and touch its corresponding onscreen icon. SpeakerPro instantly displays the precise distance between the two points. You can choose to accept it, or to move the speaker and re-measure. Repeat the process as necessary to take distance measurements from other speakers in your system.\n\nOnce all your measurements are taken, touch the Angle icon to obtain intelligent speaker toe-in angle recommendations for your system. Begin by adjusting your speakers so they are facing straight ahead. Place your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch on top of one of the speakers and press the corresponding onscreen icon, then rotate that speaker towards the listening position. As you do so, SpeakerPro's onscreen display shows you the degree of toe-in, using color coding to guide you through a range of recommended angles. Next, do the same for the paired speaker in your system. A handy onscreen Reset button allows you to start from scratch at any time and experiment with different distance measurements and toe-in angles."

      "label": "Rowmote lets you seamlessly control audio, video, and presentation applications on your Mac from your iOS device.\n\nYou love the remote control which came with your Mac - so simple yet elegant, with easy control of Front Row, iTunes, Quicktime, DVD Player, Keynote, and more.\n\nOr, your Mac didn’t come with a remote control or doesn’t even have an infrared port. Buying a remote control, from Apple or a third party, would carry a significant cost!\n\nYou carry your iPhone or iPod Touch wherever you go... so why should you carry a second device just to control your computer?  Furthermore, why should you need line-of-sight to do so?\n\nEnter Rowmote!  Rowmote is like your Mac’s remote control, but over the wireless network and even better! By tapping the Apps button, you get bonus abilities, switching between controlled programs, toggling the iTunes Visualizer, and more. Rowmote will even wake sleeping Macs.\n\nFEATURES\n\n - Control your Mac over a wireless network. No line of sight necessary.\n\n - Functions just like the hardware Apple Remote Control in:\n• Adobe Lightroom\n• Airfoil Video\n• Amarra\n• Aperture\n• BBC iPlayer\n• Beamer\n• Boxee\n• Decibel\n• DVD Player\n• Ecoute\n• eyeTV 3.x\n• Firefox\n• Front Row\n• Hulu Desktop\n• iPhoto\n• iTunes\n• Keynote ‘08 & later\n• kJams Pro\n• Kodi\n• Last.fm\n• Logic\n• Microsoft Powerpoint ‘04 & later\n• mPlayer\n• Movist\n• OpenOffice Impress\n• Preview\n• PandoraBoy\n• PandoraJam\n• PandoraOne Desktop\n• Photos\n• Plex, Plex Home Theater, & Plex Media Player\n• Quicktime\n• Rdio\n• Safari\n• Skim\n• Songbird\n• Spotify\n• Squire\n• The Tube\n• VLC\n• xbmc (Xbox Media Center)\n\n- SWITCH: Access your Mac’s Dock, launching & switch between all controllable applications on the Mac, toggle the iTunes visualizer, and more. Order & display customizable.\n\n - Click-and-hold works just like on the physical remote in applications; for example, holding the right button fast-forwards, while a single click is ‘next’. This is a feature no other iPhone remote control I know of does properly!\n\n- Sleep on demand; wake the Mac automatically\n- Pause the music or video automatically when you answer a call on your iPhone\n- Proximity sensor support to automatically turn the screen off if the device is face-down\n- Secure authentication\n- Optional dark interface\n- Connect via WiFi or Bluetooth (Bluetooth requires Personal Hotspot Bluetooth tethering)\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n • Mac OS X 10.4.0 or later.\n • Mac: The free Rowmote Helper program must be running on the Mac to be controlled. Download at www.rowmote.com. Some features require later versions of Mac OS X.\n\nRowmote is a steal! Couple it with Apple’s free Remote app to turn your iPhone or iPod Touch into the ultimate controller for home stereo, mobile presentation, or casual video viewing.\n\nThe artwork of Rowmote was designed by Rik Schennink."

      "label": "Quickly Calculate the dimensions of a mat, image, or frame for your project.\n\n\"A good tool that makes calculations easy. Thanks!\" - Farquarsen\n\nThe Matting Calculator has been developed to help artists, framers, and DIY'ers to accurately calculate the following questions:\n\n1. What opening will I have if I use an existing frame with a set mat width?\n\n2. What frame size do I need to fit my image with a set mat width?.\n\n3. What mat width are needed mat an existing frame with my image?\n\nWhile the math to preform these calculations is easy, it is also easy to make calculation errors. When mistakes are made they are often not caught until after the mat is cut. With the cost of mat board currently going between $5 to $50. The savings received from getting the calculations correct is very valuable. Capture this value by using the Matting Calculator today. \n\nThe Matting Calculator also comes with these additional features:\n* Mat Board Optimize\n* Proportions Scale\n* Mat Preview\n* Save Calculation\n\nMat Board Optimizer - This simple tool lets you know how many mats with the same outer dimensions can be cut out of one board. The layout preview shows different options for laying out the mats to get the most out of the board. This feature will save you additional $$ by maximizing your materials.\n\nProportions scale - This tool lets you easily scale to different sizes without modifying the proportions. This is especially useful when you have the option to print an image any size you want.\n\nMat Preview - Have you ever wanted to know what your finished mat will look like before you buy the wrong color.  The preview tool lets you insert an image into a scaled mat preview. You can change out colors, and find the right color before you buy the board.\n\nSave Calculation - After completing a calculation you can use the save tool to assign that calculation a name and keep for future use. Easily browse through your saved mat calculations at a later date. This allows you to create a virtual mat library of calculations.\n\nGet the Matting Calculator today!"

      "label": "\"High-Frequency Noise Monitor\" is a high-frequency noise analysis tool that specializes in high-frequency bands above 8 kHz.\n\nYou may be exposed to artificial high-frequency noise on a daily basis that is inaudible to the human ear. This app allows you to monitor such high frequency noises and examine their occurrence.\n\nIn general, noise may contain relatively high frequency components depending on its source, and this is classified as high frequency noise.\n\nFor example, harmonic noise is radiated from the main body of an electronic device or the power lines of a power conversion device such as an AC-DC power adapter, and depending on its power level, it may affect peripheral devices.\n\nThere are also devices that generate high-frequency noise to drive away vermin such as rats and weasels. The frequency of the sound varies depending on the type of vermin, and some devices incorporate sensors to change the volume and frequency over time. When such devices are installed in the vicinity, there are cases where they can lead to noise problems with adverse effects on human health.\n\nHigh-frequency noise does not often occur at a constant volume or frequency, but often occurs in a certain cycle or randomly. It is not easy to detect such high-frequency noise.\n\nThis app collects randomly fluctuating high-frequency noise from the iPhone's built-in microphone and performs frequency analysis in real time.\nIn addition, it retains the PCM data for 20 seconds just before the measurement is stopped, and displays a spectrogram of FFT and octave band analysis. The spectrogram is a graph showing the analysis results of the frequency spectrum of sound, with time on the vertical axis, frequency on the horizontal axis, and signal strength in colors. You can visually monitor the occurrence of high-frequency noise. \n\nFeatures:\n# Main: Real-time frequency analysis function.\n- Real-time measurement: Automatically stops after a maximum of approximately 180 seconds.\n- Maximum frequency detection and power level display (dB unit in 20 μPa standard)\n- Time trace display: approx. 10 seconds\n- Display gain adjustment (Range): 3 levels (0dB - 90dB / -10dB - 80dB / -20dB - 70dB)\n\n# Analysis: FFT/octave band spectrogram analysis function (PCM data for 20 seconds immediately before the measurement is stopped is saved, and spectrogram analysis is performed.)\n- FFT spectrogram analysis (FFT)\n- Octave spectrogram analysis (OCT)\n- Display gain switching (Range): 3 levels\n- Playback function: approx. 20 seconds.\n- Playback sound filter (Filter): 8kHz high-pass filter to cut off low-mid range sound.\n\n# Snapshot (Snap): Save the analysis result as an image file.\n\nOperation Procedure:\n1) Sound measurement and real-time frequency analysis (Main)\nTap Start button in Main mode to start measurement. It displays the real-time instantaneous frequency analysis result and the trace of frequency time variation. The frequency and signal level at which the maximum level is detected can be displayed numerically.\n\n2) Spectrogram analysis (Analysis)\nAfter measurement in Main mode, tap the Analysis button to perform spectrogram analysis. Tap FFT or OCT button to display the spectrogram by FFT or octave band analysis.\n\n3) Snapshot\n By tapping Snap button, you can save the measurement result as an image file in \"Photos\". A time stamp will be inserted into the image.\n\nNotes:\n- The measurement of high frequency sounds depends on the sensitivity characteristics of the built-in microphone, so it may vary depending on the iPhone model.\n- Wireless (Bluetooth) headphones and headset are not supported.\n- This app accesses the built-in microphone. At the time of initial launch, the iOS system will ask you to approve the access, which you must do. If you do not allow it, you will not be able to use the microphone due to iOS privacy restrictions. In such a case, go to the iOS basic settings (Settings > Privacy > Microphone) and allow access from this app."

With Haptique you get exactly what you need in a clean and simple interface where you can tap and feel each and every haptic available in iOS. \n\nDoes your UI-button need a light thud or a heavy thud? Maybe even a Failure haptic when things go bad. Enrich the user experience in your app with Haptique - A guide for haptic feedback\n\nDESIGNER SUPERPOWER\nFor designers, Haptique gives you the equivalent of Superman's X-ray vision, but for haptics. Instead of asking a developer to try out every haptic available and wasting valuable time. Take back the control, and decide exactly which haptic is the correct one for your delicious button. As a bonus, including this information in your handover, is often highly appreciated by developers.\n\nDARK MODE\nHaptique has a gorgeous dark mode theme ready for you when you wake up sweaty from a nightmare where you dreamed that your developer used the Failure haptic for a success screen.\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n- Requires iPhone 7 or later due to the 2nd gen Taptic Engine.\n- iOS 14 Minimum"

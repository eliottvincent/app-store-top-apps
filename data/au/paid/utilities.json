Within seconds Antenna Mate will accurately* point to the direction of your best** TV reception from anywhere in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. Antenna Mate is used by professional installers, caravaners, and DIYers from city and country areas.\n\nWE HAVE GOT YOU COVERED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM\n\n* 1,151 broadcasting sites.\n* 3,698 digital transmitters.\n* All cities and towns in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands where digital terrestrial television is available*****\n\nWE HAVE GOT YOU COVERED IN AUSTRALIA\n\n* 597 broadcasting sites.\n* 2,841 digital transmitters.\n* All cities and towns in QLD, NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, SA, WA and NT where digital terrestrial television is available***\n\nWE HAVE GOT YOU COVERED IN NEW ZEALAND\n\n* 35 broadcasting sites.\n* 344 transmitters\n* All cities and towns in the North and South Islands where digital terrestrial television is available****\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nUsing your current location, your device's compass, and the target site's effective radiated power, Antenna Mate instantly estimates the signal strength of all nearby sites and automatically plots a bearing to the best one**.\n\nUnder normal circumstances you should get an initial result within seconds. The longer you leave Antenna Mate open, the more accurate it will become. For best results use Antenna Mate outside in an open space and away from objects which cause interference.\n\nAntenna Mate doesn't need an internet connection, that's one of the reasons why it's so fast.\n\nDETAILED TRANSMITTER INFO\n\nComplete listings of all digital terrestrial transmitters are available at each site. Listings include the callsign, frequency (MHz), channel, polarisation, and effective radiated power (kW).\n\nALL SITES BY STRENGTH OR DISTANCE\n\nPrefer to align your TV antenna with another broadcasting site? No worries! Sites can be listed from strongest to weakest, or closest to furthest away. Pick any site from the list and Antenna Mate instantly plots a new bearing to the targeted site.\n\nUsing an amplifier or high gain antenna? You can increase the search radius up to 200 km (120 mi) from your current location.\n\nLIGHT AND DARK DISPLAY SWITCHING\n\nWhen your device is in direct sunlight Antenna Mate will automatically switch to a light display making the arrow easy to see. Perfect for performing an alignment during the middle of the day.\n\nUSE IT UPSIDE DOWN, OR THE RIGHT WAY UP\n\nAntenna Mate is smart enough to know when your device is being held upside down, or the right way up. Either way, it will always point to the targeted site.\n\nSUPPORT AND FEEDBACK\n\nWe would love to hear your feedback or help you troubleshoot. Send an e-mail to support@antennamate.com or tweet @antennamate. Follow us on Twitter to get notified when transmitter data is updated.\n\n* Time taken to find best broadcasting site and directional accuracy will vary based on device and external environmental factors.\n\n** Best broadcasting site is measured by estimating maximum theoretical field strength in free space (No obstructions or reflections). Actual field strength will be lower. Closest broadcasting site is measured by estimating distance using line of sight. Distance is only an approximation.\n\n*** Based on Australian Communications and Media Authority data.\n\n**** Based on Radio Spectrum Management and OpenStreetMap data.\n\n***** Based on Ofcom data."

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store.

These are just a few of the day to day conveniences this app will help achieve:\n\n - Pair your watch as a proper vehicle key, just like your phone! Works under all conditions, including in underground parking garages or in the middle of a desert!\n\n - Forgot to plug in? Get a notification if vehicle is in a pre-configured location and not plugged in - all done directly on the watch, no external servers required, keeping your privacy!\n\n - Add the graphic corner complication to your watch face and enjoy the convenience of having easy access to state of charge, charging indicator, time remaining if charging, sentry mode active indicator and indicator if any windows, doors or trunks are open. All from one complication, that also will launch the app when tapped. \n\n - During and after charge, a panel will show how much energy was added. Convenient if you schedule your charge during the night - wake up each morning and easily check how much energy was added to the battery. \n\n - If you have multiple vehicles on your account, tap the vehicle name to quickly and easily switch between them. \n\n - You can queue up commands by tapping on buttons, then put your wrist down and the commands will execute in the background when the vehicle is successfully woken up. \n\n - When you tap the unlock vehicle button, the charge port will also unlock if a charging cable is attached. That's convenience right there!\n\n - Want to reduce phantom drain? Background updates can be configured to longer intervals between updates or to only update if car is already awake or can be disabled entirely for absolutely zero impact on phantom drain.\n\n - A warning panel will show up if any doors, windows or trunks are left open. Conveniently, you can tap the panel to close any open windows.\n\n - Need to access the frunk? Just do it from your wrist - no fiddling with your phone. \n\n - Sitting comfy in the couch, but just remembered you have a road-trip in the morning? Set the charge limit to 100% - or any value really - and start charging, right from the convenience of your wrist!\n\n - Leaving the office after a long hot day? Activate the HVAC when you're on your way, and enjoy a nice cool vehicle.\n\n - When charging, tap the time remaining label to switch to show time of expected completion - no more head calculus!\n\n - Need to run a quick errand, but you don't have your phone? Unlock your vehicle from your wrist, then activate remote start and off you go. Just please be mindful that this feature requires internet connectivity on both watch and vehicle - so don't drive into the desert and leave your vehicle, or you'll get stuck there!\n\nA note about security and privacy:\nThis app accepts two types of login. Either Tesla account credentials or a Tesla API token. Your account credentials are never stored in the app, but are used only once to obtain an authentication token and refresh token directly from the Tesla API server. If you would rather supply that token yourself, you can do so instead. It is required to supply a refresh token. Your token will be persisted in the app. Tokens will be revoked if you change your Tesla account password. No network traffic will ever be emitted from this app that goes anywhere other than directly to the Tesla API servers, unless the OPTIONAL cloud processing is enabled, in which case an in-flight encrypted ACCESS token with a lifespan of 8 hours will be transmitted and stored ONLY WHILE COMMAND IS EXECUTING. The source code for this application will at all times be made available to any security researcher for a voluntary security and safety audit. \n\nDisclaimer: \nThis app is not endorsed by Tesla Inc. Use at your own risk. No guarantee of proper function is given. Only you are responsible for any changes to your car caused by using this app.  \n\nMade in Denmark"

      "label": "Noir is a Safari extension that automatically adds a dark mode to every website you visit.\n\nIt makes browsing the web at night so much better. With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.\n\nAnd the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it is – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop. And with over 20 built-in themes and the ability to create your own, you can customize the results exactly the way you want.\n\nNoir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!\n\nBuilt from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Focus Filters and Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows. And your settings are automatically synced to all your devices using iCloud.\n\nAnd just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data. Period.\n\nNoir is made by a solo iOS developer. It does not include any subscriptions or ads. Buy Noir once, use it forever.\n\nNotes:\n• Found a website where Noir’s dark mode doesn’t look just right? Let me know by reporting it. The app will be frequently updated to address issues that are reported.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\n• The Noir extension requires access to the websites you visit to analyze the existing style of the page and to override it with Noir's dark style.\n• Noir never collects your browsing data. The only data Noir ‘collects’ are your settings, and those will never leave your device.\n• You can read Noir’s full Privacy Policy at https://getnoir.app/privacypolicy"

Quick walls will pay for itself many times over, by using it to build just one wall! It's the greatest value tool in the tool trailer! All for the cost of a pencil!"

      "label": "Necrophonic is an ITC app used for spirit communication and EVP research.\n\n8 Sounds Banks:\n\nThe audio has been mastered in a way to bring out various sound properties . \nUsing Pro Tools I was able to enhance high, mid, and low range frequencies. I also applied \nother filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an \nenvironment suitable for spirit communication.\n\nThe audio itself is made up of phonemes, \npartial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help \nspirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.\nthere are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.\n\nThese sounds banks play in a similar\nway to that of my other app \"Spiritus Ghost Box\" but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has\n8 active sound banks.\n\nWhite Noise Sound Bank:\n\nThis app also has an optional 9th sound bank called \"White noise\". \nThis bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This \naudio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the \n\"Holy Grail\" of EVP recorders. This is not a White Noise Generator, this is a normal sound bank like the others but this one contains white noise from the DR60.\n\nAudio Effects:\n\nThis app does contain Echo and Reverb audio effects. These have been proven \nto be the best effects to apply to ITC sessions. The echo can create audio that can be \nmanipulated within the echo itself. Echo can also help in live, real time communication by \nrepeating the audio and allowing you to better hear whats coming through. Reverb can be \napplied to the audio to create a spacious sound environment that will enhance audio manipulation."

Easily convert from different time zones, including times in the future or past.\n\nOn the iPhone:\n\n- The Zulu Time page gives a quick view of both Zulu and Local times\n\n- The Offset Time page allows you to see Zulu and local time either in the future or past by entering an offset via the Offset button. Tapping either Zulu or Local times will allow you to enter a time in the future or past, synchronizing both Local and Zulu times with that offset. The offset only applies to this view (except on the iPad the offset applies to everything on the page)\n\n- The Multiple Zones page allows you to add as many time zones as you wish in a scrolling view. Clicking on any Time Zone will allow you to change it.\n\non iPad:\n\nAll information is combined on one screen. You have user customizable time zones on the right hand side. On the left, you have Zulu and Local time and one customizable time zone. The offset to see future or past time can be done via the Offset button or tapping any of either the Zulu, Local or Custom time buttons on the left.\n\nOn the Watch:\n\nComplications available in all watch faces making for glanceable ZuluTime and access to the app, which gives offset able time computation."

      "label": "Recommended and shared by thousands of users! Mentioned as the iOS app to use in:\n  ◆  wired.com - How to Sweep For Bugs and Hidden Cameras\nNote that the app is just a helper tool to induce lens reflection and should be used with common sense and manual inspection of the target object.\n \nProtect your privacy from spy hidden camera lenses. Here are some actual news headlines:\n  ◆  Brits staying in Airbnb flat 'find spy camera hidden pointed at bed'\n  ◆  Oil rig worker files lawsuit: I was secretly recorded\n  ◆  Motel manager accused of setting up hidden camera\n  ◆  Models find hidden cameras in apartment\n\nA free do-it-yourself way of detecting cameras from instructables.com, also based on detecting lens reflections:\n  ◆  Step 1: Find a tube that's good for looking through. A cardboard tube from a roll of toilet paper or paper towels is best.\n  ◆  Step 2: All you need is a flashlight or something that you can use to focus a beam of light in a dark room. Attaching a couple of directional LEDs to the outside of the cardboard tube can work also if you don't have a flashlight.\n  ◆  Step 3: With one hand, hold up the toilet paper tube to your eye. With your other hand, hold up the flashlight at about eye level and point it away from you. With one eye, look through the tube and scan the room. If there are any small points of light bouncing back, inspect it further. It might be a camera.\n\nThis app is a tool to help you detect disguised camera lens that you suspect are present in a room. The manual mode with overlay is already equivalent to the do-it-yourself described above or the more expensive hardware camera detector gadgets that tries to detect using the tell-tale signs of tiny reflections of hidden camera lenses. The good thing is this app is always with you, ready when you need it.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS for the APP: \n\nUse this tool after your own visual inspection and investigation. Scan the room first without your phone and once you find something suspicious point the phone camera to the suspected object. The app alternately turns on and off the camera flash to detect the signature of a camera lens. Carefully adjusting the distance and angle relative to the target object helps as well adjusting the level of lighting in the room.\n\nWhen automatic mode is ineffective or distracting you should use manual mode. In both manual and automatic modes you must use your own judgment as this is just a tool like what you would do with an expensive hidden camera detector gadgets or the do-it-yourself detector described above.\n\nMANUAL Detection: \nAnytime that you see the signature of a camera lens you can single-tap on the screen and put a marker on the suspected camera lens.\nYellow overlay - this signifies that the surface might be metallic or glass-like and that a great amount of reflectivity is being detected.\nCyan overlay - this means that the surface is changing in color consistent with the general hue of camera lenses.\n\nAUTOMATIC Detection: \nThe app will continuously try its best to put a marker where it assesses a camera lens may be present. To exclude surfaces that are generating lots of false positives you can zoom the camera or carefully change the distance or angle of the phone to the target. Works best when room lights are dimmed and the phone is very steady.\n\nBONUS 1: EMF scanner to detect the slight magnetic field present in electronic devices including hidden spy cameras. \nBONUS 2: Some home cameras broadcast bluetooth information and this app has a scanner for bluetooth devices.\n\nBE SAFE and START SCANNING!"

Then, you can customize the pass and save, share or store it directly on Apple Wallet. MakePass also supports creating passes with Shortcuts!\n\nMakePass supports customizing passes in a lot of ways:\n\n• Import or manually define the pass barcode type and content with any format supported by Apple Wallet: QR, AZTEC, PDF417 and Code 128 with text payloads. MakePass also allows you to convert unsupported barcodes to any of the valid formats or embed them in the original format as a pass image.\n• Add a title, organization, description and custom fields that will be visible on the header, front and back of the pass.\n• Define the pass group to select which passes of the same type appear grouped on Apple Wallet. MakePass supports up to 10 different pass groups.\n• Add custom images for the icon, logo, background, strip image or lateral thumbnail.\n• Set custom colors for the background, titles and body text. MakePass can also automatically infer the color scheme of the pass based on the imported barcode image.\n• Choose the type of pass: Event Ticket, Boarding Pass, Generic, Store Card or Coupon.\n• For boarding passes set the transit type: Air, Boat, Bus, Train or Generic.\n• Set a relevant date, expiration date and up to 10 relevant locations, so the pass automatically appears on the lock screen when it becomes relevant.\n• Add an associated app that will appear on the pass on the Wallet app so you can quickly install or launch it.\n\nMakePass also includes advanced features like keyboard shortcuts, Quick Actions, Handoff and full support for automating the creation and customization of passes with Shortcuts!\n\nMakePass supports macOS, iOS and iPadOS.\n\nNotes:\n• On iPadOS, as Apple Wallet is not available MakePass will allow you to preview the pass and share or save the generated pass as a file instead of adding it to Wallet.\n• Barcodes with Code 128 format are not shown by Apple Wallet on the Apple Watch.\n• Barcode formats that Apple Wallet does not support but MakePass can embed as pass images include Code 39, Code 93, EAN8, EAN13, UPCE and ITF14.\n• The organization name and icon image will be visible on the relevant pass notifications that appear on the lock screen.\n• Background, strip and thumbnail images are not supported on all pass types. Note that background images are automatically blurred by Apple Wallet and that some passes while supporting multiple image types cannot include all types at the same time.\n• The “Create Pass” Shortcuts action supports both opening the result on MakePass or generating the pass file inline.\n• Handoff can transfer the current editor state with the exception of embedded pass images due to size limits of the transferred payload imposed by the system.\n\nPrivacy by Design: MakePass works completely on-device and does not store or send any information outside of the protected app sandbox."

You can launch the app to view an animated display of live data (updated every 10 seconds while it's open), or add a complication to your watch face so that you always know how much battery you have left. Note that complications aren't allowed to refresh as often, so that will update roughly every 30 minutes if you add one.\n\nThe app displays solar, battery, grid and home power usage as well as how much charge is left in your Powerwall.\n\nThere's two main items in the app, showing live power data as well as a daily summary total telling you how much solar you've generated, home power used and how much grid power you've imported and exported.\n\nThis is a fully stand-alone watch app, it can run stand-alone and without your Apple Watch once you've signed in.\n\nNew to version 1.4, this app now works with solar only installations as well, so you don't need a Powerwall to use it, if you have Tesla solar panels you can see live stats and a day summary for that as well!\n\nAs of version 2.0, this app supports 2FA/MFA accounts as well.\n\nWe use this app personally every day and will endeavour to keep it up to date and add more features over time.\n\nNote:\nA Tesla Powerwall or a Tesla Solar Installation, and Tesla account are required to use this app. Your account details are stored in the built in secure Keychain on your device. They are only transmitted to Tesla's servers for authentication purposes on login. This app contains no first or third party tracking whatsoever. We take great care to respect your privacy and your data remains your data.\n\nDisclaimer:\nThis app is not made or endorsed by Tesla. It's built by nerds who couldn't get enough of watching that mesmerising Powerwall animation and wanted it on their watches. It has an iPhone counterpart only because it needs to use a web based login to work."

Ishraq prayer is 10 to 12 minutes after sunrise. There is a misconception where Islamic websites and people use the word \"Ishraq\" and then give timings for actual Sunrise. Praying at sunrise is forbidden and must be performed after at least 10 minutes of sunrise. iPray for this reason adds 10 minutes to sunrise and labels it correctly as \"Ishraaq\".\n\n* Prayer Alerts will ONLY alert you with an initial Takbir. The full azan (and its length) is NOT supported by the iOS alert mechanism as there is a maximum limit of 30 seconds of audio playback."

      "label": "Apart from the most reliable app for polar alignment (with or without a polar scope), PS Align pro has become the astronomer's swiss-army knife with all the tools added over the years. Remember, all features & updates are free forever, the only in-app purchases are donations (tip jar).\n\nPolar Scope Align will calculate the position of Polaris or σ Octantis in your Polar Scope reticle for your location (using your phone's GPS or manually), allowing a quick and accurate polar alignment. It is one of the few programs that are accurate in lower latitudes by correcting for atmospheric refraction (so expect results to agree only with precise software and not most simplistic \"polar align\" apps - see the \"Accuracy\" section in help for details). In the settings you can select the polar scope reticle that matches your own, from a vast collection:\niOptron old & new, Astro-Physics RAPAS & PASILL, various versions of Takahashi EM-10/11/200/400/500, NJP, PM-1, P2-Z, the latest Orion / Skywatcher, the Classic Skywatcher / Orion / Celestron / Meade / EXOS2 / Bresser, the Telrad, Rigel QuikFinder, a couple for Astrotrac / Losmandy / Kenko / Avalon, the Vixen PF-L/Atlux/SX/SXD/SXP/AXD/GP/GP-DX/Polarie Polar Axis Scopes, a Konus and several Polar Finders: Tuthill, Explore Scientific 8x50, Meade 9x60, Vixen Polaris, Celestron 7x50, Carton Optical. PoleMaster help view for South Hemisphere users. If you have one not included, just ask the developer to add it!\n\nFeature list:\n\n-Accurate calculation of Polaris or Sigma Oct for any date and location, including effect of atmospheric refraction (and annual aberration, nutation). Most other apps do not perform precision calculations, so please only compare app readings to accurate sources (USNO, scientific software etc).\n-Use device time/date/location, or enter your own, or pick from online & offline world databases via the Location Manager.\n-Approximate daytime / no polarscope polar alignment tool. Great for visual use, solar imaging (inc. eclipses) and even limited short focal length astrophotography. Now with sun shadow calibration for more accuracy!\n-Laser / Hop Align for nighttime alignment using a calibration star for obstructed or not visible polar star, or for improving laser align.\n-Full app in red-color (or alternative green, white) night mode - tools switchable to daytime view.\n-Deep Space Object (DSO) Database with 22000+ objects from several catalogs (Messier, Caldwell, NGC, IC, Herschell 400, Sharpless 2, Barnard), along with stars (Yale Bright Star) & planets. Search, apply filters, sorting, download DSS color images for all items, or get help finding them with your non-goto telescope with the Push-To function.\n-Connect to and control WiFi-enabled iOptron mounts.\n-Over 30 calculators useful for observing and astrophotography, from eyepiece magnification and field of view, to imaging resolution and reducers.\n-Xasteria: World astro-weather report based on 7Timer! data\n-Water vapor satellite images.\n-List of visible ISS and bright satellite passes.\n-Moon phase & lunar Calendar with solar/lunar rise/set and twilight times.\n-Wizard to calculate your reticle centering offset and correct or compensate for it.\n-Zoomable reticle view and customized routines & tools: Alt-az alignment error display for mounts that calculate it after star alignment (e.g. iOptron iEQ45, CEM60), polar alignment when your scope is not in zero position (for mounts like iOptron ZEQ/CEM on which you can always access the polar scope), remember zero position on Celestron / Skywatcher / Orion etc reticles.\n-Bubble level (using either gyro or accelerometer) and Compass heading, as well as magnetic declination reading.\n-GPS accuracy & elevation data.\n-Red/White/LED light.\n-Dimming slider.\n-iOptron, NexStar and Meade LX200 Star Lists.\n-Support for iPhone & iPad from iOS 9 (and iPod Touch, except tools that require the compass)."

      "label": "This professional tool called Clinometer is the most precise (all you can get with some calculations) slope measurement tool for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad using all sides of the device plus the camera. It can be used for simple applications like aligning a frame as well as for more sophisticated fields of applications where an arbitrary slope needs to be measured exactly. Read the reviews (and write your own) for all the applications you find! Thank for all your positive feedback! Please use our support link if you have questions and suggestions, we don't read the iTunes reviews every day!\n\nWith this tool, the slope can be measured by all edges of the device and through the camera. The current features include:\n\n◆ 3 Modes (incl. auto switching): Clinometer mode (auto when holding upright), Camera mode (any direction, manual activation) and Bubble level (smoothly fading in when holding flat).\n\n◆ Relative angles: Besides measuring absolute angles, for every mode you can measure the relative angle between device positions\n\n◆ Advanced two way calibration on all sides: For every 4 sides plus the bubble mode you can calibrate in two steps, which allows you to calibrate exactly even on non-level surfaces. Each direction can be calibrated individually to achieve the optimal precision. \n\n◆ Speech synthesis: The device will speak the current reading, so you don't have to watch the display while measuring/aligning your object.\n\n◆ Five different unit modes: The device can display the slope in degrees (rounded or in tenth of degrees), percentage, rise over run (common for roof slope measurement in :12) and 1V:H (common in engineering)\n\n◆ Dial Rotation: You can smoothly rotate the background dial and thus define which side of the device represents 0° and 90° degrees. \n\n◆ Motion-sensitive Lock feature: Besides the common instant simple tap hold mechanism you can activate the motion-sensitive lock. If activated the device waits for the final lock until you hold your device steady enough for at least 2 seconds. You can set the lock sensitivity between 0.1° and 1.0° degrees. \n\n◆ Peer Mode: Use two devices to measure angles: One as a display, the other as the measurement device that can be attached to the hardware you want to align. \n\n◆ Fullscreen Mode: The full screen mode can be toggled by tapping the center of the screen and by the upper and lower arrows in the center. This prevents you from erroneous inputs while measuring.\n\n◆ Different color schemes: Press the S/C Button to instantly switch the color. The color can be selected differently for the bubble and the clinometer mode. The predefined color sets include day and night color schemes (Black on White, White on Black and Red). \n\n◆ Adjustable Auto-Lock: You can prevent the device from turning into the sleep mode. \n\nAccording to wikipedia: An inclinometer or clinometer is an instrument for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or inclination of an object with respect to gravity. It is also known as a tilt meter, tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. \n\nFor recreational use only. After the calibration it CAN (!) be very accurate especially for the main axis after calibration. The measurement is performed as well as possible (we try our best) by using the three inbuilt accelerometers. \n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! \n\nWe will improve the application long-term. This was the first application of this kind shortly after the opening of the App Store. Since then it is continuously updated and enriched with new features."

      "label": "Are you wanting to communicate with ghosts? If so, you have come to the right place! Our EVP Recorder app is designed specifically for ghost hunting purposes.\n\nUsing your devices built in microphone, allows our EVP Recorder App to pick up electronics voice phenomena (responses from ghosts).\n\nIt has been tested thoroughly by a few experiences ghost hunting teams before release and works very well.\n\nSome of the features include\n- EVP Recording\n- Ability to save recordings\n- Pause function during recording\n- Share options to share recordings via Facebook, WhatsApp and more\n- Audio visualisation so you can see responses visually\n- Ability delete voice record\n- Voice recorder playback\n- Ability to delete and rename records\n- Ability to load in existing recordings into the app\n- Fast forward and reverse options during playback\n- Beautiful and easy to use interface\n- No ads or in-app purchase\n- Free updates for life\n- Shows recording information such as time recorded, filename, duration, and file size.\n\nHow to use the EVP Recorder App\n\nOur app is very simple to use. Once the app is open, you will see two tabs, \"Record\" and \"Listen\". Whilst on the \"Record\" tab, click the microphone icon to start. You can then ask the ghosts and spirits questions, leaving a gap in between for them to respond.\n\nOnce finished press the tick button to stop and save the voice record. Visit the \"Listen\" tab, select your recording and press the play button. You need to listen carefully to the gaps in between your questions. This is where you will hear and EVPs you may have captured.\n\nGhost Hunting Tips\n1.\tTo get the most from the voice recorder during your ghost hunting session, ensure you are in a haunted location. Not all places are haunted, so you need to be in a location where there are ghosts.\n2.\tBefore you start your voice record, plan a few questions out in your head. Which may be relevant to the location.\n3.\tAlways be polite to spirits, even during your voice recording session. Even a ghost was human once, and they will more likely respond if you treat them with respect.\n4.\tIf you don’t get any results with the EVP recorder, try not to be discouraged. Not every ghost will respond every time. Try the recorder app again another time, or at another location.\nHow To Analyse Voice Recording\n\n“You can send your voice recording from the voice recorder to your computer.” There are free programs such as Audacity. Which will allow you to amplify the track and remove any white noise. Allowing you to hear the EVPs more clearly.\n\nTHE CLASS A EVP RECORDER\nGhost Hunting requires knowledge, and the right equipment. Our EVP Recorder is one of the basic required for ghost communication. Our voice recorder allows you to ask the spirits questions and hear responses when played back.\n\nAfter the voice record, you will need to place the voice recording back and listen carefully. Not all of the responses the recorder app may pick up will be loud and clear. Use the one tap voice record, ask your questions, leaving a gap in between responses. Then play the voice recording back.\nWe hope you enjoy our EVP Recorder app and stay safe whilst ghost hunting!"

      "label": "***THIS APPLICATION DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY SERVER SIDE SERVICE***\n\nQuantumult is a powerful proxy client.\n• Right now supports protocol Shadowsocks(r), HTTP, HTTP over TLS, SOCKS5 and SOCKS5 over TLS, VMess.\n\nIt can capture all the TCP traffic and redirect under you own way by using Filter function.\n• The filter has a few types to match. For TCP traffic that has the upper layer protocol HTTP(S), 'HOST', 'HOST-SUFFIX', 'HOST-KEYWORD', 'USER-AGENT', 'GEOIP' and 'IP-CIDR' are all supported. For the other TCP traffic, 'GEOIP' and 'IP-CIDR' are supported. Especially, when deal with HTTP(S) traffic, Quantumult has another function called Rejection, it matchs the whole URL of the HTTP(S) request.\n• After match, the filter has a lot of actions to deal with the request, built-in policy 'DIRECT', 'REJECT', 'PROXY', all your servers and your customized policies. Actually you can see all the actions as a lot of paths and you can decide which request goes through which path by using filter function.\n\nMore over, Quantumult can be a convenient web develop tool on mobile device.\n• When you on the road without the Mac platform debug tools like Charles and Wireshark, you still can use Quantumult to log parts of the web request to debug some web issues.\n• Quantumult can log all the HTTP(S) request header and response header.\n• Yes, you are right it can log the HTTPS request header and response header, be sure to install and trust Quantumult root CA for this advanced function.\n\nSince quantumult has a function called PROXY, sure it can redirect your traffic to remote proxy servers. But be clear, we do NOT provide any server side service or support, you should build your own servers.\n• Like we said early Quantumult can redirect all TCP traffic through the filter function, that means you can visit different web site through different servers by the filter. See it can accelerate your network connection if you set your filter right, and of course the filter is totally customizable.\n• About the customized policy, there are 3 different types of customized policy, 'SSID', 'Latency' and 'Static'. The 'SSID' policy depends on your network enviroment, Wi-Fi, Cellular or specific Wi-Fi with the SSID your provided. The 'Latency' policy is based on the latencies of all the servers of the policy settings, the result is the shortest(The test interval has the option of 600 or 1200 seconds). The 'Static' policy is based on your manual selection of servers or other polices from the policy settings. Sure you are right, some of polices can wrap other polices, convinent, right ?\n\nAbout working state, Quantumult can work in 3 state, 'GLOBAL', 'DIRECT' AND 'AUTO'.\n• The GLOBAL state will ignore filter settings and redirect all TCP traffic through the built-in PROXY policy(you need build and add your server first).\n• The DIRECT state will ignore filter settings and redirect all TCP traffic directly to the destination web site. How this state useful ? Yes, it can be a simple web develop tools by analizing the reqeust header and response header including HTTPS.\n• The AUTO state, we call it auto because it base on the filter you set to divide the TCP traffic through different paths, like the popular ACL way.\n\nExtra, Quantumult can also work as a HTTP proxy server for devices under the same Wi-Fi, when this function is turned on, the home view will show the IP and port for other device easily to connect.\n\n\nAt last, some attentions.\n• About the location on the map of home view. It is not the real location in the real world, it's just the IP location and might not be correct."

      "label": "NOTE! You phone/tablet MUST have a built in Magnetometer and Accelerometer sensor for the app to work. More info: https://www.laxton.se/ghost-tracker-emf-evp-recorder-app/faq/#info\n\n3-in-1 ghost hunting app developed by Sweden's most popular paranormal investigation team \"LaxTon Ghost Sweden\". More than 30.000 satisfied users have given the app 4.5 out of 5 in average rating.\n\nLaxTon Ghost Sweden has +30 years of combined experience in the paranormal area and more than 100.000 subscribers on their YouTube channel. When developing this application they wanted to select the 3 most useful basic functions used in a ghost hunt.\n\nThe app contains a EMF-scanner, a Motion Detector and a EVP / Voice recorder that will help you to easily detect EMF (Electromagnetic Fields), Motion and EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon). With this tool you will have a much greater chance to succeed with your ghost hunts - a ghost tracker app based on scientific sensors in your smartphone / tablet!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nEMF METER -  ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD DETECTOR / SCANNER\n\nNOTE! The EMF function requires a Magnetometer sensor.\n\nWe are all surrounded by various electrical devices that create natural electromagnetic fields that are affecting us to varying degrees. Some EMF fields, however, lack natural source and these are extra interesting for ghost hunters. Until the day the researchers succeed in presenting scientific evidence for these EMF fields, the phenomenon is paranormal.\n\nThere is a theory within the paranormal society that you can measure EMF that doesn’t have a natural power source and this can be paranormal activity. This EMF meter allows you to measure and view your EMF value and communicate with the help of the light that shows how strong EMF value the tool is capturing. \n\nEasy to use, click the button and scan the area around you.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nMOTION DETECTOR / VIBRATION INDICATOR \n\nNOTE! The motion detector requires an Accelerometer sensor.\n\nSometimes you can feel small bangs and vibrations in the floors, stairs, chairs and tables. Within the paranormal society we try to capture these vibrations. With this motion detector you can easily register all vibrations and collect the data for later use. \n\nEasy to use, just place the device where you want to capture motion and then click the button to start collecting motion data.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nEVP Recorder - Electronic Voice Phenomenon\n\nElectronic voice phenomena - test record voices from the dead. With this tool you can run EVP sessions, save the data and evaluate / listen at a later time. Within the paranormal society, EVP recorders are used to capture voices considered to come from the other side, ghosts, lost souls, spirits, scary demons, or whatever you choose to call the phenomenon.\n\nEasy to use voice recorder - click the button to record and ask questions, then listen through if you managed to capture voices from the other side.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nDISCLAIMER\n\nMeasurements performed by this app are based 100% on data from sensors in your phone / tablet. There are no false indications or sound effects. The results are completely dependent on the quality of your phone / tablet sensors.\n\nWe do not recommend replacing dedicated (and much more expensive) equipment with this app (because that type of equipment has stronger sensors).\n\nBecause the results are not scientifically reviewed, we MUST write this; The app should only be used for entertainment."

      "label": "***Named one of the top 100 new home products for 2011 in This Old House magazine***\n\n\nBalusterPro is a unique and handy tool designed for carpenters and woodworkers, but useful for do-it-yourselfers and homeowners alike. BalusterPro makes the chore of calculating spacing of handrail balusters a quick and elementary task.  It can also be used for any job requiring equal spacing between boards or slats.  Use for picket fences, bench/chair backs,decking or column flutes.\n____________________________________\n\nWhat users are saying:\n\nPunch in staircase and handrail dimensions, choose the configuration, and this app saves you the tedium of calculating baluster spacing. Hallelujah.\n\nThis Old House Magazine\n\n\nBalusterPro is an awesome app and can be used for a multitude of layout tasks, at your desk, on the job, in your car—wherever your phone goes, and it only costs a few bucks.\n\nGary Katz - Master finish carpenter and publisher of THISiscarpentry.com\n\n\nBalusterPro makes building that stairway more heavenly\n\nhomefixated.com\n____________________________________\n\n\nInstructions for Use:\n\nBalusterPro offers calculations for six different common handrail situations which you may encounter.  First, tap the settings button to select your measurement input method, then select the desired type of baluster installation. Use the keypad or sliders to enter your measurements for ‘Run Length’ (distance between the newel posts) and the ‘Baluster Width.’  Finally, just drag the ‘Balusters Needed’ slider to see your required number of balusters. As you adjust the ‘Balusters Needed’ slider, the “Spacing Between Balusters” will simultaneously update. Stop when your ‘Spacing Between Balusters’ meets your specific code requirements.  Tap the view button to see a list of all the centers and edges of the balusters. No longer will you need to keep pressing the add button on your traditional calculator to list your centers....they are all shown on one screen! It’s just that simple! You can display your measurements by selecting 1/16, 1/32, or metric on the main screen to determine your precision level.  If desired you can also display your result down to 1/64.  To do this, once you have done your calculation, simply tap the 'Spacing Between Balusters' result and if possible it will be further reduced down to 1/64 and displayed for 5 seconds.  This is handy if you want to cut all your fillets at once as it nearly eliminates cumulative error.  Tap the speak buttons at the bottoms of the list columns to have the app speak your measurements. \n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nCheck out my other construction related apps...StairBuilderPro for a stair stringer layout tool & TilePro for a simple tile layout tool.\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nCheck out the video demo at my website to see BalusterPro in action."

There's no limit on how many contacts you can lock.\n\nWe all have a few contacts in our iPhone for people we really should NOT phone or email at 1am on a Friday night (your ex-girl/boy friend, your mother(!) or your boss).\n\nWith Drunk Dial NO! you can leave your house at 8pm on a Friday night, hide those contacts for 12 hours and stop yourself waking up on Saturday morning thinking (cleaned up for iTunes!) \"Oh dear! oh my! I didn't, did I??!\"\n\nNEW FEATURE: Drunk Dial NO! now blocks incoming numbers for the time you set! Make sure that annoying ex-boyfriend doesn't try to call you when you're out on the town.

Warn your future, drunken, self against making a dreadful mistake! (you know the kind of thing we're talking about!)\n\n- Now looks great on Retina displays \n\n- Have Fun (and don't worry)\n\n----------------\nReal User Reviews:\n\nDrunk and call!! - 5 Stars\nby LISA705 - Version 2.995 - Nov 23, 2012\nI like it, it saves me alot!\n\nIt works!! - 4 Stars\nby me - Version 2.80 - Dec 27, 2011\nThis app is ridiculously funny!

Thank you for saving me from myself!\n\nPerfect App - 5 Stars\nby Jenniferw83 - Version 2.00 - May 29 2010\nThis app is perfect, and not just for when you are drunk. It's good to keep me from calling or texting an ex right after we break up. Every time I get the urge to text just cause I put his number on drunk dial no for 48 hours and by the time the 48 hours goes by the urge is gone. If not then I put him on it for another 48 hours!\n----------------\n\nTO START:\n - Tap the '+' button\n - Choose one of your contacts\n - Drunk Dial NO! will store the contact's phone number(s) and email address(es) for between 1 and 48 hours\n - NO EXCUSES! NO BEGGING!\n - After between 1 and 48 hours, run Drunk Dial NO! again to restore stored contact(s)\n\nTO TEST:\n - Create a contact called 'Test Person'\n   (first name: Test, last name: Person)\n - Add some fake phone and email entries for 'Test Person'\n - Choose 'Test Person' contact in Drunk Dial NO!\n - 'Test Person' is only stored for 5 minutes\n\nTO SEND YOURSELF A MESSAGE:\n - Tap the Compose button\n - Enter an important message you don't want to forget\n - The message will be sent to your device after the number of hours you enter\n\nTO TURN ON INCOMING BLOCKING:\n - In the Settings App\n - Goto Phone > Call Blocking & Identification\n - Make sure Drunk Dial NO! is turned On\n\nNote: If you've got contacts which Drunk Dial NO! is blocking, don't delete Drunk Dial NO! until you've restored the contacts using Drunk Dial NO! (of course, hopefully you'll like Drunk Dial NO! so much that you won't delete it!)\n\nFollow us on twitter @explorefun\n\nAll comments/suggestions welcomed to: info@explorefun.com"

This has nothing to do with the app, but is a factor of the compatibility between: 1) the iPhone, 2) your network provider, 3) the other person's network provider, and 4) the other person's cell phone.  \n\n* FAST INTERNET CONNECTION RECOMMENDED:  Due to the extensive server-side communication for downloading images, this app works best for users with a strong 3G signal or WiFi connection.  \n\n* Some images featured are in the public domain.  If you believe your work has been included in err, please let us know so it can be removed immediately.\n\nWRITE US!  Input and suggestions always welcome, and we're always here to help.

      "label": "The Miracle Box is an app used for Spirit Communication and ITC Research. You must use this correctly, responsibly and by using it you are doing so at your own risk. To see the full information and Q&A on how to use this app correctly, you can visit: https://huffparanormal.com/2021/05/the-miracle-box-spirit-communication-app-is-here/\n\nThe Miracle Box includes methods used by Steve Huff of Huff Paranormal in his Astral Doorway and Miracle Box full size devices. The app has eleven banks, which are all reversed human speech. There are no words, no music, no phrases and nothing programmed in to make you think spirit is speaking with you. This is an advanced yet simple ITC app based on eleven years of research and communication. It will not work for everyone (no app or box does). \n\nWhen using it, you must do so correctly. If you do not have a connection to spirit you will not hear replies come through. Instead, you will hear gibberish, nothing. That is by design. This app is designed to only bring you true responses, if and only if you connect with a spirit when using it. No matter the app or device you use, the connection is the #1 aspect of getting results. \n\nAlways use this with love, respect, kindness and a clear mind. If you do not hear replies, try again at another time, or a different place. Do not use it if you are angry, depressed, in a negative mood or fearful of it. If you fear this, do not use this app as fear is an energy we put out that can and could attract undesirable spirits. Love is the key here and this is meant for serous ITC researchers and enthusiasts. \n\nJust pick a voice, press record, ask a question and move the slider to the right for 1-3 seconds and then slide it back. You will soon hear a voice emerge that will either be answering you (if you connected) or gibberish (if you did not). Even if you do not hear a reply in real time, always check the recording as it could have changed. \n\nThis is a tool you can grow with. To learn how to build a connection, and see demo videos with this app in action visit the Huff Paranormal YouTube Channel."

You will even get notified when your Mac locks itself.\n\nAUTOWAKE\nEnable AutoWake and your Mac will wake its display when your iOS device gets near, with the option to automatically unlock it.\n\nWIDGET\nIncludes a handy Notification Center widget, which will show all your currently connected Macs and give you quick access to lock and unlock them from anywhere on your iOS device.\n\niPad HARDWARE KEYBOARD SUPPORT\nGreat support for hardware keyboards so you can zip about the UI really quickly and intuitively.\n\nThe iOS app needs to be paired with the free Unlox for macOS companion app, which you must download from unlox.it/get\n\nPairing Unlox for iOS with Unlox for macOS will enable Tap to Unlock, an exclusive way to unlock your Mac by tapping a custom tap pattern into your Magic Trackpad or Magic Mouse.

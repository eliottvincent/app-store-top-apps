Within seconds Antenna Mate will accurately* point to the direction of your best** TV reception from anywhere in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. Antenna Mate is used by professional installers, caravaners, and DIYers from city and country areas.\n\nWE HAVE GOT YOU COVERED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM\n\n* 1,151 broadcasting sites.\n* 3,698 digital transmitters.\n* All cities and towns in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands where digital terrestrial television is available*****\n\nWE HAVE GOT YOU COVERED IN AUSTRALIA\n\n* 597 broadcasting sites.\n* 2,841 digital transmitters.\n* All cities and towns in QLD, NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, SA, WA and NT where digital terrestrial television is available***\n\nWE HAVE GOT YOU COVERED IN NEW ZEALAND\n\n* 35 broadcasting sites.\n* 344 transmitters\n* All cities and towns in the North and South Islands where digital terrestrial television is available****\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nUsing your current location, your device's compass, and the target site's effective radiated power, Antenna Mate instantly estimates the signal strength of all nearby sites and automatically plots a bearing to the best one**.\n\nUnder normal circumstances you should get an initial result within seconds. The longer you leave Antenna Mate open, the more accurate it will become. For best results use Antenna Mate outside in an open space and away from objects which cause interference.\n\nAntenna Mate doesn't need an internet connection, that's one of the reasons why it's so fast.\n\nDETAILED TRANSMITTER INFO\n\nComplete listings of all digital terrestrial transmitters are available at each site. Listings include the callsign, frequency (MHz), channel, polarisation, and effective radiated power (kW).\n\nALL SITES BY STRENGTH OR DISTANCE\n\nPrefer to align your TV antenna with another broadcasting site? No worries! Sites can be listed from strongest to weakest, or closest to furthest away. Pick any site from the list and Antenna Mate instantly plots a new bearing to the targeted site.\n\nUsing an amplifier or high gain antenna? You can increase the search radius up to 200 km (120 mi) from your current location.\n\nLIGHT AND DARK DISPLAY SWITCHING\n\nWhen your device is in direct sunlight Antenna Mate will automatically switch to a light display making the arrow easy to see. Perfect for performing an alignment during the middle of the day.\n\nUSE IT UPSIDE DOWN, OR THE RIGHT WAY UP\n\nAntenna Mate is smart enough to know when your device is being held upside down, or the right way up. Either way, it will always point to the targeted site.\n\nSUPPORT AND FEEDBACK\n\nWe would love to hear your feedback or help you troubleshoot. Send an e-mail to support@antennamate.com or tweet @antennamate. Follow us on Twitter to get notified when transmitter data is updated.\n\n* Time taken to find best broadcasting site and directional accuracy will vary based on device and external environmental factors.\n\n** Best broadcasting site is measured by estimating maximum theoretical field strength in free space (No obstructions or reflections). Actual field strength will be lower. Closest broadcasting site is measured by estimating distance using line of sight. Distance is only an approximation.\n\n*** Based on Australian Communications and Media Authority data.\n\n**** Based on Radio Spectrum Management and OpenStreetMap data.\n\n***** Based on Ofcom data."

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store.

      "label": "Necrophonic is an ITC app used for spirit communication and EVP research.\n\n8 Sounds Banks:\n\nThe audio has been mastered in a way to bring out various sound properties . \nUsing Pro Tools I was able to enhance high, mid, and low range frequencies. I also applied \nother filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an \nenvironment suitable for spirit communication.\n\nThe audio itself is made up of phonemes, \npartial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help \nspirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.\nthere are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.\n\nThese sounds banks play in a similar\nway to that of my other app \"Spiritus Ghost Box\" but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has\n8 active sound banks.\n\nWhite Noise Sound Bank:\n\nThis app also has an optional 9th sound bank called \"White noise\". \nThis bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This \naudio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the \n\"Holy Grail\" of EVP recorders. This is not a White Noise Generator, this is a normal sound bank like the others but this one contains white noise from the DR60.\n\nAudio Effects:\n\nThis app does contain Echo and Reverb audio effects. These have been proven \nto be the best effects to apply to ITC sessions. The echo can create audio that can be \nmanipulated within the echo itself. Echo can also help in live, real time communication by \nrepeating the audio and allowing you to better hear whats coming through. Reverb can be \napplied to the audio to create a spacious sound environment that will enhance audio manipulation."

      "label": "Noir is a Safari extension that automatically adds a dark mode to every website you visit.\n\nIt makes browsing the web at night so much better. With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.\n\nAnd the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it is – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop. And with over 20 built-in themes and the ability to create your own, you can customize the results exactly the way you want.\n\nNoir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!\n\nBuilt from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Focus Filters and Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows. And your settings are automatically synced to all your devices using iCloud.\n\nAnd just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data. Period.\n\nNoir is made by a solo iOS developer. It does not include any subscriptions or ads. Buy Noir once, use it forever.\n\nNotes:\n• Found a website where Noir’s dark mode doesn’t look just right? Let me know by reporting it. The app will be frequently updated to address issues that are reported.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\n• The Noir extension requires access to the websites you visit to analyze the existing style of the page and to override it with Noir's dark style.\n• Noir never collects your browsing data. The only data Noir ‘collects’ are your settings, and those will never leave your device.\n• You can read Noir’s full Privacy Policy at https://getnoir.app/privacypolicy"

You can also take advantage of results history.\n\nUse in a quiet environment. Any ambient noises can affect result accuracy. Complete silence is the best.\n\nRecommended way to record the ticks is to touch the crown of the watch with the headset microphone. You will get the best results using original Apple EarPods.\n\nIf you don't need such advanced tool as Watch Tuner and all you need is to the check rate accuracy, maybe it's worth to try Watch Tuner Lite - a little brother of Watch Tuner application.\nIf you need frequency diagram look at Watch Tuner Timegrapher - the most sophisticated app of Watch Tuner series."

You can launch the app to view an animated display of live data (updated every 10 seconds while it's open), or add a complication to your watch face so that you always know how much battery you have left. Note that complications aren't allowed to refresh as often, so that will update roughly every 30 minutes if you add one.\n\nThe app displays solar, battery, grid and home power usage as well as how much charge is left in your Powerwall.\n\nThere's two main items in the app, showing live power data as well as a daily summary total telling you how much solar you've generated, home power used and how much grid power you've imported and exported.\n\nThis is a fully stand-alone watch app, it can run stand-alone and without your Apple Watch once you've signed in.\n\nNew to version 1.4, this app now works with solar only installations as well, so you don't need a Powerwall to use it, if you have Tesla solar panels you can see live stats and a day summary for that as well!\n\nAs of version 2.0, this app supports 2FA/MFA accounts as well.\n\nWe use this app personally every day and will endeavour to keep it up to date and add more features over time.\n\nNote:\nA Tesla Powerwall or a Tesla Solar Installation, and Tesla account are required to use this app. Your account details are stored in the built in secure Keychain on your device. They are only transmitted to Tesla's servers for authentication purposes on login. This app contains no first or third party tracking whatsoever. We take great care to respect your privacy and your data remains your data.\n\nDisclaimer:\nThis app is not made or endorsed by Tesla. It's built by nerds who couldn't get enough of watching that mesmerising Powerwall animation and wanted it on their watches. It has an iPhone counterpart only because it needs to use a web based login to work."

      "label": "=================================== \n   Keep your private life private™ \n=================================== \n\nFINALLY!! At long last, iDiscrete 3.0 is ready for download. This new version is fully functional on all new iPhones and the latest version of iOS. It is now optimized for the larger screen sizes of the newest iOS devices. We are still ironing out some small bugs, but we're 95% of the way there...\nThanks for supporting our pet project iDiscrete. We will continue updating the app as long as there are still users out there that are enthusiastic about it. THANK YOU!!\n\niDiscrete has a very simple Mission Statement: \n\n\"To securely store our user's private content (videos, images, notes, et al.) on their iOS devices, and to do so in the most discreet way possible.\" \n\nYou can think of iDiscrete as a digital safe, where you can securely store all your private pictures, videos, notes and more. Rather than requiring a suspicious looking password or PIN to enter the app, iDiscrete uses its patented Touch Sequence Protection™. This works by bringing up a fake \"Loading\" screen upon entry to the application. An unauthorized user will think the app is really loading, but the device owner knows that this is actually the password screen.  A series of taps in the correct places (the \"Touch Sequence\") will open up the app. Doing nothing will boot to a dummy app. \n\nThis unique feature, combined with an application icon and name that do not give away its functionality, mean that an unauthorized user would NEVER suspect the true nature of the app.\n\nKeep your private life private with iDiscrete!\n\n=================================== \n\niDiscrete distinguishes itself from the competition in a number of important ways: \n\n► PRICE ◄ \niDiscrete is half the price of its nearest legitimate competition. DO YOUR HOMEWORK AND READ OUR REVIEWS, AND YOU WILL FIND THAT iDISCRETE IS BY FAR THE BEST VALUE, NOT TO MENTION A SUPERIOR APP. \n\n► SUPPORTED FILE TYPES ◄ \niDiscrete has a massive list of file formats it supports, and here is it:\nJPG, PNG, BMP, GIF, 3GP, ASF, AVI, DIVX, DV, FLV, GXF, M2P, M2TS, M2V, M4V, MKV, MOOV, MOV, MP4, MPEG, MPEG1, MPEG2, MPEG4, MPG, MPV, MT2S, MTS, MXF, OGM, OGV, PS, QT, RM, RMVB, TS, VOB, WEBM, WM, WMV, TXT, DOC, DOCX, RTF, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX, PDF and MP3. Whew! (And we are adding more all the time…)\n\n► UPDATES ◄ \nWe have a number of future upgrades planned that will add even more functionality to iDiscrete, many of which were taken directly from real end-user suggestions. Other apps do not offer the exceptional customer support and updates that we do. \n\n► WIFI HARD DRIVE ◄ \nUsing our innovative iDiscrete File Manager, you can get your content onto your iOS device using any computer with a web browser and a WiFi connection. In addition, YOU CAN PULL CONTENT OFF THE DEVICE IN THE SAME WAY. iDiscrete allows you to upload any file type (unsupported formats go into a \"Misc.\" folder) so in this way it doubles as a mass storage device. Stand alone apps that do this often cost more than iDiscrete! \n\n► It's right in the name: DISCREET! ◄ \nOther apps simply password protect your content, but to prying eyes this can still look very suspicious. Thus, iDiscrete not only hides the sensitive content and effectively password protects it, but it conceals the very fact that an app with this functionality exists on the user's device. It avoids a situation where an unauthorized user may inadvertently click on the app, see a password, and ask you \"Hey, what's this??\" \n\nIT NEVER LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO HIDE WITH iDISCRETE."

      "label": "Convenience on the wrist - Watch app for Tesla is the ideal companion in day to day life with your Tesla vehicle. These are just a few of the day to day conveniences this app will help achieve:\n\n - Forgot to plug in? Get a notification if vehicle is in a pre-configured location and not plugged in - all done directly on the watch, no external servers required, keeping your privacy!\n\n - Add the graphic corner complication to your watch face and enjoy the convenience of having easy access to state of charge, charging indicator, time remaining if charging, sentry mode active indicator and indicator if any windows, doors or trunks are open. All from one complication, that also will launch the app when tapped. \n\n - During and after charge, a panel will show how much energy was added. Convenient if you schedule your charge during the night - wake up each morning and easily check how much energy was added to the battery. \n\n - If you have multiple vehicles on your account, tap the vehicle name to quickly and easily switch between them. \n\n - You can queue up commands by tapping on buttons, then put your wrist down and the commands will execute in the background when the vehicle is successfully woken up. \n\n - When you tap the unlock vehicle button, the charge port will also unlock if a charging cable is attached. That's convenience right there!\n\n - Want to reduce phantom drain? Background updates can be configured to longer intervals between updates or to only update if car is already awake or can be disabled entirely for absolutely zero impact on phantom drain.\n\n - A warning panel will show up if any doors, windows or trunks are left open. Conveniently, you can tap the panel to close any open windows.\n\n - Need to access the frunk? Just do it from your wrist - no fiddling with your phone. \n\n - Sitting comfy in the couch, but just remembered you have a road-trip in the morning? Set the charge limit to 100% - or any value really - and start charging, right from the convenience of your wrist!\n\n - Leaving the office after a long hot day? Activate the HVAC when you're on your way, and enjoy a nice cool vehicle.\n\n - When charging, tap the time remaining label to switch to show time of expected completion - no more head calculus!\n\n - Need to run a quick errand, but you don't have your phone? Unlock your vehicle from your wrist, then activate remote start and off you go. Just please be mindful that this feature requires internet connectivity on both watch and vehicle - so don't drive into the desert and leave your vehicle, or you'll get stuck there!\n\nA note about security and privacy:\nThis app accepts two types of login. Either Tesla account credentials or a Tesla API token. Your account credentials are by default not stored in the app, but are used only once to obtain an authentication token and refresh token directly from the Tesla API server. If you would rather supply that token yourself, you can do so instead. It is preferable to supply a refresh token, as the app will then have a perpetual login. Your token will be persisted in the app. Tokens will be revoked if you change your Tesla account password. With the optional remote start feature you can choose to store your password in the app - it will be securely stored in the iOS / watchOS / iPadOS keychain. This feature is optional and is not required for all other features to function. No network traffic will ever be emitted from this app that goes anywhere other than directly to the Tesla API servers. The source code for this application will at all times be made available to any security researcher for a voluntary security and safety audit. \n\nDisclaimer: \nThis app is not endorsed by Tesla Inc. Use at your own risk. No guarantee of proper function is given. Only you are responsible for any changes to your car caused by using this app.  \n\nMade in Denmark"

It can be run either manually or automatically. \n\nManual mode allows you to run the test signal and flip the phase so you can listen yourself to ensure your sound system is setup correctly. \n\nAutomatic mode will run a series of test signals through your sound system and use the microphone on the device to analyse the results.\n\nNew in version 2.0 is a waveform view mode for advanced use. It allows you to play an asymmetrical waveform (ramp waveform), record the sound from each speaker close up and capture the waveforms to then compare them. \n\nPhase is a difficult concept so full help is available in the app to ensure you get the best results.\n\nYou should check the phase of your sound system whenever the wiring has been changed to ensure everything is the correct polarity.\n\nWhen a sound systems speakers are out of phase the sound quality is affected massively. Bass is reduced significantly and stereo imaging gives the illusion of the sounds pulling outside of the room.\n\nTo run the check connect your iOS device to your sound system so it can play audio. If possible place the iOS device evenly between the speakers. Phase cancellation will not occur close to the speakers so ensure the device is not too close. Ensure the volume is at a comfortable listening level and if possible ensure there is no background noise to interfere with the scan."

Remember, all features & updates are free forever, the only in-app purchases are donations (tip jar).\n\nPolar Scope Align will calculate the position of Polaris or σ Octantis in your Polar Scope reticle for your location (using your phone's GPS or manually), allowing a quick and accurate polar alignment. It is one of the few programs that are accurate in lower latitudes by correcting for atmospheric refraction (so expect results to agree only with precise software and not most simplistic \"polar align\" apps - see the \"Accuracy\" section in help for details). In the settings you can select the polar scope reticle that matches your own, from a vast collection:\niOptron old & new, Astro-Physics RAPAS & PASILL, various versions of Takahashi EM-10/11/200/400/500, NJP, PM-1, P2-Z, the latest Orion / Skywatcher, the Classic Skywatcher / Orion / Celestron / Meade / EXOS2 / Bresser, the Telrad, Rigel QuikFinder, a couple for Astrotrac / Losmandy / Kenko / Avalon, the Vixen PF-L/Atlux/SX/SXD/SXP/AXD/GP/GP-DX/Polarie Polar Axis Scopes, a Konus and several Polar Finders: Tuthill, Explore Scientific 8x50, Meade 9x60, Vixen Polaris, Celestron 7x50, Carton Optical. PoleMaster help view for South Hemisphere users. If you have one not included, just ask the developer to add it!\n\nFeature list:\n\n-Accurate calculation of Polaris or Sigma Oct for any date and location, including effect of atmospheric refraction (and annual aberration, nutation). Most other apps do not perform precision calculations, so please only compare app readings to accurate sources (USNO, scientific software etc).\n-Use device time/date/location, or enter your own, or pick from online & offline world databases via the Location Manager.\n-Approximate daytime / no polarscope polar alignment tool. Great for visual use, solar imaging (inc. eclipses) and even limited short focal length astrophotography. Now with sun shadow calibration for more accuracy!\n-Laser / Hop Align for nighttime alignment using a calibration star for obstructed or not visible polar star, or for improving laser align.\n-Full app in red-color (or alternative green, white) night mode - tools switchable to daytime view.\n-Deep Space Object (DSO) Database with 22000+ objects from several catalogs (Messier, Caldwell, NGC, IC, Herschell 400, Sharpless 2, Barnard), along with stars (Yale Bright Star) & planets. Search, apply filters, sorting, download DSS color images for all items, or get help finding them with your non-goto telescope with the Push-To function.\n-Connect to and control WiFi-enabled iOptron mounts.\n-Over 30 calculators useful for observing and astrophotography, from eyepiece magnification and field of view, to imaging resolution and reducers.\n-Xasteria: World astro-weather report based on 7Timer! data\n-Water vapor satellite images.\n-List of visible ISS and bright satellite passes.\n-Moon phase & lunar Calendar with solar/lunar rise/set and twilight times.\n-Wizard to calculate your reticle centering offset and correct or compensate for it.\n-Zoomable reticle view and customized routines & tools: Alt-az alignment error display for mounts that calculate it after star alignment (e.g. iOptron iEQ45, CEM60), polar alignment when your scope is not in zero position (for mounts like iOptron ZEQ/CEM on which you can always access the polar scope), remember zero position on Celestron / Skywatcher / Orion etc reticles.\n-Bubble level (using either gyro or accelerometer) and Compass heading, as well as magnetic declination reading.\n-GPS accuracy & elevation data.\n-Red/White/LED light.\n-Dimming slider.\n-iOptron, NexStar and Meade LX200 Star Lists.\n-Support for iPhone & iPad from iOS 9 (and iPod Touch, except tools that require the compass)."

      "label": "SPLnFFT is a sound level meter (noise meter) for your iPhone or iPad with many advanced features: frequency analyzer, frequency meter, test signal generator, dosimeter, ...\n\nThis soundmeter App is the only one for iOS recommended by the \"Laborers' Health and Safety Fund of North America\".\nHere are extracts from other reviews:\n\"our favorite sound measurement app\" SafetyAwakenings.com\n\"SPLnFFT is comprehensive, easy to use\" TapeOp.com\nYou will find more reviews here: https://www.facebook.com/SPLnFFT\n\nFor daily use, a very simple interface displays the level of exposure: if orange or red, protect your ears !\nProfessional users will take advantage of a wide range of accurate and reliable measurements: Leq, peak, L10, L95, taktmaximal, frequency analysis, histogram, dosemetering, ... A&C weightings are compliant with ANSI® S1.42 standard. \"468\" refers to ITU-R 468-4\n\n>>> Some KEY INFORMATION <<< :\n- you absolutely need to allow access to microphone to use this App\n- screen rotation must be un-locked\n- there are built-in help messages (speech bubble). Need more ? Contact us !: email, blog, Facebook,...\n- do not expect to measure as low as 0dB(A) in a quiet room, for these 2 reasons: 30-130dB(A) is the standard usable range for sound level meters and anyway a standard quiet room is around 30dB(A) whereas a typical anechoic chamber is 10 to 20dB(A)\n- to change frequency weightings (dB(A),dB(C),...) a LONG PRESS is required (1/3rd of a second). This is to avoid accidental changes\n\nTop digital display is for measurement of sound power in 'slow' mode (averaged on 1s). Central analog display is for 'fast' mode (averaged on 1/8th s). But it can display 'slow' mode as well on request: just click on 'fast' label.\nPeak and average values are displayed below and are held until you touch the 'reset' label. The videos on Youtube reveal more details.\n\nBottom view is a real time FFT (frequency analysis). You will notice that predominant frequency and next one are highlighted. Their frequencies and relative power are displayed on the right. If your input signal is a pure tone then this App will lock on its frequency and display a very accurate result.\nGreen line is the result of a real time FFT done with 1024 points. Purple line is the averaged FFT (exponential filtering done on power of each frequency). Blue line is a copy of what the purple line was when the user froze the display the last time.\nA test tone at 1kHz or a white noise or a pink noise can be generated and sent to right and/or left outputs (select the type you want in BEEP tab). This FFT view - more precisely an upsized version of it - can be exported as a picture in your own photo library, using the camera button (when display is frozen only).  This picture can be exported in a mail as well.\nThe display can be flipped upside-down to ease reading: just rotate your iPhone while holding it vertically.\n\nAs for ALL sound meters (thus including this one and all others at any price), calibration is suggested if you want to reach extreme precision. This is enabled in this App thanks to a slider to apply some compensation and to three non volatile memories (choice to be made in MIC. tab). How to ? For calibration, you need and external reference, either a calibrated sound meter, or a calibrated noise source.\nNote as well that the tiny embedded loudspeaker cannot reproduce extreme frequencies. Thus if you want to hear a real white or pink noise, you will need to use a quality headphone or HiFi system.\n\nThis App was designed seriously for our own needs, by a signal processing expert, and is regularly updated to maintain accuracy and reliability.\n\n***** Any comment, any feedback ? Click on 'support' in iTunes: there is a blog for this. You can even contact us directly by email  or through the dedicated FaceBook page (note 'send email' top right) *****"

Ishraq prayer is 10 to 12 minutes after sunrise. There is a misconception where Islamic websites and people use the word \"Ishraq\" and then give timings for actual Sunrise. Praying at sunrise is forbidden and must be performed after at least 10 minutes of sunrise. iPray for this reason adds 10 minutes to sunrise and labels it correctly as \"Ishraaq\".\n\n* Prayer Alerts will ONLY alert you with an initial Takbir. The full azan (and its length) is NOT supported by the iOS alert mechanism as there is a maximum limit of 30 seconds of audio playback."

The longer you have Battery Grapher installed, the more accurate future battery level predictions will be.\n\nLOW ENERGY CONSUMPTION\nBattery Grapher is made for people who want to extend the battery life, meaning that low energy usage is a priority.

You can  get the app to notify you when you battery drops below a preset percentage, or if you only have a certain number of hours left before your battery runs out. (currently only available on watchOS)\n\nALL COMPLICATIONS & WIDGET SIZES SUPPORTED\nBattery Grapher supports all complications & widget sizes.

If the Bluetooth device is paired with another iPhone, turn off Bluetooth on that iPhone.\n\nBlue Hound is always scanning for Bluetooth devices. When a device is detected, Blue Hound identifies it by name, maker and model when possible. It does this using a large database of smart recognizers that are updated automatically. Devices you find are uploaded to the cloud to help you search for them later.\n\nBlue Hound works great with Bluetooth tags. If you attach one to your keys, you can locate them within 100 feet or more even outdoors in high grass. Attach one to your drone and you will be able to find it if it lands unexpectedly.\n\nScanning for Bluetooth devices can be a fun outdoor activity. Take Blue Hound out for a walk. Enable Power Saver Mode for Blue Hound in Settings and put your iPhone in your pocket upside down. The screen will go dark and the app will enter power saver mode. If you wish, Blue Hound can even bark to alert you when a new device is found.\n\nBlue Hound has features not found in any other Bluetooth scanner or finder:\n\n• Real time Bluetooth scanner with signal strength and description\n• Sort the scanner list by age, distance or name\n• Filter the scanner list for matching text\n• List both active and inactive devices\n• Power saver option and audio alerts for scanning while walking\n• Search the cloud for devices you have found in the past\n• Search for past devices using an interactive map\n• Smart device identification using cloud updated recognizers\n• Display detailed information about a devices including is maker and model\n• Search Google for more information about the device\n• Get directions to the last known location of the device\n• Locate a device indoors using a signal strength meter\n• Locate a device outdoors using a heat map and signal graph\n• Outdoor direction finder saves time when searching\n• Display the directions on the map to triangulate the location"

Other hardware and software are required.\n\nLink to the popular JMRI software through a local Wi-Fi network to access throttle, address, and function controls wirelessly.\n-or-\nConnect directly to an MRC Prodigy WiFi module.\n-or-\nConnect directly to a Digitrax LnWi module.\n-or-\nConnect directly to a WifiTrax WFD-30/31.\n\nDigital Command Control (DCC) is now the most common control method for earnest model railroaders, allowing multiple trains to be controlled simultaneously anywhere on the track.  JMRI is an interface program that works with most brands of DCC and is very popular because it simplifies DCC programming, signaling, control, and many other aspects of running a permanent layout.  It is also free and multi-platform.  \n\nInstead of direct control through the DCC system, WiThrottle links with JMRI or a dedicated module.  This provides a universal interface to many possible combinations of technology and model railroads.  As DCC evolves, JMRI is updated as needed to match current technology.\n\nJMRI Requirements:\n- JMRI 2.12 or higher, JMRI 5.0 or newer recommended\n- DCC system interfaced to a computer and a model railroad\n- Local Wi-Fi network\n\nMRC Prodigy WiFi Requirements:\n- MRC Prodigy WiFi module\n- MRC Prodigy DCC system\n\nDigitrax LnWi Requirements:\n- Digitrax LnWi module\n- Digitrax DCC system\n\nWifiTrax WFD-30/31 Requirements:\n- WifiTrax WFD module\n- NCE DCC system\n\nIf you operate at either a club or private home that uses JMRI for operations and has Wi-Fi, access to the local network (host may need to share their password) is all you need.  Multiple iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad mobile devices may use their own WiThrottle app simultaneously during an operating session.  If you would like to sample WiThrottle, we offer a Lite version at no charge.  This allows you to confirm compatibility before buying the full App.\n\nPlease visit our website for additional information.  Our goal is to enhance your model railroading experience by providing convenient, wireless control of your existing system.  WiThrottle is the final piece of the puzzle.  \n\nFeatures:\n- Select road or yard throttle control arrangements\n- Dual throttle screen\n- F0 - F28 function controls\n- Build and break Advanced Consists\n- Link multiple addresses for control by one throttle (Universal Consists)\n- Control JMRI routes & turnouts\n- Imports roster list and function labels from your JMRI files\n- Access the JMRI WebServer for control panels and more\n- Adjust sensitivity of the throttle slider\n- Set for right or left hand use\n- Acquire and dispatch addresses wirelessly\n- Train idles if interrupted (e.g. phone call)\n- Control track power\n- Fastclock display\n- Automatic networking\n- Flashlight for devices equipped with camera flash\n\nWiThrottle will integrate seamlessly if:\n- you can already control a train using the built-in throttles of JMRI 2.12 or later\n- your iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad can access your local wireless network (not cellular or Bluetooth)"

      "label": "Recommended and shared by thousands of users! Mentioned as the iOS app to use in:\n  ◆  wired.com - How to Sweep For Bugs and Hidden Cameras\nNote that the app is just a helper tool to induce lens reflection and should be used with common sense and manual inspection of the target object.\n \nProtect your privacy from spy hidden camera lenses. Here are some actual news headlines:\n  ◆  Brits staying in Airbnb flat 'find spy camera hidden pointed at bed'\n  ◆  Oil rig worker files lawsuit: I was secretly recorded\n  ◆  Motel manager accused of setting up hidden camera\n  ◆  Models find hidden cameras in apartment\n\nA free do-it-yourself way of detecting cameras from instructables.com, also based on detecting lens reflections:\n  ◆  Step 1: Find a tube that's good for looking through. A cardboard tube from a roll of toilet paper or paper towels is best.\n  ◆  Step 2: All you need is a flashlight or something that you can use to focus a beam of light in a dark room. Attaching a couple of directional LEDs to the outside of the cardboard tube can work also if you don't have a flashlight.\n  ◆  Step 3: With one hand, hold up the toilet paper tube to your eye. With your other hand, hold up the flashlight at about eye level and point it away from you. With one eye, look through the tube and scan the room. If there are any small points of light bouncing back, inspect it further. It might be a camera.\n\nThis app is a tool to help you detect disguised camera lens that you suspect are present in a room. The manual mode with overlay is already equivalent to the do-it-yourself described above or the more expensive hardware camera detector gadgets that tries to detect using the tell-tale signs of tiny reflections of hidden camera lenses. The good thing is this app is always with you, ready when you need it.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS for the APP: \n\nUse this tool after your own visual inspection and investigation. Scan the room first without your phone and once you find something suspicious point the phone camera to the suspected object. The app alternately turns on and off the camera flash to detect the signature of a camera lens. Carefully adjusting the distance and angle relative to the target object helps as well adjusting the level of lighting in the room.\n\nWhen automatic mode is ineffective or distracting you should use manual mode. In both manual and automatic modes you must use your own judgment as this is just a tool like what you would do with an expensive hidden camera detector gadgets or the do-it-yourself detector described above.\n\nMANUAL Detection: \nAnytime that you see the signature of a camera lens you can single-tap on the screen and put a marker on the suspected camera lens.\nYellow overlay - this signifies that the surface might be metallic or glass-like and that a great amount of reflectivity is being detected.\nCyan overlay - this means that the surface is changing in color consistent with the general hue of camera lenses.\n\nAUTOMATIC Detection: \nThe app will continuously try its best to put a marker where it assesses a camera lens may be present. To exclude surfaces that are generating lots of false positives you can zoom the camera or carefully change the distance or angle of the phone to the target. Works best when room lights are dimmed and the phone is very steady.\n\nBONUS 1: EMF scanner to detect the slight magnetic field present in electronic devices including hidden spy cameras. \nBONUS 2: Some home cameras broadcast bluetooth information and this app has a scanner for bluetooth devices.\n\nBE SAFE and START SCANNING!"

It looked like an old typewriter with some extra features.\n\nBeing fully compatible with the real Enigma means you can also use Mininigma to decode any of the original messages which can be found on Internet.\n\nYou can also generate a machine configuration based on a keyword or keyphrase. That means you'll only have to share that keyword to send a message!!\n\nMininigma can accurately simulate different types of machines: The Enigma I, M3 and M4, Railway, G-312, or Swiss-K, with some others coming in the future. You can read more about these, as always, on the Wikipedia :)\n\nYou can actually select between the different machine types and setup them as you would with a real one: choose rotors, configure them, or use a plugboard to switch letters. All at the tip of your finger.\n\nMininigma supports Copy/Paste to allow you to interact with any other application on your device. You can even copy/paste machine configurations in an encryptable string!!"

The Breach Protocol app will help you upload as many as possible to cripple the enemy network!\n\nThe Breach Protocol App will find the shortest solution to upload all of your daemons, or tell if your buffer is not large enough to upload them all. If your buffer is too small you can deselect any of the daemons to exclude it and find a shorter solution with only the selected daemons. You can also exit and retry the breach or reload your game to get different sequences.\n\nUses your device's camera and on-device text recognition to read the matrix and sequences from the screen of your PC or console while you are performing a Breach Protocol hack in Cyberpunk 2077 and provide the best possible solution for your buffer size and selection of sequences.\n\nSupports all 18 \"interface\" languages in Cyberpunk 2077\n- English\r\n- Español\r\n- Español de Latinoamérica\r\n- Čeština\r\n- Français\r\n- Deutsch\r\n- Italiano\r\n- Magyar\r\n- Polski\r\n- Português Brasileiro\r\n- Русский\r\n- Türkçe\r\n- 한국어\r\n- 日本語\r\n- ภาษาไทย\r\n- 正體中文\r\n- 简体中文\n -اللغة العربية\r\n\nThe app WILL NOT WORK unless you select the language that you are using for the \"Interface\" language in Cyberpunk 2077.\nFor example, if the title of the sequences box in-game is in Chinese, you must select Chinese in the app or the text recognition will not work.\n\nDoes not work well from a distance, if you are playing on console at couch distance you may need to get your camera closer to the TV for it to work properly.\n\nDoes not require an internet connection to use.\n\nJoin our Discord server! https://discord.gg/Ud4b9YWG\nEmail us at j.cob.development@gmail.com"

The sensor is very sensitive. \n\nPerfect to use at the airport, your office, library, or in any place where you will leave your device unattended for a short while. \n\nYou can also use the app as an alarm for power surge/failure when your battery is really low and you depend on your wake-up call. Works even better with the new Volume control.\n\nAlso works if your power pack loses all the power.\n\n(When using for example an Apple Smart Power Case, you have to use the Motion Function as an alarm since the normal function senses power loss.)\n\nWorks on wireless chargers as well."

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here. Chromecast is a trademark of Google LLC."

For best results use Antenna Mate outside in an open space and away from objects which cause interference.\n\nAntenna Mate doesn't need an internet connection, that's one of the reasons why it's so fast.\n\nDETAILED TRANSMITTER INFO\n\nComplete listings of all digital terrestrial transmitters are available at each site. Listings include the callsign, frequency (MHz), channel, polarisation, and effective radiated power (kW).\n\nALL SITES BY STRENGTH OR DISTANCE\n\nPrefer to align your TV antenna with another broadcasting site? No worries! Sites can be listed from strongest to weakest, or closest to furthest away. Pick any site from the list and Antenna Mate instantly plots a new bearing to the targeted site.\n\nUsing an amplifier or high gain antenna? You can increase the search radius up to 200 km (120 mi) from your current location.\n\nLIGHT AND DARK DISPLAY SWITCHING\n\nWhen your device is in direct sunlight Antenna Mate will automatically switch to a light display making the arrow easy to see. Perfect for performing an alignment during the middle of the day.\n\nUSE IT UPSIDE DOWN, OR THE RIGHT WAY UP\n\nAntenna Mate is smart enough to know when your device is being held upside down, or the right way up. Either way, it will always point to the targeted site.\n\nSUPPORT AND FEEDBACK\n\nWe would love to hear your feedback or help you troubleshoot. Send an e-mail to support@antennamate.com or tweet @antennamate. Follow us on Twitter to get notified when transmitter data is updated.\n\n* Time taken to find best broadcasting site and directional accuracy will vary based on device and external environmental factors.\n\n** Best broadcasting site is measured by estimating maximum theoretical field strength in free space (No obstructions or reflections). Actual field strength will be lower. Closest broadcasting site is measured by estimating distance using line of sight. Distance is only an approximation.\n\n*** Based on Australian Communications and Media Authority data.\n\n**** Based on Radio Spectrum Management and OpenStreetMap data.\n\n***** Based on Ofcom data."

      "label": "Convenience on the wrist - Watch app for Tesla is the ideal companion in day to day life with your Tesla vehicle. These are just a few of the day to day conveniences this app will help achieve:\n\n - Pair your watch as a proper vehicle key, just like your phone! Works under all conditions, including in underground parking garages or in the middle of a desert!\n\n - Forgot to plug in? Get a notification if vehicle is in a pre-configured location and not plugged in - all done directly on the watch, no external servers required, keeping your privacy!\n\n - Add the graphic corner complication to your watch face and enjoy the convenience of having easy access to state of charge, charging indicator, time remaining if charging, sentry mode active indicator and indicator if any windows, doors or trunks are open. All from one complication, that also will launch the app when tapped. \n\n - During and after charge, a panel will show how much energy was added. Convenient if you schedule your charge during the night - wake up each morning and easily check how much energy was added to the battery. \n\n - If you have multiple vehicles on your account, tap the vehicle name to quickly and easily switch between them. \n\n - You can queue up commands by tapping on buttons, then put your wrist down and the commands will execute in the background when the vehicle is successfully woken up. \n\n - When you tap the unlock vehicle button, the charge port will also unlock if a charging cable is attached. That's convenience right there!\n\n - Want to reduce phantom drain? Background updates can be configured to longer intervals between updates or to only update if car is already awake or can be disabled entirely for absolutely zero impact on phantom drain.\n\n - A warning panel will show up if any doors, windows or trunks are left open. Conveniently, you can tap the panel to close any open windows.\n\n - Need to access the frunk? Just do it from your wrist - no fiddling with your phone. \n\n - Sitting comfy in the couch, but just remembered you have a road-trip in the morning? Set the charge limit to 100% - or any value really - and start charging, right from the convenience of your wrist!\n\n - Leaving the office after a long hot day? Activate the HVAC when you're on your way, and enjoy a nice cool vehicle.\n\n - When charging, tap the time remaining label to switch to show time of expected completion - no more head calculus!\n\n - Need to run a quick errand, but you don't have your phone? Unlock your vehicle from your wrist, then activate remote start and off you go. Just please be mindful that this feature requires internet connectivity on both watch and vehicle - so don't drive into the desert and leave your vehicle, or you'll get stuck there!\n\nA note about security and privacy:\nThis app accepts two types of login. Either Tesla account credentials or a Tesla API token. Your account credentials are never stored in the app, but are used only once to obtain an authentication token and refresh token directly from the Tesla API server. If you would rather supply that token yourself, you can do so instead. It is required to supply a refresh token. Your token will be persisted in the app. Tokens will be revoked if you change your Tesla account password. No network traffic will ever be emitted from this app that goes anywhere other than directly to the Tesla API servers, unless the OPTIONAL cloud processing is enabled, in which case an in-flight encrypted ACCESS token with a lifespan of 8 hours will be transmitted and stored ONLY WHILE COMMAND IS EXECUTING. The source code for this application will at all times be made available to any security researcher for a voluntary security and safety audit. \n\nDisclaimer: \nThis app is not endorsed by Tesla Inc. Use at your own risk. No guarantee of proper function is given. Only you are responsible for any changes to your car caused by using this app.  \n\nMade in Denmark"

      "label": "Necrophonic is an ITC app used for spirit communication and EVP research.\n\n8 Sounds Banks:\n\nThe audio has been mastered in a way to bring out various sound properties . \nUsing Pro Tools I was able to enhance high, mid, and low range frequencies. I also applied \nother filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an \nenvironment suitable for spirit communication.\n\nThe audio itself is made up of phonemes, \npartial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help \nspirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.\nthere are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.\n\nThese sounds banks play in a similar\nway to that of my other app \"Spiritus Ghost Box\" but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has\n8 active sound banks.\n\nWhite Noise Sound Bank:\n\nThis app also has an optional 9th sound bank called \"White noise\". \nThis bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This \naudio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the \n\"Holy Grail\" of EVP recorders. This is not a White Noise Generator, this is a normal sound bank like the others but this one contains white noise from the DR60.\n\nAudio Effects:\n\nThis app does contain Echo and Reverb audio effects. These have been proven \nto be the best effects to apply to ITC sessions. The echo can create audio that can be \nmanipulated within the echo itself. Echo can also help in live, real time communication by \nrepeating the audio and allowing you to better hear whats coming through. Reverb can be \napplied to the audio to create a spacious sound environment that will enhance audio manipulation."

Length, distance, area of any surface… Measure everything with this virtual ruler and tape measure thanks to augmented reality. \n\nMeasuring a length is now easier than with a laser meter or any other measure tool. You draw your measurement lines in 3D thanks to the camera directly on the video of your phone or tablet. You export your plans in PDF, PNG or DXF. CamToPlan is the AR measuring app that brings your measures from cam…to…plan !\n\nFor personal or professional use, always measure like a pro. Thanks to Virtual Reality (VR), you can measure floors, dimensions of walls, windows, doors or a whole home in a few seconds. No more tape measure or ruler needed!\n\nThis app has infinite applications for everybody:\n- Personal use: the length measure app for the handyman who loves DIY !\n- Real estate professionals (real estate agent, interior design decorator or designer, architect, topographer, energy adviser...): this app will help you make a floorplan of a house, apartment, a specific room of a flat.\n- Construction workers can use it to quickly measure jobs : concreter, tile layer, carpet fitter, painter, drywall guy, plasterer, builder, carpenter, electrician, plumber, slater... \n- For gardener, landscaper, swimming pool builders and maintenance, digger, earth-moving, navvy: this app also works outside\n- Cost estimation professionals: this length measure app can make pricing estimates, it will be a great assistant for quantity surveyor, price studies technician, economist…\n- Building industry: foreman, site manager or engineer can drop their tape measure and ruler to perform a quick measurement check\n\nHow does this measuring app work?\nIt relies on ARKit by Apple. Machine learning algorithms combine the device sensors data (accelerometer, gyroscope…) with odometry which analyses in real time the video of the camera and relies on visual details of images, in order to scan the environment and find the position and rotation angle of the device.\n\nPlease note: \n- you can measure in metric (meters, centimeters) or imperial units (feet, inches)\n- the app measures distances horizontally (= on the ground) and vertically!\n- no need to remove the furniture from the room for measurements. The application determines the intersection between the floor and the target, even if it is hidden.\n- The application may have difficulty with some types of tiles.\n- The accuracy is not guaranteed.\n- you can move while performing measurements to get closer to your target point, for maximum precision, even if it is not visible and calculated by extrapolation."

Ishraq prayer is 10 to 12 minutes after sunrise. There is a misconception where Islamic websites and people use the word \"Ishraq\" and then give timings for actual Sunrise. Praying at sunrise is forbidden and must be performed after at least 10 minutes of sunrise. iPray for this reason adds 10 minutes to sunrise and labels it correctly as \"Ishraaq\".\n\n* Prayer Alerts will ONLY alert you with an initial Takbir. The full azan (and its length) is NOT supported by the iOS alert mechanism as there is a maximum limit of 30 seconds of audio playback."

With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.\n\nAnd the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it is – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop. And with over 20 built-in themes and the ability to create your own, you can customize the results exactly the way you want.\n\nNoir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!\n\nBuilt from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Focus Filters and Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows. And your settings are automatically synced to all your devices using iCloud.\n\nAnd just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data. Period.\n\nNoir is made by a solo iOS developer. It does not include any subscriptions or ads. Buy Noir once, use it forever.\n\nNotes:\n• Found a website where Noir’s dark mode doesn’t look just right? Let me know by reporting it. The app will be frequently updated to address issues that are reported.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\n• The Noir extension requires access to the websites you visit to analyze the existing style of the page and to override it with Noir's dark style.\n• Noir never collects your browsing data. The only data Noir ‘collects’ are your settings, and those will never leave your device.\n• You can read Noir’s full Privacy Policy at https://getnoir.app/privacypolicy"

This app connects using a secure and session-based protocol--no passwords are transmitted in plain text.\n\nRemote access does require router configuration or NGROK, which you can test without the app by using Safari.  You should see your Blue Iris login page.\n\nKey features include:\n\n- Manage multiple Blue Iris installations\n- Geofencing: set status, send alerts, and more in response to device location *\n- Control the shield icon, schedule and profile selection\n- Receive iOS push notification alerts when a Blue Iris camera is triggered or there is a critical status message\n- Fast H.264 streaming\n- Control PTZ, IR and more for any camera that’s also controllable at the Blue Iris PC\n- Listen to and talk to any camera that’s also supported at the Blue Iris PC\n- Navigate cameras by tapping and swiping\n- Review recordings as stored on the Blue Iris PC, up to 64x speed\n- Download recorded video from the Blue Iris PC to the iOS device\n- Selectively delete recordings from the Blue Iris PC\n- Broadcast live video from the iOS device directly into a Blue Iris PC camera window\n- Remote control DIO output signals on compatible devices\n- Baby monitor functionality: continue to listen to audio with app closed or device in standby **\n\n* Note that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n** Note that continued use of audio streaming running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "This professional tool called Clinometer is the most precise (all you can get with some calculations) slope measurement tool for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad using all sides of the device plus the camera. It can be used for simple applications like aligning a frame as well as for more sophisticated fields of applications where an arbitrary slope needs to be measured exactly. Read the reviews (and write your own) for all the applications you find! Thank for all your positive feedback! Please use our support link if you have questions and suggestions, we don't read the iTunes reviews every day!\n\nWith this tool, the slope can be measured by all edges of the device and through the camera. The current features include:\n\n◆ 3 Modes (incl. auto switching): Clinometer mode (auto when holding upright), Camera mode (any direction, manual activation) and Bubble level (smoothly fading in when holding flat).\n\n◆ Relative angles: Besides measuring absolute angles, for every mode you can measure the relative angle between device positions\n\n◆ Advanced two way calibration on all sides: For every 4 sides plus the bubble mode you can calibrate in two steps, which allows you to calibrate exactly even on non-level surfaces. Each direction can be calibrated individually to achieve the optimal precision. \n\n◆ Speech synthesis: The device will speak the current reading, so you don't have to watch the display while measuring/aligning your object.\n\n◆ Five different unit modes: The device can display the slope in degrees (rounded or in tenth of degrees), percentage, rise over run (common for roof slope measurement in :12) and 1V:H (common in engineering)\n\n◆ Dial Rotation: You can smoothly rotate the background dial and thus define which side of the device represents 0° and 90° degrees. \n\n◆ Motion-sensitive Lock feature: Besides the common instant simple tap hold mechanism you can activate the motion-sensitive lock. If activated the device waits for the final lock until you hold your device steady enough for at least 2 seconds. You can set the lock sensitivity between 0.1° and 1.0° degrees. \n\n◆ Peer Mode: Use two devices to measure angles: One as a display, the other as the measurement device that can be attached to the hardware you want to align. \n\n◆ Fullscreen Mode: The full screen mode can be toggled by tapping the center of the screen and by the upper and lower arrows in the center. This prevents you from erroneous inputs while measuring.\n\n◆ Different color schemes: Press the S/C Button to instantly switch the color. The color can be selected differently for the bubble and the clinometer mode. The predefined color sets include day and night color schemes (Black on White, White on Black and Red). \n\n◆ Adjustable Auto-Lock: You can prevent the device from turning into the sleep mode. \n\nAccording to wikipedia: An inclinometer or clinometer is an instrument for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or inclination of an object with respect to gravity. It is also known as a tilt meter, tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. \n\nFor recreational use only. After the calibration it CAN (!) be very accurate especially for the main axis after calibration. The measurement is performed as well as possible (we try our best) by using the three inbuilt accelerometers. \n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! \n\nWe will improve the application long-term. This was the first application of this kind shortly after the opening of the App Store. Since then it is continuously updated and enriched with new features."

      "label": "Crowd GPS Scanner App that allows the user to quickly find the most common crowd locate GPS devices such as tile. These are the devices the size of a coin that will transmit signals back to the owners for anything up to a year with just a watch battery. Before these devices came to market tracking would require larger batteries & sim cards which would become quite large and simple to find.\nHow the Crowd Locate system works:\nCrowd locate works on the basis that when a tile is paired to a phone it will stay connected to that phone whilst paired and within approx. 30ft. Once the tile device goes out of range it will start sending a signal to \"Find me\" This signal will be collected by any persons phone that runs the tile app! This is how crowd locate works, the more people having the app the more chances the tile can be pinpointed. Once the tile has come within 30ft of another mobile phone running the app it will pinpoint that exact location on a map and send that information back to the owner of the tile! This will give the owner of the tile a real time location on a map with a time when located.\nWith our App you can search all devices within approx. 30ft and the App will list all devices detected.\nThe App will only detect devices that you don't have paired to your own phone or that are currently sending out signals because they are out of range to paired device. \nThis can be put to the test if you have a tile that has been paired to your phone. When you have a tile paired to your phone and the tile app is running on your phone the Crowd GPS Scanner App will NOT list any tiles that you own. Now swipe closed the tile app and turn off your phone then turn it back on. The tile you own will now be in lost mode because it's not connected to your phone. Whilst in lost mode it will be transmitting a signal \"Find me\" so now if you open the Crowd GPS Scanner App it will now list the tile device on the screen. Stop clear the results and start the tile App which will pair to the tile. Now if you run the Crowd GPS Scanner App it will NOT list your own device."

The reading as to be made close to the object you are searching for.\n\nTransform your iPhone in a magnetic field detector, metal detector or electronic devices detector such as smartphones, spy bugs, microphones and so on! \n\nNote that the app can't distinguish metal object from smartphone, spy bugs from other electronic device, so you will read \"found\" also in case of the presence of a metal object, so you have to perform the search away from metal objects to have a good result. \n \nConsider that the magnetometer on iPhones is on the upper right, and on iPads in the back top centre.\n\nThis app read the magnetic field and show it in a simple to use interface."

      "label": "***THIS APPLICATION DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY SERVER SIDE SERVICE***\n\nQuantumult is a powerful proxy client.\n• Right now supports protocol Shadowsocks(r), HTTP, HTTP over TLS, SOCKS5 and SOCKS5 over TLS, VMess.\n\nIt can capture all the TCP traffic and redirect under you own way by using Filter function.\n• The filter has a few types to match. For TCP traffic that has the upper layer protocol HTTP(S), 'HOST', 'HOST-SUFFIX', 'HOST-KEYWORD', 'USER-AGENT', 'GEOIP' and 'IP-CIDR' are all supported. For the other TCP traffic, 'GEOIP' and 'IP-CIDR' are supported. Especially, when deal with HTTP(S) traffic, Quantumult has another function called Rejection, it matchs the whole URL of the HTTP(S) request.\n• After match, the filter has a lot of actions to deal with the request, built-in policy 'DIRECT', 'REJECT', 'PROXY', all your servers and your customized policies. Actually you can see all the actions as a lot of paths and you can decide which request goes through which path by using filter function.\n\nMore over, Quantumult can be a convenient web develop tool on mobile device.\n• When you on the road without the Mac platform debug tools like Charles and Wireshark, you still can use Quantumult to log parts of the web request to debug some web issues.\n• Quantumult can log all the HTTP(S) request header and response header.\n• Yes, you are right it can log the HTTPS request header and response header, be sure to install and trust Quantumult root CA for this advanced function.\n\nSince quantumult has a function called PROXY, sure it can redirect your traffic to remote proxy servers. But be clear, we do NOT provide any server side service or support, you should build your own servers.\n• Like we said early Quantumult can redirect all TCP traffic through the filter function, that means you can visit different web site through different servers by the filter. See it can accelerate your network connection if you set your filter right, and of course the filter is totally customizable.\n• About the customized policy, there are 3 different types of customized policy, 'SSID', 'Latency' and 'Static'. The 'SSID' policy depends on your network enviroment, Wi-Fi, Cellular or specific Wi-Fi with the SSID your provided. The 'Latency' policy is based on the latencies of all the servers of the policy settings, the result is the shortest(The test interval has the option of 600 or 1200 seconds). The 'Static' policy is based on your manual selection of servers or other polices from the policy settings. Sure you are right, some of polices can wrap other polices, convinent, right ?\n\nAbout working state, Quantumult can work in 3 state, 'GLOBAL', 'DIRECT' AND 'AUTO'.\n• The GLOBAL state will ignore filter settings and redirect all TCP traffic through the built-in PROXY policy(you need build and add your server first).\n• The DIRECT state will ignore filter settings and redirect all TCP traffic directly to the destination web site. How this state useful ? Yes, it can be a simple web develop tools by analizing the reqeust header and response header including HTTPS.\n• The AUTO state, we call it auto because it base on the filter you set to divide the TCP traffic through different paths, like the popular ACL way.\n\nExtra, Quantumult can also work as a HTTP proxy server for devices under the same Wi-Fi, when this function is turned on, the home view will show the IP and port for other device easily to connect.\n\n\nAt last, some attentions.\n• About the location on the map of home view. It is not the real location in the real world, it's just the IP location and might not be correct."

If your buffer is too small you can deselect any of the daemons to exclude it and find a shorter solution with only the selected daemons. You can also exit and retry the breach or reload your game to get different sequences.\n\nUses your device's camera and on-device text recognition to read the matrix and sequences from the screen of your PC or console while you are performing a Breach Protocol hack in Cyberpunk 2077 and provide the best possible solution for your buffer size and selection of sequences.\n\nSupports all 18 \"interface\" languages in Cyberpunk 2077\n- English\r\n- Español\r\n- Español de Latinoamérica\r\n- Čeština\r\n- Français\r\n- Deutsch\r\n- Italiano\r\n- Magyar\r\n- Polski\r\n- Português Brasileiro\r\n- Русский\r\n- Türkçe\r\n- 한국어\r\n- 日本語\r\n- ภาษาไทย\r\n- 正體中文\r\n- 简体中文\n -اللغة العربية\r\n\nThe app WILL NOT WORK unless you select the language that you are using for the \"Interface\" language in Cyberpunk 2077.\nFor example, if the title of the sequences box in-game is in Chinese, you must select Chinese in the app or the text recognition will not work.\n\nDoes not work well from a distance, if you are playing on console at couch distance you may need to get your camera closer to the TV for it to work properly.\n\nDoes not require an internet connection to use.\n\nJoin our Discord server! https://discord.gg/Ud4b9YWG\nEmail us at j.cob.development@gmail.com"

      "label": "GEOFENCY enables fully automatic location-based time recording on iPhone, iPad, Mac & Apple Watch, where manual check-in and check-out becomes an absurdity of the past. Arrival and departure times are automatically recorded as soon as you enter or leave an interesting place – it works like magic! Of course all very energy efficient, thanks to the latest Geofencing & iBeacon technologies! With the integrated webhook feature you can even trigger your home automation system as you arrive or leave (e.g. switch on the lights when coming home)!\n\nIdeal for automatic monitoring of working hours, client visits, lunch breaks or the stays on your favorite places! GEOFENCY offers the easiest and most effective way to MONITOR your DURATION OF STAYS on interesting places.

Simply mark your points of interest on a map and leave the rest to Geofency!\n\nGEOFENCY automatically tracks the times when you enter or leave your points of interest. Simply carry your iPhone in your pocket or bag with you. You will automatically receive extensive statistics and graphics over time!\n\nAutomatic Location-based Time Tracking – The (GEO)FANCY way!\n\nFEATURES\n• Automatic location-based time tracking - 24/7 time recording for your points of interest!\n• Graphical visualization of your dwell times (by simply rotating your device to landscape) - with zoom!\n• Rich statistics: Single-, Day-, Week- & Month-Summaries.\n• Map-View: Manage your points of interest directly on a beautiful fullscreen map view.\n• Add new locations in seconds – With just one tap!\n• Runs completely in the background while trying to maintain good battery life!\n• Automatic recognition when you enter or leave a place or region.\n• Tags: To group places into tags.\n• Webhook feature: Lets you control your home automation system to e.g. switch on lights as you arrive!\n• Journaling feature: Automatic recognition of frequent visited places – to know exactly when you've been where and how long!\n• Calendar-Export: Export events automatically into your calendar (iCloud, CalDAV & Exchange) – view your data comfortable even from Mac or PC!\n• Today Widget: See the most interesting details right from the Notification Center with one swipe and be more productive!\n• Apple Watch App!\n• Export feature: Send time recordings via e.g. email in an Excel-friendly format!\n• Export time data and use it directly in Excel, Numbers or Harvest!\n\nBENEFITS\nSimple to use daily timesaver!

We will never collect or share any information about you. We respect and care about the privacy of our users!\n\nREQUIREMENTS\nFor the best and most accurate monitoring results, Wi-Fi, carrier and location services should always be enabled for Geofency. iBeacon monitoring requires at least Bluetooth 4.\n\nBATTERY USE\nContinued use of GPS in the background can significantly reduce battery life. Geofency was designed to use GPS very sparingly and never in the background. The app relies mostly on cell tower + Wi-Fi locations. This has been carefully chosen to get the best battery life.\n\nWHAT PEOPLE SAY\n• \"I had no idea that my iPhone could do such things!\"\n• \"Beautiful, polished and elegant designed. Extremely simple to use.\"\n• \"Perhaps the most overall effective app available.\"\n\nFind out more on our landing page: www.geofency.com\nSample-Scripts for easy webhook integration: www.geofency.com/geo.zip"

It is unique in that way.\n\nIt can used in all industries (food, agribusiness, mining, manufacturing, construction, defence etc) and even when doing work at home. \n\nThe advantage of it is that it can be done simply on your phone which you always have with you so there’s no need for carrying around extra little books which saves paper and pocket space.\n\nTake 5 PRA App features include: \n• Short risk assessment questions; \n• Simple email output; \n• Pause & resume Take 5; & \n• Memory of last Take 5 / hazard report. \n\nOur vision is to empower everyone to take accountability for their own health and safety at work and at home by providing a simple and cost effective tool that asks the key questions, you may not know to ask.\n\nNOTES:\n• Uses your own email to allow you to add other comments if you choose.\n• If you wish for a PDF copy in your email, simply use the email address pdfconvert@pdfconvert.me  instead of your own.\n• There is no time/date stamp as it will be identifiable with the email as it is sent prior to the task starting.\n\nSUPPORT - Please contact me at thatappguy01@gmail.com for: \n• Any bugs; \n• Request for features/improvements; \n• Requests for additional translations; or\n• If you would like this Take 5 App application customised and built for your business with your logo.\n\nIf you like the application and find it useful please share it with your friends and colleagues to help improve the safety culture for as many people as possible.\n\nWARNING – Use of this tool does not guarantee there are no risks with the work you do however will likely help you identify as many as possible. Jobs change frequently and if you don’t stop to assess the changes, it may limit your ability to identify and manage the risks adequately."

      "label": "If you’re a vinyl junkie, you want your music to sound exactly as the artist intended - and that means 33⅓ RPM, not 35. Previously, checking your turntable for accuracy was difficult and inexact. But no longer. Measuring your turntable’s speed is now as simple as setting your phone down. Just start Turntabulator, place it on your platter, and start spinning. In as little as a few seconds, Turntabulator will adapt its output to your turntable, revealing its analysis in a stabilized rotating display that has to be seen to be believed. No twisting your neck - just read and be delighted.\n\nThrough the power of Musical Analysis with Gyroscopically Indifferent Calculations (MAGIC), no gyroscope is required, so Turntabulator works just fine on older devices.  In fact, the results are more accurate than the gyroscope would provide.\n\nTurntabulator offers two measurement modes.  Quick Mode will give you results within 0.1 RPM very quickly, typically in 15 seconds or less.  Or, if you’re a perfectionist, use Exact Mode for more precise results, typically reaching 0.01 RPM error or less within one or two minutes.\n\nTurntabulator will auto-sense 33⅓ or 45 RPM, or can be fixed at either setting.  It then displays the percentage error compared to the target RPM, and whether your turntable is running slow or fast.\n\nThat’s it!  Start using Turntabulator, and make sure your vinyl sounds as perfect as possible."

      "label": "Take the guess work out of aligning any TV antenna. Within seconds Antenna Mate will accurately* point to the direction of your best** TV reception from anywhere in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. Antenna Mate is used by professional installers, caravaners, and DIYers from city and country areas.\n\nWE HAVE GOT YOU COVERED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM\n\n* 1,151 broadcasting sites.\n* 3,698 digital transmitters.\n* All cities and towns in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands where digital terrestrial television is available*****\n\nWE HAVE GOT YOU COVERED IN AUSTRALIA\n\n* 597 broadcasting sites.\n* 2,841 digital transmitters.\n* All cities and towns in QLD, NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, SA, WA and NT where digital terrestrial television is available***\n\nWE HAVE GOT YOU COVERED IN NEW ZEALAND\n\n* 35 broadcasting sites.\n* 344 transmitters\n* All cities and towns in the North and South Islands where digital terrestrial television is available****\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nUsing your current location, your device's compass, and the target site's effective radiated power, Antenna Mate instantly estimates the signal strength of all nearby sites and automatically plots a bearing to the best one**.\n\nUnder normal circumstances you should get an initial result within seconds. The longer you leave Antenna Mate open, the more accurate it will become. For best results use Antenna Mate outside in an open space and away from objects which cause interference.\n\nAntenna Mate doesn't need an internet connection, that's one of the reasons why it's so fast.\n\nDETAILED TRANSMITTER INFO\n\nComplete listings of all digital terrestrial transmitters are available at each site. Listings include the callsign, frequency (MHz), channel, polarisation, and effective radiated power (kW).\n\nALL SITES BY STRENGTH OR DISTANCE\n\nPrefer to align your TV antenna with another broadcasting site? No worries! Sites can be listed from strongest to weakest, or closest to furthest away. Pick any site from the list and Antenna Mate instantly plots a new bearing to the targeted site.\n\nUsing an amplifier or high gain antenna? You can increase the search radius up to 200 km (120 mi) from your current location.\n\nLIGHT AND DARK DISPLAY SWITCHING\n\nWhen your device is in direct sunlight Antenna Mate will automatically switch to a light display making the arrow easy to see. Perfect for performing an alignment during the middle of the day.\n\nUSE IT UPSIDE DOWN, OR THE RIGHT WAY UP\n\nAntenna Mate is smart enough to know when your device is being held upside down, or the right way up. Either way, it will always point to the targeted site.\n\nSUPPORT AND FEEDBACK\n\nWe would love to hear your feedback or help you troubleshoot. Send an e-mail to support@antennamate.com or tweet @antennamate. Follow us on Twitter to get notified when transmitter data is updated.\n\n* Time taken to find best broadcasting site and directional accuracy will vary based on device and external environmental factors.\n\n** Best broadcasting site is measured by estimating maximum theoretical field strength in free space (No obstructions or reflections). Actual field strength will be lower. Closest broadcasting site is measured by estimating distance using line of sight. Distance is only an approximation.\n\n*** Based on Australian Communications and Media Authority data.\n\n**** Based on Radio Spectrum Management and OpenStreetMap data.\n\n***** Based on Ofcom data."

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store.

I also applied \nother filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an \nenvironment suitable for spirit communication.\n\nThe audio itself is made up of phonemes, \npartial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help \nspirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.\nthere are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.\n\nThese sounds banks play in a similar\nway to that of my other app \"Spiritus Ghost Box\" but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has\n8 active sound banks.\n\nWhite Noise Sound Bank:\n\nThis app also has an optional 9th sound bank called \"White noise\". \nThis bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This \naudio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the \n\"Holy Grail\" of EVP recorders. This is not a White Noise Generator, this is a normal sound bank like the others but this one contains white noise from the DR60.\n\nAudio Effects:\n\nThis app does contain Echo and Reverb audio effects. These have been proven \nto be the best effects to apply to ITC sessions. The echo can create audio that can be \nmanipulated within the echo itself. Echo can also help in live, real time communication by \nrepeating the audio and allowing you to better hear whats coming through. Reverb can be \napplied to the audio to create a spacious sound environment that will enhance audio manipulation."

      "label": "Noir is a Safari extension that automatically adds a dark mode to every website you visit.\n\nIt makes browsing the web at night so much better. With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.\n\nAnd the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it is – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop. And with over 20 built-in themes and the ability to create your own, you can customize the results exactly the way you want.\n\nNoir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!\n\nBuilt from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Focus Filters and Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows. And your settings are automatically synced to all your devices using iCloud.\n\nAnd just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data. Period.\n\nNoir is made by a solo iOS developer. It does not include any subscriptions or ads. Buy Noir once, use it forever.\n\nNotes:\n• Found a website where Noir’s dark mode doesn’t look just right? Let me know by reporting it. The app will be frequently updated to address issues that are reported.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\n• The Noir extension requires access to the websites you visit to analyze the existing style of the page and to override it with Noir's dark style.\n• Noir never collects your browsing data. The only data Noir ‘collects’ are your settings, and those will never leave your device.\n• You can read Noir’s full Privacy Policy at https://getnoir.app/privacypolicy"

Hallelujah.\n\nThis Old House Magazine\n\n\nBalusterPro is an awesome app and can be used for a multitude of layout tasks, at your desk, on the job, in your car—wherever your phone goes, and it only costs a few bucks.\n\nGary Katz - Master finish carpenter and publisher of THISiscarpentry.com\n\n\nBalusterPro makes building that stairway more heavenly\n\nhomefixated.com\n____________________________________\n\n\nInstructions for Use:\n\nBalusterPro offers calculations for six different common handrail situations which you may encounter.  First, tap the settings button to select your measurement input method, then select the desired type of baluster installation. Use the keypad or sliders to enter your measurements for ‘Run Length’ (distance between the newel posts) and the ‘Baluster Width.’  Finally, just drag the ‘Balusters Needed’ slider to see your required number of balusters. As you adjust the ‘Balusters Needed’ slider, the “Spacing Between Balusters” will simultaneously update. Stop when your ‘Spacing Between Balusters’ meets your specific code requirements.  Tap the view button to see a list of all the centers and edges of the balusters. No longer will you need to keep pressing the add button on your traditional calculator to list your centers....they are all shown on one screen! It’s just that simple! You can display your measurements by selecting 1/16, 1/32, or metric on the main screen to determine your precision level.  If desired you can also display your result down to 1/64.  To do this, once you have done your calculation, simply tap the 'Spacing Between Balusters' result and if possible it will be further reduced down to 1/64 and displayed for 5 seconds.  This is handy if you want to cut all your fillets at once as it nearly eliminates cumulative error.  Tap the speak buttons at the bottoms of the list columns to have the app speak your measurements. \n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nCheck out my other construction related apps...StairBuilderPro for a stair stringer layout tool & TilePro for a simple tile layout tool.\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nCheck out the video demo at my website to see BalusterPro in action."

Ishraq prayer is 10 to 12 minutes after sunrise. There is a misconception where Islamic websites and people use the word \"Ishraq\" and then give timings for actual Sunrise. Praying at sunrise is forbidden and must be performed after at least 10 minutes of sunrise. iPray for this reason adds 10 minutes to sunrise and labels it correctly as \"Ishraaq\".\n\n* Prayer Alerts will ONLY alert you with an initial Takbir. The full azan (and its length) is NOT supported by the iOS alert mechanism as there is a maximum limit of 30 seconds of audio playback."

      "label": "***THIS APPLICATION DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY SERVER SIDE SERVICE***\n\nQuantumult is a powerful proxy client.\n• Right now supports protocol Shadowsocks(r), HTTP, HTTP over TLS, SOCKS5 and SOCKS5 over TLS, VMess.\n\nIt can capture all the TCP traffic and redirect under you own way by using Filter function.\n• The filter has a few types to match. For TCP traffic that has the upper layer protocol HTTP(S), 'HOST', 'HOST-SUFFIX', 'HOST-KEYWORD', 'USER-AGENT', 'GEOIP' and 'IP-CIDR' are all supported. For the other TCP traffic, 'GEOIP' and 'IP-CIDR' are supported. Especially, when deal with HTTP(S) traffic, Quantumult has another function called Rejection, it matchs the whole URL of the HTTP(S) request.\n• After match, the filter has a lot of actions to deal with the request, built-in policy 'DIRECT', 'REJECT', 'PROXY', all your servers and your customized policies. Actually you can see all the actions as a lot of paths and you can decide which request goes through which path by using filter function.\n\nMore over, Quantumult can be a convenient web develop tool on mobile device.\n• When you on the road without the Mac platform debug tools like Charles and Wireshark, you still can use Quantumult to log parts of the web request to debug some web issues.\n• Quantumult can log all the HTTP(S) request header and response header.\n• Yes, you are right it can log the HTTPS request header and response header, be sure to install and trust Quantumult root CA for this advanced function.\n\nSince quantumult has a function called PROXY, sure it can redirect your traffic to remote proxy servers. But be clear, we do NOT provide any server side service or support, you should build your own servers.\n• Like we said early Quantumult can redirect all TCP traffic through the filter function, that means you can visit different web site through different servers by the filter. See it can accelerate your network connection if you set your filter right, and of course the filter is totally customizable.\n• About the customized policy, there are 3 different types of customized policy, 'SSID', 'Latency' and 'Static'. The 'SSID' policy depends on your network enviroment, Wi-Fi, Cellular or specific Wi-Fi with the SSID your provided. The 'Latency' policy is based on the latencies of all the servers of the policy settings, the result is the shortest(The test interval has the option of 600 or 1200 seconds). The 'Static' policy is based on your manual selection of servers or other polices from the policy settings. Sure you are right, some of polices can wrap other polices, convinent, right ?\n\nAbout working state, Quantumult can work in 3 state, 'GLOBAL', 'DIRECT' AND 'AUTO'.\n• The GLOBAL state will ignore filter settings and redirect all TCP traffic through the built-in PROXY policy(you need build and add your server first).\n• The DIRECT state will ignore filter settings and redirect all TCP traffic directly to the destination web site. How this state useful ? Yes, it can be a simple web develop tools by analizing the reqeust header and response header including HTTPS.\n• The AUTO state, we call it auto because it base on the filter you set to divide the TCP traffic through different paths, like the popular ACL way.\n\nExtra, Quantumult can also work as a HTTP proxy server for devices under the same Wi-Fi, when this function is turned on, the home view will show the IP and port for other device easily to connect.\n\n\nAt last, some attentions.\n• About the location on the map of home view. It is not the real location in the real world, it's just the IP location and might not be correct."

You can launch the app to view an animated display of live data (updated every 10 seconds while it's open), or add a complication to your watch face so that you always know how much battery you have left. Note that complications aren't allowed to refresh as often, so that will update roughly every 30 minutes if you add one.\n\nThe app displays solar, battery, grid and home power usage as well as how much charge is left in your Powerwall.\n\nThere's two main items in the app, showing live power data as well as a daily summary total telling you how much solar you've generated, home power used and how much grid power you've imported and exported.\n\nThis is a fully stand-alone watch app, it can run stand-alone and without your Apple Watch once you've signed in.\n\nNew to version 1.4, this app now works with solar only installations as well, so you don't need a Powerwall to use it, if you have Tesla solar panels you can see live stats and a day summary for that as well!\n\nAs of version 2.0, this app supports 2FA/MFA accounts as well.\n\nWe use this app personally every day and will endeavour to keep it up to date and add more features over time.\n\nNote:\nA Tesla Powerwall or a Tesla Solar Installation, and Tesla account are required to use this app. Your account details are stored in the built in secure Keychain on your device. They are only transmitted to Tesla's servers for authentication purposes on login. This app contains no first or third party tracking whatsoever. We take great care to respect your privacy and your data remains your data.\n\nDisclaimer:\nThis app is not made or endorsed by Tesla. It's built by nerds who couldn't get enough of watching that mesmerising Powerwall animation and wanted it on their watches. It has an iPhone counterpart only because it needs to use a web based login to work."

      "label": "This tool shows you the ultimate precise time of day. To achieve this, it uses a special internet time protocol to fetch the time from an atomic time server.\n\nWe are proud to offer version 5 of the Gorgy Timing Atomic Clock. The program is one of the classic applications since the early days of the Apple App Store and has been continually improved based on user feedback.\n\nThe Gorgy Timing Atomic Clock shows the precise time of day. To achieve this, it uses a special internet time protocol to fetch the ultimate precise time from cesium atomic clocks available on the internet, or any other time server you like.\n\nThe graphical display mimics the clock display of the legendary Gorgy Timing clocks, which are used in professional radio and television studios, and we spent much effort to bring the original feeling of these wickedly expensive clocks to your iPhone. This app is used by BBC studios, astronomers, concert promoters, etc. \n\nVersion 5 contains the following functions:\n\n* Universal support for all iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices running iOS 8 or higher (including iPhone 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, and all of the latest iPads and iPads Pro)\n* Optimized for iOS 13 and watchOS 6, full 64 bit support\n* Alarm function with snooze (touch anywhere on the screen), volume fade-in, based on weekdays\n* Alarm time based on seconds (not minutes)\n* Local time / UTC time mode\n* Alarm notification window instead of normal alarm sound, if app is not running or in the background\n* Use playlists or a manual picker selection from your own music library as alarm sounds\n* The alarm sound is also playing when the device is muted, or the display is switched off, and also works in AirPlay environments\n* Customizable time server sources\n* Colors: green, red, blue, yellow, white, dark green, violet, pink, orange, turquoise and hidden, with a separate color option for digits, seconds and segments\n* Alternative visual display of fractional seconds (1/60th sec. resolution)\n* 12/24 hours display\n* Optional second tick sound\n* Full landscape support (including settings dialog)\n* Touching the display lets the buttons and status bar fade out\n* Touching the display again will add the current date (in all orientations)\n* Disabled screen auto-lock\n* Options \"sync at startup\", \"hourly\", \"daily\", or a sync button for manual syncing\n* The last known time delta is used when started without sync\n* \"Night mode\", which dims the display using a slider, shows the seconds with only one dot (to prevent a hard brightness switch between second 59 and second 0), switches off the tick sound, and reduces screen updates to save battery\n* To minimize burn-in effects (especially on the iPhone X OLED display), the clock is doing micro movements when running longer than 5 minutes\n* VoiceOver support\n\nAnswers to common questions:\n\n* An application can not set your device's system time, so a time sync between the atomic time and the device time is not possible.\n* If you want to wakeup with music, please do not exit the app before going to sleep (which would result in a local notification dialog without music in the morning), and do not lock your device. Be aware that running an application all the time, even without display, consumes battery, so please make sure that your iPhone is fully charged before you go to bed, connect it to your charger, or use the app's Night mode, which is much more energy-saving."

      "label": "Apart from the most reliable app for polar alignment (with or without a polar scope), PS Align pro has become the astronomer's swiss-army knife with all the tools added over the years. Remember, all features & updates are free forever, the only in-app purchases are donations (tip jar).\n\nPolar Scope Align will calculate the position of Polaris or σ Octantis in your Polar Scope reticle for your location (using your phone's GPS or manually), allowing a quick and accurate polar alignment. It is one of the few programs that are accurate in lower latitudes by correcting for atmospheric refraction (so expect results to agree only with precise software and not most simplistic \"polar align\" apps - see the \"Accuracy\" section in help for details). In the settings you can select the polar scope reticle that matches your own, from a vast collection:\niOptron old & new, Astro-Physics RAPAS & PASILL, various versions of Takahashi EM-10/11/200/400/500, NJP, PM-1, P2-Z, the latest Orion / Skywatcher, the Classic Skywatcher / Orion / Celestron / Meade / EXOS2 / Bresser, the Telrad, Rigel QuikFinder, a couple for Astrotrac / Losmandy / Kenko / Avalon, the Vixen PF-L/Atlux/SX/SXD/SXP/AXD/GP/GP-DX/Polarie Polar Axis Scopes, a Konus and several Polar Finders: Tuthill, Explore Scientific 8x50, Meade 9x60, Vixen Polaris, Celestron 7x50, Carton Optical. PoleMaster help view for South Hemisphere users. If you have one not included, just ask the developer to add it!\n\nFeature list:\n\n-Accurate calculation of Polaris or Sigma Oct for any date and location, including effect of atmospheric refraction (and annual aberration, nutation). Most other apps do not perform precision calculations, so please only compare app readings to accurate sources (USNO, scientific software etc).\n-Use device time/date/location, or enter your own, or pick from online & offline world databases via the Location Manager.\n-Approximate daytime / no polarscope polar alignment tool. Great for visual use, solar imaging (inc. eclipses) and even limited short focal length astrophotography. Now with sun shadow calibration for more accuracy!\n-Laser / Hop Align for nighttime alignment using a calibration star for obstructed or not visible polar star, or for improving laser align.\n-Full app in red-color (or alternative green, white) night mode - tools switchable to daytime view.\n-Deep Space Object (DSO) Database with 22000+ objects from several catalogs (Messier, Caldwell, NGC, IC, Herschell 400, Sharpless 2, Barnard), along with stars (Yale Bright Star) & planets. Search, apply filters, sorting, download DSS color images for all items, or get help finding them with your non-goto telescope with the Push-To function.\n-Connect to and control WiFi-enabled iOptron mounts.\n-Over 30 calculators useful for observing and astrophotography, from eyepiece magnification and field of view, to imaging resolution and reducers.\n-Xasteria: World astro-weather report based on 7Timer! data\n-Water vapor satellite images.\n-List of visible ISS and bright satellite passes.\n-Moon phase & lunar Calendar with solar/lunar rise/set and twilight times.\n-Wizard to calculate your reticle centering offset and correct or compensate for it.\n-Zoomable reticle view and customized routines & tools: Alt-az alignment error display for mounts that calculate it after star alignment (e.g. iOptron iEQ45, CEM60), polar alignment when your scope is not in zero position (for mounts like iOptron ZEQ/CEM on which you can always access the polar scope), remember zero position on Celestron / Skywatcher / Orion etc reticles.\n-Bubble level (using either gyro or accelerometer) and Compass heading, as well as magnetic declination reading.\n-GPS accuracy & elevation data.\n-Red/White/LED light.\n-Dimming slider.\n-iOptron, NexStar and Meade LX200 Star Lists.\n-Support for iPhone & iPad from iOS 9 (and iPod Touch, except tools that require the compass)."

LightSpectrumPro EVO has an error of 2 - 8% compared to existing professional products on the market. in addition to the color temperature measurement in Kelvin, LightSpectrumPro EVO allows you to view the color spectrum of the light being examined with a band ranging from 360nm to 800nm. in addition to the spectrum it is possible to display the position of the white point on the CIE 1931 diagram and to apply a filter for wavelengths to display in overlay on the image captured by the cameras which elements reflect a specific frequency and with what intensity."

If you do not want something of the sort to happen, thing about accessing all sites via the HTTPS technology.\n\nHTTPS Now is a Safari extension (content blocker) that protects your browsing activity by automatically enabling the HTTPS protocol on all websites that you visit. By loading the HTTPS version of websites into your browser, all your traffic will be encrypted, reliable and surveillance free.\n\nAlthough major websites already encrypt the traffic by using HTTPS, it’s not guaranteed that you use this technology - sometimes is not active by default or some embedded assets are loaded through the default and unencrypted HTTP connections. Also, clicking links can redirect you to the insecure versions of sites. Actually more than 75% of websites out there still rely on unencrypted HTTP communications.\n\nThe HTTPS Now extension will fix these problems by rewriting all your requests from HTTP to HTTPS. It will also make sure that the assets from the visited websites (images, styles, scripts or ads) are transferred via the safe HTTPS and no one can steal your cookies, passwords, sessions or private data.\n\n• What is the HTTPS protocol and why should you care?\nDid you know that browsing the web in a coffee shop, airport or hotel with free internet access can be dangerous? Even your own home or company internet connection is not safe. This is because the common HTTP web traffic can be intercepted in clear text, inspected and even modified by anyone.\nHTTPS has significantly more secure since this protocol will encrypt your communications.\n\n• The benefits of the HTTPS protocol and why should you use it?\n- Faster page loading: data sent over HTTPS loads faster since the new HTTP/2 protocol is available in Safari only on encrypted communications\n- Confidentiality: no one can read your content, passwords or messages\n- Integrity: your traffic cannot be modified - for example, no key-loggers can be injected\n- Authentication: your site cannot be routed to a clone without you knowing it\n\n• Is this a VPN service?\nNo, this extension is not a VPN service, but is very efficient and safe as a VPN. This extension will make sure you are using only HTTPS in your surfing and the usage of HTTPS will make your traffic encrypted, reliable and surveillance free. Also, HTTPS is much faster than a VPN.\n\n• Support\nWe read your support emails every day, day by day.\nWrite with confidence any question, feedback or complaint and you will receive an answer in a very short period of time."

Here are some actual news headlines:\n  ◆  Brits staying in Airbnb flat 'find spy camera hidden pointed at bed'\n  ◆  Oil rig worker files lawsuit: I was secretly recorded\n  ◆  Motel manager accused of setting up hidden camera\n  ◆  Models find hidden cameras in apartment\n\nA free do-it-yourself way of detecting cameras from instructables.com, also based on detecting lens reflections:\n  ◆  Step 1: Find a tube that's good for looking through. A cardboard tube from a roll of toilet paper or paper towels is best.\n  ◆  Step 2: All you need is a flashlight or something that you can use to focus a beam of light in a dark room. Attaching a couple of directional LEDs to the outside of the cardboard tube can work also if you don't have a flashlight.\n  ◆  Step 3: With one hand, hold up the toilet paper tube to your eye. With your other hand, hold up the flashlight at about eye level and point it away from you. With one eye, look through the tube and scan the room. If there are any small points of light bouncing back, inspect it further. It might be a camera.\n\nThis app is a tool to help you detect disguised camera lens that you suspect are present in a room. The manual mode with overlay is already equivalent to the do-it-yourself described above or the more expensive hardware camera detector gadgets that tries to detect using the tell-tale signs of tiny reflections of hidden camera lenses. The good thing is this app is always with you, ready when you need it.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS for the APP: \n\nUse this tool after your own visual inspection and investigation. Scan the room first without your phone and once you find something suspicious point the phone camera to the suspected object. The app alternately turns on and off the camera flash to detect the signature of a camera lens. Carefully adjusting the distance and angle relative to the target object helps as well adjusting the level of lighting in the room.\n\nWhen automatic mode is ineffective or distracting you should use manual mode. In both manual and automatic modes you must use your own judgment as this is just a tool like what you would do with an expensive hidden camera detector gadgets or the do-it-yourself detector described above.\n\nMANUAL Detection: \nAnytime that you see the signature of a camera lens you can single-tap on the screen and put a marker on the suspected camera lens.\nYellow overlay - this signifies that the surface might be metallic or glass-like and that a great amount of reflectivity is being detected.\nCyan overlay - this means that the surface is changing in color consistent with the general hue of camera lenses.\n\nAUTOMATIC Detection: \nThe app will continuously try its best to put a marker where it assesses a camera lens may be present. To exclude surfaces that are generating lots of false positives you can zoom the camera or carefully change the distance or angle of the phone to the target. Works best when room lights are dimmed and the phone is very steady.\n\nBONUS 1: EMF scanner to detect the slight magnetic field present in electronic devices including hidden spy cameras. \nBONUS 2: Some home cameras broadcast bluetooth information and this app has a scanner for bluetooth devices.\n\nBE SAFE and START SCANNING!"

      "label": "On a slow connection? Speed up Safari with Speedafari!\n\n\"Kinda crazy, but it works.\" - Federico Viticci, Macstories.net\n\nSpeedafari blocks unnecessary parts of websites from loading. By removing part of the experience (ads, tracking scripts, external fonts, videos, etc.), you save time, battery, and data.\n\nSpeedafari is always just a swipe away, in the notification center. Just tap once, and — boom — Safari speeds up. No need to switch browser.\n\nEasily switch between three different aggressiveness levels — low, medium, and high. The higher the aggressiveness, the more will be blocked, and the faster the page will load. Note that some website functions may not work at all with the medium and high levels.\n\nWhitelist the sites you love to support them, by letting them show you ads.\n\nUse the Speedafari URL scheme to toggle speedup and change the aggressiveness, from inside other apps. For example, you can make Speedafari semi-automatically trigger upon leaving home, by using it in combination with the Launch Center Pro app.\n\nOut in the woods? With Speedafari, you don't need to worry about slow internet anymore!\n\n\"Speedafari is a blocker that strips away everything it can so you can still load pages even when your connection is crap.\" - Thorin Klosowski, Lifehacker.com\n\nOh, and don't worry about privacy! Speedafari has no access at all as to what web pages you visit.\n\nNote that all features are included in the download price, and that in-app purchases are not required to unlock anything. The in-app purchases simply provide a means to voluntarily support the development of Speedafari.\n\nWhat our users say:\n\n– \"You didn't know that you needed this nifty little app until you used it; then, you wondered how you could have gone this long without it! Flawless so far.\"\n– \"On its highest level of blocking it eliminates *all* graphics, which is terrific if you have limited bandwidth or just want to get to a site's text. [...] Very useful, unique features make this a must-have for me. Recommended.\"\n– \"The ability to quickly turn it on and off and change the aggressiveness through the notification menu is a win win.\"\n– \"It works beautifully.\"\n– \"One of the best app purchases made\"\n– \"Get it. Quickly.\"\n\nDeveloped and designed by Arvid Lunnemark."

      "label": "This professional tool called Clinometer is the most precise (all you can get with some calculations) slope measurement tool for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad using all sides of the device plus the camera. It can be used for simple applications like aligning a frame as well as for more sophisticated fields of applications where an arbitrary slope needs to be measured exactly. Read the reviews (and write your own) for all the applications you find! Thank for all your positive feedback! Please use our support link if you have questions and suggestions, we don't read the iTunes reviews every day!\n\nWith this tool, the slope can be measured by all edges of the device and through the camera. The current features include:\n\n◆ 3 Modes (incl. auto switching): Clinometer mode (auto when holding upright), Camera mode (any direction, manual activation) and Bubble level (smoothly fading in when holding flat).\n\n◆ Relative angles: Besides measuring absolute angles, for every mode you can measure the relative angle between device positions\n\n◆ Advanced two way calibration on all sides: For every 4 sides plus the bubble mode you can calibrate in two steps, which allows you to calibrate exactly even on non-level surfaces. Each direction can be calibrated individually to achieve the optimal precision. \n\n◆ Speech synthesis: The device will speak the current reading, so you don't have to watch the display while measuring/aligning your object.\n\n◆ Five different unit modes: The device can display the slope in degrees (rounded or in tenth of degrees), percentage, rise over run (common for roof slope measurement in :12) and 1V:H (common in engineering)\n\n◆ Dial Rotation: You can smoothly rotate the background dial and thus define which side of the device represents 0° and 90° degrees. \n\n◆ Motion-sensitive Lock feature: Besides the common instant simple tap hold mechanism you can activate the motion-sensitive lock. If activated the device waits for the final lock until you hold your device steady enough for at least 2 seconds. You can set the lock sensitivity between 0.1° and 1.0° degrees. \n\n◆ Peer Mode: Use two devices to measure angles: One as a display, the other as the measurement device that can be attached to the hardware you want to align. \n\n◆ Fullscreen Mode: The full screen mode can be toggled by tapping the center of the screen and by the upper and lower arrows in the center. This prevents you from erroneous inputs while measuring.\n\n◆ Different color schemes: Press the S/C Button to instantly switch the color. The color can be selected differently for the bubble and the clinometer mode. The predefined color sets include day and night color schemes (Black on White, White on Black and Red). \n\n◆ Adjustable Auto-Lock: You can prevent the device from turning into the sleep mode. \n\nAccording to wikipedia: An inclinometer or clinometer is an instrument for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or inclination of an object with respect to gravity. It is also known as a tilt meter, tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. \n\nFor recreational use only. After the calibration it CAN (!) be very accurate especially for the main axis after calibration. The measurement is performed as well as possible (we try our best) by using the three inbuilt accelerometers. \n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! \n\nWe will improve the application long-term. This was the first application of this kind shortly after the opening of the App Store. Since then it is continuously updated and enriched with new features."

      "label": "Use your iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad as a throttle for model railroad control!\n**PLEASE NOTE**  This App is not a stand-alone product!  Other hardware and software are required.\n\nLink to the popular JMRI software through a local Wi-Fi network to access throttle, address, and function controls wirelessly.\n-or-\nConnect directly to an MRC Prodigy WiFi module.\n-or-\nConnect directly to a Digitrax LnWi module.\n-or-\nConnect directly to a WifiTrax WFD-30/31.\n\nDigital Command Control (DCC) is now the most common control method for earnest model railroaders, allowing multiple trains to be controlled simultaneously anywhere on the track.  JMRI is an interface program that works with most brands of DCC and is very popular because it simplifies DCC programming, signaling, control, and many other aspects of running a permanent layout.  It is also free and multi-platform.  \n\nInstead of direct control through the DCC system, WiThrottle links with JMRI or a dedicated module.  This provides a universal interface to many possible combinations of technology and model railroads.  As DCC evolves, JMRI is updated as needed to match current technology.\n\nJMRI Requirements:\n- JMRI 2.12 or higher, JMRI 5.0 or newer recommended\n- DCC system interfaced to a computer and a model railroad\n- Local Wi-Fi network\n\nMRC Prodigy WiFi Requirements:\n- MRC Prodigy WiFi module\n- MRC Prodigy DCC system\n\nDigitrax LnWi Requirements:\n- Digitrax LnWi module\n- Digitrax DCC system\n\nWifiTrax WFD-30/31 Requirements:\n- WifiTrax WFD module\n- NCE DCC system\n\nIf you operate at either a club or private home that uses JMRI for operations and has Wi-Fi, access to the local network (host may need to share their password) is all you need.  Multiple iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad mobile devices may use their own WiThrottle app simultaneously during an operating session.  If you would like to sample WiThrottle, we offer a Lite version at no charge.  This allows you to confirm compatibility before buying the full App.\n\nPlease visit our website for additional information.  Our goal is to enhance your model railroading experience by providing convenient, wireless control of your existing system.  WiThrottle is the final piece of the puzzle.  \n\nFeatures:\n- Select road or yard throttle control arrangements\n- Dual throttle screen\n- F0 - F28 function controls\n- Build and break Advanced Consists\n- Link multiple addresses for control by one throttle (Universal Consists)\n- Control JMRI routes & turnouts\n- Imports roster list and function labels from your JMRI files\n- Access the JMRI WebServer for control panels and more\n- Adjust sensitivity of the throttle slider\n- Set for right or left hand use\n- Acquire and dispatch addresses wirelessly\n- Train idles if interrupted (e.g. phone call)\n- Control track power\n- Fastclock display\n- Automatic networking\n- Flashlight for devices equipped with camera flash\n\nWiThrottle will integrate seamlessly if:\n- you can already control a train using the built-in throttles of JMRI 2.12 or later\n- your iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad can access your local wireless network (not cellular or Bluetooth)"

Additionally, all of this information is available off-line, so if your favorite Apothecary is out of cell range and you're looking for that special Crystal, Herb or Essential Oil then your Book of Shadows is still only a tap away!\n\nBook of Shadows is all about positive energies and does not contain anything which is harmful to others or deals in the darker side of magick (occult, Black Magick).\n\nFor more information about Book of Shadows check out\nhttp://www.bookofshadows.com.au/"

      "label": "%Cover is an environmental application designed for use on iOS devices. It utilises standard smart phone technology (such as camera, GPS, date/time) to apply existing assessment techniques, used by environmental professionals, students and amateurs, in the ecological assessment of vegetation cover; i.e. the amount of canopy leaf cover versus leaf gap, above a nominated point along a transect or under an individual tree.\n\nThe amount of leaf cover is expressed as a percentage value and is a commonly used metric in the environmental monitoring, classification and condition assessment of vegetation communities. The existing field practice for estimating the percentage of canopy cover is to visually assess the canopy cover using a hard copy reference sheet, with black and white images showing incremental area increases of 10%; from entirely white (0%) to entirely black (100%).\n\n%Cover was designed to be a simple digital application of an established scientific method for the measurement and monitoring of leaf canopy cover. Smartphone technology provides a platform for the collection and analysis of environmental monitoring data, therefore minimising the amount of specialised field equipment."

Shake to clean out the lab monkey cages, pinch to grant sentience to a toaster, and flip to mix a deadly neurotoxin. \n\nClaim Your Rewards \nAs you level up in CARROT’s twisted little game, she’ll unlock gifts like new songs, app upgrades, and even a collection of bedtime stories. Who doesn't love a good bedtime story? \n\n** WARNING ** Do Not Fall Back Asleep \nCARROT loves waking up sleepy humans. But be careful! Try to sleep in, and you’ll make CARROT upset.

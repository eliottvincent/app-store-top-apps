      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

      "label": "Dive into the heart of Bois Jacques on a unique immersive journey with the Easy Company thanks to Overlap Reality®, a technology developed by SkyBoy that enhances the effects of augmented reality.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Bois Jacques, an historic site of the Battle of the Ardennes, was the scene of terrible battles between the American and German armies.\n\nIn December, 1944, Bastogne is situated on the route of the German Fifth Armoured Division. The Germans have a very clear plan, which involves taking the important crossroads that form Bastogne as quickly as possible and heading towards the river Meuse: the Panzer Lehr Division 130 must capture the town by surprise, while the Panzer Division 2 must bypass it and attack the Meuse. Meanwhile, the Volks-Grenadiere-Division 26 must attack the resistance pocket.\n\nBut the Americans on the ground and the reinforcements hastily sent in in trucks resist to defend the city! And on December 19, the 101st American Airborne Division comes to the rescue. However, The GIs are quickly surrounded.\n\nIt is in this context that, on December 20, 1944, the 2nd Battalion of the 506th Parachute Regiment, of which the famous Easy Company is a member (“Band of Brothers”), takes up position in Bois Jacques. It will remain there until the beginning of January, 1945, before giving way to other units of the 101st Airborne Division.\n\nAfter fierce resistance to German attacks, the time comes for the American counter-attack in early January, 1945. In mid-January, the German army is still resisting fiercely but is seriously weakened: its supply is becoming increasingly complicated and its tanks run out of fuel. On January 28, 1945, the Battle of the Ardennes comes to an end. Its consequences prove decisive for the continuation of the conflict, and deal a fatal blow to Adolf Hitler’s ambitions.\n\nAware of the exceptional heritage character and historical value of this site, the City of Bastogne, IDELUX and INTERREG wished to promote it.\n\nUsing a dedicated mobile application, this particular digital project offers visitors of Bois Jacques the chance to be plunged into a series of six immersive, 360°, geo-localised videos, each lasting two to three minutes. Each audiovisual work, a true historical re-enactment, follows soldiers who belong to one of the Easy Company’s divisions, recounting a scene from their daily life of war, each spot being about a particular day and event.\n\nBenjamin Brillaud, alias NOTA BENE, is the red thread of the journey but knows to regularly disappear so as to allow the spectator to enter into the heart of history, inviting them to put themselves in the soldiers' shoes.\n\nThis mobile application is funded by the INTERREG V A GRANDE REGION programme as part of the “Land of Memory” project. It is produced by SKY BOY on behalf of IDELUX Public Projects.\n\nThe application is available in French, English, Dutch and German.\n\nHow does it work?\n 1/ Meet at Bois Jacques\n 2/ Scan the QR code or connect to the \"Bois Jacques\" Wi-Fi\n 3/ Download the application in the app-store of your smartphone\n 4/ Launch the application to load the content\n 5/ Place yourself on one of the points materialized by a target\n 6/ At each point of interest, aim at the target and click on the screen to start the video"

      "label": "Join hundreds of thousands of families! \nAs adults, we've all dreamed of being able to easily learn a new language, but those of us who have tried know how complicated it can be. That's why we have developed a revolutionary method for children aged 3 to 12. Children have the brain plasticity to learn new languages far more easily than adults!\n\n====================\nWHY DO CHILDREN AND PARENTS LOVE THE HOLY OWLY METHOD?\nIt's not just an app: Holy Owly is the result of 3 years of research and development within a school, where teachers, linguist researchers and hundreds of children have participated in the development of the pedagogical method and unique content.\nOur commitment:\nOnly 5 minutes a day of learning: this format constitutes a daily ritual encouraging memory anchoring without over exposure to screens,\nChildren learn while having fun: thanks to our teaching method and the immersive adventure in which they participate, they learn 3 words or sentences 6 days a week on a theme from everyday life, \nChildren practice speaking: to learn a language you have to speak it! Our voice recognition system will allow children to practice on their own and improve their pronunciation. We make children proud to express themselves!\nOur content is curated for every age group during childhood, with a personalised course that adapts to each child's learning pace. Each year, children will be able to continue their adventure and continue to enrich their vocabulary and progress in oral expression.  \n\nThe Holy Owly method is organised in 7 stages: Discover, Repeat, Choose, Classify, Memorise, Play and Check. \n\n====================\nRECOMMENDED BY TEACHERS\nHoly Owly is the number one English application for children in France and is also recommended by teachers. Following numerous requests, we have adapted our methodology to schools in partnership with the publisher Bordas, and it is now used in several hundred classes in France! \n\n====================\nIn order to use all the functions of the application, you will have to choose a monthly or yearly subscription. You will have one week free before the first payment.\nTRY IT OUT WITH OUR FREE TRIAL WEEK\n\n====================\nThe content is 100% secure: without ads, children can learn safely.

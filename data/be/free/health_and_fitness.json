      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985.

      "label": "Virtuagym Food: Helping you to live healthy and feel great. Get a free personalized nutrition plan by answering a few questions about your lifestyle and goals. We support plans for many goals: weight loss, maintaining weight, weight gain and building muscle. Eat what you want, but keep an eye on those calories, carbs and fats!\n\nFEATURES\n* Food Database Validated by Expert Nutritionists\n* Add your own foods\n* Save meals and add them instantly next time\n* Nutrition tracking for several goals (e.g. weight loss & muscle building)\n* More than a calorie counter: keep an eye on those carbs, proteins and fats as well\n* Integrated with Virtuagym Fitness for home & gym workouts\n* Health app integration: Sync workouts from other apps, and save your eaten calories, carbs, proteins and fat in the Health app, so other apps can use this data\n\nWHY VIRTUAGYM IS THE BEST\n- Many other nutrition apps or calorie counters don’t have a lot of knowledge about fitness. Therefore, mistakes are being made with calorie tracking. Our apps are made in cooperation with fitness professionals and expert nutritionists, making Virtuagym the most accurate app on the market.\n- It’s not a regular calorie counter. We count everything: carbs, proteins and fats, allowing you to use Virtuagym food for other goals than weight loss, like gaining weight and muscle building.\n - We were one of the first apps in the Health and Fitness category and over the last few years we have been featured in the Health and Fitness category in several countries.\n\nVALIDATED FOOD DATABASE\nOur food database is linked to several official food databases. These food databases are updated on a regular basis. The foods on this list have been validated by expert nutritionists.\n\nFOR A VARIETY OF GOALS:\n- Weight loss: focus on those calories to lose weight. Combine our calorie counter with exercising with Virtuagym Fitness and reach your goals!\n- Maintaining weight: find the diet plan that’s right for you. You’ll get a balanced diet plan, with enough calories, carbs, proteins and fats.\n- Gain weight: eat, eat, eat. Find out which foods help you to reach your goals.\n- Building muscle: you’ll need protein. Lots of protein. Use our protein counter to see which foods are best for you.\n\nDIFFERENT DIET PLANS:\nWe have diet plans for multiple goals. You can select your own diet plan (low carb, high protein, low calorie, whatever you want), and we provide you with your personal diet plan. Virtuagym Food comes with several diet plans:\n- Durable\n- High Protein Diet\n- Low Carb Diet\n- Muscle Building Diet\n- Athlete\n- Cardio \n- After Weight Loss Diet\n- Custom: select your own percentages of carbohydrates, proteins and fats.\n\nAnother good thing about Virtuagym Food is that it can be used by vegetarians as well. You can eat whatever you want. Just keep an eye on the nutrients. So if you are vegetarian, just create your own vegetarian diet plan!\n\nFULLY INTEGRATED WITH VIRTUAGYM FITNESS\n- One account, access to everything you need\n- Complete Workouts\n- 3D-animated exercises\n- Written exercise instructions\n- Progress tracking: over 30 values available\n\nLIKE VIRTUAGYM?\nPlease rate us 5 stars, so we can keep improving it :) We’re continuously working on new features and we continuously add new 3D-animated exercises. If you have any suggestions, let us know. If you want to stay updated, get useful fitness tips or if you need motivation: follow us on Facebook and Twitter!\n\nPRO SUBSCRIPTION\nTo unlock the full app you can subscribe to our PRO membership. The monthly subscription will automatically renew and your iTunes account will be charged within 24 hours prior to renewal for the same amount as your current monthly subscription fee, if the auto-renew option is not turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period.

      "label": "Macadam is the first step counter app that makes you earn money when you walk.\n\nEvery step you do is tracked in the app with our pedometer and is automatically rewarded with real financial gains. \n \nLooking for a pedometer that really motivates you by paying you for each step? It's right here!\n\n\nHOW TO MAKE PROFITS WITH MACADAM \n\nStep #1 Macadam connects to your phone's step counter via Apple Health \nStep #2 The app earns you corners every time you put one foot in front of the other, whether it's a walk or a real run. \nStep #3 You can then exchange this virtual currency for real euros, spend your earnings at our partners or request a bank transfer. \n \nPut on your sneakers and go for a walk or a run, we promise you that it pays off!\n\nMacadam works equally well for walking, hiking, running or even a marathon. \n\nWHY A PEDOMETER THAT PAYS ME? \n \nTo fight against sedentary lifestyle! One human out of 2 has a sedentary lifestyle, which is a real health problem. \n\nMany people find it difficult to motivate themselves and stay in shape. So we try a funny and modern approach: The Reward! Rewarding people with money when they motivate themselves by walking. \n\nWith Macadam you can either walk or run! What matters to us is to reward you for getting moving. \n\n\nSTEP COUNTER APP FEATURES: \n\n- Pedometer (Number of steps, distance and kilometers traveled)\n- Calorie Tracker (Number of KCAL calories burned) \n- Step converter (convert your steps into euros) \n\n\n\nWHAT HEALTH AND WALKING DATA IS AVAILABLE?\n\nLike all step counters, our pedometer gives you access to the number of your daily steps, as well as a tracking of caloric expenditure and distance traveled.\nOf course, your data is completely anonymous and we will never sell it. \n\nMacadam does not use any GPS data and does not affect your battery.  \n \n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS : \n\n- What currency do I earn with the Macadam pedometer? \n\nThe app allows you to earn coins. This currency can be exchanged into money (euros) with a few clicks in the app. \nAlthough it is a virtual currency, coins are not a cryptocurrency, and we are not a web3-based move-to-earn app. \n\n- Is the step counter reliable? \n\nYes, we use data from Apple Health pedometer step sensor. For even more accuracy, you can use any connected watch or bracelet compatible with Apple Health (Apple Watch, Withings, Honor, Suunto, Fossil, Garmin, Fitbit, etc.)\n\n- Can I use it for running? \n\nOf course you can! Macadam works perfectly with running. \n\n- Are you affiliated with any other apps that pay for walking (walk to earn)? \n\nMacadam is an independent walk to earn app and is not affiliated with Sweatcoin, StepN, Walk and Earn, million Steps, Fancy Gifts, Nike+ Running, Strava, Charity Miles, Runkeeper, Endomondo, Calo, Fitmint, Movn, Wirtual, Istep, Aglet, Moofit, Movez\n\n\nGrab your legs, your feet, put on your shoes, your sneakers, go for a run or a walk and start earning money with Macadam step counter. \n\nYou walk ?

      "label": "The Secret of Weight (TSOW) is a convenient and easy to use photo-based calorie counting app that offers a fun and enjoyable way of maintaining, losing or gaining weight, depending on your objective!\n \nWe have all heard of calorie counting, but what does that really mean?  Can this concept be used easily?  How do you count calories anyway? \n \nThe Secret of Weight gives you all the answers!  How many calories are you entitled to each day? What happens if you go overboard?  Find out with this app! The best feature of all, however, is that this app makes calorie counting a breeze thanks to the photo-based food choices to select from!\n \nHow does it work?\n \n- Each day, you work with a set Calorie Budget that you can “spend” on your food choices, not matter what they are, without gaining any weight.  You therefore work with a set number of Calories each day, which means you can “spend this budget” on any type of food you like!  There are no food restrictions, the point being that as long as you stick to your budget, you will not gain weight!  This is the real Secret of Weight!\n \nOkay, so how does it all work?\n \n- Each time you eat something, look it up in the photo database and add that item to your cart for the day.  A bar gauge on the side of the Dashboard shows how many Calories you have left for that day.\n- If you go over budget, you start gaining weight.  The equivalent amount of weight gained is displayed on your app in real time, based on how many extra Calories you have consumed.\n- If you stay under budget, you start losing weight.  The equivalent amount of weight lost is displayed on your app in real time, based on how many less Calories you have consumed.\n \nThis new concept is based on the idea that there are no forbidden foods, even when you want to lose weight!  You will also find out how high or low your calorie intake should be to gain or lose a few pounds.\n \n \nContents:\n- Calorie gauge and dashboard\n- Food database:\n1661 photographs of food\n1934 food items\n- Add new food items to the database, with or without pictures\n- Add your own recipes, with or without pictures\n- Keep track of frequently chosen items by adding them to your Favorites list\n- Food cart (food cart content can be viewed for the ten previous days)\n- Customized settings\n- Help topics\n- Virtual coach “Flo” guides you through the app\n- Customize your dashboard gauge by changing colors (by holding your finger on the gauge)\n \nNo hidden in-app purchases.  The only suggested purchase is the book by the same name, The Secret of Weight, that explains the entire method in detail. \n \n \n \nTest this great tool for yourself!\n \nThe application has voluntarily been designed with few options:  the point was to keep it as simple as possible.  All options are therefore quick and easy to discover (even if you will need a few minutes of attention to grasp the concept).  Thanks to the help options, you can start keeping track of your weight in just 15 minutes.  Make it easy!  Think easy!  Diet easy!"

      "label": "Mijn Eetmeter is een online eetdagboek dat mensen helpt om gezonder te eten. Je krijgt inzicht in je eetpatroon en in de hoeveelheid energie en voedingsstoffen die je binnenkrijgt. Ook krijg je concrete tips hoe je gezonder kan kiezen en volgens de Schijf van Vijf kan eten. Dat kan allemaal ook helpen om af te vallen. \n\nSNEL JE DAGBOEK INVULLEN MET DE BARCODE-SCANNER \nIn de app Mijn Eetmeter kun je de barcodes van producten scannen. Zo voeg je makkelijk en snel producten toe aan jouw dagboek.\n\n90.000 MERKPRODUCTEN \nIn Mijn Eetmeter zitten ruim 90.000 (huis)merkartikelen. \n\nWAT MAAKT MIJN EETMETER UNIEK?\n\n1. Helemaal gratis en zonder commercieel belang\n\nMijn Eetmeter is en blijft gratis. Het Voedingscentrum kan deze app gratis aanbieden omdat wij 100% door de overheid gefinancierd worden om mensen te helpen gezonder te eten. Omdat we geen commercieel belang hebben is onze informatie onafhankelijk en betrouwbaar. We zullen ook nooit je persoonlijke informatie delen met derden.\n\n2. Altijd actueel \n\nMijn Eetmeter is de enige app die de productinformatie direct haalt uit de databanken van fabrikanten. Passen de fabrikanten het etiket aan, dan krijgen wij dus automatisch de meest actuele productgegevens. \n\n3. Voedingswaarde zoals je het eet\n\nScan of selecteer je bijvoorbeeld een pasta, dan wil je natuurlijk de voedingswaarden toevoegen van de gekookte pasta; zo eet je het immers. Staan op het etiket de waarden van de rauwe pasta, dan rekenen wij dit in Mijn Eetmeter voor je om. Of als je groente eet, dan kun je kiezen of je dit rauw of gewokt eet bijvoorbeeld.\n\n4. Advies ook op vitamines en mineralen.\n\nOp het etiket staat hoeveel energie, vet, verzadigd vet, eiwit, koolhydraten, vezels en zout er in het product zit. In Mijn Eetmeter krijg je voor deze voedingsstoffen direct een advies op maat. Maar je kunt in Mijn Eetmeter ook letten op vitamines en mineralen. Wij koppelen namelijk alle producten aan algemene voedingswaarden. Zo kunnen wij je inzicht geven in alle voedingstoffen. \n\n5. Volgens de Schijf van Vijf \n\nMensen die graag meer volgens de Schijf van Vijf willen eten, bieden we een Schijf van Vijf-advies aan. Daarin krijg je te zien hoeveel jij al eet volgens de Schijf van Vijf en krijg je tips hoe je gezonder kunt kiezen.\n\n6. Link met de app ‘Kies ik Gezond?’\n\nGebruikers van onze ‘Kies ik Gezond?’-app kunnen producten vanuit die app favoriet maken in Mijn Eetmeter. In deze app zie je per product of het gezond is.\n\nAFVALLEN\nVeel van de gebruikers van Mijn Eetmeter gebruiken het als hulp bij afvallen. Mijn Eetmeter helpt je bewust te maken welke producten veel calorieën leveren en je kunt eenvoudig bijhouden hoeveel je eet.\n\nBMI BIJHOUDEN\nIn Mijn Eetmeter kun je bijhouden hoe je gewicht zich ontwikkelt. Daarvoor vul je regelmatig je gewicht in. Je ziet dan in een grafiek hoeveel je aankomt of afvalt. \n\nBEWEEGMETER\nGenoeg bewegen hoort bij een gezonde leefstijl, net als gezond eten. Als je wilt kun je daarom ook bijhouden hoeveel je beweegt en of dit genoeg is om de norm voor beweging te halen.\n\nMIJN VOEDINGSCENTRUM\nMijn Eetmeter wisselt gegevens uit met de website www.mijnvoedingscentrum.nl. Op deze website kun je met dezelfde gegevens inloggen als met Mijn Eetmeter. Je vindt daar nog meer handige tools. Ook kun je je dagboek en de resultaten downloaden en printen.\n\nSUCCES\nOndertussen is de app al ruim een miljoen keer gedownload en kent vele enthousiaste gebruikers, zoals Elly: “Het gaf inzicht. Bij sommige dingen dacht ik: jee, zoveel calorieën, of zoveel suiker of vet. Je weet het wel, maar je schrikt toch als je die getallen ziet.”"

      "label": "Get to a healthier and more active life with Google Fit!\n\nIt’s hard to know how much or what kind of activity you need to stay healthy. That’s why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\n\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You’ll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO’s recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nSEE YOUR WORKOUTS\nGet insights and see stats such as heart rate, speed, pace, route, and more for your runs, walks, and bike rides.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and steps. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.\n\nMAKE EVERY MOVE COUNT\nAll physical activity can help you lead a healthier life, and with Google Fit you can track it all in one place. Working with your favorite fitness apps and devices, Google Fit builds a journal of your activity. And to make sure Fit never misses a workout, you can manually add any activity your other apps didn’t track - from Aerobics to Zumba!\n\nCONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES\nGoogle Fit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices that are compatible with Apple Health to give you a holistic view of your health, so you’ll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Headspace, and more.\n\nCHECK IN AT ANYTIME, FROM ANYWHERE\nSee a snapshot of your activity history across Google Fit and your integrated apps in your journal. Or, see the full picture in browse, where you can find all of your health and wellness data.\n\nLearn more about Google Fit and see a list of supported apps at: https://www.google.com/fit"

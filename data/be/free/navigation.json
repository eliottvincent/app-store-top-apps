Making your life easier, safer and more efficient before, during and after your trip, Flitsmeister is your best friend! \n\nThere are several other ways in which Flitsmeister will make your life easier: \n\n• Mobile and fixed speed cam, speed check zone alerts; to save your hard-earned cash.   \n\n• Traffic jam alerts; check in advance whether you will be encountering a traffic jam on your route and start a new route if necessary. \n\n• Service vehicle alerts such as ambulances and fire trucks, to help you get out of the way calmly and in time so they can reach their destination more quickly.  \n\n• Accidents, roadworks, stationary vehicles and other incident alerts: allowing you to anticipate the situation safely and in time. \n\n• Matrix sign alerts: never miss a closed exit, opened rush hour lane or maximum speed instructions ever again. \n\n• Navigation: the right instructions to get from A to B, taking into account the current situation on the road or recommending a different route if disturbances are expected on your route.  \n\n• Paid parking: start a parking action upon arrival at your destination with the tap of a button.

We will send you a notification as soon as you get back behind the wheel so you never forget to stop your parking action and never overpay. \n\n• Traffic lights: certain traffic lights in the Netherlands will send their current status to the app. The number of these ‘smart’ traffic lights will be increasing in the future, allowing us to show you a countdown for the green light and speed recommendations to keep you in the green wave. \n\n• Apple Carplay for Flitsmeister on the screen of your car: navigate to your destination even more conveniently by displaying Flitsmeister on the screen of your car.

Daarna kan je ook makkelijk met één druk op de knop navigeren naar het gewenste station. Op het station krijg je meteen via de app welke pompen voor jou beschikbaar zijn en kan je ook via de app de pomp vrijzetten.

It's easy and is just one click away. Another unique feature is the intelligent route planning, where the DKV Mobility App automatically calculates the best route with optimal charging stops for long distances.\n\nNeed to find a station quickly?\n\nWith our new home screen, you have instant access to the station closest to you. You can check the price and start navigation right away.\n\nActively managing time windows in which the DKV CARD can be used?\n\nThe activation mode \"on demand\" offers the possibility to activate cards only for the period in which they are used for a transaction. During the rest of the time, the card is inactive, and transactions will be declined. Simply start the 60-minute time window during which fuel can be purchased. After the time has expired, the card is automatically deactivated again.\n\nWhat other benefits does the DKV Mobility App offer?\n\nIf you need immediate assistance, for example in the event of a breakdown or the loss of your card, the app offers direct dialing to connect you to the helpline.\n\nYou can find more information about our range of services at https://www.dkv-mobility.com/en/. \n\nDKV.

We have various features to make Speedometer the best speed tracker app for IOS devices. We use GPS to track your speed and alert you when you are over the speed limit. There are other features that will be useful for you such as Night Mode, HUD screen, and many more.  \n\nHave you ever driven a car and worried that you go over the speed limit? Driving too fast can get you into trouble especially if there are some traffic cops nearby with their speed radar gun. That’s why we add Speed Limit Alert as one of the most important features of our app. You can enable and disable it. We support US and EU style speed limit signs and support different display units. This means that it will make it easier to drive when you visit EU or USA. \n\nAside from tracking your speed, Speedometer one also can track your distance, altitude, average speed, and top speed. \n\n=== FEATURES OF SPEEDOMETER ONE: ===\n\n\t•\tAccurate Speedometer for Cars, Boats, Motorcycle or other types of Vehicles. \n\t•\tChoose your units mph, km/h, or knots. \n\t•\tSupport Night Mode with high contrast on the screen. \n\t•\tSupport Landscape or Portrait Mode.\n\t•\tSpeed Limit Alert: Enable this option first, and \n\t•\tHUD (Head Unit Display) Mode \n\t•\tSupports USA and EU speed limit. \n\t•\tChoose over 44 themes (22 dark and 22 light) through In-App Purchase. \n\nWhen you use the HUD mode, you can put your iPhone on the dashboard near the windshield. Our app is very customizable, especially if you’ve unlocked our themes. You can choose the look and display according to your needs: your mood, eyesight, night or day. Our customization is what sets us apart from other similar apps. Try it for yourself today!\n\nIMPORTANT USAGE NOTE: \n\n\t•\tTo be able to use Speedometer One, please allow Location Services.  \n\t•\tSet what kind of vehicle you use and the max speed before using. \n\t•\tSpeedometer One is not compatible with Wifi only iPad or iPod Touch. \n\t•\tOur speed tracker is based on GPS info. GPS sensor is not always accurate due to the device hardware sensor limitation. When in doubt, always rely on your car’s speedometer.\n\t•\tGPS is most accurate when you are in wide-open spaces. Trees, tall buildings, and other things might affect your GPS accuracy. \n\t•\tProlong use of GPS will affect your battery life. \n\t•\tPlease stay safe. Focus on the road ahead and do not interact with any device when you are driving, especially when you are driving at high speed.\n\nLove Speedometer One!

      "label": "iMapp will help you track your friends and relatives who are connected to the service as well as assist you in finding a person's location by request, regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed.\n\nNow, you no longer need to call each other dozens of times to arrange a meeting, you can simply view each other’s locations via a phone number. If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

      "label": "Geovelo, your free GPS application, your statistics and your challenges!\n\n- PERSONALIZED ITINERARIES & GPS\n\nThe app adapts to your type of bike (classic, electric, self-service (SSB), to your travel speed and to the type of route you prefer (from the fastest to the most secure). Geovelo prioritises cycle paths, cycle lanes and low-traffic streets to ensure your comfort, safety and peace of mind. Geovelo includes a real-time guidance system (map / full screen / compass mode), with voice guidance and notifications.\n\n- STATISTICS & RECORDING\n\nLog in and save your rides to access your personalized statistics.\nWhen the Geovelo app is installed, you can start cycling around, and your routes will be automatically detected and saved. You can then view them in the app. Please note that you will need to authorise the retrieval of locations when the app is closed or in the background for this feature to work.\nGeovelo allows you to synchronise your cycling activity information with the Apple Health app.\n\n- CYCLING FACILITIES AND BIKE PARKING\n\nWith its comprehensive mapping, Geovelo also allows you to quickly and easily find nearby bicycle parkings and bike racks.\n\n- COMMUNITIES & CHALLENGES\n\nFind other cyclists in your city or organisation, and connect by participating in regular activity challenges. Get on your bike every day or ride as many kilometres as you can to try and make it to the podium in your community! Note that several competitions are organised to win useful gifts for cyclists. \n\n- CYCLE ROUTES & WALKS\n\nThe app also offers cycling routes (including La Vélodyssée®, Via Rhôna, La Loire à Vélo®, La Scandibérique, La Flow Vélo, Le Canal des deux Mers à Vélo, La Vélo Francette®, La Véloscénie, L'Avenue Verte London-Paris and others) as well as numerous walks to discover the local heritages & treasures\n\n- CONTRIBUTIONS & REPORTS\n\nReport any missing bike-park, problems or roadworks, dangerous roads for cyclists and much more for the benefit of the community.\n\n- PRACTICAL TOOLS\n\nThe application includes many features such as the display of cycling facilities, the setting of weather alerts on your favourite routes (to advise you on a departure time according to the weather), simplified address searches, etc.\n\n- SELF-SERVICE BICYCLES\n\nGeovelo displays the availability of bikes and parking spaces (BSS) in real time! In this context, we use data provided by companies such as Bordeaux V3, Vélolib, Vélo'+, Donkey Republic, V'Lille, Velam, VéloCité, Villo, Velo2, Cristolib, Vélo'V, Le vélo, VéloCité, VélOstan'lib, Bicloo, Cy'clic, VélôToulouse, LE vélo STAR, PBSC, PubliBike V1, Yélo, Optymo, C vélo, Vélib', Vélocéa, Velopop'.\n\n- A CIVIC & VIRTUOUS APP\n\nThe data created from rides recorded with the Geovelo app is anonymised and used in the context of partnerships to help territories that we work with, to analyse and improve the cyclability of their network. It will never be used for marketing purposes. In addition, Geovelo actively contributes to the mapping of cycling facilities alongside the OpenStreetMap community (an international project to create an open map).\n\n- LET'S STAY CONNECTED\n\nIf you like this app, we invite you to rate it and tell others about it!\n\nFollow @geovelofr on Twitter and Geovelo on Facebook to keep up with updates, news and the community."

Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period at the same cost as your original purchase.\n\n\nTIPS FOR MAPPING ROUTES\n• For longer routes, try zooming in and mapping your route in multiple segments.\n• Tap and hold the map to quickly route between waypoints and POIs.\n• Did Footpath snap to the wrong roads? Trace over the incorrect segment to edit, or use the eraser tool.\n• Turn off snap to roads (magnet icon) and zoom in to manually trace the map. (Try switching to a satellite layer).\n• Displaying maps and continuously running GPS in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Navigate without maps or with the screen off for all day battery life.\n\n\nCONTACT US\nWe've got a lot planned for Footpath.

      "label": "Map, Track, Sync and Share Your Trek From Anywhere\n\nFor adventure seekers, explorers and outdoor enthusiasts, the Garmin Explore ecosystem offers a complete mobile navigation solution that  — when paired with a compatible Garmin device¹ — lets you map, track and navigate your trek from anywhere with unlimited cloud storage.\n\nGarmin Explore provides basic trip planning or viewing of maps you’ve preloaded on your device. Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

De app heeft alles wat je onderweg nodig hebt: navigeren met informatie over files, flitsers en werkzaamheden, goedkoop parkeren, actuele benzineprijzen en beschikbaarheid van laadpalen.\n\nDe functionaliteiten in deze app:\n\n• Betrouwbare navigatie \nPlan een route en bekijk voor je in de onderweg gaat waar je kunt tanken, laden of parkeren op jouw route of bestemming. Bekijk waar je het best en goedkoop kunt parkeren en stel deze parkeerplaats direct in als eindbestemming. Wil je onderweg tanken? De app toont alle tankstations inclusief prijzen op of langs jouw route. Voeg eenvoudig het tankstation naar keuze toe aan de route. De appt geeft aan hoeveel extra reistijd er eventueel is. Als je elektrisch rijdt, filter je op laadpalen. De app toont alle laadpalen op jouw route of eindbestemming. Met één klik voeg je een laadpaal toe aan de route. Zoals je van de ANWB gewend bent, krijg je alle actuele files en verkeersinformatie. Ook als je niet de navigatie aan hebt staan. Met de rijmodus functie ontvang je nog steeds alle info en nieuws.\n\n• Actuele verkeersinformatie en filemeldingen \nIn de app vind je een overzicht van actuele en betrouwbare ANWB verkeersinformatie in de buurt of op je route, zoals files (alle wegen), flitsers (snelwegen) en wegwerkzaamheden. Met de handige verkeersinformatielijst kun je per wegnummer alle files en incidenten bekijken.\n\n• Goedkoper of gratis mobiel parkeren \nDe app toont alle parkeerlocaties met tarieven in heel Nederland. In een handig overzicht zie je waar je op loopafstand van je bestemming goedkoper of gratis kunt parkeren. Heb je een parkeerplaats gekozen, dan stel je deze met één klik in als eindbestemming. De navigatie plant je route naar deze parkeerplaats. Parkeren in een parkeergarage? Dat kan ook met de app. Bekijk de openingstijden en maak een reservering om van je parkeerplek verzekerd te zijn. Op bestemming aangekomen betaal je gemakkelijk via de app. Je start en stopt de transactie wanneer jij wil. Zo betaal je alleen voor de tijd die je hebt geparkeerd. We sturen je gratis parkeermeldingen zodat je nooit een lopende transactie vergeet. ANWB Parkeren is een samenwerking met Yellowbrick en werkt in heel Nederland. Log in met je ANWB Parkeren account, voer de zonecode in, controleer je kenteken en start de transactie. Meld je gratis aan en parkeer al vanaf 0,15 cent per transactie. https://www.anwb.nl/mobielparkeren\n\n• Laadpalen of tankstations zoeken inclusief actuele brandstofprijzen \nIn de navigatie tab vind je actuele benzineprijzen van alle tankstations in Nederland of specifiek op jouw geplande route. Met handige kleuren zie je meteen waar je goedkoop kunt tanken. Door te klikken op een tankstation, zie je alle openingstijden, voorzieningen en prijzen\n\n(Super Plus 98, Euro 95, Diesel). Ook alle openbare laadpalen vind je via de navigatie tab. Je kunt kiezen voor laden onderweg zodat de app alle snelladers op jouw route toont of je kiest voor laden op bestemming en ziet daarmee alle laadpalen rondom jouw eindbestemming. Met het aantal elektriciteit iconen geven we een indicatie van de laadsnelheid en de kleur geeft de beschikbaarheid aan.\n\n• Online pech melden \nGeef je pech makkelijk door aan de Wegenwacht via de ANWB Onderweg app. Via de app kun je alle benodigde informatie zoals je exacte locatie doorgeven. Zo helpt de Wegenwacht je snel weer op weg. Na de pechmelding ontvang je een sms met een link waarmee je kunt volgen wat de status van je Wegenwacht is.\n\n• Mijn ANWB en digitale ledenpas \nHier vind je je digitale ledenpas en jouw ANWB producten en diensten.\n\nHeb je vragen over deze app? Of heb je verbetersuggesties? \nStuur deze dan naar appsupport@anwb.nl o.v.v. ANWB Onderweg app of kijk in de app bij Mijn ANWB en klik op Info & Help om ons feedback te geven."

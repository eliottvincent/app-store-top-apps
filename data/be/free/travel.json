Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMost aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes. This specifically excludes activities that might endanger yourself or the lives of others.

With the app, you can :\n\nFIND ROUTES IDEAS\nYou will find varied and quality walking routes throughout the UK and around the world. The quality of the routes we suggest is our main concern. This is why each track is checked by a team of moderators before being published and shared with the community.\n\nKNOW YOUR POSITION\nIn real time, you can consult your position on the map layer you have chosen. This will allow you to better locate yourself and also visualise the points of interest around you.\n\nBE GUIDED\nOnce the walk has been selected and your preferred map layer is chosen, the app will safely guide you on the right route with detailed and verified directions. Even offline, the app will be able to guide you !\n\nRECORD YOUR TRACKS\nAt the same time as following the guidance, you have the possibility to record your own track. In this way, you can then analyse it, compare it, share it or simply redo it later.\n\nSHARE\nSince Visorando is built on a participatory model, we hope you’re going to share your routes with the community too ! GPX export is also possible for those who want to use their tracks on other types of devices.\n\nCREATE YOUR OWN TRACK\nDoes no walking idea fit your desires ? You can create your own route using our FREE walking planner available on the website via PC (and also on mobile if you subscribe to Club Visorando). Once your track is saved to your account, an automatic synchronisation takes place and you can immediately find your route in the app.\n\n__________\n\nPAID VERSION\nAccess to a wide range of licensed maps such as OS Explorer, IGN, Swisstopo, etc. for free for 3 days following your first log in to the app. After that, you should subscribe to the Club Visorando to keep access to them. Quarterly subscription costs £4,99 and annual subscription costs £21,49. \n\nThe subscription will automatically renew unless automatic renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be billed within 24 hours of the end of the current period, for an amount of £21,49 for an annual subscription to the Club Visorando or £4,99 for a quarterly subscription.\n\nThe OpenStreetMap map layer remains completely free. You can therefore continue to use the application for free with this map layer, even if you have passed the trial period for OS Explorer maps.\n\nPurchases are made on iTunes. You will therefore be billed to your iTunes account upon confirmation of your purchase.\nThe subscription will automatically renew unless automatic renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

For example, a flight from New York to San Francisco might be $300, but a similar flight from New York to Seattle with a layover in San Francisco might be $200.

      "label": "Yango is an easy-to-use app for getting around the city\n\nTaxify your life with the Yango taxi app. It puts the whole city in your hands and lets you ride wherever you want to go via taxi. Do it all by making a taxi order via the Yango taxi app.\n\nChoose the right service class for you\n\nReach your destination at the right level of comfort and price for you. Choose from several service classes. Start is perfect for short rides. Economy is awesome for when you need a car fast. Comfort lets you sit back and enjoy the ride. And The Fastest offers rides when the service class doesn’t matter… you need the closest available taxi!\n\nRide safely\n\nSafety is our top priority. You’ll see who’s coming to pick you up and in which car right in the app. You’ll see the driver’s name and rating and be able to share your ride with whomever you like so they know where you are.\n\nSmart destinations\n\nYango will suggest destinations for your taxi ride based on your ride history, like first offering ‘home’ as a destination because it’s your most common taxi order on weekday evenings. Ride taxis the smart way!\n\nMultiple destinations, one route\n\nThe Yango taxi app makes everyday life easier. Like picking the kids up from school, dropping a friend off at a market, and doing some quick shopping on the way. Just add a new taxi order stop in the app, and Yango will recalculate a new route for the driver. That makes it even easier to ride a taxi.\n\nOrder for someone else\n\nYango lets you order friends and loved ones a ride by taxi. Get your mother to a doctor’s appointment with a taxi order. Send a taxi online to pick up your special someone. Or get each of your friends a ride home after a night out. You can order up to 3 cars at once.\n\nTell your friends about the Yango taxi app and get discounts\n\nYou can get discounts for your rides by inviting friends to use the Yango app. Share your personal promo code with them and receive bonuses when they take their first ride. Ride taxi, tell friends, save. It’s as easy as that.\n\nAn international service\n\nYango is a ride-hailing service that operates mobility and delivery aggregators in 19 countries, including Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Zambia.\n\nIsrael Only\n3 free Wind scooter ride unlocks and a 20 NIS discount\nA little birdie told us that Wind scooters are now available in Yango. These scooters are bright yellow (not lime green), so you can't miss them! Easily order a scooter, find locations on the map (they look like a dot), and build routes with the same high-quality scooters you know and love, all in one convenient, top-tier app. We offer free unlocks and 20 NIS discounts on the first 3 rides to everyone who loves the feel of the wind in their hair. Just log into Yango, select scooters, and enjoy your three free unlocks!\n\nMeet Delivery in Israel - it's like a taxi service, but for your packages\n\nWe've also built in a fast delivery service into Yango - use Delivery to quickly send personal packages or even business orders by courier all around the Gush Dan district. Delivery is suitable for any item that can be transported by scooter or car.\n\nEnjoy your ride!\n\nIf you would like to share your feedback on the Yango taxi app or a specific taxi company, please use the feedback form located at yango.com/en_gh/support/\n\nYango is an informational service and not a transportation or taxi services provider. Transportation services are provided by third parties. \nUp to 50% (max 6 GHC/5 GHC) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Accra/Kumasi until 31.12.2022.\nThe 30% (max 10 EUR) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Helsinki until 31.12.2022. The 30% (max 100 kr) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Oslo until 31.12.2022.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://yango.com/legal/yango_privacy_notice\nYango Plus subscription conditions:\nhttps://deli.yango.com/en-IL/about/docs/legal/yango_plus_conditions"

      "label": "Buy one of our prepaid eSIM plans at affordable rates (starting from $4.50) in over 190+ countries and regions to enjoy global connectivity!\nAdd a data pack to your dual SIM iPhone or iPad and stop worrying about staying connected while on your adventures.\n\nSay 'alo' to freedom!\n\nWhat is an eSIM?\n* An eSIM is embedded SIM technology. Think of it as a digital SIM card. Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\n.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM. The advantage is that you no longer need a fiddly, easily lost old-school plastic SIM card that you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIMs are a true technological revolution and we bring them right into your eSIM-compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or paying for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your existing phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store over time.  Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find a regularly updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link:\nhttps://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who travels - it doesn't matter whether you're on a boat, a plane, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries. We’re here to provide you with instant connectivity and solve your travel connectivity problems.\n\n\nWhy use Airalo?\n* No more huge data roaming fees\n* Installation in just a couple of minutes\n* Easy top-ups, wherever you are\n* Keep your existing number while traveling \n* No more fiddling with pins and paperclips to change SIMs\n* No need to carry a bulky WiFi dongle around\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n* Step 1: Install the Airalo app\n\n* Step 2: Find an eSIM for your destination\n(Airalo has eSIMs for over 190+ countries and regions and we're working 24/7 to expand our coverage.)\n\n* Step 3: Purchase & install your eSIM\nThere are three ways to install your eSIM; most can be installed directly, if this isn’t possible you can use a QR code or install it manually. \n\n* Step 4: Enjoy connectivity whenever you are!\n\nWhy do we love eSIM?\n\n* You aren’t disconnected during transit. With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fiddly hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things simpler for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top-up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees.\n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device. That gives you the freedom to purchase your eSIMs ahead of time and simply activate them on arrival.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n---\n\nVisit airalo.com for more information.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/privacy-policy\nTerms & Conditions: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/terms-conditions"

Simple, flexible, affordable. \n\nOur vehicles are parked at stations on reserved parking spaces. The special advantage: After the journey, a free parking space is immediately available. \n\nIn Bremen you will also find \"smumo\" vehicles without stations for spontaneous and flexible journeys. The smumo cars in Bremen can be identified by a separate symbol.\n\nAre you already a cambio customer? Then you can start right away. Otherwise, you can register as a new customer directly via the app.\n\nMobile everywhere\nWith the cambio app you can find the available vehicles in your area and immediately reserve the next free car at the station of your choice, extend or cancel existing bookings. With the app you can also conveniently open vehicles with an on-board computer without your cambio card.\n\nAre you travelling in a foreign city? The navigation of the smartphone guides you directly to the nearest station and to the next free vehicle - this requires the approval of the location.\n\nCost control\nYou can calculate the expected travel costs during the booking process. If the desired vehicle is not available, free vehicles are suggested as an alternative and - if applied - price differences are displayed.\n\nRate vehicle\nYou can evaluate the condition of the vehicle at the start of the journey. This evaluation will be forwarded directly to the cambio service team. In the event of serious defects or damage to the car, you can contact the cambio booking service directly.\n\nYour customer area \"My cambio\"\nThe section “Mycambio” keeps on expanding. You can now do the following: Look at your personal data, change your contact information and address, change your login data and contact customer service. You can also consult your invoices up to two years old, and a trip list for the past 36 months. From now on you can consult your current user limit and purchase trip credit online if needed.\n\nWith the cambio app, customers of the CarSharing provider \"Stadtteilauto Münster\" can also reserve, extend or cancel vehicles as described. The CarSharing stations in Münster are displayed with a corresponding icon."

      "label": "Met de Wandelknooppunt app kan je alle wandelknooppuntennetwerken in Vlaanderen, Oost-België, Pays des Collines en het grensgebied met Nederland verkennen. Samen goed voor meer dan 12.000 kilometer wandelplezier. Om te kijken of er in jouw buurt wandelknooppunten zijn surf je best even naar wandelknooppunt.be/routeplanner.\n\nHANDIGE WANDELROUTEPLANNER \nJe kan alle wandelknooppunten op kaart bekijken en knooppunt per knooppunt een wandeltocht op maat uitstippelen. Het kan ook sneller: via de handige Surprise Me functie kun je een bepaald wandelknooppunt kiezen en de app een route met een afstand naar keuze laten berekenen. Bovendien kun je alle uitgetekende wandelroutes opslaan zodat je ze later kan hergebruiken.\n\nWANDELROUTES IMPORTEREN \nJe kan ook achter je PC wandeltochtjes uitstippelen via onze handige online routeplanner op wandelknooppunt.be. Je kan daar voor elke route een QR-code genereren. Deze code kun je met behulp van de app scannen waarna de route naar je smartphone wordt verzonden.\n\nSUGGESTIEROUTES \nJe vindt in de app ook meer dan 500 suggestieroutes. Dit zijn routes die we zelf samenstellen of routes die worden aangeboden door onze partners Toerisme Vlaams-Brabant, Toerisme Provincie Antwerpen en Toerisme Oost-Vlaanderen.\n\nKRIJG EXTRA MOGELIJKHEDEN ALS ABONNEE \nVoor de prijs van 9.99 euro per jaar kan je ook een abonnement in de app nemen. Als abonnee krijg je toegang tot heel wat extra functies (+):\n\nGEEN ADVERTENTIES (+) \nJe krijgt geen advertenties meer te zien onderaan in de app.\n\nNAVIGATIEMODUS (+) \nMet onze handige navigatiemodus kan je elke wandelroute volgen met de GPS-functie van je smartphone. De app leidt je langs de route en zal je waarschuwen als je van de route afwijkt. Als je een route volgt langs wandelknooppunten zal een stem je bij elk knooppunt ook melden wat het volgende knooppunt is.\n\nROUTEPLANNER PRO (+) \nAls abonnee heb je op wandelknooppunt.be toegang tot onze Routeplanner Pro. Daar kan je vrij routes plannen, ook op plaatsen waar geen wandelknooppunten zijn. Op een kaart kies jij langs waar je wilt wandelen (in heel Europa). Deze vrije routes kan je ook importeren in de app zodat je ze in de navigatiemodus kan volgen.\n\nOFFLINE KAARTEN (+) \nJe kan elke wandelroute vooraf thuis downloaden. Daarna kan je de route offline volgen waardoor je mobiele data spaart tijdens je wandeling.\n\nHOOGTEPROFIELEN (+) \nJe kan voor elk wandelroute een hoogteprofiel opvragen zodat je de intensiteit van je wandeling vooraf kan beoordelen.\n\nREGISTREER LANGS WAAR JE WANDELT (+) \nVoor elk traject tussen 2 wandelknooppunten kan je aangeven of je er al hebt gewandeld. Dit wordt visueel weergegeven op de kaart zodat je altijd een overzicht hebt van waar je al wandelde. In de navigatiemodus registreert de app automatisch langs welke trajecten van het wandelnetwerk je wandelt. Zo kun je steeds de mooiste routes plannen langs trajecten waar je nog nooit bent geweest.\n\nOPGELET: je kan in de app onder 'Abonnee worden' een abonnement afsluiten voor 1 jaar voor de prijs van 9.99 euro. De betaling van een abonnement wordt afgehandeld met je iTunes Account. Abonnementen worden automatisch verlengd, tenzij je ten laatste 24 uur voor de vervaldatum van je abonnement het abonnement opzegt. Je kan je abonnement zelf beheren, en ook de automatische verlenging ervan kan stopgezet worden door na aankoop naar je iTunes Account Instellingen te gaan.\n\nDISCLAIMER: voortdurend gebruik van de GPS in de achtergrond van de app kan de levensduur van je batterij aanzienlijk verlagen.\n\nGEBRUIKSVOORWAARDEN: www.wandelknooppunt.be/gebruiksvoorwaarden\n\nPRIVACYBELEID: www.wandelknooppunt.be/privacy\n\nMEER INFO: een uitgebreide handleiding van de Wandelknooppunt app vind je op www.wandelknooppunt.be/app"

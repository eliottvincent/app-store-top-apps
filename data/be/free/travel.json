Enjoy a personalised experience to plan your journeys through Brussels and beyond, by including STIB-MIVB and the other transport operators in Brussels.  \n\nTo do so, create your account, which will allow you to access a variety of functionalities. You already have a STIB-MIVB account on MyBOOTIK (the online service to purchase transport tickets)? Great! Just use your MyBOOTIK user ID to log on!  \n\nThe itinerary search of the STIB-MIVB App is the best door-to-door solution. Thanks to the positioning system, that includes a transport mode optimisation (on foot, bus, tram, metro or even train), you can get effortlessly from your departure point to your final destination. Launch an itinerary search and follow the instructions. Once you are in your transport mode (bus, tram, metro), the app will warn you to alight when you arrive near your destination. When you finished your itinerary, your journey will be added to your frequently used lines. Moreover, you can find your recent itinerary searches.  \n\nYou wish to think ahead and organise a journey in advance? No problem! Simply register your request and the app will warn you when it's time to go!  \n\nThe disruptions on your frequently used lines and the lines near your position are always available. With one click you can see the waiting time in real time at the stops nearby or the timetables of a line. You can save your favourite destinations and rename them. Thanks to this functionality, you can immediately launch your itinerary until one of your favourite destinations. What's more, you can save a stop or line in your favourites so as to immediately consult the waiting time at the stop and the possible disruptions associated or the detail of the line. \n\nWhen consulting a line, the information regarding lines parallel to this line is easily accessible. It will allow you to manage your journey and to optimise it by taking the first line servicing your stop.\n\nSee our Accessibility compliance statement: https://www.stib-mivb.be/article.html?l=en&_guid=d0f0d466-1483-3410-45af-9748427ab131#contentBodyList6"

Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes. This specifically excludes activities that might endanger yourself or the lives of others. Under no circumstances will the developer of this app be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation or its use contrary to this agreement.\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.flightradar24.com/terms-and-conditions"

Always!\n\nBut in more practical terms:\n• To be part of a community trying to be more sustainable through less owning products and more sharing.\n• When you realize the cost associated with owning your own bike or leasing from a regular bike-lease company.\n• When you have a flat tire or broken lights. Don’t wait for repairs, hop on to a nearby Donkey bike with our app.\n• When you’re visiting other towns, simply open the app and see if we are there.\n• When guests visit you, share your love for biking with them.\n\n\nFAQs\n\nCan I rent more than one bike at once?\nYes, you can rent up to 5 bikes at once! Just make sure to select the correct number of vehicles right at the beginning of your booking process.\n\nCan I leave the bike anywhere?\nNo. We work hard with the cities to keep the streets clean and accessible for everyone. Please return your Donkeys to specific drop-off locations when you are done for the day.\n\nWhat if I have issues?\nOur support team is always happy to help and understands that life happens.\n\n\nHOW PRICING WORKS\n\nJust Ride (Pay as you go)\nWith no strings attached. Just Ride is ideal for trips from 15 mins to a few hours.

Visiting for a weekend or inspired to explore like a local when you're on vacation? This is the perfect solution for you or a guest visiting you. \n\nMonthly memberships\nWith a Donkey membership, you pay a fixed monthly fee and get a certain amount of free time per day. If you exceed the included daily free time, your rental is extended for a low fixed cost. Ideal for the daily commute and for a busy city life with multiple errands throughout the day. Valid in all Donkey cities.\n\n\nCYCLING IS OUR PASSION\n\nWe are a team of 40(ish) firm believers in cycling as the most efficient mode of transportation and the only one our cities need. We work by the rule that any decision we make will have to bring us closer to being a sustainable, affordable, and reliable mobility provider. We wish to show the world that cycling can make cities more liveable and bike-sharing will help in that transformation.\n\nDonkey Republic - Every ride counts"

Simple, flexible, affordable. \n\nOur vehicles are parked at stations on reserved parking spaces. The special advantage: After the journey, a free parking space is immediately available. \n\nIn Bremen you will also find \"smumo\" vehicles without stations for spontaneous and flexible journeys. The smumo cars in Bremen can be identified by a separate symbol.\n\nAre you already a cambio customer? Then you can start right away. Otherwise, you can register as a new customer directly via the app.\n\nMobile everywhere\nWith the cambio app you can find the available vehicles in your area and immediately reserve the next free car at the station of your choice, extend or cancel existing bookings. With the app you can also conveniently open vehicles with an on-board computer without your cambio card.\n\nAre you travelling in a foreign city? The navigation of the smartphone guides you directly to the nearest station and to the next free vehicle - this requires the approval of the location.\n\nCost control\nYou can calculate the expected travel costs during the booking process. If the desired vehicle is not available, free vehicles are suggested as an alternative and - if applied - price differences are displayed.\n\nRate vehicle\nYou can evaluate the condition of the vehicle at the start of the journey. This evaluation will be forwarded directly to the cambio service team. In the event of serious defects or damage to the car, you can contact the cambio booking service directly.\n\nYour customer area \"My cambio\"\nThe section “Mycambio” keeps on expanding. You can now do the following: Look at your personal data, change your contact information and address, change your login data and contact customer service. You can also consult your invoices up to two years old, and a trip list for the past 36 months. From now on you can consult your current user limit and purchase trip credit online if needed.\n\nWith the cambio app, customers of the CarSharing provider \"Stadtteilauto Münster\" can also reserve, extend or cancel vehicles as described. The CarSharing stations in Münster are displayed with a corresponding icon."

For example, a flight from New York to San Francisco might be $300, but a similar flight from New York to Seattle with a layover in San Francisco might be $200. If you’re going to San Francisco we’ll show you both flights, and if you choose the cheaper one, you get off the plane at the layover (San Francisco) rather than going to the final destination (Seattle).\n\nThis is perfectly legal and the savings can be significant, but if you’ve never traveled like this before, you should read our HIDDEN-CITY FAQ at http://skiplagged.com/faq\n\nWe’ll always show you all the options, so YOU can pick the deal you want!"

      "label": "Yango is an easy-to-use app for getting around the city\n\nTaxify your life with the Yango taxi app. It puts the whole city in your hands and lets you ride wherever you want to go via taxi. Do it all by making a taxi order via the Yango taxi app.\n\nChoose the right service class for you\n\nReach your destination at the right level of comfort and price for you. Choose from several service classes. Start is perfect for short rides. Economy is awesome for when you need a car fast. Comfort lets you sit back and enjoy the ride. And The Fastest offers rides when the service class doesn’t matter… you need the closest available taxi!\n\nRide safely\n\nSafety is our top priority. You’ll see who’s coming to pick you up and in which car right in the app. You’ll see the driver’s name and rating and be able to share your ride with whomever you like so they know where you are.\n\nSmart destinations\n\nYango will suggest destinations for your taxi ride based on your ride history, like first offering ‘home’ as a destination because it’s your most common taxi order on weekday evenings. Ride taxis the smart way!\n\nMultiple destinations, one route\n\nThe Yango taxi app makes everyday life easier. Like picking the kids up from school, dropping a friend off at a market, and doing some quick shopping on the way. Just add a new taxi order stop in the app, and Yango will recalculate a new route for the driver. That makes it even easier to ride a taxi.\n\nOrder for someone else\n\nYango lets you order friends and loved ones a ride by taxi. Get your mother to a doctor’s appointment with a taxi order. Send a taxi online to pick up your special someone. Or get each of your friends a ride home after a night out. You can order up to 3 cars at once.\n\nTell your friends about the Yango taxi app and get discounts\n\nYou can get discounts for your rides by inviting friends to use the Yango app. Share your personal promo code with them and receive bonuses when they take their first ride. Ride taxi, tell friends, save. It’s as easy as that.\n\nAn international service\n\nYango is a ride-hailing service that operates mobility and delivery aggregators in 19 countries, including Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Zambia.\n\nIsrael Only\n3 free Wind scooter ride unlocks and a 20 NIS discount\nA little birdie told us that Wind scooters are now available in Yango. These scooters are bright yellow (not lime green), so you can't miss them! Easily order a scooter, find locations on the map (they look like a dot), and build routes with the same high-quality scooters you know and love, all in one convenient, top-tier app. We offer free unlocks and 20 NIS discounts on the first 3 rides to everyone who loves the feel of the wind in their hair. Just log into Yango, select scooters, and enjoy your three free unlocks!\n\nMeet Delivery in Israel - it's like a taxi service, but for your packages\n\nWe've also built in a fast delivery service into Yango - use Delivery to quickly send personal packages or even business orders by courier all around the Gush Dan district. Delivery is suitable for any item that can be transported by scooter or car.\n\nEnjoy your ride!\n\nIf you would like to share your feedback on the Yango taxi app or a specific taxi company, please use the feedback form located at yango.com/en_gh/support/\n\nYango is an informational service and not a transportation or taxi services provider. Transportation services are provided by third parties. \nUp to 50% (max 6 GHC/5 GHC) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Accra/Kumasi until 31.12.2022.\nThe 30% (max 10 EUR) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Helsinki until 31.12.2022. The 30% (max 100 kr) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Oslo until 31.12.2022.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://yango.com/legal/yango_privacy_notice\nYango Plus subscription conditions:\nhttps://deli.yango.com/en-IL/about/docs/legal/yango_plus_conditions"

I go through all the comments, one by one, so that you can get better flight deals. \n\nWhat you can do with my app:\n\n•        Get cheap flight tickets\n•        Plan your trip ahead\no        Choose your seat\no        Order your meal beforehand\no        Buy additional luggage\no        Book your hotel room\no        Rent a car\no        Buy Fast Track\n•        Gift flight tickets with Gift Card\n•        Become a member of BolBol, my loyalty program\n•        Collect BolPoints, my flight points \n\nNo doubt that these are not the only things you can do with the app of “The Digital Airlines of Turkey.” You can find out more when you download my app....

If you're not a member yet, you can easily sign up. You have to be signed in to your BolBol account to auto-fill your information.  \n\nIf you want to buy a flight ticket for another person, you need to go to User Settings and create a new profile for that person through \"\"My Contacts\"\" tab.

What should I do?\n\nUnfortunately, I have to update my app to make it better and fix known issues. My app will be guiding you through the update processes so that you can use the most recent version.\n\nBonus \n\nHow can I get the cheapest flight tickets?\n\nFirst, you can download my app to help me alert you for flight deals of Pegasus Airlines.\n\nAt flight finder screen you can filter tickets by price, so you can choose the most suitable flight for yourself. \n\nAlso, you can plan your trip in advance and find the cheapest flight tickets on my app.\n\n***\n\nThat's all for now!

      "label": "Silicon Valley’s new success story, inDrive is a free ride-hailing app available in more than 700 cities in 47 countries. We are growing fast by putting the power back in the hands of people.\n\ninDrive first emerged as a taxi alternative — a mobility app where affordable rides for passengers would still mean well-paid rides for drivers. \n \nBut now, there’s so much more to it. You can use inDrive to travel to other cities, send and receive packages, book a truck for your personal or business needs, and even hire a local pro to help you with whatever you need. You can also sign up as a driver, courier, or tasker.\n\nThe main idea is the same for all services: A fair price is the one you agree on — not hope for. inDrive exists to prove that people can always come to an agreement. \n\nWhat We Offer\nCITY RIDES\nAffordable everyday rides with no surge pricing. You get to set the fare and choose your ride based on the driver’s price offer, rating, number of completed rides, car model, and pickup time.\n\nINTERCITY RIDES\nA safe and convenient way to travel between cities. Specify your destination, pickup date, time and location, offer your fare and request a ride. \n\nCOURIER SERVICES\nThis door-to-door on-demand delivery service is a fast and safe way to send and receive packages of up to 20 kilos. Offer your fare ​​and track your delivery in real-time.\n\nFREIGHT SERVICES\nBook a truck for your delivery and moving needs. Set the time and the fare and specify any extra details in the comments. Wait for the offers to roll in and choose the one that works best for you.\n\nPROFESSIONAL SERVICES\nFrom home improvement to tutoring and beauty care services. Describe your task, name your price and get skilled help from local pros you can trust.\n\nWhy choose inDrive\nQUICK AND EASY\nIt's simple and fast to request an affordable ride — just enter points \"A\" and \"B\" in the app, name the fare you are willing to pay, and choose your driver.\n\nOFFER YOUR FARE\ninDrive provides you with a tailored, surge-free ride-hailing experience. Here you, and not the algorithm, decide on the fare and choose the driver. We do not set the pricing according to time and mileage like other services. You agree on a win-win price with the driver before the ride starts.\n\nCHOOSE YOUR DRIVER\ninDrive lets you choose your driver from a list of the drivers who accepted your ride request. Pick them based on the best deal, arrival time, driver's rating, number of completed trips, and even a car model.\n\nSTAY SAFE\nSee the driver's name, car model, license plate number, and the number of previously completed trips before accepting the ride. During your trip, you can share the driver's information and the real-time location of the car with your family or friends using the \"Share Your Ride\" button. Your real-time geolocation can be shared via messengers, social networks, e-mail, or SMS Text. All of that is there to make your experience safe & trusted. We're continuously adding new safety features to the app to make sure both riders and drivers can enjoy 100% safe rides.\n\nADD TRAVEL OPTIONS\nDo you have specific requirements? Specify travel add-ons — SUV, extra stops on the way, a child seat, or accommodating special needs. You can write your specific needs or any other details in the comments field like \"traveling with my pet,\" “I have luggage,\" etc.\n\nSIGN UP AS A DRIVER & MAKE EXTRA MONEY\nIf you have a car, inDrive provides an excellent opportunity to make extra money. Set your schedule and enjoy complete transparency with inDrive. See your passenger's drop-off location and fare before accepting the ride request. If the passenger’s price doesn’t seem enough, you can always offer your fare or skip the rides you don’t like with no penalties.\nBest of all, low-to-no service rates mean you make more money driving with inDrive!\n\nWe can't wait for you to experience it. Install the app and let’s ride!"

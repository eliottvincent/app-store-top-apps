Bij het openen krijgt u direct het scherm voor de invoer van een nieuwe rit te zien. De beginstand van de kilometerteller staat al ingevuld. U hoeft dus alleen de eindstand en de adressen te noteren. Voor het laatstgenoemde kunt u ook gebruikmaken van de GPS- of contact-optie.\n\nAutomatische backups\nDe app bepaalt indien gewenst zelf wanneer er een backup gemaakt moet worden. Dit gebeurt automatisch, zonder tussenkomst van de gebruiker. Uiteraard kunt u ook handmatig een backup maken.\n\nRitten terugzetten\nAls u telefoon gestolen wordt of kapot gaat, kunt u in de app ervoor kiezen om ritten terug te zetten. Hiervoor hoeft u alleen maar uw persoonlijke code in te voeren. Met deze code weet de app de juiste backup uit DoodleCloud op te halen.\n\nExporteren vai e-mail\nUiteraard is het ook mogelijk om ritten te exporteren. Hiervoor hoeft u alleen uw e-mailadres in te voeren, zodat we een spreadsheet met ritten naar u kunnen mailen. Gemiddeld duurt dit exporteren slechts 15 seconden!\n\nRitten aanpassen\nNadat u ritten heeft opgeslagen, kunt u deze ook nog aanpassen via de app. Handig, voor als u 'tikfouten' heeft gemaakt bij de kilometerstand!\n\nReacties van gebruikers:\n\"Ik registreer zeker 20 ritten per dag, en het is dus een ramp als er data verloren gaat. De backups komen dus goed van pas! Daarnaast heb ik nog nooit zo'n snelle, eenvoudige ritregistratie op m'n telefoon gehad!\"\n\n\"M'n werkgever wil dat al m'n collega's ermee gaan werken, dus dat zegt ook genoeg, lijkt mij!\"\n\n\"Zeer praktische app en bovendien een klantgerichte, snelle ondersteuning bij vragen.

      "label": "Nano Hotel Booking - is an application for receiving orders and booking rooms in hotels, recreation centers, health centers, guesthouses. \nAlso, it can be used for daily, hourly, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly renting of real estate, vehicles, construction machinery and any other objects. Application’s versatility makes it suitable for services reservation, for example, at hair salons, car workshops, gyms etc. \n\nThe application is fully compatible with the desktop version (Nano Hotel Booking for OS X).\n\nPrinciples of operation\nThe application is based on a calendar registering the statuses of the hotel rooms (objects). The calendar displays the state of a hotel room on any day of the month. In the hourly rent mode there is a separate calendar for one day divided into 5, 10, 15, 30 or 60 minutes. \nBooked days are highlighted with pink color. For each free day, the room rate is given with regard to seasonal prices. \nTo book a room you need to create an order for this room while specifying the term and the type of a rent. An order can be tied to the client book, or you can simply enter client’s name and phone number directly to the order card. \nYou can book a free room straightforward from the calendar. You can open an order card or a room card from the calendar with one click. Rooms can be made unavailable, for example, for the period of renovation. Rooms and orders can also be labeled with colored tags in order to show their current status.\n\nPricing\nIn a room (object) card you can specify the price and the cost of one day of rent. If you have a lot of rooms, it will be more convenient to create price lists in the settings and tie rooms to them. \nYou can specify daily, hourly, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly prices in the price lists separately. \nYou can enter season prices for each room. Season prices can be tied to the price lists. \nIt is possible to add additional options to each order, such as food, excursions, transfers. There is an indication of each option’s price, as well as whether the price depends on the number of days and the number of guests. \nAn account of the room appliances is kept, i.e. refrigerator, TV, telephone set and so forth.\n\nTypes of rent\n\nDaily\nThis is the main mode of the application. The value of an order is calculated as the price per day multiplied by the number of days or nights, depending on the application settings (see “Settings” – “My Profile”).\n\nHourly\nThe value of an order is calculated as the price per hour multiplied by the number of hours of rent (can be specified accurately to within 5 minutes).\n\nWeekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly\nIn these modes (cyclic orders), the value is calculated as the price per one period (week, month, quarter or year) multiplied by the number of periods that have begun. Let us demonstrate you this through an example. Let’s say the monthly rent is 100 and let’s say today is June 30th. Let’s create an order from July 1st to August 31st with a monthly rent type. In this example, the order amount on June 30th will be 0, as the rent starts only since tomorrow. The order amount on July 1st will be 100. On August 1st the order amount will increase by 100 and will equal 200. On September 1st the amount will not change, as the order ends on August 31st. \nYou can stop a cyclic order at any moment. For this purpose, there is a button “Close cyclic order” in an order card. It will set the order amount equal to the sum of money actually received and the end date to the day of an order closure. \n\nIn all types of rent, the value of options is added to the order amount."

In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

      "label": "Ever since Daniel Ofman in his first book Core Qualities, a Gateway to Human Resources (1992) introduced the Core Quadrant as an easy, simple and very effective way to discover your core qualities, pitfalls, challenges and allergies, core quadrants became part of the Dutch educational system. \nIn the business world, from Universities to high schools to primary schools, everywhere people are encouraged to explore their strength (core quality), their weakness (pitfall), their learning points (challenges) and their personal judgements (allergies). Without exception participants are surprised, inspired and excited to discover the relationships between these four aspects in themselves and others. By now more then a million Dutch people know about core quadrants, and over 100.000 copies of his book have been sold (in the Dutch language only). Core quadrants have virtually become part of the language.\nRecognition and admission are characteristic reactions from each individual who is introduced to the simplicity and logic which made core quadrants so immensely popular.\n \nWith this application you can go one step further. Thru a 16-step Self Analysis you can build and store 16 core quadrants.\nWhat makes this application unique, is the module Daily Reflection, which enables you to reflect on your daily interactions with others or your own behaviour. The application will then look for correlations between the core quadrants you made earlier and the issue you are reflecting on. It will then either give you feedback or invite you to make a new core quadrant. The application is designed to help you to translate the initial insights you got when you built your first core quadrants, into daily practice, in order to benefit from your increased awarenes. Somewhere in Daniel Ofman's latest book on core qualities \"Fancy Meeting Me Here..!?\" it is mentioned: \"The world is not waiting for people to become aware of their core qualities. The world is waiting for people who are willing to make their awareness productive and have meaningful interactions. When awareness about yourself has no effect on what you do and how you deal with people, building a core quadrant makes no sense and is a useless exercise.\"\n   \nWhy do so many people nowadays spend so little time to reflect? Maybe it is because the price we have to pay for awareness is simply too high. This price is namely responsibility. Once you realise and see what is going on and why you behave the way you do, it automatically makes you responsible. Next time you can't say anymore you didn't know. People are not bad, people are often unconscious and the moment you wake up, you bear responsibility and not everyone likes that. This app is meant for people who want to take responsibility for their own lives and their part in relationships with others. Usually this brings success as well as joy."

      "label": "RouteRegistration is the ideal app for tracking mileage for reimbursement or tax deduction. By using Hotspot Detection you are notified when you have arrived at a destination. By using a supported Bluetooth Smart tag, RouteRegistration Car Detection will detect your car automatically and will notify when you leave your car. So you'll never forget to register your mileage! Because RouteRegistration calculates the mileage from previously registered routes or the ideal calculated route, registering your mileage is super easy. Combining Hotspot Detection, Car Detection and automatically calculation of the mileage, it's possible to register a ride with one touch, just press 'Save'!\n\nCloud sync & backup\n\nWith RouteRegistration it is also possible to manage the mileage registration on multiple iOS devices. The Cloud Sync functionality syncs all data super fast to the cloud. This creates a backup of the mileage registration in the Cloud and on all your iOS devices running RouteRegistration. There are no additional fees for using Cloud Sync. If you don't want to use Cloud Sync, that's no problem, you can also use RouteRegistration with local storage only.\n\nReporting & Export\n\nRouteRegistration can easily generate a report containing all important information about your mileage registration. This report allows you to filter by date and search criteria. You can choose from various export possibilities; Send by e-mail, export to Dropbox or print to an AirPrint-enabled printer. In both email and Dropbox exports an PDF and an CSV file are included that you can use in Excel. Also all export files are stored on the iOS device itself, these files can easily be transfer from iTunes to your computer.\n\nRouteRegistration Car Detection\n\nRouteRegistration can use a supported Bluetooth Smart tag to identify your car. By placing a Bluetooth Smart tag in your car, RouteRegistration can detect when you are in your car and when you leave your car. When you leave your car RouteRegistration will notify you, so the mileage can be easily registered!\n\n* Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. But RouteRegistration is optimized to minimize the battery usage."

Now with Scripting and Siri Shortcuts support!\n\nAccounts, recipes, expenses, inventory — life is full of things that we don’t want to forget or misplace. Tap Forms 5 helps you organize all kinds of things in one place — secure, searchable, and accessible on your iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch (Mac app sold separately).\n\nHow can one app organize everything? Because not only can you use and customize the more than 30 built-in templates but you can create your own “forms” for inputting any kind of information, even if that information includes pictures, doodles, audio recordings, calculations, file attachments, ratings, or even links to other forms. This makes it almost like building your very own customized organization app.\n\n• Capture your way: Snap a picture, type or scribble some text, record an audio note, scan a barcode — there are 23 different types of information that can be captured with Tap Forms\n\n• Organize your way: Create and design custom forms exactly how you want to for optimal organization. Get started with one of our ready-to-go form templates, or easily make a custom one from scratch with our integrated form building tools.\n\n• Store confidential data with confidence: Tap Forms' security settings let you optionally require a password or a Touch ID scan, and even auto-lock when idle for a custom period of time. Using AES encryption, you can rest easy knowing your data is safe and secure.\n\n• Import, Export, Share: It’s easy to import your data from existing files, so getting started is a breeze. Import your data from text, CSV, Bento and more. One-tap exporting allows you to share with Mac, Windows, and Linux users.\n\nAdvanced Features:\n\n• Scripting support for writing JavaScript code for performing all kinds of operations on your forms and records.\n• Siri Shortcuts let you record a voice command to execute any Form script.\n• Multi-column (table) view of your records.\n• AirDrop records to your nearby contacts.\n• Sync with Tap Forms for iOS and Mac using iCloud, IBM Cloudant, Nearby (WiFi), or with your own Apache CouchDB sync server.\n• Saved search rules with multi-field record filtering\n• Built-in Backup & Restore\n• 1Password Extension integration for logging into your Cloudant sync account.\n• Document Picker support for accessing iCloud and other document service providers.\n• Pick lists for quick data entry\n• AES-256 bit encryption\n• Import & Export standard CSV files from Excel, Numbers, or other systems\n• Print record details\n• Lightning fast search\n• Share form templates with friends, family, and co-workers\n• Notify you of things that need your attention using alerts\n• Barcode scanning of UPC/EAN and QR codes (iOS only)\n\nStore 25 different types of information, such as:\n\n• Script\n• Table\n• Link to form (relational links between forms)\n• Inverse relationships\n• File Attachment with multi-file support\n• Email address\n• GPS location\n• Contact\n• Text\n• Date\n• Time\n• Date & time\n• Number\n• Rating\n• Web site address\n• Check mark\n• Note\n• Audio notes (record on iOS, playback on Mac)\n• Photos\n• Drawings (draw on iOS, view on Mac)\n• Phone number\n• Section headings\n• Calculations\n• Signatures\n\nIncludes more than 30 built-in forms, including:\n\n• Audio dictation\n• Bank accounts\n• Clients\n• Client call log\n• Credit & debit cards\n• Daily journal\n• Expenses\n• Frequent flyer numbers\n• Health insurance\n• Homework assignments\n• Loyalty cards\n• Personal health cards\n• Security alarm codes\n• Serial numbers\n• Vehicle insurance\n• Website accounts\n• Wine collection"

Test her witty personality or just ask her to tell a joke or two. \n\nCommon Questions and concerns: \n\nQ: Why do I get strange answers to my question? \nA: Voice Answer will first check it's knowledge servers, including Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha's award winning service, for an answer. If these don't respond, either because the answer is unavailable or the servers are down, the chatbot will answer the question. These answers are generally more funny than useful. You can avoid strange answers by disabling the chatbot, and try your question later. We are further enhancing our current data sources with additional databases as these become available, as we want to offer our customers the very best. \n\nQ: What do I do when voice answer doesn't understand my voice? \nA: Voice Answer compares your voice against a database of spoken english words and sentences. It works better for some people than for others. In general it works better than the voice recognition used by many other apps, but it depends on your accent. Try to speak slow and use regular sentences. If this doesn't work, you can use the keyboard. As and when better voice recognition algorithms are developed and become available, we can and will plug these in. \n\nQ: The app crashes. What can I do? \nA: On some devices such as the iPad1 or 3GS, it may sometimes be required to do a hard reset to get it to work. If this fails, removing the app and installing it again will generally get it going. We are working on improving the stability on those devices. \n\nPlease contact us at support@sparklingapps.com for any questions or comments. If you have any problems with any of the functions of the app, we can assist you with it. We are proud of our product and want our customers to get the most out of it."

If you need to keep track of time and expenses, you can’t find a better app than Time Master. We at On-Core are IT professionals, so we have firsthand experience with billing and keeping track of time. We know from personal experience what is needed and have made this app so flexible, it works for virtually anyone in any industry in which time needs to be kept.\n\nFeatures:\n- Track time by start, stop and/or by duration\n- Sessions option can track \"punch-in & out\" for a single time entry\n- Single or multiple running timers\n- Timers keep running even if you are not running the app\n- Time Entries are by Client and can be sub-categorized by Project and Tasks\n- Powerful billing rates that can be defined in the following priority: Global, by Client, by Project, by Task or Custom per entry\n- Powerful Time Rounding: by hour, minutes and/or seconds\n- Multiple Filters to sort and view only what you need to see\n- Define the day of the week that your work week starts\n- Track Expenses - from Mileage to Meals to Burning CD's and anything else you want to define\n- Display Reports right on your device that you can view and export via email in HTML and/or CSV format. By Client or Timesheet\n- Copy Client information from your Contacts list\n- Dual taxes for countries such as Canada\n- Import IIF files\n- Full Backup & Restore capabilities\n- and so much more!\n\nOPTIONAL MODULES (one-time additional fee required as an \"In App Purchase\"):\n- Invoicing: If you want to do billing directly from your iPhone or iPod Touch then look no further. The most powerful invoicing module built directly into Time Master. Professional PDF invoices can be emailed to the client, including your own logo.\n- Quickbooks Export: Easily export your Time Entries with a QB IIF file. Win QB 2007 Pro or greater.

It will allow you to time across days, for example if you start a job at 8 p.m. and finish at 2 a.m., it will have a duration of 6 hours.\n\nExpenses can be setup for recurring fixed cost items, such as burning a CD, reimbursement of hardware items, or fluid things such as toll expenses, automobile mileage, etc.\n\nQuick reporting can be done on the iPhone / iPod Touch with the Reports function. The report can be emailed in an HTML and/or CSV format.\n\nAdding new Clients, Projects, Tasks and Expenditures is super easy.  You can create them on the fly without having to navigate to a separate maintenance screen. To edit them you can tap on Setup, do you edit and then return to where you left off in Time Entries or Expenses. By selecting a Project or Task first will automatically fill in the Client field for quick entry.\n\nWe’ve made everything as seamless as possible, as you would expect from a top class iOS application.

Film production is expensive and time is of the essence so using a SOLight, directors, set builders and lighting crew are able to synchronize the best daylight and know the direction of the sun or its current position. \n\n> Solar Energy Installers (DIY and professional) – Figuring out the optimum position for solar energy collection is crucial for installers to make the most of the solar energy available. \n\n> Builders/Upgraders – Adding to an existing building can be made easier as knowing how to track the sun means finding out where light and solar heat or shade is available and at what times of the day. \n\n> Architects and Planners – Visit your target development location and quickly record the direction of the sun from any point. \n\n\nUsing SOLight, see the exact track of the sun live or for any chosen day from any location on the planet, all shown conveniently as an image on your screen! \n\nSunlight is a commodity we can all do with or without depending on the circumstances – those with too much need to know how to find the shade and those with too little need to maximize the amount they can access. Using SOLight it is possible to accurately determine the amount of available light (or shade) and the length of time it is incident!\n\n\n> LIVE VIEW\nThis mode is an instant way of seeing the position of the sun relative to wherever the device is pointed. If the sun is not in view of the device, an animated sun arrow helpfully points the way to the current sun position, realigning itself in real-time as the device is re-oriented.\n\nBuilt in compass display shows the precise direction the device is pointed at so when sun track images are recorded.\n\n> SUN PATHS\nAutomatically displayed Winter/Summer Paths– In the display, the red and yellow lines above and below the suns current (white) track indicate where the sun tracks at the highest and lowest points of its seasonal travel. \n\nSun tracking curves are displayed with an easy to read timeline so the time of day when the sun passes a particular point, or the time shading starts/ends can be read by simply looking along the sun track. \n\n> COMPARE\nDate View – Set a new date. The display will update to show data about the position of the sun and its track relevant to that date. \n\nDetailed information about the track of the sun and its position at any time is available right on the screen or in the Detail View.\n\n> SUN PICS\nSave your sun track image or share the picture instantly via email – location scouts and realtors can send an image of their screen containing all the sun position, sun track, time and location information to an email address or save the taken picture on the device for later use. \n\n--- PRODUCT FEATURES ---\n\n# Current sun track\n# Sun track for the summer solstice (peak)\n# Sun track for the winter solstice (lowest point)\n# Current sun position\n# Peak time and precise daylight length for all calculated sun tracks\n# Every full hour is marked on the sun tracks\n# Positioning with digital compass and integrated gyroscope\n# Compass direction and elevation for the viewing direction\n# Crosshair and horizon line\n# Operates worldwide with GPS data\n\n### Download SOLight and transform your iPad/iPhone into an instant solar calculator! ###\n\nWe appreciate any feedback, questions or tips.

      "label": "The most complete, flexible and versatile calculator for professionals in the oil and gas industry!\n\nNow optimized for iOS 12 and above. \nNewly added features: \n- Calculator for Aromatics\n- Added the following tables to the oil conversion screen: table 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 52, 56, 57, 58\n- Added a field for density correction in the main calculator (and quantity editor) for the calculation of special applications in case a thermal expansion coefficient is not available\n- Viscosity / pour point / flash point blender\n- LNG density calculator\n- Viscosity / Temperature calculator\n- Density data for both the LPG and LNG density calculator are stored in the phone for easy retrieval\n\nThe app uses the ASTM tables / formulas to calculate weights and volumes based on entered density15, density20, relative density or API, observed volume, pressure and temperature, and calculates the following:\n- Volume correction factor (to number of decimals of your own choice or as set by table Version)\n- Metric tons (vacuum)\n- Metric tons (air)\n- GSV (M3 @15)\n- BBLS (@60)\n- Longtons\n- Gallons\n\nOilCalcs contains both ASTM 1980 and ASTM 2004 tables (including updates 2007 and 2009) as well as the ASTM 1952 version of LPG Table 54, and users can select which table to use in the settings screen. Users can also select whether they want to calculate using SI Metric units or Imperial units.\n\nPrecision for VCF, GSV, MTons, LTons and Bbls can be changed using the settings screen. Settings are saved in the app so that when you use the app next time it will calculate with your chosen settings.\n\nDensities can be entered in the following formats which are automatically recognized:\ne.g 0.9664 / 966.4 / 9664\n\nThe app can calculate for crude oil, black and white products, lubrication oils and special applications, and input can be changed between density in vacuum at 15 and 20 deg C/ API / relative density / observed, and degrees Celsius / Fahrenheit by touching the applicable buttons.\n\nThe user has the choice to calculate using as input observed M3 / M3 at 15 / observed Barrels / Barrels 60 / Metric tons air/vac / Ltons / Gallons.\n\nThe user can also calculate weights of LPG / NGL, using either density @ 15C, relative density @60F, observed density or density @ 20C.\n\nAside from the conversion screen with conversions between API, observed density, density 15, density 20 and relative density, there is also a screen with conversions used in LPG / NGL.\n\nFor products, lube oils and crude there are two tools for calculating final density when blending two components: one tool that calculates the blend after loading the 2nd component, and another tool that lets the user choose the two components and advises which component to load first, based on density 15C or API 60F and actual temperature of the components. Both tools also calculate volume shrinkage due to blending.\n\nA utility has been included that enables the user to export data from the calculator screen directly into a database for future reference. The same utility can be used to enter data manually and edit previously entered data.\n\nFor a detailed tutorial please visit our webpage (http://mooringmarineconsultancy.wordpress.com)."

      "label": "Stargate ESP Trainer is designed to help you learn to describe distant or future events.\nIt is a direct out-growth of the secret $25 million CIA, STAR GATE program with dozens of viewers at SRI, where we showed that psychic abilities are real and available.\n            \nIn this training game, the viewer is presented with two Yes/No questions pertaining to the outdoor image you will see shortly. Your goal is to quiet your mind and become aware of that picture.\n\nYou select one of the two choices by pressing the answer which best matches your awareness of that image. When you do that, a second question\nwill appear. You then repeat the process. The Property Matches indicator at the bottom shows the number of correct answers to 24 questions.\n\nFour pictures will then appear. Tap the picture that best matches your mental image. The correct picture will fill the screen. After 12 pictures you may begin a new game.\n\nThis program offers feedback and reinforcement to meets the requirements for learning this skill. The Stargate ESP Trainer presents meaningful and emotional images to your subconscious mind. This ability is often called clairvoyance, and can enhance your life in many surprising ways."

Questions are randomly generated which means it is very replayable. The game has been carefully designed for children, with large, widely spaced buttons. We recommend that young children play on a tablet.\n\nSix main topics are covered: \n\n* Times tables - up to 10 or 12 \n* Division - up to 10 or 12\n* Square numbers\n* Number bonds\n* Doubling \n* Halving\n\nBetween these topics, the four standard arithmetic operations are covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nYou can create up to 30 player profiles per device to track an individual's high scores (increased from 15 in 2019). If you prefer there's also the option to play as a guest. All data is stored locally on your device so you don't have to worry about privacy issues. We've also made it very easy for children to quickly switch between profiles after playing a game, if they're sharing a device.\n\nAfter each game, the score achieved is displayed along with the child's high score. Bronze, silver or gold stars and trophies are awarded depending on the score achieved in each game."

      "label": "Mit Antolin dem Leseraben können Kinder ihre Lesefertigkeit auf spielerische Weise steigern. Dabei werden Konzentration und  Wahrnehmung, Augenbewegung und Blickspanne trainiert. Dies fördert die Sicherheit bei der Worterfassung und verbessert die Lesefähigkeit  der Kinder.  Die liebevoll gestalteten und temporeichen  Übungen bieten zusätzlich viel  Aktion und Spielspaß so dass Lesetraining ganz nebenbei erfolgt! Durch das Spielen gegen die Zeit werden die Kinder zum Verbessern ihres Highscores und damit zum häufigen Wiederholen motiviert.\n\nDie 7 Lesespiele fördern zentrale Lesefertigkeiten\n\nPunkte jagen \nMit den Augen wird ein schnell wandernder Punkt verfolgt, der ab und zu seine Farbe ändert. Diese Übung trainiert die Konzentrationsfähigkeit  sowie eine gleichmäßige und schnelle Augenbewegung.  Gleichzeitig werden die reflexhafte Reaktion und Blicksprünge geübt.  Denn bei einem flüssigen und schnellen Lesen bewegen sich die Augen nicht gleichmäßig von Buchstabe zu Buchstabe, sondern sie springen von einem Haltepunkt zum nächsten. \n\nBlitzwörter\nEs wird ein Wort gezeigt, welches nach kurzer Zeit wieder verschwindet.  Dieses Wort soll aus einer Auswahl von drei Wörtern wiedererkannt werden.\nDiese Übung trainiert das ganzheitliche Erfassen und das Wiedererkennen  der Wortgestalt von ein- und zweisilbigen Wörtern  Dadurch kann das Kind Wörter schneller erfassen, sodass seine Leseflüssigkeit zunimmt. \n\nWortpaare\nAus einer  Anzahl von  Wortpaaren sollen die ungleichen  Wortpaare erkannt und angetippt werden. \nDiese Übung trainiert die Lesegeschwindigkeit bekannter und unbekannter Wörter. Die Wörter werden als Bilder wahrgenommen und werden nicht Buchstabe für Buchstabe mühsam erlesen. \n\nWortgitter\nIn einem Buchstabenfeld soll  möglichst schnell das gesuchte Wort zweimal wiedergefunden werden.  \nDiese Übung trainiert die Wortauffassung und die Diskrimination von Wortbildern. \n\n\nBücherwurm\nIn einem Kontinuum von sich bewegenden Konsonanten sollen  möglichst schnell die gesuchten Wörter  erlesen werden. \nDiese Übung trainiert die Erfassung von Wortgrenzen. \n\nBildersuche \nIn einem Bild sollen möglichst schnell die gesuchten Ausschnitte gefunden und angetippt werden.\nDiese Übung trainiert die horizontale Blickführung und die visuelle Wahrnehmung. Das Kind muss genau hinsehen und sich konzentrieren. Die Blickspanne wird erweitert, wodurch der Lesefluss verbessert und ein schnelles sowie sicheres Lesen möglich wird.  \n\nBallonspiel\nDiese Übung  trainiert die Blickspanne und die Konzentration. Das Auge der Kinder muss über das gesamte Spielfeld wandern, da immer neue Ballons hinzukommen. Durch den konzentrierten Blick und das Lesen muss in kurzer Zeit wahrgenommen werden, ob der Buchstabe an dem Ballon zu dem Wort  in dem Ballon passt. Erste Lesefertigkeiten und –fähigkeiten werden darüber gefördert. \n\nDie Punkte, die die Kinder in der Antolin Lesepiele-App erzielen, werden nicht  dem Punktekonto auf www.antolin.de zugerechnet.\n \nWir sind daran interessiert, unsere Apps kontinuierlich zu verbessern. Bitte senden Sie Verbesserungsvorschläge und Fehlermeldungen per E-Mail an antolin@schroedel.de. Vielen Dank!"

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "Team Shake provides a technological and environmentally friendly way to choose teams for board games, sporting events, tournaments, school projects or anytime groups are required. The newest release brings many new features including full iPad support, balancing teams based on skill or gender, importing users from a file, enabling video output, and sharing teams via facebook or email. \n\nTeam Shake is the premier iOS App for creating teams. Instead of a hat and scraps of paper, the user enters his friends' names in his iPhone and gives it a shake. The screen will then display a random set of color-coded teams. These teams can immediately be used for game play or shared via facebook or email.   The quick and easy selection of random (or balanced) teams eliminates fighting over who will be on which team. Innovative use of the iPhone shake gesture gives users the satisfying feeling of shaking a virtual hat without the trouble of carrying around an actual hat. Conventional buttons can also be used for those who would rather not shake their expensive hardware about.  \n\nThe app is designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind. Names can easily be entered with the onscreen keyboard, chosen from the user's contacts, or imported from a file. The email and facebook functions document the members of each individual team as well as preserving the team number and color assigned by the app. For repeated use of Team Shake, lists of friends can be easily saved and loaded later. The current list is also automatically saved so that if you exit the app, or even reboot the device, changes will not be lost. For teachers and others with large lists of people, Team Shake supports the ability to import teams from text or csv files.\n\nIf you have any problems, feature requests, or comments please send an email to support@rhine-o.com. \n\nFeatures:\n\n* Create 1 to 64 random teams\n* Create completely random or balanced teams\n* Full iPad support\n* Eliminates fighting over choosing teams\n* Share / Save teams via email or Facebook\n* Teams can be chosen by the number of teams or by the size of teams.\n* Save lists of friends for later games\n* Import lists from email or spreadsheet\n* Export lists and options for use on another device\n* Satisfying feeling of shaking a “virtual” hat to create teams\n* Animated shaking hat\n* Entry of names via onscreen keyboard\n* Entry of names via iPhone contacts\n* Temporarily disable people who are absent\n* Set groups of people to always be on the same team\n* Set groups of people to always be on different teams\n* Set user strength to make more even teams (now supports fully balanced teams)\n* 5 users strengths level\n* Pick a single random person from the list of players\n* User strength indicator on the main screen (can be disabled in options)\n* Number of active players and total players is now displayed on the main screen\n* Video Out Support\n* Option to Sort Teams by Name\n* Option to balance male / female team members\n* \"Equal Ability\" option to create teams where all players have the same strength\n* Option to create separate male and female teams\n* Configurable Team Colors\n* Configurable Team Names\n* Print Support\n* Export Teams in CSV or XLS Format\n* Team Shake now supports simultaneously assigning players to multiple subteams and / or oppose teams at the same time.\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now have customized names to make selection easier\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now be enabled or disabled globally so that teams can be made quickly without subteams / oppose teams.  In particular, Balance Teams Strengths will work when separate Male / Female teams are created.\n\nYappler-Tags: Teams, Groups, Random, Hat, Entertainment, Games, Utilities"

      "label": "Splitting Numbers is the number one app to teach your child the fundamentals of mathematics.\n\n'To split’ teaches kids the essence of figures and is taught to all children in the first grade. It is one of the keystones to gain mathematical insight. That is why this is taught to first-grades all year through!\n\nAt last! Now there is 'Splitting Numbers’: the app that teaches your kid the basics of splitting numbers in a fun and self-dependent way.\n\nNo more sorting out the wrinkled paper cards! This app presents you digital flash cards in an intelligent way, completely scalable to the abilities of your 6 year old.\n\nPossibilities offered by this App :\n\n∙ choose what numbers you want to work with (from 0 to 10)\n∙ you can create practice sessions of 10, 25, 50, 100 or 200 exercises\n∙ when your kid has more difficulties with a certain number, you can easily adjust the settings so the app will present more exercises with this specific number. This way you child will get better at it very soon!\n∙ a thumbs-up or thumbs-down icon and an accompanying sound tells your child wether the exercise was correct or not\n∙ you can easily switch the sound on or off\n\nWhy Splitting Numbers?\n\nSplitting numbers is the most used method to teach children the connections between certain figures.\n\nFirst of all, splitting numbers brings insight to the so called 'commutative characteristic’ of the sum of numbers. This characteristic holds that the order of the numbers in a sum are not important: 3 + 5 equals 5 + 3.\n\nOn the other side - splitting numbers shows the connection between sums and subtractions. You may bring two parts together to form a whole (sums), but you may also remove a part from the whole (subtractions). When you understand that you can split 8 into 5 + 3, you have the solutions to 4 different exercises: 3 + 5, 5 + 3, 8 - 5 and 8 - 3. By learning and understanding how to split numbers - your kid has to learn 4 times less ‚facts’.\n\nIt is important that splitting numbers becomes a habit, an automation. You must know them by heart, without thinking.\n\n\nWhy automation?\n\nTo automate in mathematics means that you know the solution to an exercise by heart. You know the solution of an exercise by heart if you can say or write down the solution without thinking, counting,…\n\nWith all kinds of mathematics there is attention for automation. To know certain exercises by heart makes it a lot easier to connect the dots in other mathematic exercises."

      "label": "Bloups permet d’apprendre à lire dans le plaisir… Application entièrement conçue par une orthopédagogue. \n\nDescription du contenu pédagogique de Bloups : (choix de l’accent: français, québécois ou belge) \n\n1) Lecture de syllabes : niveaux de difficulté progressifs \n- syllabes simples (ex. : la, ma, ar, etc.) \n- syllabes comportant des sons simples (ex. : lou, lin, leu, etc.) \n- syllabes comportant des sons complexes (ex. : rouille, rein, gue, etc.) \n- syllabes comportant des confusions visuelles (ex. : bo, do, po) et des confusions auditives (ex. :di, ti) \n\n2) Lecture de mots : \n- mots simples (ex. : rire, tomate, etc.) \n- mots complexes (ex. : combien, explication, etc.) \n- mots irréguliers (ex. : femme, monsieur, etc.) \n\n3) Chronomètre (optionnel) : \n- permet au joueur (qui le souhaite) de toujours améliorer son propre temps en lecture \n\n4) Repère visuel structurant (fiole d’énergie) : \n- indique au joueur le nombre d’items réussis et le nombre d’items restants \n\nParents et pédagogues s’intéressent à cette application éducative, car elle s’adresse aux lecteurs débutants et intermédiaires. Elle est aussi recommandée aux jeunes ayant des difficultés ou des troubles en lecture (ex.: dyslexie d’assemblage, autisme, etc.). \n\nÉtant réalisée par une orthopédagogue, la progression de chaque niveau respecte les étapes d’apprentissage de la lecture syllabique. De ce fait, Bloups représente un défi juste, raisonnable et motivant qui tient compte de la progression propre à chaque enfant. Le focus est porté essentiellement sur la lecture de syllabes; condition essentielle à une bonne rapidité et une bonne justesse en lecture de mots et de phrases. En effet, la lecture de pseudo-mots (ex.: remu, lumiron, bratoir, etc.) oblige l’élève à lire, à décoder correctement chaque syllabe, il ne peut donc pas “deviner” le mot par une lecture globale. Pour être un bon lecteur, il faut, entre autres, maîtriser les deux voix de lecture, c’est-à-dire, la lecture syllabique et la lecture globale. Bloups représente donc une application pour apprendre à lire efficacement. \n\n\nLe contenu pédagogique de cette application favorise essentiellement l’augmentation de la vitesse de lecture, la précision du décodage, l’apprentissage de la fusion phonémique et l’apprentissage de la segmentation de différentes structures syllabiques. Il contribue aussi à l’automatisation de la lecture de sons composés (ex. : ou, on, in, en, an) et de sons complexes (ex. : g, c, aille, ouille, etc). Enfin, la lecture de mots simples, complexes et irréguliers incluse dans Bloups permet au joueur de faire le pont entre la lecture de syllabes et la lecture de mots réels. \n\nBut du jeu : \nLe joueur doit écouter la syllabe, la structure syllabique ou le mot donné oralement pour ensuite repérer la bonne réponse parmi les bulles proposées par les monstres. Après 5 succès, le joueur obtient une page de jeu de 5 secondes et après 20 succès (fiole toute remplie), le joueur est mené vers la découverte d’un nouveau monstre où la complexité de la lecture de syllabes est légèrement plus complexe. Pour l’apprenant, le but est d’amasser le plus de monstres possible et d’améliorer son propre temps s’il reprend un monstre ! Apprendre à bien lire devient alors monstrueusement amusant ! \n\nVariante : \nIl est possible pour l’adulte de déverrouiller préalablement tous les monstres d’une même ligne afin de proposer seulement un monstre précis à l’enfant en fonction de ses besoins particuliers. Par exemple, l’adulte aura déverrouillé les monstres 31 et 32 pour que l’enfant n’ait qu’à faire le monstre 33 travaillant les confusions spatiales et visuelles b, d, p, q."

You can choose which tables you want to practice and how many tables at the same time. As new sums fall down you quickly have to find the right answer mounted to the vault door to finally open the vault when completing all tables! \n\nDuring the development of TableVault several kids and teachers of an elementary school were involved. The kids told us which parts of the game they liked and teachers instructed us in standard school teachings. For example, the time in which a sum is supposed to be solved is defined and integrated into this app. The faster kids solve the sum the more points they get! This method ensures they will automatically try to improve their skills to get the highest score! \n\nIn this app an overview of all practices are saved for each child. This includes all the tables a child has practiced and how well he/she is performing for each table. Thus parents can easily track improvements of all their kids."

Mnemonica, Aronoson, Sti-stebbins) \n\n‘Practice P.A.O’ \n\nOur method for learning the stack uses the unique P.A.O Method (person, action, object.) \n\nYou will be able to enter your own custom values and practice them within the app! \n\nIn order to protect the integrity of our methods we won’t go any deeper into that here, but you will be able to practice P.A.O within the app. \n\n‘Practice the Stack’\n\nThis is where you’ll spend most of your time.\n\nIn the ‘practice the stack’ part of the app there are a lot of settings you can play around with! \n\nYou can practice any part of the stack e.g. 1-10, 5-25, or 1-52 (anything you choose!) \n\nYou can also practice based on suits, odd cards, even cards, red or black cards and more! \n\nYou can also set your own rules for the training deciding whether you want to be timed, lose lives, or practice in free play mode. \n\nYour custom stacks also automatically sync with this part of the app. \n\nEach day you practice you’ll update your streak - get to thirty days and we’ll send you something special! \n\nThis app is constantly being worked on to make it the best app in the magic industry regarding stack training - you won’t be disappointed. \n\nBuy now!"

Awesome with a smartboard as well.\" - by jbrown61\n\nSolar Walk enables you to:\n\n► Observe 3D model of our Solar system with all its objects in real time and in a ​proper orientation.

      "label": "The infosphere, Visualized.\n\nEvery time we use our phones, tablets or laptops we are entering an invisible world of wireless digital signals. It is a world that we cannot see but that is literally all around us.\nThe Architecture of Radio is a 360 degree data visualization of what this world might look like. It shows the cell towers, GPS satellites and Wi-Fi routers around you that allow us to live our digital lives.\n\nNew: support for Iphone X, XR, XS and XS Max Screens\nNew: Cardboard support!\nImmerse yourself in the Infosphere in Virtual Reality using a cardboard or compatible headset*\n\n*Carboard support only for iPhone. iPhone 6s or newer recommended for best performance.\n\nWhy should I use this app?\n\nOut of curiosity! We are increasingly dependent on a global ecosystem of digital signals. We use them for so many things, yet we cannot see them. We can see the roads we use to travel, the buildings we live in, but not the infrastructure that is changing the world. How can we understand this world without understanding how it works? \nThe purpose of this app is to make the invisible visible so we can look at it, think about it and discuss it.\n\nWhy Should I not use this app?\n\nThis app is not a measurement tool. It’s purpose is to inspire, to see the world through a different lens. The app is based on real world data and gives you a pretty good idea of the density of digital signals around you, but it won’t tell you where to move the couch to get a better WIFI signal.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is a data visualization, based on global open datasets of cell tower, Wi-Fi and satellite locations. Based on your GPS location the app shows a 360 degree visualization of signals around you. The dataset includes almost 7 million cell towers, 19 million Wi-Fi routers and hundreds of satellites.\n\nIs this really what radio signals look like?\n\nWe can’t see radio with our eyes. The waves that we use for our cell phones and Wi-Fi are way outside the spectrum of visible light. In order to “see” radio, it has to be interpreted or translated into an image that we can see. There are many ways to do that but it will always be an interpretation.\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is an impression of the infosphere, a way of seeing it."

There’s so much to do here. Our Little Builders dig, plaster, fill, paint and mix... And they need your children´s help.\n\nAt the same time they can watch funny things happen, because on every building site there’s always something going wrong.

Depending on the child’s age, all animations and functions can run automatically or be controlled through a tap.\n\n7 interactive scenarios contain over 100 interactive animations and surprises:\n\n1. Steer the digger, fill the truck and repair the water pipe.\n2. Paint the house in different colours and unload the removals truck.\n3. Operate the crane and build a new roof for the house.\n4. Mix cement and build a real wall.\n5. Operate a big cement mixer and concrete a large area.\n6. Drive the street sweeper and clean the dirty road.\n7. Unload the crane truck and make sure it leaves on time.\n\nAmazing graphics, great animations, a user-friendly interface, no text and no in-app purchases. Download now and start building!\n\nPlease also check out our other great Apps for kids:\n\n„PETTING ZOO“ - is a fantastic storybook app for the iPad and iPhone.

      "label": "With the Bumba LaLaLa App you can improve the musical ear of your kids while they’re having great fun. The cute clown Bumba lets your kids recognize different sounds, melodies and musical instruments while playing. The app has two game levels: the first aimed at toddlers, the second at preschoolers.\n\nThe toddler level introduces children to musical instruments and their sounds. The auditory processes of 2-3 year olds are stimulated by teaching them the difference in sound between these seven basic instruments.\n\nThe preschooler level for 4-5 year olds goes one step further: preschoolers can create their own melody or recreate melodies they like. For that they have ten instruments that they can combine endlessly. Furthermore, they can set the speed and volume themselves. They are supported by a metronome.\n\nThis interactive music game was developed in cooperation with child development specialist. Therefore your kids are ensured of a fun play experience suitable for their age. All features of the game are designed to meet the development needs of 2-3 year olds (toddler level) and 4-5 year olds (preschooler level).\n\nFrom early on, children pay special attention to melodies. Toddlers and preschoolers just love music. They clap their hands or stamp their feet to the rhythm when they hear a familiar song. They can also listen to the same song for hours on end without it boring them. But: music is more than just entertainment for them. In children who have early experiences with music, the brain has shown to be better at handling change during the growth process. It adapts easier. Children who learn the difference between notes, rhythms and musical instruments will be able to handle auditory information better. And that’s beneficial for their speech development and for learning to read.\n\nThe Bumba LaLaLa App is therefore not simply a lot of fun to play, it also has a clear educational bonus. Recommended for all who wish to improve their children’s skills in a fun way."

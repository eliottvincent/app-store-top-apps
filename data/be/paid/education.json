      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Set your Hatch timer from 5 to 120 minutes \n2. Stay focused without leaving the app \n3. Enter the goal or other information for this session \n4. Hatch your new friend \n\n-How it Works iPad-\n1. Set your Hatch timer from 5 to 120 minutes \n2. You may let the timer run in the background \n3. Complete your task \n4. Hatch your new friend \n\nParents & Teachers: \nHatch utilizes positive behavioral reinforcement as a way to reward students for staying focused and completing tasks. We recommend starting off with shorter sessions, 5-10 minutes, and gradually increasing the focus sessions as your child or student becomes accustomed to staying focused for longer periods of time without interruption.\n\nPro Tip: Create a family or class focus group. Give your group a fun name and compete to see who can log the most focus minutes in the family. Set your Hatch timer for 25-30 minutes at night and let everyone in the family curl up with their favorite book and come together when it’s time to see what everyone has hatched. \n\nEndorsed by Order out of Chaos (@orderoutofchaos) as a tool to help students with ADHD or those who are otherwise easily distracted"

There’s so much to do here. Our Little Builders dig, plaster, fill, paint and mix... And they need your children´s help.\n\nAt the same time they can watch funny things happen, because on every building site there’s always something going wrong.

Depending on the child’s age, all animations and functions can run automatically or be controlled through a tap.\n\n7 interactive scenarios contain over 100 interactive animations and surprises:\n\n1. Steer the digger, fill the truck and repair the water pipe.\n2. Paint the house in different colours and unload the removals truck.\n3. Operate the crane and build a new roof for the house.\n4. Mix cement and build a real wall.\n5. Operate a big cement mixer and concrete a large area.\n6. Drive the street sweeper and clean the dirty road.\n7. Unload the crane truck and make sure it leaves on time.\n\nAmazing graphics, great animations, a user-friendly interface, no text and no in-app purchases. Download now and start building!\n\nPlease also check out our other great Apps for kids:\n\n„PETTING ZOO“ - is a fantastic storybook app for the iPad and iPhone.

The app is free of advertising.\nWith Family Sharing set up, up to six family members can use this app.\n\nCorrect and Quick Arithmetic Premium does exactly what the name predicts.\nFirst practice the basic calculations, and then speed it up.\n\nThis app was developed for everyone who would like to train and maintain the basic processes of arithmetic.\n\nIn this app you will find exercises with number bonds 1 to 10, addition and subtraction sums up to 100, and the multiplication and division tables up to and including 10. These are the foundations needed for arithmetic.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to have committed to memory the answers to number bonds 1 to 10, addition and subtraction sums up to 20, and the tables through 10 (within 2 seconds). For sums up to 100, the way to work them out is automated. \n\nThe structure of the levels of mental arithmetic in the app:\n        Number bonds 1 to 10\n        Addition and Subtraction to 10\n        Addition and Subtraction to 20\n        Addition and Subtraction to 100\n        Multiplications tables from 0 to 5 and 10 \n        Multiplications tables from 6 to 9\n        Division Tables from 1 to 5 and 10\n        Division Tables from 6 to 9\n\nFirst start to practice without timing yourself. \nIn practice mode (X), the correct answer appears after a wrong answer. Wrongly answered sums are always repeated. \nOnly when this goes well will you be able to start training at speed. \nSo first CORRECT and only then QUICK!\n\nStick to the running order of the sums in the app! \nPractise the number bonds and the sums up to 10 until you can do them all well, and most importantly, fast. These are the most important sums in mental arithmetic!!\n\nButton: Levels - My selection\nYou can use the My Selection button to choose the mix of levels you want to practise.\n\nAfter a series of sums, a smiley will show how many you got right and how many wrong. The more sums you get right, the happier the smiley is!\n\nUltimately, the reward is realizing just how good it is to be able to do these calculations quickly and correctly.\nYou'll find that the arithmetic that comes later will also go better and more quickly because of it.\n\nCorrect and Quick Arithmetic Premium is an indispensable instrument, dependent on any method, for learning mental arithmetic!\n\nHave fun, and good luck with Correct and Quick Arithmetic Premium!\n\nM&M Breuking"

      "label": "Sta in het Duits nooit meer buitenspel! \nIs het nu der, die of das Mannschaft?\n\nIn juni is het weer zo ver - het WK voetbal gaat van start en veel landen kijken uit naar een spannende competitie. Zo ook de Nederlanders en diens liefste voetbalvijand - Duitsland. Dit is voor ons aanleiding genoeg om in Language Passport Nederlands-Duits een heel hoofdstuk met de belangrijkste voetbalbegrippen op te nemen. Zo sta je in het Duits nooit meer buitenspel.\n\nDe opzet van het Language Passport Nederlands-Duits is eenvoudig en gebruiksvriendelijk. De leermethode bestaat uit drie hoofdonderdelen:\n1. Zinnen. Dit onderdeel bestaat uit zinnen ter kennismaking, zinnen voor op reis en 30 opbouw zinnen.\n2. De woordenschat. Dit zijn woorden met een veelvoorkomend karakter als vakantiewoorden, transport en reizen, communicatie, in en om het huis en meer.\n3. Het werkwoordsysteem. In dit systeem kun je een werkwoord en een tijdsbepaling aantikken waarvan vervol- gens de vertaling en vervoeging op je beeldscherm verschijnen.\n\nIn de leermethode worden de lessen bijgestaan door een tolk die zinnen eerst uitspreekt alvorens ze te zien zijn. In de leer-modus van de app, die met een knop onder in het scherm geactiveerd kan worden, kan de tijd tussen de uitgesproken zin en de verschijning worden geregeld middels een interval-button. Hiermee geef je jezelf de kans om de Duitse zin te herhalen voordat je de spelling te zien krijgt. Klaar met de les? Vink hem dan gemakkelijk af van de lijst!\n\nTer ondersteuning van de lessen kan onder de info-button een beknopte uitleg over de uitspraak en grammatica worden gevonden.\n\nDe Language Passport taalcursussen zijn ideaal voor beginners, maar ook voor mensen die al kennis hebben ge- maakt met de vreemde taal en zich de taal in eigen tempo (verder) eigen willen maken. Voor gevorderden zijn de Language Passport taalcursussen uitermate geschikt om hun talenkennis weer op te frissen.\n\nInhoud: \n1. Kennismakingszinnen \n2. Zinnen voor op reis \n3. 30 opbouwzinnen \n4. Vakantiewoorden \n5. De Wereld, de zon, de maan \n6. Transport en reizen \n7. De dieren, plant, boom, bloemen \n8. In en om het huis \n9. Goed, beter, best, positieve dingen \n10. Het lichaam en kleren \n11. Slecht, slechter, slechts, negatieve dingen \n12. Communicatie, praten, luisteren etc. \n13. Eten en drinken \n14. Geld \n15. De familie \n16. De tijd, dagen van de week etc. \n17. Wie? Wat? Waar? \n18. Getallen \n19. Bijvoeglijke naamwoorden en kleuren \n20. Voorzetsels en plaatsbepaling \n21. Voetbal\n22. Werkwoordframe \n23. Onregelmatige werkwoorden\n\nLanguage Passport is verkrijgbaar in meerdere talen. Kijk onder 'Gerelateerd' om ze te ontdekken.\n\n** Als u geen geluid hoort, controleer dan of de mute functie aanstaat op uw toestel"

      "label": "Are you a music student who wants to improve your theory or ear-training skills?  Our mobile app can help.  It's not a theory lesson or video game.  The app focuses on THEORY MEMORIZATION by using interactive audio flashcards on your mobile device.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding music theory is important, but memorization is not emphasized enough when it comes to this subject. Memorizing theory topics will not only help your grades in music class, it will make you a better musician by improving your composition and improvisation skills.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\nSix exercise categories - Notes & Clefs, Key Signatures, Interval Spelling,  Chord Spelling, Interval Ear-training and Chord Ear-Training.\r\n \r\nCustomizable exercises - Control the level of difficulty with the options menu.  A variety of settings allow you to set up the exercises the way you want.  Great for musicians of all ability levels.\r\n\r\nTEN instrument sounds - These are real instrument recordings, not computer generated sounds. Includes: Piano, synth, sax, vocal choir, violin, and four different guitars.\r\n\r\nOver 1000 possible cards - We've included chord and interval cards built on every possible root note. This can create spellings that include double sharps and double flats.  You can choose to remove those cards if you'd like.\r\n \r\nAudio/video controls - Make the app look and sound the way you want with a variety of options: Animation, background color and texture, menu size, melodic/harmonic playback style, playback octave, playback instrument, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES OPTIONS\r\nThree randomization settings - Repeat, no-repeat or unshuffled.\r\n\r\nEar-training options - Pitch lock, inversion, chord spread and wide spread.\r\n\r\nKey signature options - Identify the key name or the number of sharps and flats.\r\n\r\nKey signature clef - Select what clef you want to appear on key exercises.\r\n\r\nLedger lines - Choose weather or not ledger line notes appear in note exercises.\r\n\r\nDouble sharps and double flats - You can choose to remove cards with these notes.\r\n\r\nPlay octave on triads - Triads can be played as three or four note chords.\r\n\r\nChord spelling options - Identify chords by naming the notes or the chord type.\r\n\r\nGuitar tablature settings - Select the fret range on guitar and bass tab cards.\r\n\r\nInterval direction - Choose the initial interval direction, ascending or decending.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO VERSIONS\r\nThis version contains NO ADVERTISING and is available here at the App Store for a low price.  We offer another version here as well. It contains fully functioning exercises at no cost, but contains advertising and doesn't include all ten instrument sounds."

Ce jeu aide l’enfant à apprendre les sons des lettres et des groupes de lettres en présentant simultanément les sons (ou mots) correspondant et les groupes de lettres.\n\nLa progression du jeu est basée sur des données scientifiques : le logiciel été développé par des linguistes, des neuropsychologues et des orthophonistes pour aider les enfants - en particulier les lecteurs en difficulté - à renforcer les automatismes fondamentaux de la lecture.\n\n« GraphoGame – Français » accompagne l’enfant à travers différents jeux avec son propre personnage qu’il fait évoluer au cours du jeu. Le joueur passe progressivement aux syllabes, aux rimes, aux mots courts et aux phrases et apprend peu à peu à décoder des mots plus longs. En jouant 15 minutes quotidiennement, l'enfant améliorera sa précision dans le décodage des lettres, des mots, et sa vitesse de lecture. \n\nLa plateforme GraphoGame est développée par une communauté de chercheurs et de développeurs de jeux leader en Finlande, tandis que le contenu francophone de « GraphoGame Français » a été développé par le Laboratoire de Psychologie Cognitive (CNRS) de l'Université d'Aix-Marseille.\n\nPour plus d’informations sur le contenu francophone, n’hésitez pas à vous rendre sur le site http://grapholearn.fr."

Thank\nyou” - Chattity\n\nSound Touch is the #1 app for entertaining and engaging young children -- complete with\nanimal sounds and music.\n\nStimulate children's brains and teach them all at the same time.\n\nListen to the sounds that farm animals, pets and other wildlife make in nature by touching\nwhimsical cartoons. Teach your toddler what an airplane, truck, and train sound like in a way that they will love.\n\nEach tile you touch opens up and reveals an exciting picture that plays a sound. The images rotate so that children can learn to identify the object, not just the single image that is shown.\n\nParents and children alike love this app and you will too! Download and play with your baby,\ntoddler or young children -- it's easy to learn and can entertain for hours.\n\nListen to the sounds made by both nature and machines. From boats, firetrucks, and\nhorse-drawn carriages to ducks, tigers, and birds. Each animal or object is like its own flash card; when opened, it plays a sound that is sure to stimulate each child and leave them with awe and wonder. This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch. Let them explore and learn with their senses. Parents of children with autism have found this app helpful in engaging their children, but truly it is for anyone that wants to teach their kids something new while stimulating and training their brains.\n\nEvery animal, transportation mode, and tile has five different sounds linked, so children can learn different sounds and images associated with objects. Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

      "label": "There's never been a better time to get into Astronomy! Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text. This app never transmits data from your device.\n\n\nNote: Non-English localizations focus on solar system objects and constellation names."

      "label": "The infosphere, Visualized.\n\nEvery time we use our phones, tablets or laptops we are entering an invisible world of wireless digital signals. It is a world that we cannot see but that is literally all around us.\nThe Architecture of Radio is a 360 degree data visualization of what this world might look like. It shows the cell towers, GPS satellites and Wi-Fi routers around you that allow us to live our digital lives.\n\nNew: support for Iphone X, XR, XS and XS Max Screens\nNew: Cardboard support!\nImmerse yourself in the Infosphere in Virtual Reality using a cardboard or compatible headset*\n\n*Carboard support only for iPhone. iPhone 6s or newer recommended for best performance.\n\nWhy should I use this app?\n\nOut of curiosity! We are increasingly dependent on a global ecosystem of digital signals. We use them for so many things, yet we cannot see them. We can see the roads we use to travel, the buildings we live in, but not the infrastructure that is changing the world. How can we understand this world without understanding how it works? \nThe purpose of this app is to make the invisible visible so we can look at it, think about it and discuss it.\n\nWhy Should I not use this app?\n\nThis app is not a measurement tool. It’s purpose is to inspire, to see the world through a different lens. The app is based on real world data and gives you a pretty good idea of the density of digital signals around you, but it won’t tell you where to move the couch to get a better WIFI signal.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is a data visualization, based on global open datasets of cell tower, Wi-Fi and satellite locations. Based on your GPS location the app shows a 360 degree visualization of signals around you. The dataset includes almost 7 million cell towers, 19 million Wi-Fi routers and hundreds of satellites.\n\nIs this really what radio signals look like?\n\nWe can’t see radio with our eyes. The waves that we use for our cell phones and Wi-Fi are way outside the spectrum of visible light. In order to “see” radio, it has to be interpreted or translated into an image that we can see. There are many ways to do that but it will always be an interpretation.\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is an impression of the infosphere, a way of seeing it."

You can choose which tables you want to practice and how many tables at the same time. As new sums fall down you quickly have to find the right answer mounted to the vault door to finally open the vault when completing all tables! \n\nDuring the development of TableVault several kids and teachers of an elementary school were involved. The kids told us which parts of the game they liked and teachers instructed us in standard school teachings. For example, the time in which a sum is supposed to be solved is defined and integrated into this app. The faster kids solve the sum the more points they get! This method ensures they will automatically try to improve their skills to get the highest score! \n\nIn this app an overview of all practices are saved for each child. This includes all the tables a child has practiced and how well he/she is performing for each table. Thus parents can easily track improvements of all their kids."

      "label": "With the Bumba LaLaLa App you can improve the musical ear of your kids while they’re having great fun. The cute clown Bumba lets your kids recognize different sounds, melodies and musical instruments while playing. The app has two game levels: the first aimed at toddlers, the second at preschoolers.\n\nThe toddler level introduces children to musical instruments and their sounds. The auditory processes of 2-3 year olds are stimulated by teaching them the difference in sound between these seven basic instruments.\n\nThe preschooler level for 4-5 year olds goes one step further: preschoolers can create their own melody or recreate melodies they like. For that they have ten instruments that they can combine endlessly. Furthermore, they can set the speed and volume themselves. They are supported by a metronome.\n\nThis interactive music game was developed in cooperation with child development specialist. Therefore your kids are ensured of a fun play experience suitable for their age. All features of the game are designed to meet the development needs of 2-3 year olds (toddler level) and 4-5 year olds (preschooler level).\n\nFrom early on, children pay special attention to melodies. Toddlers and preschoolers just love music. They clap their hands or stamp their feet to the rhythm when they hear a familiar song. They can also listen to the same song for hours on end without it boring them. But: music is more than just entertainment for them. In children who have early experiences with music, the brain has shown to be better at handling change during the growth process. It adapts easier. Children who learn the difference between notes, rhythms and musical instruments will be able to handle auditory information better. And that’s beneficial for their speech development and for learning to read.\n\nThe Bumba LaLaLa App is therefore not simply a lot of fun to play, it also has a clear educational bonus. Recommended for all who wish to improve their children’s skills in a fun way."

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Ons doel is om ouders handige tools te geven bij het leren van gebaren, zodat hun kinderen de mogelijkheid krijgen zichzelf beter te uiten. Kwebl werkt samen met wetenschappers en pedagogisch professionals, en we gebruiken uitsluitend de gestandaardiseerde NmG/NGT gebaren. \nLees meer over hoe we werken op www.kwebl.co.\n\n\nCONTACT\nwww.kwebl.co\ncontact@kwebl.co\n\n\n\n\nWij zijn enorm benieuwd naar wat je van ons app'je vindt!\nStuur je ervaring, vraag of tips naar: contact@kwebl.co\n\nLike ons op Facebook om op de hoogte te blijven, en deel je ervaringen met andere ouders:\nwww.facebook.com/kwebl\nwww.twitter.com/kwebl"

You can choose which tables you want to practice and how many tables at the same time. As new sums fall down you quickly have to find the right answer mounted to the vault door to finally open the vault when completing all tables! \n\nDuring the development of TableVault several kids and teachers of an elementary school were involved. The kids told us which parts of the game they liked and teachers instructed us in standard school teachings. For example, the time in which a sum is supposed to be solved is defined and integrated into this app. The faster kids solve the sum the more points they get! This method ensures they will automatically try to improve their skills to get the highest score! \n\nIn this app an overview of all practices are saved for each child. This includes all the tables a child has practiced and how well he/she is performing for each table. Thus parents can easily track improvements of all their kids."

      "label": "***** 5/5 stars  EducationalAppStore.com *****\nLetraKid is an educational game addressed to children (4-8 years old) that can help them to learn pre-cursive and print block handwriting correctly, while having fun when doing so!\n\nWHAT KIDS CAN LEARN FROM THIS GAME\n\n• Recognize letter shapes and perfect alphabet pronunciation\n• The correct letter formation: start, checkpoints, strokes direction, order etc. Difficulty Levels 1 and 2 with assisted writing are designed to focus on the letter formation.\n• Develop fine motor skills for handwriting activity. Difficulty Levels 3 to 5 with freehand writing activities will focus on this improvement to help maximize confidence and form when writing.\n• Playing with a stylus pen will also help to improve standard pencil grasp. Any stylus compatible with the device will work.\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n\n• 16 languages with full support for interface, human native voices for letter/numbers pronunciation and full official alphabets. (ENGLISH, ESPAÑOL, FRANÇAIS, DEUTSCH, ITALIANO, PORTUGUÊS, NEDERLANDS, SVENSKA, NORSK, DANSK, SUOMI, ROMÂNĂ, JĘZYK POLSKI, TÜRKÇE, BAHASA INDONESIA and BAHASA MELAYU)\n• 3 popular letter formation rules that will provide flexibility for picking the right stroke order and direction for the child. Vital for improving grasp on key terms and rulings within handwriting.\n• Makes use of the 10 most used fonts in classes all over the world for learning pre cursive and print block handwriting: ZB style, HWT style, DN style, German(Hamburg) style and Euro Latino.\n• Full support for both Left and Right handwriting rules.\n• 5 difficulty levels with AUTO and LOCK settings, ranging from assisted writing for beginners, up to real freehand writing with minimal support and strict evaluation.\n• 4 set of glyphs: ABC (full alphabet for upper case letters), abc (full alphabet for lower case letters), 123 (numbers from 0 to 9) and a special set of signs for funny exercises.\n• 5 progression levels, color coded for each glyph that allows parents and teachers an instant evaluation of the progression and most exercised letters at the alphabet level.\n• 16 funny sticker rewards that will unlock after progression milestones are reached. Also, their drawing rules after each completed progression at Alphabet/glyph list level.\n• 3 profile slots with 50 funny avatars and name customization that will save independently the settings and the progression.\n• Full support for both Landscape and Portrait orientations.\n\nGREAT IN THE CLASSROOM!\n\nWith a unique and real-time feedback feature as well as complex tracing evaluation algorithms, LetraKid is not just another tracing app.\n\nThis is a new approach, focused on creating a fun game by utilizing handwriting mechanics itself. This avoids using distracting random rewards or secondary game mechanics that can break and confuse the learning process, optimizing learning progress and educational appeal to children.\n\nThe real time feedback will give both audio and graphic clues about the quality of the tracing and will adjust with difficulty level.\nOur tracing evaluation algorithms allow for an accurate and fun reward, using a 5 star rating for each exercise. This engages and motivates the kids to progress and to strive for more.\n\nDESIGNED for KIDS\n\n• No ads or irritating pop-ups.\n• No collection of personal data\n• Game settings are by default behind a parental gate. This can be disabled, but ensures a child to work with a certain font, formation rule, difficulty level and various other features for total specification to their needs.\n• External links are protected by a permanent parental gate and includes upgrade to full version, feedback and social media usage to help follow the latest news and changes with regards to the platform.\n\nGot any ideas for improving LetraKid? Then please send us your feedback and requests."

      "label": "Das Schulwörterbuch Latein enthält alle lateinischen Vokabeln, die du für die Lehrbuchphase brauchst, mit allen für die Schule wichtigen Bedeutungen und Redewendungen. Navigium findet über 310.000 flektierte Formen. Es deckt damit den Grund- und Aufbauwortschatz aller deutschsprachigen Latein-Lehrbücher ab. Alle Einträge sind in der App selbst gespeichert, so dass für die Benutzung keine Online-Verbindung nötig ist. Zu allen gefunden Formen wird eine Formenbestimmung durchgeführt. Die App ist blitzschnell gestartet, so dass ihr sofort loslegen könnt.\n\nÜber den Suchen-Button ist sowohl eine Suche in Richtung Latein-Deutsch als auch Deutsch-Latein möglich: Einfach das gewünschte Wort (Latein oder Deutsch) in das Suchfeld eintragen und \"Suchen\" drücken.  Zu allen Substantiven, Adjektiven und Verben ist die zugehörige Deklinations- bzw. Konjugationsklasse angegeben.\n\nDie in diesem Lateinwörterbuch enthaltenen Vokabeln sind mit den für die Aussprache unverzichtbaren Vokallängen versehen. Zusätzlich zu den deutschen Bedeutungen werden englische, französische, spanische und/oder italienische Merkhilfen angezeigt. Durch die Beschränkung der Vokabeln auf das typische Lehrbuchvokabular wird bewusst eine Überforderung des Lernenden vermieden. \n\nDie App findet auch deklinierte und konjugierte Formen und führt eine Formenbestimmung durch. Hier einige Beispiele:\n\n* Suche nach \"sustulerat\" findet tollere (3. Pers. Sg. Plusquamperf. Ind. Akt.) und sufferre;\n* Suche nach \"arcem\" findet \"arx arcis, f\" (Akk. Sg.);\n* Suche nach \"forte\" findet neben dem Adverb auch das Adjektiv \"fortis forte\".\n\nDurch die integrierte Teilwortsuche können auch verwandte Wörter gefunden werden:\n* Suche nach \"cepi\" findet alle Komposita von \"capere\" und die zugehörigen Redewendungen.\n\nNavigium enthält zu jedem Eintrag die vollständige Wortgrammatik:\n- alle Verbformen inkl. Deponentien, Semideponentien \n- alle deklinierte Formen der Substantive, Adjektive und Pronomina, inkl. Steigerung \n\nDas Navigium Schulwörterbuch Latein basiert auf der seit 20 Jahren von Dr. phil. Karl Niederau und Philipp Niederau kontinuierlich weiterentwickelten und weit verbreiteten Lernsoftware \"Navigium, Computertraining Latein\". Über hundert Schulen setzen Navigium regelmäßig im Unterricht ein."

      "label": "Stargate ESP Trainer is designed to help you learn to describe distant or future events.\nIt is a direct out-growth of the secret $25 million CIA, STAR GATE program with dozens of viewers at SRI, where we showed that psychic abilities are real and available.\n            \nIn this training game, the viewer is presented with two Yes/No questions pertaining to the outdoor image you will see shortly. Your goal is to quiet your mind and become aware of that picture.\n\nYou select one of the two choices by pressing the answer which best matches your awareness of that image. When you do that, a second question\nwill appear. You then repeat the process. The Property Matches indicator at the bottom shows the number of correct answers to 24 questions.\n\nFour pictures will then appear. Tap the picture that best matches your mental image. The correct picture will fill the screen. After 12 pictures you may begin a new game.\n\nThis program offers feedback and reinforcement to meets the requirements for learning this skill. The Stargate ESP Trainer presents meaningful and emotional images to your subconscious mind. This ability is often called clairvoyance, and can enhance your life in many surprising ways."

      "label": "Hit the Button Math is an app designed to help develop mental math and calculation skills.\n\nThe app is aimed at 5-11 year olds. There are 166 different game modes of varying difficulty so it is useful throughout grades K-5. Answer as many questions as possible in minute-long games, or you can now practice without the pressure of a countdown timer - a feature which is new for 2019. Questions are randomly generated which means it is very replayable. The game has been carefully designed for children, with large, widely spaced buttons. We recommend that young children play on a tablet.\n\nSix main topics are covered: \n\n* Times tables - up to 10 or 12 \n* Division - up to 10 or 12\n* Square numbers\n* Number bonds\n* Doubling \n* Halving\n\nBetween these topics, the four standard arithmetic operations are covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nYou can create up to 30 player profiles per device to track an individual's high scores (increased from 15 in 2019). If you prefer there's also the option to play as a guest. All data is stored locally on your device so you don't have to worry about privacy issues. We've also made it very easy for children to quickly switch between profiles after playing a game, if they're sharing a device.\n\nAfter each game, the score achieved is displayed along with the child's high score. Bronze, silver or gold stars and trophies are awarded depending on the score achieved in each game."

      "label": "Mit Antolin dem Leseraben können Kinder ihre Lesefertigkeit auf spielerische Weise steigern. Dabei werden Konzentration und  Wahrnehmung, Augenbewegung und Blickspanne trainiert. Dies fördert die Sicherheit bei der Worterfassung und verbessert die Lesefähigkeit  der Kinder.  Die liebevoll gestalteten und temporeichen  Übungen bieten zusätzlich viel  Aktion und Spielspaß so dass Lesetraining ganz nebenbei erfolgt! Durch das Spielen gegen die Zeit werden die Kinder zum Verbessern ihres Highscores und damit zum häufigen Wiederholen motiviert.\n\nDie 7 Lesespiele fördern zentrale Lesefertigkeiten\n\nPunkte jagen \nMit den Augen wird ein schnell wandernder Punkt verfolgt, der ab und zu seine Farbe ändert. Diese Übung trainiert die Konzentrationsfähigkeit  sowie eine gleichmäßige und schnelle Augenbewegung.  Gleichzeitig werden die reflexhafte Reaktion und Blicksprünge geübt.  Denn bei einem flüssigen und schnellen Lesen bewegen sich die Augen nicht gleichmäßig von Buchstabe zu Buchstabe, sondern sie springen von einem Haltepunkt zum nächsten. \n\nBlitzwörter\nEs wird ein Wort gezeigt, welches nach kurzer Zeit wieder verschwindet.  Dieses Wort soll aus einer Auswahl von drei Wörtern wiedererkannt werden.\nDiese Übung trainiert das ganzheitliche Erfassen und das Wiedererkennen  der Wortgestalt von ein- und zweisilbigen Wörtern  Dadurch kann das Kind Wörter schneller erfassen, sodass seine Leseflüssigkeit zunimmt. \n\nWortpaare\nAus einer  Anzahl von  Wortpaaren sollen die ungleichen  Wortpaare erkannt und angetippt werden. \nDiese Übung trainiert die Lesegeschwindigkeit bekannter und unbekannter Wörter. Die Wörter werden als Bilder wahrgenommen und werden nicht Buchstabe für Buchstabe mühsam erlesen. \n\nWortgitter\nIn einem Buchstabenfeld soll  möglichst schnell das gesuchte Wort zweimal wiedergefunden werden.  \nDiese Übung trainiert die Wortauffassung und die Diskrimination von Wortbildern. \n\n\nBücherwurm\nIn einem Kontinuum von sich bewegenden Konsonanten sollen  möglichst schnell die gesuchten Wörter  erlesen werden. \nDiese Übung trainiert die Erfassung von Wortgrenzen. \n\nBildersuche \nIn einem Bild sollen möglichst schnell die gesuchten Ausschnitte gefunden und angetippt werden.\nDiese Übung trainiert die horizontale Blickführung und die visuelle Wahrnehmung. Das Kind muss genau hinsehen und sich konzentrieren. Die Blickspanne wird erweitert, wodurch der Lesefluss verbessert und ein schnelles sowie sicheres Lesen möglich wird.  \n\nBallonspiel\nDiese Übung  trainiert die Blickspanne und die Konzentration. Das Auge der Kinder muss über das gesamte Spielfeld wandern, da immer neue Ballons hinzukommen. Durch den konzentrierten Blick und das Lesen muss in kurzer Zeit wahrgenommen werden, ob der Buchstabe an dem Ballon zu dem Wort  in dem Ballon passt. Erste Lesefertigkeiten und –fähigkeiten werden darüber gefördert. \n\nDie Punkte, die die Kinder in der Antolin Lesepiele-App erzielen, werden nicht  dem Punktekonto auf www.antolin.de zugerechnet.\n \nWir sind daran interessiert, unsere Apps kontinuierlich zu verbessern. Bitte senden Sie Verbesserungsvorschläge und Fehlermeldungen per E-Mail an antolin@schroedel.de. Vielen Dank!"

      "label": "There's never been a better time to get into Astronomy! Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

It is a world that we cannot see but that is literally all around us.\nThe Architecture of Radio is a 360 degree data visualization of what this world might look like. It shows the cell towers, GPS satellites and Wi-Fi routers around you that allow us to live our digital lives.\n\nNew: support for Iphone X, XR, XS and XS Max Screens\nNew: Cardboard support!\nImmerse yourself in the Infosphere in Virtual Reality using a cardboard or compatible headset*\n\n*Carboard support only for iPhone. iPhone 6s or newer recommended for best performance.\n\nWhy should I use this app?\n\nOut of curiosity! We are increasingly dependent on a global ecosystem of digital signals. We use them for so many things, yet we cannot see them. We can see the roads we use to travel, the buildings we live in, but not the infrastructure that is changing the world. How can we understand this world without understanding how it works? \nThe purpose of this app is to make the invisible visible so we can look at it, think about it and discuss it.\n\nWhy Should I not use this app?\n\nThis app is not a measurement tool. It’s purpose is to inspire, to see the world through a different lens. The app is based on real world data and gives you a pretty good idea of the density of digital signals around you, but it won’t tell you where to move the couch to get a better WIFI signal.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is a data visualization, based on global open datasets of cell tower, Wi-Fi and satellite locations. Based on your GPS location the app shows a 360 degree visualization of signals around you. The dataset includes almost 7 million cell towers, 19 million Wi-Fi routers and hundreds of satellites.\n\nIs this really what radio signals look like?\n\nWe can’t see radio with our eyes. The waves that we use for our cell phones and Wi-Fi are way outside the spectrum of visible light. In order to “see” radio, it has to be interpreted or translated into an image that we can see. There are many ways to do that but it will always be an interpretation.\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is an impression of the infosphere, a way of seeing it."

      "label": "With the Bumba LaLaLa App you can improve the musical ear of your kids while they’re having great fun. The cute clown Bumba lets your kids recognize different sounds, melodies and musical instruments while playing. The app has two game levels: the first aimed at toddlers, the second at preschoolers.\n\nThe toddler level introduces children to musical instruments and their sounds. The auditory processes of 2-3 year olds are stimulated by teaching them the difference in sound between these seven basic instruments.\n\nThe preschooler level for 4-5 year olds goes one step further: preschoolers can create their own melody or recreate melodies they like. For that they have ten instruments that they can combine endlessly. Furthermore, they can set the speed and volume themselves. They are supported by a metronome.\n\nThis interactive music game was developed in cooperation with child development specialist. Therefore your kids are ensured of a fun play experience suitable for their age. All features of the game are designed to meet the development needs of 2-3 year olds (toddler level) and 4-5 year olds (preschooler level).\n\nFrom early on, children pay special attention to melodies. Toddlers and preschoolers just love music. They clap their hands or stamp their feet to the rhythm when they hear a familiar song. They can also listen to the same song for hours on end without it boring them. But: music is more than just entertainment for them. In children who have early experiences with music, the brain has shown to be better at handling change during the growth process. It adapts easier. Children who learn the difference between notes, rhythms and musical instruments will be able to handle auditory information better. And that’s beneficial for their speech development and for learning to read.\n\nThe Bumba LaLaLa App is therefore not simply a lot of fun to play, it also has a clear educational bonus. Recommended for all who wish to improve their children’s skills in a fun way."

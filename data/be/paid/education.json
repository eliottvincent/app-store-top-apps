      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

(Please set your iPhone to Ring mode to hear the audio playback.)\n・Fun illustrations help users to better retain the words studied. \n・Users can bookmark the words they like. The bookmarked words are compiled in the Bookmark list in \"List.\"\n\n◇ “Check” helps learners to track their mastery.\n・Users check their understanding of the vocabulary studied and sort the words into those mastered and those not yet retained.\n・The words already mastered are taken out of the study set, leaving behind just those that still need to be worked on.\n\n◇ “List” displays a list of all words covered by the app so that users can see their progress and review the vocabulary.\n・The list can be arranged in any of three orderings: lesson order, a-i-u-e-o order, and alphabetical order. The words bookmarked in the Study mode are also listed in the Bookmark list.\n・Checkmarks are automatically placed next to words that have been mastered.\n・The Study view of words can be displayed from the list entries, enabling quick review.\n\n\n○This app is based on the vocabulary from the third edition of GENKI.\n○Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

(Please set your iPhone to Ring mode to hear the audio playback.)\r\n・Basic information on the target kanji is provided with fun illustrations and mnemonic hints, as well as animations of their stroke order.\r\n(The illustrations and hints are taken from the very popular learning resource “Kanji Look and Learn.”)\r\n・Users can bookmark the kanji words they like. The bookmarked words are compiled in the Bookmark list in \"List.\"\r\n\r\n◇ “Check” helps learners to track their mastery.\r\n・Users check their understanding of the kanji words studied and sort them into those mastered and those not yet retained.\r\n・The kanji words already mastered are taken out of the study set, leaving behind just those that still need to be worked on.\r\n\r\n◇ “List” displays various lists of all the words and kanji covered by the app so that users can see their progress and review them.\r\n・In the lists arranged in lesson order, a-i-u-e-o order, or alphabetical order, checkmarks are automatically placed next to words that have been mastered.\r\n・Kanji information on the cards can be displayed from the entries in the On/Kun list.\r\n・Users can search kanji words from their target kanji in the Serial # list.\r\n・The words bookmarked in the Study mode are also listed in the Bookmark list.\r\n・The Study view of kanji words or the target kanji can be displayed from the list entries, enabling quick review.\r\n\r\n○This app is based on the kanji list from the third edition of GENKI.\r\n○Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

The app is both educational and entertaining, with an intuitive and visually appealing interface. \n\nNoteWorks was created for: \n• iPhone, iPod touch and iPad users.\n• Players of all ages. \n• Beginners to advanced music students. \n• Families with multiple players. \n• Music teachers with multiple students. \n\nGame design features include: \n• A funny animated character. \n• User-friendly menus. \n• Superb graphics. \n• Engaging sound effects. \n\nNote reading options: \n• On-screen piano keyboard input.\n• On-screen guitar fretboard input.\n• MIDI keyboard input.  \n• \"A, B, C\" note naming:\n. . . CDEFGAB\n. . . CDEFGAH\n. . . ABCDEFG\n. . . AHCDEFG \n• \"Do, Re, Mi\" (Fixed Do) note naming. \n• Treble clef. \n• Bass clef. \n• Tenor clef. \n• Alto clef. \n• Custom note range in all four clefs.\n\nEducational features: \n• Students learn by playing and having fun. \n• Multiple game settings allow players to stay in control. \n• Students can choose to play with hints. \n• Students play without hints to earn points and stars. \n• Players learn to recognize notes instantly, on sight. \n• For beginners, the game starts by teaching a limited range of notes. \n• Note range can be easily customized as students advance. \n• After mastering accidentals, students learn key signatures. \n• Game speed is controlled to increase or decrease difficulty, or students may choose to play without any time limit.\n• Sharing of game progress: ability to share game results with teachers.\n\nWhile music teachers persistently stress the importance of sight reading, most teachers prefer not to spend valuable lesson time on basic note recognition skills. Thus, NoteWorks helps music teachers concentrate on more interesting aspects of their art, such as technique and musicality. \n\nSerious music students can take advantage of the game to learn clefs outside of their own instruments, as well as prepare for music theory exams. In addition, non-musicians could use NoteWorks as an interesting memory game, to help keep their minds sharp and quick. \n\nNoteWorks was created for people who like to learn by playing and having fun. It was designed with the objective of neither being too easy nor too hard, and never boring. We hope you'll find NoteWorks both useful and entertaining, and we would greatly appreciate it if you could share your thoughts and opinions about the game by rating it."

Most children cannot read yet, so all explanations, questions and assignments are spoken out loud. So the children can work independently with this application. The clear, bright and beautifully designed application enables the children to practice the assignments faster and better, because they can play the game by themselves. By visiting the settings menu, the teacher or parents can disable or enable various parts of the application or change the settings of the games. For example, you can able practicing numbers until 5, 10, 15 or 20 and you can select how many assignments are to be done before the final score is shown.\n\n\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nTeacher Dennis"

      "label": "Welcome aboard your rocket ship to the next level of Japanese.\n\nHuman Japanese Intermediate is packed with content and features that will take your Japanese language skills to the next level. If you liked the first HJ, you'll love Intermediate. (And if you're new to Human Japanese, welcome aboard! Find a full list of content by chapter at www.humanjapanese.com/intermediate.)\n\nIn Human Japanese Intermediate, you'll find:\n\n- More than 40 illuminating chapters\n- Over 2600 example sentences and dialogs with crystal-clear recordings of male and female speech\n- Kanji animations, tips, illustrations, and more\n- Photos and cultural notes to keep you engaged and energized\n- Intelligent quizzes that track your history and help you focus on trouble spots\n- INGREDIENTS™ example sentence breakdowns for total clarity in every example\n\nLike its predecessor, Human Japanese Intermediate is built on the idea that the best way to learn and truly comprehend Japanese is to have it explained by someone who speaks your language. Core concepts are explained in a friendly, down-to-earth tone, with frequent comparisons to similar aspects of English. With humor and warmth, it demystifies and illuminates the real nuts-and-bolts of the language--not just vocabulary and canned phrases like many other products.\n\nExplanations come alive with deeply interwoven interactive example sentences--more than 2600 in total--so that you can immediately see and hear exactly what you're learning.\n\nStay on track with an exciting new patent-pending feature called INGREDIENTS™ example sentence breakdowns. Next to every sentence is an icon that provides an instantaneous, simultaneous lookup of every word in the sentence, even conjugated forms! That means you'll never lose your flow in the middle of an interesting discussion just because you've momentarily forgotten the meaning of a word.\n\nKANJI\nHuman Japanese Intermediate also gets into kanji in a big way. At the end of most chapters, a new batch of kanji is introduced, with animations of each character, plus example sentences, illustrations, writing tips, and more. Our goal is not to simply throw a bag of characters in your lap, but to carefully explain how everything works.\n\nTo this end, Human Japanese Intermediate keeps track of which kanji you've learned at what point in the text and automatically adjusts the \"spelling\" of words in example sentences as appropriate to your current knowledge. So early on, you might encounter the following sentence:\n\nそのひとの　なまえを　しらない。\n\nBut later, after you've met several of kanji used in these words, the version you would see is:\n\nその人の　名前を　知らない。\n\nThis approach removes the most overwhelming aspect of learning kanji--the fact that most sentences contain many characters you don't yet know--and that helps you to stay focused and energized.\n\nQUIZZES\nStay sharp with five different kinds of quizzes: chapter reviews, vocab, conjugation, kanji stroke order, and kanji flashcard.\n\nQuizzes keep track of which questions you get right and wrong, to help you concentrate on your trouble spots.\n\nAnd when you get a question wrong, it's not simply \"Try again.\" Wherever possible, the quiz provides a hint that is specific to that question, to help you remember and learn.\n\nPHOTOS AND CULTURAL NOTES\nWe've packed Human Japanese with hundreds of photos, illustrations, and cultural asides to keep you interested and energized. You'll find tours of hotels, train stations, convenience stores, supermarkets, kissaten (coffee shops), temples, and more.\n\nLEARN JAPANESE WITH US\nWe care deeply about helping you to grow in your understanding of Japanese. Whether you've worked through the original Human Japanese app or have come from a different background, it will be our pleasure and privilege to be your guide on the next stage of your journey. Hajimemashou!"

      "label": "Team Shake provides a technological and environmentally friendly way to choose teams for board games, sporting events, tournaments, school projects or anytime groups are required. The newest release brings many new features including full iPad support, balancing teams based on skill or gender, importing users from a file, enabling video output, and sharing teams via facebook or email. \n\nTeam Shake is the premier iOS App for creating teams. Instead of a hat and scraps of paper, the user enters his friends' names in his iPhone and gives it a shake. The screen will then display a random set of color-coded teams. These teams can immediately be used for game play or shared via facebook or email.   The quick and easy selection of random (or balanced) teams eliminates fighting over who will be on which team. Innovative use of the iPhone shake gesture gives users the satisfying feeling of shaking a virtual hat without the trouble of carrying around an actual hat. Conventional buttons can also be used for those who would rather not shake their expensive hardware about.  \n\nThe app is designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind. Names can easily be entered with the onscreen keyboard, chosen from the user's contacts, or imported from a file. The email and facebook functions document the members of each individual team as well as preserving the team number and color assigned by the app. For repeated use of Team Shake, lists of friends can be easily saved and loaded later. The current list is also automatically saved so that if you exit the app, or even reboot the device, changes will not be lost. For teachers and others with large lists of people, Team Shake supports the ability to import teams from text or csv files.\n\nIf you have any problems, feature requests, or comments please send an email to support@rhine-o.com. \n\nFeatures:\n\n* Create 1 to 64 random teams\n* Create completely random or balanced teams\n* Full iPad support\n* Eliminates fighting over choosing teams\n* Share / Save teams via email or Facebook\n* Teams can be chosen by the number of teams or by the size of teams.\n* Save lists of friends for later games\n* Import lists from email or spreadsheet\n* Export lists and options for use on another device\n* Satisfying feeling of shaking a “virtual” hat to create teams\n* Animated shaking hat\n* Entry of names via onscreen keyboard\n* Entry of names via iPhone contacts\n* Temporarily disable people who are absent\n* Set groups of people to always be on the same team\n* Set groups of people to always be on different teams\n* Set user strength to make more even teams (now supports fully balanced teams)\n* 5 users strengths level\n* Pick a single random person from the list of players\n* User strength indicator on the main screen (can be disabled in options)\n* Number of active players and total players is now displayed on the main screen\n* Video Out Support\n* Option to Sort Teams by Name\n* Option to balance male / female team members\n* \"Equal Ability\" option to create teams where all players have the same strength\n* Option to create separate male and female teams\n* Configurable Team Colors\n* Configurable Team Names\n* Print Support\n* Export Teams in CSV or XLS Format\n* Team Shake now supports simultaneously assigning players to multiple subteams and / or oppose teams at the same time.\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now have customized names to make selection easier\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now be enabled or disabled globally so that teams can be made quickly without subteams / oppose teams.

      "label": "GraphoGame Français » est un logiciel d’entraînement au décodage qui aide les enfants d'âge préscolaire et primaire et les enfants en difficultés à renforcer leurs premières compétences en lecture. Ce jeu aide l’enfant à apprendre les sons des lettres et des groupes de lettres en présentant simultanément les sons (ou mots) correspondant et les groupes de lettres.\n\nLa progression du jeu est basée sur des données scientifiques : le logiciel été développé par des linguistes, des neuropsychologues et des orthophonistes pour aider les enfants - en particulier les lecteurs en difficulté - à renforcer les automatismes fondamentaux de la lecture.\n\n« GraphoGame – Français » accompagne l’enfant à travers différents jeux avec son propre personnage qu’il fait évoluer au cours du jeu. Le joueur passe progressivement aux syllabes, aux rimes, aux mots courts et aux phrases et apprend peu à peu à décoder des mots plus longs. En jouant 15 minutes quotidiennement, l'enfant améliorera sa précision dans le décodage des lettres, des mots, et sa vitesse de lecture. \n\nLa plateforme GraphoGame est développée par une communauté de chercheurs et de développeurs de jeux leader en Finlande, tandis que le contenu francophone de « GraphoGame Français » a été développé par le Laboratoire de Psychologie Cognitive (CNRS) de l'Université d'Aix-Marseille.\n\nPour plus d’informations sur le contenu francophone, n’hésitez pas à vous rendre sur le site http://grapholearn.fr."

Download and play with your baby,\ntoddler or young children -- it's easy to learn and can entertain for hours.\n\nListen to the sounds made by both nature and machines. From boats, firetrucks, and\nhorse-drawn carriages to ducks, tigers, and birds. Each animal or object is like its own flash card; when opened, it plays a sound that is sure to stimulate each child and leave them with awe and wonder. This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch. Let them explore and learn with their senses. Parents of children with autism have found this app helpful in engaging their children, but truly it is for anyone that wants to teach their kids something new while stimulating and training their brains.\n\nEvery animal, transportation mode, and tile has five different sounds linked, so children can learn different sounds and images associated with objects. Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

      "label": "There's never been a better time to get into Astronomy! Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

      "label": "The infosphere, Visualized.\n\nEvery time we use our phones, tablets or laptops we are entering an invisible world of wireless digital signals. It is a world that we cannot see but that is literally all around us.\nThe Architecture of Radio is a 360 degree data visualization of what this world might look like. It shows the cell towers, GPS satellites and Wi-Fi routers around you that allow us to live our digital lives.\n\nNew: support for Iphone X, XR, XS and XS Max Screens\nNew: Cardboard support!\nImmerse yourself in the Infosphere in Virtual Reality using a cardboard or compatible headset*\n\n*Carboard support only for iPhone. iPhone 6s or newer recommended for best performance.\n\nWhy should I use this app?\n\nOut of curiosity! We are increasingly dependent on a global ecosystem of digital signals. We use them for so many things, yet we cannot see them. We can see the roads we use to travel, the buildings we live in, but not the infrastructure that is changing the world. How can we understand this world without understanding how it works? \nThe purpose of this app is to make the invisible visible so we can look at it, think about it and discuss it.\n\nWhy Should I not use this app?\n\nThis app is not a measurement tool. It’s purpose is to inspire, to see the world through a different lens. The app is based on real world data and gives you a pretty good idea of the density of digital signals around you, but it won’t tell you where to move the couch to get a better WIFI signal.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is a data visualization, based on global open datasets of cell tower, Wi-Fi and satellite locations. Based on your GPS location the app shows a 360 degree visualization of signals around you. The dataset includes almost 7 million cell towers, 19 million Wi-Fi routers and hundreds of satellites.\n\nIs this really what radio signals look like?\n\nWe can’t see radio with our eyes. The waves that we use for our cell phones and Wi-Fi are way outside the spectrum of visible light. In order to “see” radio, it has to be interpreted or translated into an image that we can see. There are many ways to do that but it will always be an interpretation.\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is an impression of the infosphere, a way of seeing it."

Drive the street sweeper and unload the truck crane!\n\nOn our construction site your child can drive a digger, mix cement, roof a building, operate a crane, drive a street sweeper or paint a house. There’s so much to do here. Our Little Builders dig, plaster, fill, paint and mix... And they need your children´s help.\n\nAt the same time they can watch funny things happen, because on every building site there’s always something going wrong. Water suddenly bursts from a pipe, a builder falls into a hole or the wind blows the bricks away because the cement wasn’t dry yet.\n\nLittle Builders is the first 3D app for children aged 2-6 years that want to explore the world of being a real little builder. Depending on the child’s age, all animations and functions can run automatically or be controlled through a tap.\n\n7 interactive scenarios contain over 100 interactive animations and surprises:\n\n1. Steer the digger, fill the truck and repair the water pipe.\n2. Paint the house in different colours and unload the removals truck.\n3. Operate the crane and build a new roof for the house.\n4. Mix cement and build a real wall.\n5. Operate a big cement mixer and concrete a large area.\n6. Drive the street sweeper and clean the dirty road.\n7. Unload the crane truck and make sure it leaves on time.\n\nAmazing graphics, great animations, a user-friendly interface, no text and no in-app purchases. Download now and start building!\n\nPlease also check out our other great Apps for kids:\n\n„PETTING ZOO“ - is a fantastic storybook app for the iPad and iPhone.

You can choose which tables you want to practice and how many tables at the same time. As new sums fall down you quickly have to find the right answer mounted to the vault door to finally open the vault when completing all tables! \n\nDuring the development of TableVault several kids and teachers of an elementary school were involved. The kids told us which parts of the game they liked and teachers instructed us in standard school teachings. For example, the time in which a sum is supposed to be solved is defined and integrated into this app. The faster kids solve the sum the more points they get! This method ensures they will automatically try to improve their skills to get the highest score! \n\nIn this app an overview of all practices are saved for each child. This includes all the tables a child has practiced and how well he/she is performing for each table. Thus parents can easily track improvements of all their kids."

      "label": "With the Bumba LaLaLa App you can improve the musical ear of your kids while they’re having great fun. The cute clown Bumba lets your kids recognize different sounds, melodies and musical instruments while playing. The app has two game levels: the first aimed at toddlers, the second at preschoolers.\n\nThe toddler level introduces children to musical instruments and their sounds. The auditory processes of 2-3 year olds are stimulated by teaching them the difference in sound between these seven basic instruments.\n\nThe preschooler level for 4-5 year olds goes one step further: preschoolers can create their own melody or recreate melodies they like. For that they have ten instruments that they can combine endlessly. Furthermore, they can set the speed and volume themselves. They are supported by a metronome.\n\nThis interactive music game was developed in cooperation with child development specialist. Therefore your kids are ensured of a fun play experience suitable for their age. All features of the game are designed to meet the development needs of 2-3 year olds (toddler level) and 4-5 year olds (preschooler level).\n\nFrom early on, children pay special attention to melodies. Toddlers and preschoolers just love music. They clap their hands or stamp their feet to the rhythm when they hear a familiar song. They can also listen to the same song for hours on end without it boring them. But: music is more than just entertainment for them. In children who have early experiences with music, the brain has shown to be better at handling change during the growth process. It adapts easier. Children who learn the difference between notes, rhythms and musical instruments will be able to handle auditory information better. And that’s beneficial for their speech development and for learning to read.\n\nThe Bumba LaLaLa App is therefore not simply a lot of fun to play, it also has a clear educational bonus. Recommended for all who wish to improve their children’s skills in a fun way."

      "label": "With the Bumba LaLaLa App you can improve the musical ear of your kids while they’re having great fun. The cute clown Bumba lets your kids recognize different sounds, melodies and musical instruments while playing. The app has two game levels: the first aimed at toddlers, the second at preschoolers.\n\nThe toddler level introduces children to musical instruments and their sounds. The auditory processes of 2-3 year olds are stimulated by teaching them the difference in sound between these seven basic instruments.\n\nThe preschooler level for 4-5 year olds goes one step further: preschoolers can create their own melody or recreate melodies they like. For that they have ten instruments that they can combine endlessly. Furthermore, they can set the speed and volume themselves. They are supported by a metronome.\n\nThis interactive music game was developed in cooperation with child development specialist. Therefore your kids are ensured of a fun play experience suitable for their age. All features of the game are designed to meet the development needs of 2-3 year olds (toddler level) and 4-5 year olds (preschooler level).\n\nFrom early on, children pay special attention to melodies. Toddlers and preschoolers just love music. They clap their hands or stamp their feet to the rhythm when they hear a familiar song. They can also listen to the same song for hours on end without it boring them. But: music is more than just entertainment for them. In children who have early experiences with music, the brain has shown to be better at handling change during the growth process. It adapts easier. Children who learn the difference between notes, rhythms and musical instruments will be able to handle auditory information better. And that’s beneficial for their speech development and for learning to read.\n\nThe Bumba LaLaLa App is therefore not simply a lot of fun to play, it also has a clear educational bonus. Recommended for all who wish to improve their children’s skills in a fun way."

      "label": "Mit Antolin dem Leseraben können Kinder ihre Lesefertigkeit auf spielerische Weise steigern. Dabei werden Konzentration und  Wahrnehmung, Augenbewegung und Blickspanne trainiert. Dies fördert die Sicherheit bei der Worterfassung und verbessert die Lesefähigkeit  der Kinder.  Die liebevoll gestalteten und temporeichen  Übungen bieten zusätzlich viel  Aktion und Spielspaß so dass Lesetraining ganz nebenbei erfolgt! Durch das Spielen gegen die Zeit werden die Kinder zum Verbessern ihres Highscores und damit zum häufigen Wiederholen motiviert.\n\nDie 7 Lesespiele fördern zentrale Lesefertigkeiten\n\nPunkte jagen \nMit den Augen wird ein schnell wandernder Punkt verfolgt, der ab und zu seine Farbe ändert. Diese Übung trainiert die Konzentrationsfähigkeit  sowie eine gleichmäßige und schnelle Augenbewegung.  Gleichzeitig werden die reflexhafte Reaktion und Blicksprünge geübt.  Denn bei einem flüssigen und schnellen Lesen bewegen sich die Augen nicht gleichmäßig von Buchstabe zu Buchstabe, sondern sie springen von einem Haltepunkt zum nächsten. \n\nBlitzwörter\nEs wird ein Wort gezeigt, welches nach kurzer Zeit wieder verschwindet.  Dieses Wort soll aus einer Auswahl von drei Wörtern wiedererkannt werden.\nDiese Übung trainiert das ganzheitliche Erfassen und das Wiedererkennen  der Wortgestalt von ein- und zweisilbigen Wörtern  Dadurch kann das Kind Wörter schneller erfassen, sodass seine Leseflüssigkeit zunimmt. \n\nWortpaare\nAus einer  Anzahl von  Wortpaaren sollen die ungleichen  Wortpaare erkannt und angetippt werden. \nDiese Übung trainiert die Lesegeschwindigkeit bekannter und unbekannter Wörter. Die Wörter werden als Bilder wahrgenommen und werden nicht Buchstabe für Buchstabe mühsam erlesen. \n\nWortgitter\nIn einem Buchstabenfeld soll  möglichst schnell das gesuchte Wort zweimal wiedergefunden werden.  \nDiese Übung trainiert die Wortauffassung und die Diskrimination von Wortbildern. \n\n\nBücherwurm\nIn einem Kontinuum von sich bewegenden Konsonanten sollen  möglichst schnell die gesuchten Wörter  erlesen werden. \nDiese Übung trainiert die Erfassung von Wortgrenzen. \n\nBildersuche \nIn einem Bild sollen möglichst schnell die gesuchten Ausschnitte gefunden und angetippt werden.\nDiese Übung trainiert die horizontale Blickführung und die visuelle Wahrnehmung. Das Kind muss genau hinsehen und sich konzentrieren. Die Blickspanne wird erweitert, wodurch der Lesefluss verbessert und ein schnelles sowie sicheres Lesen möglich wird.  \n\nBallonspiel\nDiese Übung  trainiert die Blickspanne und die Konzentration. Das Auge der Kinder muss über das gesamte Spielfeld wandern, da immer neue Ballons hinzukommen. Durch den konzentrierten Blick und das Lesen muss in kurzer Zeit wahrgenommen werden, ob der Buchstabe an dem Ballon zu dem Wort  in dem Ballon passt. Erste Lesefertigkeiten und –fähigkeiten werden darüber gefördert. \n\nDie Punkte, die die Kinder in der Antolin Lesepiele-App erzielen, werden nicht  dem Punktekonto auf www.antolin.de zugerechnet.\n \nWir sind daran interessiert, unsere Apps kontinuierlich zu verbessern. Bitte senden Sie Verbesserungsvorschläge und Fehlermeldungen per E-Mail an antolin@schroedel.de. Vielen Dank!"

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

Vooral in het voorjaar reageren vogels hier sterk op en dat is verloren energie. Echte kenners nemen oortjes (koptelefoon) mee het veld in.

Once number splitting is mastered, all the other exercises become easy.\n\nLittle dots under the numbers when doing sums up to 10 provide additional help to children in all  the exercises.\n\nAll the animated backgrounds are peaceful with some animations but avoiding sensory overload and distractions."

      "label": "A unique breakthrough in learning and translating Ancient Egyptian!\n\nThe first hurdle in understanding Egyptian hieroglyphs is to identify each glyph. Since there are over 7000 glyphs, with several hundred in common use, putting a name to each glyph in an inscription can be time consuming. \n\nHieroglyph Sketch allows you to put a hieroglyphic inscription on your screen via your camera. Use your finger to trace over each glyph. Using state of the art deep learning algorithms, the app will progressively refine the identity of a glyph as you sketch details. With practice, the App is roughly is over 80% accurate for top pick and about 95% accurate in picking the top 5 most likely glyphs from the set of the 500 most commonly used hieroglyphs. \n\nEven rough, partial sketches are usually enough to infer a small group of likely glyphs. Tap the correct one and see extra information about that glyph such as its pronunciation, Gardiner and MdC codes, etc. Tap \"Add\" and the app will add the glyph to a sequence which can be translated into English.\n\nHieroglyph Sketch comes with an internal dictionary of 55,000 word and phrases.  \n\nThis app works in the field - no internet required!\n\nFor more information about the Michael C. Carlos Museum and the new Senusret collection, go to:  https://carlos.emory.edu/senusret-collection\n\nPrivacy Statement: Hieroglyph Sketch collects some information about how people use the App, such as how long they it, which features they use, how many translations per session, etc.  None of this information is traceable to an individual user or device. The data are only used to guide future refinement of the App and to help solve bugs (if they occur!). Aviametrix NEVER sells or markets ANY data to third parties."

      "label": "The infosphere, Visualized.\n\nEvery time we use our phones, tablets or laptops we are entering an invisible world of wireless digital signals. It is a world that we cannot see but that is literally all around us.\nThe Architecture of Radio is a 360 degree data visualization of what this world might look like. It shows the cell towers, GPS satellites and Wi-Fi routers around you that allow us to live our digital lives.\n\nNew: support for Iphone X, XR, XS and XS Max Screens\nNew: Cardboard support!\nImmerse yourself in the Infosphere in Virtual Reality using a cardboard or compatible headset*\n\n*Carboard support only for iPhone. iPhone 6s or newer recommended for best performance.\n\nWhy should I use this app?\n\nOut of curiosity! We are increasingly dependent on a global ecosystem of digital signals. We use them for so many things, yet we cannot see them. We can see the roads we use to travel, the buildings we live in, but not the infrastructure that is changing the world. How can we understand this world without understanding how it works? \nThe purpose of this app is to make the invisible visible so we can look at it, think about it and discuss it.\n\nWhy Should I not use this app?\n\nThis app is not a measurement tool. It’s purpose is to inspire, to see the world through a different lens. The app is based on real world data and gives you a pretty good idea of the density of digital signals around you, but it won’t tell you where to move the couch to get a better WIFI signal.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is a data visualization, based on global open datasets of cell tower, Wi-Fi and satellite locations. Based on your GPS location the app shows a 360 degree visualization of signals around you. The dataset includes almost 7 million cell towers, 19 million Wi-Fi routers and hundreds of satellites.\n\nIs this really what radio signals look like?\n\nWe can’t see radio with our eyes. The waves that we use for our cell phones and Wi-Fi are way outside the spectrum of visible light. In order to “see” radio, it has to be interpreted or translated into an image that we can see. There are many ways to do that but it will always be an interpretation.\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is an impression of the infosphere, a way of seeing it."

Drive the street sweeper and unload the truck crane!\n\nOn our construction site your child can drive a digger, mix cement, roof a building, operate a crane, drive a street sweeper or paint a house. There’s so much to do here. Our Little Builders dig, plaster, fill, paint and mix... And they need your children´s help.\n\nAt the same time they can watch funny things happen, because on every building site there’s always something going wrong. Water suddenly bursts from a pipe, a builder falls into a hole or the wind blows the bricks away because the cement wasn’t dry yet.\n\nLittle Builders is the first 3D app for children aged 2-6 years that want to explore the world of being a real little builder. Depending on the child’s age, all animations and functions can run automatically or be controlled through a tap.\n\n7 interactive scenarios contain over 100 interactive animations and surprises:\n\n1. Steer the digger, fill the truck and repair the water pipe.\n2. Paint the house in different colours and unload the removals truck.\n3. Operate the crane and build a new roof for the house.\n4. Mix cement and build a real wall.\n5. Operate a big cement mixer and concrete a large area.\n6. Drive the street sweeper and clean the dirty road.\n7. Unload the crane truck and make sure it leaves on time.\n\nAmazing graphics, great animations, a user-friendly interface, no text and no in-app purchases. Download now and start building!\n\nPlease also check out our other great Apps for kids:\n\n„PETTING ZOO“ - is a fantastic storybook app for the iPad and iPhone.

      "label": "Tables Vault - the most fun way to learn tables! \n*** Top 5 popular apps in education*** \n*** 5 stars nomination Kids Apps Awards apps.weebly.com*** \n\nUsing this educational app kids can practice the math tables from 1 to 20 within a challenging game! You can choose which tables you want to practice and how many tables at the same time. As new sums fall down you quickly have to find the right answer mounted to the vault door to finally open the vault when completing all tables! \n\nDuring the development of TableVault several kids and teachers of an elementary school were involved. The kids told us which parts of the game they liked and teachers instructed us in standard school teachings. For example, the time in which a sum is supposed to be solved is defined and integrated into this app. The faster kids solve the sum the more points they get! This method ensures they will automatically try to improve their skills to get the highest score! \n\nIn this app an overview of all practices are saved for each child. This includes all the tables a child has practiced and how well he/she is performing for each table. Thus parents can easily track improvements of all their kids."

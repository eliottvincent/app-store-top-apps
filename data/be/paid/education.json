      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

It has LESS FEATURES than the iPad app. (it has NO LATERAL computations, no graphical MCP and Max Continuous Power computations and a simple version load manifest) For use on iPad with professional load manifest, exact lateral and MCP performance computations, please choose the Tim Tucker - iPad version.  *********\n\n\nA great new tool for students, instructors and professional pilots. Weight & Balance calculations have never been easier and faster. \n\n\nWith the Gyronimo Performance Pad you can calculate weight & balance, performance and navigation data in just a few seconds!  It is designed specifically for the Robinson R44 Raven and Raven II, and contains all necessary flight and performance data. \n\nThe weight and balance calculations can also be used for the Robinson R44 Astro.\n\nQuickly change all important values using sliders! Compare Raven and  Raven II OGE and IGE performance! \nCalculate and compare Manifold Pressure and Never Exceed Speed Limits.\nThis enables students and flight instructors to experiment with the values and create \"what if\" scenarios in no time.\n\nThe Performance Pad has four main pages\n\n1. Weight and Balance Page\nSet person and baggage values in seconds using the convenient sliders. Select doors on/off with switch-buttons. The CG position is calculated and displayed simultaneously.\n\nBased on fuel flow and fuel available the flight time and fuel reserve are computed. Control all values via sliders and receive a warning if the fuel reserve is less than 20 minutes.\n\n\n2. Performance Page\nUsing the data from your Weight & Balance page the pad calculates:\n- Out of Ground Effect (OGE) ceiling\n- In Ground Effect (IGE) ceiling\nand converts the pressure altitude to feet MSL.\n\nThe pad also calculates \n\n- Density Altitude\n- Maximum Continuous Power (MCP) \n- 5 minute take off power \n- Never Exceed Speed (V ne) \n\nusing the internal data derived from the original helicopter operating handbook.\n\nYou can also experiment with the all values and find the corresponding maximum helicopter weight for the particular environment.\n\n3. Flight Time Page\nThis page is a complete E6B flight computer with a new and revolutionary graphical user interface. Use the sliders to enter basic values like variation, deviation, wind velocity and direction and the pad will calculate\n\n- Calibrated and True Airspeed \n- True and Magnetic Course \n- Wind Correction Angle (WCA)\n- Compass Heading\n- Ground Speed\n- Flight Time for a specific distance\n\n4. Helicopter Page\nSave and load helicopter setups and performance scenarios. Send weight & balance results to your email address. View important Airspeed Limits and access the Gyronimo Video Channel.\n\n\nWhether you are a professional pilot, student or flight instructor, we are sure that you will benefit from the possibilities of this revolutionary flight computer.\n\n\nProduct Support\nWe hope that the Performance Pad is intuitive to use, however if you have questions or reports please\ncontact us anytime at: info@gyronimosystems.com and we will reply usually within the same day!\n\nVideo Tutorials\nCheck out our video channel on youtube and find a growing number of example calculations.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nThe Gyronimo R44 Performance Pad is a student, professional pilot and flight instructor assistance tool for plausibility checks  and flight training only.\n\nAll graphics and data provided in this application are used as examples.

      "label": "This app will bring you into the cockpit of your dreams...and help you to stay there...\n\nFrom version 3.1 with the new number arithmetics test !\n\nHow are your mathematics skills ? How fast can you perform easy calculations without paper and pencil, or make quick estimations of difficult calculations ? \n\nThese skills you need to have when you are a pilot...in the cockpit, but also at the pilot screening, to get into a cockpit in the first place....\n\nLuckily, everyone can improve these skills, and this app is the best tool for your math training. And you can do this wherever you are, sousing your iPhone or iPad.\n\nThe app is completely easy and intuitive to use. It has 6 sections where different mathematic skills can be trained and improved. Each test comprises 20 questions and you have a limited time to answer each question. The average time to answer the questions is computed and shown after the test is completed. The highscore and the result of the last try is shown on the menu screen, so the app works a bit like a game...yes, studying and learning can also be fun...\n\nThe tests:\n\n- The estimation test lets you estimate the result of a difficult calculation which is impossible so solve within the limited time available.\n- The fraction test asks for solutions of easy calculations which include fractions under time pressure\n- The word problems are exactly what you would expect...word problems...\n- The number series tests your ability continue a sequence of numbers by logical reasoning. You have to find the logic of the number sequence and find the next number.\n- The arithmetics test will train your ability to perform simple calculations quickly.\n- The cube test is a bit tricky. You have to take the sum of the points on the front sides of the cubes and the sums of the points of the back sides of the cubes and subtract the smaller values from the larger. If one of the cubes shows this number of points, klick on this cube. If not, click on the cube which shows the questionmark. And this under time pressure ! Got it ? Have fun, captain :-)\n\nAll of these tests are part of most pilot screenings one way or another. So the more you train these skills with this app, the higher the chances are, that you end up in the cockpit of your dreams. And if you are already in the cockpit of your dreams, you should train anyway, because exactly these skills you need as pilot to deliver optimal performance.\n\nEven if you are not a pilot, it makes sense to train your mathematics skills with this app. It is fun, and being able to perform quick calculations can help you in many professions and in many areas of life.\n\nThis app will be constantly improved in future. I add new questions at regular updates and I am working on additional modules which will be available in near future.\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact me via email: thomas.oswald@aeroware.at or check my youtube channel for tutorial videos regarding this app. Also check my other pilot apps in the App Store."

Instead, building a Svelte application generates code to manipulate the DOM, which may give better client run-time performance. Svelte has its own compiler for converting app code into client-side JavaScript.\n\n- Learn Javascript (ES6)\n- Learn Typescript\n- Learn HTML5\n- Learn CSS3\n- Webpack\n- Svelte Interview Questions\n- Ajax\n- Learn D3.js\n- Learn Sapper\n- Learn Polymer & Moments.js\n\nLearn TypeScript\nTypeScript lets you write JavaScript the way you really want to. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. TypeScript is pure object oriented with classes, interfaces and statically typed like C-Sharp or Java.\n\nLearn JavaScript\nJavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is designed for creating network-centric applications. It is complimentary to and integrated with Java. JavaScript is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML.\n\nLearn AJAX\nAJAX is a web development technique for creating interactive web applications. If you know JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and XML, then you need to spend just one hour to start with AJAX.\n\nLearn GraphQL\nGraphQL is an open source server-side technology which was developed by Faceboo to optimize RESTful API calls. It is an execution engine and a data query language.\n\nLearn WebPack\nWebpack is an open-source JavaScript module bundler. It is made primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets such as HTML, CSS, and images if the corresponding loaders are included. webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules."

You can choose which tables you want to practice and how many tables at the same time. As new sums fall down you quickly have to find the right answer mounted to the vault door to finally open the vault when completing all tables! \n\nDuring the development of TableVault several kids and teachers of an elementary school were involved. The kids told us which parts of the game they liked and teachers instructed us in standard school teachings. For example, the time in which a sum is supposed to be solved is defined and integrated into this app. The faster kids solve the sum the more points they get! This method ensures they will automatically try to improve their skills to get the highest score! \n\nIn this app an overview of all practices are saved for each child. This includes all the tables a child has practiced and how well he/she is performing for each table. Thus parents can easily track improvements of all their kids."

      "label": "Zit je in groep 4 of 5 (leerjaar 2 - 3) en heb je al flink geoefend met het lezen en schrijven van langere woorden met één klinker (MMKMM-woorden)? Dan is dit je volgende leuke oefen-app. \nDeze app bevat 11 boekjes. Ieder boekje bevat 4 hoofdstukken met ieder 6 oefeningen waarin je de volgende onderwerpen in de spelling gaat oefenen:\n\nJe hoort de u-klank in het woord maar je schrijft hem niet op.\nVeel woorden in het Nederlands hebben door bepaalde combinaties van medeklinkers een u-klank in het woord. Echter deze klank schrijf je niet op. Bijvoorbeeld het woord \"help\". Je hoort een u-klank tussen de l en de p, maar je schrijft hem niet. \n\nJe hoort een u-klank maar je schrijft een 'e' in plaats van een korte 'u'.\nDeze zogenaamde stomme-e komt veel voor in twee-lettergreepwoorden. Veel woorden op het nivo van groep 4 en 5 kun je in deze app oefenen. \n\nEen eerste Introductie in het opschrijven van verkleinwoorden.\nEind groep 4 en in groep 5 wordt een begin gemaakt met verkleinwoorden. De spelling theorie is behoorlijk pittig maar de eerste drie eenvoudige regels kun je al vast oefenen in deze app. Verkleinwoorden zijn woorden die eindigen met 'je'. En je raadt het vast al, de 'e' van 'je' is ook een u-klank.\n\nZoals alle spelling-apps van MagiWise volgen we onze methode:\n\n- Leren lezen van de woorden.\n- Leren overschrijven van de woorden.\n- Woord flitsen.\n- Het invullen van bijv medeklinkers in de woorden. \n- Het hele woord leren schrijven.\n- Woorddictee met de woorden.\n\nDaarnaast heeft elk boekje ook drie dictee-toetsen, zodat je alle woordjes nog eens kan toetsen. Het leesniveau in deze app is AVI E4 - M5 (7 jaar met anderhalf jaar leesonderwijs). In totaal oefen je in deze app met 660 verschillende woorden.\n\nDe app maakt gebruik van een speciaal Nederlands toetsenbord die alle klanken in de Nederlandse taal groepeert. Hierdoor leer je eenvoudig de lettercombinaties en de verschillen in klank. Ook leer je dan beter begrijpen hoe de combinaties van de letters in de woorden worden toegepast. Ook krijg je via de stem van de virtuele juf te horen of je het goed hebt gedaan. En soms wil ze ook wel eens een tip gegeven.\n\nDirect na afloop maar ook op een later tijdstip, kan de leerkracht/ouder elke oefening nalopen en alle antwoorden terughalen in de vorm van schermafdrukken. Op deze manier is het eenvoudig om de oefening samen te evalueren.\n\nDeze app maakt onderdeel uit van de succesvolle educatieve app serie MagiWise, die samen met kinderen zijn gemaakt en ideaal zijn voor extra oefenen op school en thuis. De oefeningen zijn ook samen met alle andere Magiwise oefeningen beschikbaar in de Basisschool app van MagiWise."

Genieten van vogelgeluiden en professionele natuurfotografie van Han Bouwmeester. Als extra heeft de app nu ook een locatiekaart. Nooit meer verdwalen en makkelijk je spots terug vinden. \nDe Veldgidsapp kan de Friese en de Nederlandse namen tegelijk laten zien. Via instellingen in de app kun je de taal kiezen. Veel plezier met de prachtige namen uit Fryslân. Met dank aan provinsje Fryslân en Afúk\n\n\nTip van een Vogelkenner. \r\nLet op met afspelen van vogelgeluiden in de natuur. Vooral in het voorjaar reageren vogels hier sterk op en dat is verloren energie. Echte kenners nemen oortjes (koptelefoon) mee het veld in. Eén oor voor het luisteren naar de vogel en het andere voor de app. Geniet van de natuur!!"

Ce jeu aide l’enfant à apprendre les sons des lettres et des groupes de lettres en présentant simultanément les sons (ou mots) correspondant et les groupes de lettres.\n\nLa progression du jeu est basée sur des données scientifiques : le logiciel été développé par des linguistes, des neuropsychologues et des orthophonistes pour aider les enfants - en particulier les lecteurs en difficulté - à renforcer les automatismes fondamentaux de la lecture.\n\n« GraphoGame – Français » accompagne l’enfant à travers différents jeux avec son propre personnage qu’il fait évoluer au cours du jeu. Le joueur passe progressivement aux syllabes, aux rimes, aux mots courts et aux phrases et apprend peu à peu à décoder des mots plus longs. En jouant 15 minutes quotidiennement, l'enfant améliorera sa précision dans le décodage des lettres, des mots, et sa vitesse de lecture. \n\nLa plateforme GraphoGame est développée par une communauté de chercheurs et de développeurs de jeux leader en Finlande, tandis que le contenu francophone de « GraphoGame Français » a été développé par le Laboratoire de Psychologie Cognitive (CNRS) de l'Université d'Aix-Marseille.\n\nPour plus d’informations sur le contenu francophone, n’hésitez pas à vous rendre sur le site http://grapholearn.fr."

Use this app to study for your US Amateur Radio License -- our question pools are always up to date and always have the current question pools because the app can download updates from the website whenever you are connected to the internet.\n\nDesigned and written by hams with volunteer examiner experience and Sponsored by Icom, this is not your typical study app -- most study apps will focus on practice exams, which is somewhat like studying for your math test by throwing darts at your textbook. Though HamStudy is not a full instructional tool our app is focussed on providing you with the tools you need to study the parts of the question pool that you most need to see.\n\nOur intelligent Study Mode tracks your progress as you move through the pool, providing you with full statistics on what you've seen and giving you the visibility into where you need to study. It will automatically repeat questions as needed. When you don't understand something you can tap the \"explain\" button to view an explanation of the question. Practice Exams make it easy to see how close you are to passing and see what areas to focus on in Study Mode.\n\nShare your progress with your friends or instructor and study together!\n\n* Study *all* current US Amateur Radio question pools (Technician, General, Amateur Extra) -- updates can be downloaded for free when they become available. Additional pools, such as the FCC commercial pools and the Canadian pools, are also available for download in the app. \n\n* This app is not a study guide, it is a directed study tool centered around the questions; there are explanations contributed by users for most pools which do help in learning, but some users may want to pair the app with a study manual to get the most out of both.\n\n* HamStudy's revolutionary Study Modes work with you to ensure you learn the questions; they automatically track your progress and adjust the pace to keep you challenged but not frustrated. User-submitted explanations help you avoid the pitfall of just memorizing answers. Synchronize with your online HamStudy.org account to prevent data loss and be able to switch devices easily.\n\n* Share your progress with other HamStudy.org users and help each other keep progressing towards that next license exam!"

Thank\nyou” - Chattity\n\nSound Touch is the #1 app for entertaining and engaging young children -- complete with\nanimal sounds and music.\n\nStimulate children's brains and teach them all at the same time.\n\nListen to the sounds that farm animals, pets and other wildlife make in nature by touching\nwhimsical cartoons. Teach your toddler what an airplane, truck, and train sound like in a way that they will love.\n\nEach tile you touch opens up and reveals an exciting picture that plays a sound. The images rotate so that children can learn to identify the object, not just the single image that is shown.\n\nParents and children alike love this app and you will too! Download and play with your baby,\ntoddler or young children -- it's easy to learn and can entertain for hours.\n\nListen to the sounds made by both nature and machines. From boats, firetrucks, and\nhorse-drawn carriages to ducks, tigers, and birds. Each animal or object is like its own flash card; when opened, it plays a sound that is sure to stimulate each child and leave them with awe and wonder. This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch. Let them explore and learn with their senses. Parents of children with autism have found this app helpful in engaging their children, but truly it is for anyone that wants to teach their kids something new while stimulating and training their brains.\n\nEvery animal, transportation mode, and tile has five different sounds linked, so children can learn different sounds and images associated with objects. Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

Because Solar Walk knows what time it is, the planets are in proper orientation to the Sun: Earth is dark where it is currently night and gradually lightens to daytime on the other side.” - NY Times\n\n\"It's great for showing my students the relative positions of the planets in the solar system, the satellites orbiting the Earth and our place in the galaxy. Awesome with a smartboard as well.\" - by jbrown61\n\nSolar Walk enables you to:\n\n► Observe 3D model of our Solar system with all its objects in real time and in a ​proper orientation.

      "label": "There's never been a better time to get into Astronomy! Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text. This app never transmits data from your device.\n\n\nNote: Non-English localizations focus on solar system objects and constellation names."

We are increasingly dependent on a global ecosystem of digital signals. We use them for so many things, yet we cannot see them. We can see the roads we use to travel, the buildings we live in, but not the infrastructure that is changing the world. How can we understand this world without understanding how it works? \nThe purpose of this app is to make the invisible visible so we can look at it, think about it and discuss it.\n\nWhy Should I not use this app?\n\nThis app is not a measurement tool. It’s purpose is to inspire, to see the world through a different lens. The app is based on real world data and gives you a pretty good idea of the density of digital signals around you, but it won’t tell you where to move the couch to get a better WIFI signal.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is a data visualization, based on global open datasets of cell tower, Wi-Fi and satellite locations. Based on your GPS location the app shows a 360 degree visualization of signals around you. The dataset includes almost 7 million cell towers, 19 million Wi-Fi routers and hundreds of satellites.\n\nIs this really what radio signals look like?\n\nWe can’t see radio with our eyes. The waves that we use for our cell phones and Wi-Fi are way outside the spectrum of visible light. In order to “see” radio, it has to be interpreted or translated into an image that we can see. There are many ways to do that but it will always be an interpretation.\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is an impression of the infosphere, a way of seeing it."

      "label": "With the Bumba LaLaLa App you can improve the musical ear of your kids while they’re having great fun. The cute clown Bumba lets your kids recognize different sounds, melodies and musical instruments while playing. The app has two game levels: the first aimed at toddlers, the second at preschoolers.\n\nThe toddler level introduces children to musical instruments and their sounds. The auditory processes of 2-3 year olds are stimulated by teaching them the difference in sound between these seven basic instruments.\n\nThe preschooler level for 4-5 year olds goes one step further: preschoolers can create their own melody or recreate melodies they like. For that they have ten instruments that they can combine endlessly. Furthermore, they can set the speed and volume themselves. They are supported by a metronome.\n\nThis interactive music game was developed in cooperation with child development specialist. Therefore your kids are ensured of a fun play experience suitable for their age. All features of the game are designed to meet the development needs of 2-3 year olds (toddler level) and 4-5 year olds (preschooler level).\n\nFrom early on, children pay special attention to melodies. Toddlers and preschoolers just love music. They clap their hands or stamp their feet to the rhythm when they hear a familiar song. They can also listen to the same song for hours on end without it boring them. But: music is more than just entertainment for them. In children who have early experiences with music, the brain has shown to be better at handling change during the growth process. It adapts easier. Children who learn the difference between notes, rhythms and musical instruments will be able to handle auditory information better. And that’s beneficial for their speech development and for learning to read.\n\nThe Bumba LaLaLa App is therefore not simply a lot of fun to play, it also has a clear educational bonus. Recommended for all who wish to improve their children’s skills in a fun way."

When you're finished grooming your horses (and cleaning up their poop!), take a well-deserved break in the club room.\n\nTHE ARENA: Next, advance to the arena and show off your horse's jumping skills. Hear the cheers when the winners take their place on the podium. After the celebration, you can race motorcycles in the arena — vroom! — or get a snack in the food court.\n\nTHE FOREST: Ready to frolic in the forest? Choose your most trusted horse and head off for an adventure in the woods, where you can sleep under the stars in your sleeping bag, then wake up for a swim in the waterfall.\n\nTHE SHOP: When you need more horse tack, head over to the shop — you'll find everything you need.\n\nTRAVEL BETWEEN LOCATIONS\nEach location gives you access to the horse transport, so you can get your horses, equipment, bikes and even characters from here to there. Put what you want to move into the transport, close the door and select the new location by tapping an icon. Everything will arrive in the selected location so you can begin your next adventure!\n\nCREATE AN ORIGINAL VIDEO OF YOUR STORY\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice as you’re telling the story, along with your characters’ movements. Create videos up two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share later!\n\nFEATURES:\n- Explore four locations: stable, arena, forest and shop.\n- Create stories for 24 new characters plus horses and other animals!\n- Care for your horses: feed them, lather them up till they're nice and clean, brush them. \n- Choose outfits from your favorite themes: medieval, western, everyday stable life and fantasy!\n- Hop on to ride bikes in the forest and race motorcycles in the arena!\n- Set up obstacles and show off your horse's jumping skills!\n- Eat at the food court and use the portable potties!\n- Have a campout! \n- Snuggle into your sleeping bag to stay warm under the stars! \n- Take a canoe ride or swim by a waterfall.\n- Make music with magical lily pads!\n- Move horses, characters and objects from here to there in the horse transport! \n- Record your stories in the app and share with your friends!\n- No time limit or high scores — play for as long as you like!\n- No third-party advertising\n\nWE LISTEN\nOne of our top requests for the Toca Life series has been horses!

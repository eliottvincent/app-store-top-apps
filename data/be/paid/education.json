With this app you will not only train your brain by solving math problems, you will also learn special mental math tricks.\n\nFor many math problems, special tricks exist that make solving these much easier. It is important to know when to use which trick, but also how to solve a math problem if none of these special tricks can be used.\n\nThis app contains 44 lessons (with up to 3 tricks per lesson) where you will learn tips and tricks for the following types of math problems:\n-Addition\n-Subtraction\n-Multiplication\n-Division\n-Divisibility\n-Remainders\n-Squaring\n-Square and cube roots\n-Calculate the weekday for any date\n\nYou will not only learn the special tricks, but also more general solutions.\n\nIn the second part of this app, the training, you can solve random math problems with increasing difficulty (adaptive training). Or you can select what type of math problem you want to practice, and in which range the numbers should be (training with choice). The goal here is not only to become better and faster at solving math problems, you will also learn to detect which trick would be the best for the current math problem. This is why there is a help button in the training-section. If you push this button, the application will search for the trick or tip that is possibly the easiest for solving the current math problem.\n\nAdditional features:\n-Two languages: All texts are in english and german.\n-Two different GUI-designs: Use a blue background with white text in sci-fi movie style. Or switch to a white background with black text.\n\nLessons:\nIntroduction\nAddition\nSubtraction\nSingle digit multiplications\nx 10 and x 5\nx 2, x 4 and x 8\nx 9 and x 3\nx 6 and x 7\nx 11 and x 12\nMultiplication of numbers between 11 - 19 and between 91 - 99\nMultiplication of numbers close to a power of 10\nMultiplication of numbers close to multiples of 100 or 1000\nMultiplying numbers with two different bases\nMultiplication of 2 digit numbers\nMultiplication of 3 digit numbers\nx 111, x 21 and x 121\nx 101 and x 1001\nx 15, x 25 and x 50\nx 95 and x 125\nx 2-digit numbers that end in 5 and x 50 to 59\nx 99, x 999 and x 999999…\nx 19 and x 2-digit numbers that end in 9 (including a special case)\n÷ 10, ÷ 5 and ÷ 4\n÷ 9 and ÷ 8\nDivision: Remainders method\nGeneral division method\nDivisibility by 2, 5 and 10\nDivisibility by 9, 3 and 6\nDivisibility by 4, 8 and 7\nDivisibility by 11, 12 and 13\nRemainder when dividing by 2, 5 and 10\nRemainder when dividing by 3, 9 and 6\nRemainder when dividing by 4 and 8\nRemainder when dividing by 7 and 11\nSquaring 1 to 29\nSquaring numbers ending with 5, and 50 to 59\nSquaring 26 to 125\nSquaring numbers close to 1000, and general squaring method\nSquaring numbers ending with 1 or with 25\nSquaring numbers ending with 9 or that have only 9s\nPerfect cube root\nPerfect cube root of numbers between 100 and 200\nPerfect square root\nDay for any date"

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Your goal is to quiet your mind and become aware of that picture.\n\nYou select one of the two choices by pressing the answer which best matches your awareness of that image. When you do that, a second question\nwill appear. You then repeat the process. The Property Matches indicator at the bottom shows the number of correct answers to 24 questions.\n\nFour pictures will then appear. Tap the picture that best matches your mental image. The correct picture will fill the screen. After 12 pictures you may begin a new game.\n\nThis program offers feedback and reinforcement to meets the requirements for learning this skill. The Stargate ESP Trainer presents meaningful and emotional images to your subconscious mind. This ability is often called clairvoyance, and can enhance your life in many surprising ways."

Download and play with your baby,\ntoddler or young children -- it's easy to learn and can entertain for hours.\n\nListen to the sounds made by both nature and machines. From boats, firetrucks, and\nhorse-drawn carriages to ducks, tigers, and birds. Each animal or object is like its own flash card; when opened, it plays a sound that is sure to stimulate each child and leave them with awe and wonder. This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch. Let them explore and learn with their senses. Parents of children with autism have found this app helpful in engaging their children, but truly it is for anyone that wants to teach their kids something new while stimulating and training their brains.\n\nEvery animal, transportation mode, and tile has five different sounds linked, so children can learn different sounds and images associated with objects. Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

      "label": "There's never been a better time to get into Astronomy! Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text. This app never transmits data from your device.\n\n\nNote: Non-English localizations focus on solar system objects and constellation names."

How can we understand this world without understanding how it works? \nThe purpose of this app is to make the invisible visible so we can look at it, think about it and discuss it.\n\nWhy Should I not use this app?\n\nThis app is not a measurement tool. It’s purpose is to inspire, to see the world through a different lens. The app is based on real world data and gives you a pretty good idea of the density of digital signals around you, but it won’t tell you where to move the couch to get a better WIFI signal.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is a data visualization, based on global open datasets of cell tower, Wi-Fi and satellite locations. Based on your GPS location the app shows a 360 degree visualization of signals around you. The dataset includes almost 7 million cell towers, 19 million Wi-Fi routers and hundreds of satellites.\n\nIs this really what radio signals look like?\n\nWe can’t see radio with our eyes. The waves that we use for our cell phones and Wi-Fi are way outside the spectrum of visible light. In order to “see” radio, it has to be interpreted or translated into an image that we can see. There are many ways to do that but it will always be an interpretation.\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is an impression of the infosphere, a way of seeing it."

Steer the digger, fill the truck and repair the water pipe.\n2. Paint the house in different colours and unload the removals truck.\n3. Operate the crane and build a new roof for the house.\n4. Mix cement and build a real wall.\n5. Operate a big cement mixer and concrete a large area.\n6. Drive the street sweeper and clean the dirty road.\n7. Unload the crane truck and make sure it leaves on time.\n\nAmazing graphics, great animations, a user-friendly interface, no text and no in-app purchases.

      "label": "Tables Vault - the most fun way to learn tables! \n*** Top 5 popular apps in education*** \n*** 5 stars nomination Kids Apps Awards apps.weebly.com*** \n\nUsing this educational app kids can practice the math tables from 1 to 20 within a challenging game! You can choose which tables you want to practice and how many tables at the same time. As new sums fall down you quickly have to find the right answer mounted to the vault door to finally open the vault when completing all tables! \n\nDuring the development of TableVault several kids and teachers of an elementary school were involved. The kids told us which parts of the game they liked and teachers instructed us in standard school teachings. For example, the time in which a sum is supposed to be solved is defined and integrated into this app. The faster kids solve the sum the more points they get! This method ensures they will automatically try to improve their skills to get the highest score! \n\nIn this app an overview of all practices are saved for each child. This includes all the tables a child has practiced and how well he/she is performing for each table. Thus parents can easily track improvements of all their kids."

      "label": "With the Bumba LaLaLa App you can improve the musical ear of your kids while they’re having great fun. The cute clown Bumba lets your kids recognize different sounds, melodies and musical instruments while playing. The app has two game levels: the first aimed at toddlers, the second at preschoolers.\n\nThe toddler level introduces children to musical instruments and their sounds. The auditory processes of 2-3 year olds are stimulated by teaching them the difference in sound between these seven basic instruments.\n\nThe preschooler level for 4-5 year olds goes one step further: preschoolers can create their own melody or recreate melodies they like. For that they have ten instruments that they can combine endlessly. Furthermore, they can set the speed and volume themselves. They are supported by a metronome.\n\nThis interactive music game was developed in cooperation with child development specialist. Therefore your kids are ensured of a fun play experience suitable for their age. All features of the game are designed to meet the development needs of 2-3 year olds (toddler level) and 4-5 year olds (preschooler level).\n\nFrom early on, children pay special attention to melodies. Toddlers and preschoolers just love music. They clap their hands or stamp their feet to the rhythm when they hear a familiar song. They can also listen to the same song for hours on end without it boring them. But: music is more than just entertainment for them. In children who have early experiences with music, the brain has shown to be better at handling change during the growth process. It adapts easier. Children who learn the difference between notes, rhythms and musical instruments will be able to handle auditory information better. And that’s beneficial for their speech development and for learning to read.\n\nThe Bumba LaLaLa App is therefore not simply a lot of fun to play, it also has a clear educational bonus. Recommended for all who wish to improve their children’s skills in a fun way."

Do you know what to do? \n\nWhether a bump on the head, a stomach ache from too much candy, a little wound, or a sunburn, these funny animals need the help of a really good doctor! \n\nFrom Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger, the illustrator and director behind the bestseller Apps „Nighty Night“, „Little Fox Music Box“ and „Nighty Night Circus“ comes a wonderful new 3D-App which your child will love! \n\nThe app is full of humorous animations, amazing 3D illustrations, and funny short movies. In the animal doctor’s office, located in a magical treehouse, the animals are waiting to be cured. Kids are playfully guided through applying treatments that they might have experienced themselves: measuring temperatures, taking medicine, getting a plaster. And of course, eating a snail is probably just good for owls!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n\nHighlights:  \n\n1.There are 7 animals in the App - fox, bat, rabbit, mole, hedgehog, spider and owl, with 21 different injuries, sicknesses, and diseases.                                                                                                      \n2. Your child has many different treatments and medicines to choose from to cure the animals and make them happy again. \n3. Every time your child plays the App the animals have different illnesses, injuries and diseases.                                                                                             \n4. Little Fox Animal Doctor is the first 3D-App by Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger. She is also the creative genius behind Nighty Night, Little Fox Music Box and Nighty Night Circus. Her Apps have been downloaded over 5 million times worldwide.                                                                                                                                  \n\nThe App will make your children’s dreams of being an Animal Doctor come true!\n\nAbout Fox & Sheep:\nWe are a Studio in Berlin and develop high quality apps for kids at the age of 2-8 years. We are parents ourselves and work passionately and with a lot of commitment on our products. We work with the best illustrators and animators around the world to create and present the best apps possible – to enrich the lives of our and your kids."

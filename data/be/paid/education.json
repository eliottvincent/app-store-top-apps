      "label": "\"Laminitis\" the iPhone App was created to provide horse owners with a practical tool to help monitor weather conditions in a way that can be used to warn when grazing on grass posses an increased risk to horses prone to laminitis.\n\nLocal weather conditions are monitored and are used to predict the rise and fall of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC's) in grass.  When the predicted NSC's increase, this is shown as a rise in risk.\n\nUnder extreme weather conditions grass can become stressed and in these circumstances significantly increase the risk of a horse becoming footy or suffering a laminitic episode.  When this type of weather pattern happens the risk gauge will rapidly increase to High and maintain this level until the NSC and grass stress levels are predicted to have lowered again.\n\nToday, laminitis is a huge problem for horses all over the world and is one of the most common causes of lameness.  With the help of this app as an educational tool it is hoped that fewer horses will suffer from this condition going forward.\n\nCurrent Coverage: United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales & Northern Ireland), Ireland, France, Belgium\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThis application is not intended as a replacement for correct animal husbandry or to replace veterinary advice, it's role is simply to act as an additional early warning tool to advise when grasses at the location you have selected are likely to be 'under stress' and therefore to have accumulated excess non-structural carbohydrates (NSC, i.e. sugars, starch or fructan) which could significantly increase the risk of a laminitic episode should it be grazed.\n\nThis app can give you a warning when the risk of grazing induced laminitis is rising or high. However, individual horses vary widely in their ability to tolerate fluctuations in NSC levels so what is safe for one horse may not be safe for another. In addition, grazing is only one risk factor for laminitis and you need also to be aware of the risks posed by other causes, including toxins, metabolic problems and sugar and starch levels in hard feed, which cannot be measured by this app."

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Ze kan ook preventief worden ingezet bij kinderen die in een \n\nrisicoprofiel vallen. Delen ervan kunnen eveneens ingezet worden bij kleuters die zich voorbereiden op het eerste leerjaar via het herkennen van getallen, correct manipuleren van de \n\nhanden,...\nBij verschillende oefeningen wordt de tijd opgemeten en een score weergegeven zodat er kan gemeten worden welke de vooruitgang is.\nAutomatisch willen zeggen snel en zonder denken oefeningen kunnen maken.

Show your students how wonderful the universe we live in is with this amazing and easy-to-use interactive encyclopedia of the solar system.\n\nAN ABUNDANCE OF ASTRONOMY INFORMATION\nNO ADS\nNO IN-APP PURCHASES\nNO INTERNET CONNECTION NEEDED\n\nSee what is said about our app used in classes:\n\n\"My students felt like they experienced the solar system as they had read in Lucy and Stephen Hawking's book \"George's Secret Key to the Universe\". In that book a powerful computer can open a portal to show young George the planets. That is precisely what my classroom of children will pretend if we can manipulate Solar Walk on our large interactive screen!\"\n— Greg Kroening, Burroughs Community School\n\n\"I used this app recently when teaching Year 9 BTEC students about the composition of the Solar System. Students were engaged from the start as I had chosen to project the animation of the solar system. I was pleased and amazed by the engagement of the students throughout the lessons as this app made the lesson more accessible to all students.\"\n— Smartlearning Teacher of Science at Priority Community School Weston Super Mare.\n\n\"Solar Walk gives your students a realistic look at the Solar System. Let your students take a virtual field trip to the planet of their choice to explore and report back to the class about. Students can become astronauts flying to the planet of choice, getting an in-depth look at the planet, and exploring each of the planets moons.\"\n— iPad Curriculum.\n\n******************************\n\nMain Features:\n\n- 3D model of our solar system with all its objects in real-time and correct positions\n- plenty of information about planets, moons, stars, comets, asteroids, satellites and other celestial bodies\n- deep space objects\n- the time machine to track the motion of celestial bodies in time and observe celestial events of different periods\n- interesting astronomy facts\n- astronomical calendar with various celestial events\n- extended information about space exploration and space missions\n- detailed 3D models of spacecraft\n- stunning visuals and graphics\n\nPossible Classroom Uses:\n\n- Use the app as a whole class teaching tool when learning about space and the solar system.\n- Let children use the app as a reference tool. They can use it to create a report about space.\n- Connect the app to a projector and use it as a backdrop for a video presentation about the solar system.\n\nYou should definitely choose this solar system app among others to apply in teaching your students because it offers an abundance of interesting and educational information about the universe and our Solar system. \n\nThe information is detailed and presented in an entertaining form so that even complex material will be clearly understood by everyone. \n\nStudents will be taken aback with the beauty of this application.\n\nMake your classes more productive, interesting and engaging with Solar Walk 2!"

Wired.com: \"Quite a useful app for learning many fraction computations.\"\n\nThe Fraction Math app can handle positive and negative fractions, improper fractions, whole numbers and mixed numbers. The user can also reduce the resulting fractions.\n\nThe user can input his/her own fractions, mixed numbers, and whole numbers. The app has also an illustrated glossary of the most common terms.\n\nRecommended by reviewers\n\nWired.com:\n\n\"Quite a useful app for learning many fraction computations.\"\n\nFun Educational Apps: \n\n\"Fraction Math app is easy to use and really takes you step by step when adding, subtracting or multiplying fractions.\"\n\nSuitable for several grades and also for adults\n\nA third-grade student can use the app to add and subtract fractions with equal denominators. \n\nA fourth-grade student can use the app to add or subtract fractions and mixed numbers with different denominators and also to reduce the resulting fractions. \n\nA fifth-grade student can multiply fractions by whole numbers and other fractions. She can also divide fractions and mixed numbers.\n\nA sixth or higher-grade student can use negative fractions, whole numbers and mixed numbers in the problems. She can also use larger numbers.\n\nThe above grades and their uses of the app are only provided as examples.\n\nThe user can choose how to solve the problems\n\nIn each step the user is presented with two choices. Sometimes both of the choices are right. When multiplying fractions the user can choose to first multiply the numerators or the denominators. \n\nIn those cases when there is only one possible next step, the user can choose between the right step and a random wrong step. For wrong steps, the app will tell, why that is the wrong step.\n\nIntelligent help system\n\nThe Fraction Math app has a help system that provides over 60 context sensitive tips based on the state of the app. For example, when searching for a lowest common denominator, the help system will first tell how to search for the answer. If, after trying herself the user cannot find the answer, the help system will tell her what the lowest common denominator is.\n\nSmart keyboard\n\nWhen the user has to enter numbers, the Fraction Math app uses the same intuitive smart rolling keyboard as my other apps. Only one tap is needed to enter any number. In reducing fractions, a special prime number keyboard is shown. \n\nEvery step is animated\n\nEvery step in solving the problems is animated. The speed of the animations can be set and they can also be turned off.\n\nFun illustrations\n\nThe 60 different tips have a lot of information about fractions, mixed numbers, improper fractions and reduction of fractions. The tips have over 50 illustrations to keep the user interested in reading the tips.\n\nThe app has the following settings:\n\n- allow addition\n- allow subtraction\n- allow multiplication\n- allow division\n- only allow fractions with same denominators\n- allow whole numbers\n- allow mixed numbers\n- allow negative numbers\n- allow numbers grater than 12\n\nOther iDevBooks math apps \n\niDevBooks math apps have been reviewed and endorsed by Wired.com, IEAR.org, Edudemic.com, Teachers with Apps, and other respected sites and organizations. \n\nSome of the other 40 iDevBooks math apps are Column Addition, Long Multiplication, Long Division, Column Subtraction, Lattice Multiplication, Visual Multiplication Table, Partial Differences Subtraction, Partial Quotients Division, Partial Sums Addition, Decimal Rounding, etc. \n\nFeedback and requests for new features \n\nNew ideas to make this app better are welcome.

      "label": "Mit Antolin dem Leseraben können Kinder ihre Lesefertigkeit auf spielerische Weise steigern. Dabei werden Wahrnehmung und Wortauffassung sowie sinnverstehendes und informationsentnehmendes Lesen geübt. Das Kind lernt Wörter schneller zu erfassen, sodass seine Leseflüssigkeit und Lesegeschwindigkeit zunehmen.\nDie liebevoll gestalteten und temporeichen Übungen bieten zusätzlich viel Aktion und Spielspaß so dass Lesetraining ganz nebenbei erfolgt! Durch das Spielen gegen die Zeit werden die Kinder zum Verbessern ihres Highscores und damit zum häufigen Wiederholen motiviert. Unterschiedliche Geschwindigkeiten und Schwierigkeitsstufen ermöglichen, dass jedes Kind entsprechend seiner Lesefähigkeit starten kann.\n\nDie 8 Lesespiele fördern zentrale Lesefertigkeiten:\n\nPunkte jagen \nMit den Augen wird ein schnell wandernder Punkt verfolgt, in dem ab und zu ein anderer Buchstabe oder ein anderes Wort erscheint. Diese Übung trainiert die Konzentrationsfähigkeit sowie eine gleichmäßige und schnelle Augenbewegung. Gleichzeitig werden die reflexhafte Reaktion und Blicksprünge geübt. Denn bei einem flüssigen und schnellen Lesen bewegen sich die Augen nicht gleichmäßig von Buchstabe zu Buchstabe, sondern sie springen von einem Haltepunkt zum nächsten. \n\nGeisterwörter\nEs wird ein Wort gezeigt, welches nach kurzer Zeit wieder verschwindet. Dieses Wort soll aus einer Auswahl von vier Wörtern wiedererkannt werden.\nDiese Übung trainiert das ganzheitliche Erfassen und das Wiedererkennen der Wortgestalt von bis zu viersilbigen Wörtern. Dadurch kann das Kind Wörter schneller erfassen, sodass seine Leseflüssigkeit zunimmt. \n\nWortpaare\nAus einer Anzahl von Wortpaaren sollen die ungleichen Wortpaare erkannt und angetippt werden. \nDiese Übung trainiert die Lesegeschwindigkeit bekannter und unbekannter Wörter. Die Wörter werden als Bilder wahrgenommen und werden nicht Buchstabe für Buchstabe mühsam erlesen. \n\nWortgitter\nIn einem Buchstabenfeld soll möglichst schnell das gesuchte Wort zweimal wiedergefunden werden.\nDie Wörter sind je nach Level horizontal und vertikal oder auch diagonal und übereck versteckt.\nDiese Übung trainiert die Wortauffassung und die Diskrimination von Wortbildern. \n\nBücherwurm\nIn einem Kontinuum von sich bewegenden Buchstaben sollen möglichst schnell die gesuchten Wörter und Sätze erlesen werden. Diese Übung trainiert die Erfassung von Wörtern und Wortgrenzen. \n\nBildersuche \nIn einem Bild sollen möglichst schnell die beschriebenen Situationen gefunden und angetippt werden. Diese Übung trainiert sinnverstehendes und informationsentnehmendes Lesen sowie die Fähigkeiten, Informationen (aus Text und Bild) in Beziehung zueinander zu setzen, Schlussfolgerungen zu ziehen und Wichtiges von Unwichtigem zu unterscheiden.\n\nSeifenblasen\nDiese Übung trainiert die Blickspanne, die Konzentration und die Wortauffassung. Das Auge der Kinder muss über das gesamte Spielfeld wandern, da die Auswahlmöglichkeiten über das ganze Spielfeld verteilt sind und sich beständig bewegen. Durch den konzentrierten Blick und das Lesen muss in kurzer Zeit wahrgenommen werden, ob das verwürfelte Wort im Ballon die gleichen Buchstaben enthält wie das Suchwort. Die Lesefertigkeiten und -fähigkeiten werden dadurch weiter gefestigt und gefördert.\n\nLeserätsel\nIn sogenannten Logicals nehmen die Kinder nach genauer Lektüre der Hinweise Zuordnungen von z.B. Berufen, Eigenschaften und Lieblingsfarben zu Personen vor.\nDiese Übung trainiert sinnverstehendes und informationsentnehmendes Lesen sowie die Fähigkeiten, Informationen (aus mehreren Texten) in Beziehung zu einander zu setzen, Schlussfolgerungen zu ziehen und Wichtiges von Unwichtigem zu unterscheiden.\n\nDie Punkte, die die Kinder in der Antolin Lesepiele-App erzielen, werden nicht dem Punktekonto auf www.antolin.de zugerechnet.\n\nWir sind daran interessiert, unsere Apps kontinuierlich zu verbessern. Bitte senden Sie Verbesserungsvorschläge und Fehlermeldungen per E-Mail an antolin@schroedel.de. Vielen Dank!"

The best way to learn a new language is through immersion and repetition. This is where Solfeggio was born. After giving the children an easy to learn and fun to play game, their understanding and recognition of the notes grew exponentially. I soon came to realize that this app had the potential to help all budding piano players, young and not so young, to learn to read notes and gain confidence in their playing. \n\nUnlike other music apps, Solfeggio is using a smart algorithm. It keeps count of correct and incorrect answers and as the player progresses, the notes or key signature that are harder for the player to remember repeat more often. Solfeggio helps players to push past their weak points and become proficient in all areas of music reading."

Your goal is to quiet your mind and become aware of that picture.\n\nYou select one of the two choices by pressing the answer which best matches your awareness of that image. When you do that, a second question\nwill appear. You then repeat the process. The Property Matches indicator at the bottom shows the number of correct answers to 24 questions.\n\nFour pictures will then appear. Tap the picture that best matches your mental image. The correct picture will fill the screen. After 12 pictures you may begin a new game.\n\nThis program offers feedback and reinforcement to meets the requirements for learning this skill.

Awesome with a smartboard as well.\" - by jbrown61\n\nSolar Walk enables you to:\n\n► Observe 3D model of our Solar system with all its objects in real time and in a ​proper orientation.

      "label": "There's never been a better time to get into Astronomy! Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

      "label": "The infosphere, Visualized.\n\nEvery time we use our phones, tablets or laptops we are entering an invisible world of wireless digital signals. It is a world that we cannot see but that is literally all around us.\nThe Architecture of Radio is a 360 degree data visualization of what this world might look like. It shows the cell towers, GPS satellites and Wi-Fi routers around you that allow us to live our digital lives.\n\nNew: support for Iphone X, XR, XS and XS Max Screens\nNew: Cardboard support!\nImmerse yourself in the Infosphere in Virtual Reality using a cardboard or compatible headset*\n\n*Carboard support only for iPhone. iPhone 6s or newer recommended for best performance.\n\nWhy should I use this app?\n\nOut of curiosity! We are increasingly dependent on a global ecosystem of digital signals. We use them for so many things, yet we cannot see them. We can see the roads we use to travel, the buildings we live in, but not the infrastructure that is changing the world. How can we understand this world without understanding how it works? \nThe purpose of this app is to make the invisible visible so we can look at it, think about it and discuss it.\n\nWhy Should I not use this app?\n\nThis app is not a measurement tool. It’s purpose is to inspire, to see the world through a different lens. The app is based on real world data and gives you a pretty good idea of the density of digital signals around you, but it won’t tell you where to move the couch to get a better WIFI signal.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is a data visualization, based on global open datasets of cell tower, Wi-Fi and satellite locations. Based on your GPS location the app shows a 360 degree visualization of signals around you. The dataset includes almost 7 million cell towers, 19 million Wi-Fi routers and hundreds of satellites.\n\nIs this really what radio signals look like?\n\nWe can’t see radio with our eyes. The waves that we use for our cell phones and Wi-Fi are way outside the spectrum of visible light. In order to “see” radio, it has to be interpreted or translated into an image that we can see. There are many ways to do that but it will always be an interpretation.\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is an impression of the infosphere, a way of seeing it."

Drive the street sweeper and unload the truck crane!\n\nOn our construction site your child can drive a digger, mix cement, roof a building, operate a crane, drive a street sweeper or paint a house. There’s so much to do here. Our Little Builders dig, plaster, fill, paint and mix... And they need your children´s help.\n\nAt the same time they can watch funny things happen, because on every building site there’s always something going wrong. Water suddenly bursts from a pipe, a builder falls into a hole or the wind blows the bricks away because the cement wasn’t dry yet.\n\nLittle Builders is the first 3D app for children aged 2-6 years that want to explore the world of being a real little builder. Depending on the child’s age, all animations and functions can run automatically or be controlled through a tap.\n\n7 interactive scenarios contain over 100 interactive animations and surprises:\n\n1. Steer the digger, fill the truck and repair the water pipe.\n2. Paint the house in different colours and unload the removals truck.\n3. Operate the crane and build a new roof for the house.\n4. Mix cement and build a real wall.\n5. Operate a big cement mixer and concrete a large area.\n6. Drive the street sweeper and clean the dirty road.\n7. Unload the crane truck and make sure it leaves on time.\n\nAmazing graphics, great animations, a user-friendly interface, no text and no in-app purchases. Download now and start building!\n\nPlease also check out our other great Apps for kids:\n\n„PETTING ZOO“ - is a fantastic storybook app for the iPad and iPhone.

You can choose which tables you want to practice and how many tables at the same time. As new sums fall down you quickly have to find the right answer mounted to the vault door to finally open the vault when completing all tables! \n\nDuring the development of TableVault several kids and teachers of an elementary school were involved. The kids told us which parts of the game they liked and teachers instructed us in standard school teachings. For example, the time in which a sum is supposed to be solved is defined and integrated into this app. The faster kids solve the sum the more points they get! This method ensures they will automatically try to improve their skills to get the highest score! \n\nIn this app an overview of all practices are saved for each child. This includes all the tables a child has practiced and how well he/she is performing for each table. Thus parents can easily track improvements of all their kids."

      "label": "With the Bumba LaLaLa App you can improve the musical ear of your kids while they’re having great fun. The cute clown Bumba lets your kids recognize different sounds, melodies and musical instruments while playing. The app has two game levels: the first aimed at toddlers, the second at preschoolers.\n\nThe toddler level introduces children to musical instruments and their sounds. The auditory processes of 2-3 year olds are stimulated by teaching them the difference in sound between these seven basic instruments.\n\nThe preschooler level for 4-5 year olds goes one step further: preschoolers can create their own melody or recreate melodies they like. For that they have ten instruments that they can combine endlessly. Furthermore, they can set the speed and volume themselves. They are supported by a metronome.\n\nThis interactive music game was developed in cooperation with child development specialist. Therefore your kids are ensured of a fun play experience suitable for their age. All features of the game are designed to meet the development needs of 2-3 year olds (toddler level) and 4-5 year olds (preschooler level).\n\nFrom early on, children pay special attention to melodies. Toddlers and preschoolers just love music. They clap their hands or stamp their feet to the rhythm when they hear a familiar song. They can also listen to the same song for hours on end without it boring them. But: music is more than just entertainment for them. In children who have early experiences with music, the brain has shown to be better at handling change during the growth process. It adapts easier. Children who learn the difference between notes, rhythms and musical instruments will be able to handle auditory information better. And that’s beneficial for their speech development and for learning to read.\n\nThe Bumba LaLaLa App is therefore not simply a lot of fun to play, it also has a clear educational bonus. Recommended for all who wish to improve their children’s skills in a fun way."

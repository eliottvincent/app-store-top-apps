      "label": "Things get messy when you’re stuck running a wildly popular pizza parlor in Papa’s Pizzeria To Go! Top, bake, and serve pizzas in this award-winning game that’s reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.\n\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the pizzeria, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Topping Station to add a variety of toppings to each pizza.  Move to the Bake Station to cook the pizzas in the oven until they're baked just right.  Jump to the Cutting Station to cut the pizza into perfect slices.  Each station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the pizza-building process.\n\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Pizzeria!  A well-crafted pizza also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\n\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S PIZZERIA TO GO **\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers don't get in the way of the action!\n\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\n\nTOPPING STATION - We've completely redesigned the Topping Station for smaller screens.  Bins of toppings can be scrolled with your thumb, which allows us to have many more toppings than in the original game.  Tap on a bin to select that topping, then tap multiple times on the pizza to add items directly onto the pizza.  You don't need to drag individual toppings onto the pizza, so you can top faster than ever!  A quick swipe on the pizza will send it off the to the Bake Station.\n\nBAKE STATION - Papa Louie's coal-fired oven gets an upgrade!  You can buy new Oven Alarms in the Shop to help you keep track of pizzas in the oven.  Simply drag an alarm onto one of the oven timers, and you'll hear an alert when that pizza is cooked just right.  Buy new Oven Boosters to cook your pizzas even faster than before!\n\nCUTTING STATION - When it's time to cut pizzas, simply touch and drag a line across the pizza to decide where to cut.  If you want even more control to fine-tune your slices, you can also cut using multi-touch!  Use two fingers or thumbs to move each end of the line at the same time, and release to slice your pizza.  If you're having trouble cutting pizzas at the right angle, buy a variety of Cutting Guides in the Shop to cut that perfect slice!\n\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients which can't be found in the original Papa's Pizzeria.  As you play the game, you'll unlock 26 unique ingredients to serve your customers!\n\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR LOBBY - You can spend your hard-earned tips in the Shop, where you can find a variety of posters, furniture, and wallpaper styles for your lobby!  Use the brand-new Lobby tool to add items to your restaurant, and move and arrange them however you like!  Choose from over 140 customization items, and every item you add to the lobby will improve your Waiting Score for your customers!\n\nUPDATED FEATURES - Serve picky closers at the end of the day, earn paychecks as you play, and try to please the finicky Food Critic to earn a Blue Ribbon!\n\n**GAME FEATURES**\n\nHands-on pizza shop in the Papa Louie universe\nAll new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\nMulti-task between topping, baking, and cutting\nShop to buy upgrades, furniture, and posters using your in-game tips\nNew Lobby Editor to customize and decorate your shop\n90 customers to unlock with unique orders\nChallenging Closers and Food Critic\n75 in-game achievements to earn\n\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens."

Set across three continents during the turbulent Middle Ages, spectacular conflicts and scheming rivals line the path to power as the great kingdoms of the medieval world vie for supremacy. Be it through diplomacy or conquest, trade or subterfuge, you must secure the resources and loyalty required to rule an empire from the shores of Western Europe to the sands of Arabia.\n\nTHE STRENGTH OF NATIONS\nUnlock up to 17 playable factions and build them into major world powers through statecraft, subterfuge or all-out war.\n\nTHE KINGDOMS EXPANSION\nAvailable via in-app purchase, this massive expansion includes 24 playable factions across four unique, fully featured campaigns. Wage war from the jungles of the Americas to the deserts of the Holy Land, from the deceptively gentle shores of the British Isles to the frigid Baltic plains.\n\nTHE ART OF WAR\nDeploy infantry, archers and cavalry into huge real-time battles, with a full range of medieval weaponry at your command.\n\nTHE TOOLS OF STATE\nUse sophisticated diplomacy, lucrative trade agreements and daring agents to forge alliances or destabilise your rivals.\n\nTHE TEST OF TIME\nShape the destinies of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East through five momentous centuries of combat, competition and conquest.\n\nTHE POWER IN YOUR HANDS\nTake command, with a brand-new user interface and enhanced touch controls for fingertip control of the battlefield. Or, play with any iPadOS-compatible mouse & keyboard.\n\n===\n\nTotal War: MEDIEVAL II requires 4.3GB of free space. For the best possible experience, we recommend playing Total War: MEDIEVAL II on iOS 15 or later. A further 7.65GB is required to install all of the Kingdoms expansion content.

At any time, you can strap yourself into the cockpit and see how it flies with realistic physics. If you're not in the mood for building, over 250,000 airplanes are available to download for free.\n\nBUILD AIRPLANES\nYou have the tools you'll need to bring any airplane to life. Snap parts together to build your airplane's body. Place engines to add thrust. Design and attach wings and then strap yourself into the cockpit and see how it flies. \n\nDOWNLOAD AIRPLANES\nOver 250,000 airplanes are available to download for free from SimplePlanes.com. Find anything from old WW2 bombers to next-generation fighters to sci-fi spacecraft. You can upload your own airplanes and rise through the ranks from a bronze builder to a gold level builder.\n\nDYNAMIC FLIGHT MODEL\nFlight simulation at its finest. Every little change you make in the designer impacts how the airplane flies. Weight distribution, thrust, lift, and drag are all calculated continuously while flying. Parts can break off in spectacular fashion while flying due to over-stress or by hitting something. The fun won't stop there though. You can keep on flying even with a missing wing if you've got the skills.\n\nSANDBOX MODE\nUse all available parts to build airplanes with no restrictions. The sky is the limit. Literally.\n\nCHALLENGES\nClimb into the cockpit of one of your custom aircraft and see how it does in the challenges. Land on aircraft carriers, dodge surface-to-air missiles, race through courses, and so much more.\n\nEDUCATIONAL\nTutorials will help players learn the basics of real airplane design and the considerations that need to be taken when airplanes are made."

      "label": "Papa's Burgeria is now available to play on the go, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.  Grill, stack, and serve burgers in a brand-new way!  \r\n\r\nYou're left in charge of Papa Louie's famous Burgeria, where you'll learn to take orders, grill patties, add toppings, and serve burgers to all of your crazy customers.  You need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls that feel just right in the palm of your hand: Head to the Order Station to keep an eye out for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Grill Station to drag patties onto the grill and flip burgers to cook them evenly.  Jump to the Build Station to carefully craft your sandwiches with toppings and sauces exactly how they ordered, and deliver the finished burger to earn points and tips!\r\n\r\nEach Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the burger-building process.  With full multi-touch support, the process is more fun than ever before!  Tap many burgers at once to flip them all on the grill, or keep one finger on the Build Station's bin slider for even better precision when building.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up. As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Burgeria!  Papa's Burgeria To Go also features unlockable toppings that aren't available in previous versions!\r\n\r\n**NEW FOR PAPA'S BURGERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  Use buttons in the top corners to switch Order Tickets without having to drag them back and forth.  You can also view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nGRILL STATION - We've made keeping track of your burgers easier than ever, with Timers stuck in each burger patty that you can read at a glance, showing the cooking time and how each side is cooked.  You can also buy Alarms in the Shop to add onto each Timer, so you'll get an alert when it's time to flip or remove a burger.  With multi-touch support, you can quickly flip and remove burgers by using multiple fingers.  Try a triple-tap to flip three patties in a row!\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - With a traditional drag-and-drop system, your finger would block your view, so we've completely changed the Build Station to work on smaller screens.  You'll swipe a carousel of Topping Bins across the top of the screen, and slide it carefully to line up toppings with the burger below.  Simply tap on the bottom of the screen to drop a topping from the bin above!  You can also tap a button to swap your Topping Bins with Burger Bins, which hold all of the patties you've cooked on the grill.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the bottom of the screen, so stacking burgers is a breeze!\r\n\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on burger shop game in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between grilling, stacking, and serving\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- Over 60 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- Over 50 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out the original \"Papa's Burgeria\" for iPad!"

You'll run around the woods, fight monsters, and talk to ostensibly shady characters! All from your pocket! Be warned though - you never know what the forest might be hiding not all trails are paved. Labyrinths and dungeons are tucked away in the most concealed nooks. There are no waypoints in Afterplace. You'll have to forge your own path.\n\nAfterplace has been designed from the ground up to be a fast, fluid, beautiful experience for mobile. There are no virtual buttons. You can move and attack by touching anywhere. You can tap objects directly to interact or attack, or use two thumbs like a traditional controller. The game will adapt dynamically to your play style. Pick up and set down the game at your own pace, it will always save your progress. Afterplace is made to feel like a full-fledged indie adventure game that fits in your pocket.\n\n\nAbout the Author:\nAfterplace is made by one person, Evan Kice. A former software engineer from Austin TX, Evan quit his job (to the dismay of his friends and family) and has been working full time on Afterplace since early 2019. The initial game released in December of 2022, but Evan plans on continuing to support and polish the game when he can!"

      "label": "Bad North DOES NOT support: iPhone 5S, 6, 6 Plus, iPad Air/Mini 2, 3/iPod Touch 6th gen and lower\n\nYour home is under attack. The king is dead at the hands of Viking invaders. Hope is a distant glimmer in the fog, fading fast with every passing moment. As you rise to take your father’s place as ruler, it will fall to you to stage your defenses. But make no mistake – this is no fight for victory, but a desperate grasp for survival. \n\nBad North is a charming but brutal real-time tactics roguelite. Defend your idyllic island kingdom against a horde of Viking invaders, as you lead the desperate exodus of your people. Command your loyal subjects to take full tactical advantage of the unique shape of each island. Everything is at stake: fail, and watch the blood of your subjects stain the ground red.\n\nIt’s charmingly brutal, with beautiful procedurally-generated islands and adorable soldiers juxtaposed against the blood-stained realities of war. You control the broad strokes of the battle, giving high level commands to your soldiers who try their best to carry them out in the heat of the moment. It’s accessibly deep, with simple player inputs masking a dynamic combat simulation that make it inviting to new players while challenging veterans.\nKeep fighting, warriors. Not for power or riches or glory, but for hope of peace to come once again in the harsh lands of the Bad North.\n\nKey Features\n\nREAL-TIME TACTICS ROGUELITE:  Position and relocate your troops to fend off the Vikings, who each have their own counters to the threats you pose. Pick your battles and plan your evacuations carefully! Lose a commander and they’re gone forever; lose everything, and it’s game over! \n\nINTELLIGENT UNIT CONTROLS: You command the broad strokes of your defenses and monitor positioning — your soldiers do the rest, navigating and engaging intuitively in response to the situation at hand.\n\nPROCEDURALLY-GENERATED ISLANDS: Each island is both stylistically charming and unique in its layout. Plan your strategies around every nook and cranny, for you only get one chance to save them from the enemy invasion.\n\nUNLOCKABLE UPGRADES: A stronger, smarter defense leads to greater rewards. Use these to develop your subjects from a ragtag militia into seasoned warriors."

Will your choices speed you up - or lead you into disaster? Will you earn Fogg's trust and respect? Will you uncover the secrets and short-cuts that can shave days off your time? Murder, romance, rebellion and intrigue await! \n\nThe app is networked, with a feed that shows you the position of all the other players of the game, their routes, triumphs and disasters. You can race to be the fastest - or look ahead to learn the secrets of the world.\n\nShare your own journey with friends, and load other's routes directly into your app so you can race head-to-head.\n\n80 DAYS is a complete experience, with no in-app purchases, and was made by a core team of just four people.

You can find words using the 7 letters you have, but also match up letters and word parts on the board.  \n \nLookup words online or in the local dictionary with a Copy/Define/Lookup online menu.\n\nThe word length selector is handy to find words for Draw Something. \n\nSearches are case-insensitive, and diacritic marks (accents) insensitive: you can type \"geent\" and \"geënt\" will be displayed. \n\nNew is the \"Test word\" option: test if a word exists, and find words with missing letters. You can use this to see if there are words that would fit a game situation, and which letters you would need. Also handy to find 2-letter combinations. Use a single dot for one missing letter, an @ sign for more. Also usable for crossword puzzles.\n\nSlide Over: you can now use the Wordsfinder in front of another app, for example in front of Wordfeud, or a puzzle app! It requires iOS 13, and is only available on iPad.\nHow to use Slide Over:  1. Make sure Wordsfinder is in the Dock; 2. Open an app; 3. Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open the Dock; 4. On the Dock, touch and hold the Wordsfinder, then drag it up, to the screen; 5.

      "label": "Shiny cherries, juicy apples, sweet pears, and glorious plums hang ripe from the trees.\nBut cheeky Theo the Raven knows it too!\nBefore he gets busy with the fruits, they all need to be harvested.\n\nTheo likes to take what suits him, and just like all real ravens, he does it without asking. This time, he has his eye on the juicy, yummy fruits in your garden.\nCan you collect all of the tasty treats in time? And watch out, he has lots of sneaky and funny tricks up his sleeve.\n\nORCHARD is based on the 1986 HABA board-game classic of the same name, and is the second App from HABA, following on from ‘Unicorn Glitterluck’.\n\nORCHARD is:\n\n1. diverse : realms for playing, learning, discovering and creating\n2. exciting : interactive, playful fun with Theo the Raven\n3. age appropriate : various challenges for children from the age of 3 upwards\n4. uncomplicated : all games are intuitive\n5. safe : no advertising or unwanted in-app purchases\n\nUnlike the the board game, the App does not function as a multi-player game. Instead, the aim is for the child to reach his or her best single-player result, without losing the most important aspects of the original board-game.\n\nORCHARD is mainly orientated towards enhancing the child’s awareness of colours, forms, and of course fruit and vegetables from all over the world.\nThe child plays directly against Theo the Raven.\nWhen it’s the ravens turn, he creeps a little closer, or starts one of many mini-games. This loosens up the course of the game, and creates moments of surprise.\n\nAbout Fox & Sheep:\nWe are a Studio in Berlin and develop high quality apps for kids at the age of 2-8 years. We are parents ourselves and work passionately and with a lot of commitment on our products. We work with the best illustrators and animators around the world to create and present the best apps possible – to enrich the lives of our and your kids."

      "label": "Conquer the world, one bite at a time! Infectonator 3: Apocalypse is a fast-paced simulation-strategy game where your goal is to destroy humanity with your growing army of mutating zombies. Drop your virus into an unsuspecting population and watch the chaos unfold. Upgrade your virus, splice DNA, and unlock dozens of undead creatures with unique powers.\n\nBlending pixel art mayhem and arcade action, Infectonator 3: Apocalypse has you lurching across the world map to wipe out humanity before it wipes out you. By causing the most destruction in each area and reaching target goals, you'll be able to jump from one continent to the next. But beware; not only will humans start deploying powerful zombie countermeasures during levels, but they'll also begin researching a cure. If that happens, it's game over! The good news is that with hordes of zombies, mutated monstrosities, and powerful traps and weapons on your side, you're not giving up this apocalypse without a fight.\n\nThe only difference between the mobile version and desktop version is that this one fits in your pocket. Now you can destroy the planet from anywhere in the world, even the bathroom.\n\nFeatures\nOver 35 Zombies to Discover and Craft – Splice DNA to unlock new mutations, from common walking-undead to leaping alien parasites. Build your brain-hungry army and master their abilities to turn humanity into mulch.\n\nA Wonderfully Warped World –  Infectonator 3: Apocalypse takes place in the real world... well, sort of! As you destroy the globe, you'll encounter parodies and morbid humor of all sorts, but beware. The humans will not go quietly and have their own defenses.\n\nClassic Pixelart With a Modern Twist – Expressive and cute-yet-creepy 2D humans and monsters roam dynamically lit 3D environments. Sending hordes of undead monsters to devour flesh has never looked so pretty!\n\nOver 200 Unique Interactive Levels – Open or lock doors, blow up walls... use the environment to your advantage and make sure your zombies get to the very last human to earn bonus cash and creatures for your lab.\n\nBuilt for Challenge and Customisation – Randomized events, mutations, and locations add difficulty to various maps, while optional modifiers can make the game harder... or more casual, if you prefer."

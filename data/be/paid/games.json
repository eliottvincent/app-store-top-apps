      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.

You can now even design custom interiors.\n\n- Set product menus and pricing wisely to compete with neighboring coffee shops. You can now also develop brand-new products.\n\n- Conduct store marketing to drive traffic while minimizing the cost. You now have more marketing campaigns.\n\n- Hire store staff and keep them working hard and happy. Their services will determine your store's popularity. You can now even hire a store manager to delegate many of daily store operations.\n\n- Store staff and customers cause many accidents every week. You deal with it one by one or delegate them to store managers.\n\n- Borrow money from banks if you need cash. Watch out the interest rates, though, now that every country has its own GDP growth and bank policy rate.\n\n- As the number of stores grows, store management gets complex. Open offices, hire white-collar workers and create functional departments: Human Resource, Finance, Products, Marketing, Engineering, Executive, and Investment.\n\n- Through the HR division, provides training, recreations, compensations and benefits to employees.\n\n- The Finance now has a cash flow statement, in addition to income statement and balance sheet. Grasp financial details like a pro through realistic statements.\n\n- Conduct city wide marketing campaigns to raise brand awareness.\n\n- The engineering division allows you to develop new online services and applications. They will penetrate globally.\n\n- Hire C-Level executives such as COO, CFO, CTO, CMO… and delegate high levels of responsibility to them. Make sure to incentivize them with stock options and RSUs.\n\n- As a chairman of the board, you can hold a board meeting and discuss your compensation and company’s dividends.\n\n- Work with investment banks and achieve IPO and M&A.\n\n- Through the Investment division, expand your empire into non-coffee businesses such as real estate and stock investment.\n\n- Your personal wealth is now separated from your company’s.\n\n- You can now store your games in iCloud so that you can sync them across your multiple devices.\n\n- As always, no annoying ads."

Mix and match any assortment of characters that you like, set their difficulty from 0-20, then jump right into the action! From your office desk, you will need to manage two side doors, two vents, as well as two air hoses, all of which lead directly into your office.\n\nThis time you will have to master other tools as well if you want to complete the ultimate challenges, tools such as the heater, A/C, a global music box, a power generator, and more. As if all of that weren't enough, you'll also need to set up laser traps in the vents, collect Faz-Coins, purchase items from the Prize Counter, and as always, keep a close eye on not one, but two, Pirate Cove curtains!\n\nOther features also included:\n- Challenge menu including sixteen themed challenges\n- Voice acting from returning favorites as well as from new arrivals to the franchise\n- Unlockable office skins\n- Unlockable cutscenes\n\nNOTE: Game entirely in English.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

Ahoy!\n\nThe Cities and Knights expansion introduces various new gameplay mechanics that add even more variety to Catan. Invest new trade goods in city improvements to build one of the three metropolises of Catan – but beware of the barbarians attracted by Catan’s new wealth! You’ll need your best knights to fend them off! C&K contains a short campaign and 7 challenging maps.\n\nExciting adventures await you in the two new scenarios \"Enchanted Land\" and \"The Great Canal\". Vanquish dragons and bag their treasures or build a canal to help barren grain fields bloom once more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Available languages: English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese\n- Original \"Settlers of Catan\" rule set\n- Update 4.0+: Synchronous online multiplayer games\n- Smart computer opponents with individual strategies\n- Scrollable game board including zoom option \n- Freely combinable game settings \n- Game statistics\n- Comprehensive tutorial\n- Seafarers LITE: New scenario \"The 4 Islands\" and two additional game variants\n- Cities and Knights LITE: Test the new expansion in the scenario “The first Island”\n- 3 different graphic sets to choose from\n\n\n***** \nCatan FAQ: \n\nQuestion: An expansion seems gone after an update or reinstallation of Catan or after restoring the device? \nAnswer: Don’t worry! Your initial purchase is already saved in your iTunes account. You can restore your InApp purchases by selecting the restore-option in the Catan IAP menu. \n\nQuestion: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating or restoring my device. Is there any way to restore it? \nAnswer: When saved games can’t be automatically restored, we’ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter „CatanWarp*“ (* = 1–15) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1–15). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well. \n\nQuestion: Are dice rolls really random? \nAnswer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We’re avid Catan players ourselves. We’ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game! \n\n*****\nQuestions or suggestions for improvements: \nMail to ios@usm.de \nWe are looking forward to your feedback! \n\nFor more information on news and updates: www.usmgames.com \nor visit us on www.facebook.com/UnitedSoftMedia and twitter.com/USM_News \n\n*****"

      "label": "Shattered Pixel Dungeon is a traditional roguelike dungeon crawler RPG that's simple to get into but hard to master! Every game is a unique challenge, with four different heroes, randomized levels and enemies, and hundreds of items to collect and use. ShatteredPD is also updated once every two or three months, so there's always something new.\n\n◀ Choose Your Hero ▶\nEach of ShatteredPD's four playable heroes has their own unique mechanics and gameplay style. Smash some heads as the durable Warrior, fry your enemies as the arcane Mage, or use terrain to your advantage as the stealthy Rogue or the markswoman Huntress!\n\nAs you progress through the dungeon you'll earn points to spend on talents, choose a subclass, and gain powerful lategame abilities. You can turn the Warrior into a combo-building Gladiator, the Mage into a soul-sucking Warlock, the Huntress into a tanky Warden, or explore loads of other possibilities!\n\n◀ Explore the Dungeon ▶\nShatteredPD's dungeon is procedurally generated with random layouts, room types, items, traps, and enemies. In each game you'll find equipment and collect or craft consumable items to power you up or help you out in a pinch. There is a huge variety to what you might see from run to run and region to region.\n\nAs you progress through the dungeon you'll find equipment that can be enchanted, upgraded, and augmented as you outfit your hero. Set foes ablaze with an enchanted weapon, wade through enemies with upgraded armor, or gain powerful damage, defensive, or utility benefits from one of the many wands, rings, or magical artifacts.\n\n◀ Succeed or Die Trying ▶\nThe Dungeon is filled with enemies, traps, hazards, and bosses intent on ending your run! Battle hostile wildlife in the sewers and caves, mad thieves and guards in the prison, occult servants in the fallen dwarven city, and maybe something even worse further down...\n\nAll these hazards can make the game quite tough, but don't be discouraged! You probably won't win on your first try, but there are many tricks and strategies to discover and learn on the path to getting your first win!\n\n◀ Almost A Decade in the Making ▶\nShattered Pixel Dungeon is an open source game based on the source code of Pixel Dungeon by Watabou (first released in 2013). It started in 2014 as a project to rebalance Pixel Dungeon but has steadily grown into its own game over the last 8 years!\n\nFeatures Include:\n• 4 Heroes, each with 2 subclasses, 3 endgame abilities, and over 25 talents.\n• Over 250 items including equipment, consumables, and items crafted via alchemy.\n• 5 dungeon regions, 26 floors, over 100 room types, and trillions of possible floor layouts.\n• Over 60 enemy types, 30 traps, and 5 detailed bosses to test your skills.\n• 9 optional challenges and over 100 achievements for completionists.\n• Interface modes for large and small screens, and support for multiple input types.\n• Updates every 2-3 months with new content, fixes, and improvements.\n• Support for many languages thanks to the game's dedicated communities."

A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nIn this last chapter of the Five Nights at Freddy's original story, you must once again defend yourself against Freddy Fazbear, Chica, Bonnie, Foxy, and even worse things that lurk in the shadows. Playing as a child whose role is yet unknown, you must safeguard yourself until 6am by watching the doors, as well as warding off unwanted creatures that may venture into your closet or onto the bed behind you.\n\nYou have only a flashlight to protect yourself. It will scare away things that may be creeping at the far end of the hallways, but be careful, and listen. If something has crept too close, then shining lights in its eyes will be your end.\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English.

(without anything extra to pay), all with the same Plug commands and features as when hosting on iOS. Just start the world on your other device and then use the App to host that game online!\n\n- Host your own server on iOS without any subscriptions EVER.\n- Full ONLINE MULTIPLAYER (including BlueTooth) - connect in seconds, not minutes like other apps (just check our reviews).\n- Get your own IP address (that's always yours and never changes) to share with your friends, so anyone can connect from any device.\n- Play with anyone, not just Xbox Live friends, and without Live Gold membership - host on our huge network of hundreds of thousands of players.\n\n- Now you can use commands like ‘invisible’, 'kick' and 'ban' in Minecraft and lots more in your OWN Minecraft Server :)\n- Post your server online WITH grief protection! (Prevent use of TNT or any other item or block!) - private AND public servers supported.\n- Play with your friends over BlueTooth when a WiFi connection isn't available.\n- Play multiplayer online on hundreds of Pocketmine servers AND thousands of servers hosted by users just like you :)\n- Make friends, and invite them to play with you.\n\nPlug for Minecraft plugs into Minecraft to give you ‘Bukkit’ style commands in your game.  Plug works in both single AND multiplayer games, so both you as the owner of the world, and players who connect are able to use the commands available.\n\nPlug for Minecraft also adds full ONLINE multiplayer to Minecraft - not just playing with Xbox Live friends.  Now you can play with friends located anywhere in the world AND voice chat with them while you play!  Best of all you can now do this with Windows 10 PCs, Xbox One, virtual reality platforms, and other mobile devices too!!\n \nAll commands are controlled from inside Minecraft chat, just like Plugins on the PC version of Minecraft.\n\nNow you can use commands like ‘invisible’ to hide yourself in worlds.  For example '.in me on' will hide you from all other players :)\n\nIn this version we’ve added an external hosting option. Now you can host any Minecraft games on your network just like you're use to with iOS. This works with Minecraft on Windows 10 PCs, Xbox One, virtual reality platforms, other iOS devices, and other mobile devices - and even Pocketmine servers running on your PC.\n\nPlug is very easy to use, all you have to do is open Minecraft and start a world.  Once in the game use commands by typing them directly into the chat.  For example to show help:  .h\n\nPlug is a world first and no other App exists like it on the App Store.  We are constantly developing it and hope to implement many more exciting things!\n\nV3.00 - As of version 3.00 you now need an internet connection for commands (even if you do not want to play online).  However simple bluetooth connection will work without an internet connection.\n\nDisclaimer – This is a third party App, it is not the game Minecraft or affiliated with the game, its creators, Xbox or Xbox Live in anyway."

I'm Denis, the developer of SiegeUp. I was working on it for the last 4 years, in my free time after work in the beginning, trying now to make this project my main job. My goal is to make a balanced RTS to play on different platforms and bring new players to the genre. I also feel that the concept of walls and sieges has not been fully developed in RTS games. Walls in SiegeUp allow bringing opponents closer to each other while keeping pace and diversifying the landscape. I keep working on updates very actively, according to the plan, 2 more races and tech tree to come by the end of the year. So, wish me good luck!"

      "label": "MISTICO - a small mysterious Spanish island hidden somewhere in the Balearics. You have often heard rumours of its existence, however, actually locating MISTICO has proven rather difficult.\n\nAfter a drunken warm evening in a local bar you overhear some sun weathered locals speaking in Spanish. Picking up some of the words you learnt exploring the local area you decide to eavesdrop in on the conversation.\n\n“¿Estás seguro?”\n\n“¡Sí !, tengo un mapa claro a la isla de mistico.”\n\nAnother man suddenly appears at the entrance of the bar and beckons the men to leave everything and come quickly.\n\nI watched the group arguing outside and they hurriedly jump in a sun battered car and leave. I take one last drag from my bottle and decide it was time to head off myself.\n\nOn the way out I notice the men had left a torn scrap of paper on the table they were seated at. I looked closer and noticed what was written on the paper. I quickly realised what I was looking at, longitude and latitude coordinates, scribbled in pencil. \n\n“Surely not” I thought. “The exact location of MISTICO?”\n\nHiring a local boat, I set off on a journey on the high seas to where the coordinates pinpointed the location of the island. However, the journey didn’t go exactly to plan. Nearing the coordinates I quickly ran into trouble, all I remember was clear blue skies turning black and a strange humming sound. \n\nOpening my eyes, I looked up and saw strange old house in the middle of nowhere….\n\n“Where am I?”\n\nABOUT\n\nMISTCO is a first person point and click adventure, similar to games you may have played in the ’90’s. A simple gameplay interface consisting of the world that you explore and an inventory panel where you can collect, combine and use items you find along the way.\n\nExplore areas, collect hidden objects and take in your surroundings. You will need all of your puzzle solving skills to put together a plan to make your way through the island and down the many paths of escape.\n\nHow you tackle the puzzles is down to you. Each puzzle has a logical solution, so take your time, there is no rush and enjoy the process of understanding what you have to do.\n\nFEATURES\n\n> Easy to play, touch the screen to move around. Use the arrow to move back\n> Use the inventory to collect, combine and use objects\n> Beautiful all original adventure 3D graphics, environments and atmosphere to explore\n> Immersive backing soundtrack and effects to pull you into the adventure\n> Automatic saving when you complete an area - Use the ‘Continue’ button on the main menu to pick up where you left off\n\nSMALL PRINT\n\nMISTICO was created from the imagination of a solo indie developer. \n\n“I am always excited to hear people playing my games and their experience along the way. Adventure gaming is my passion and your feedback helps my games get better.“\n\nMISTICO is compatible will all devices and has been designed to be as resource efficient as possible to allow play on many different devices. With that said, if you do run into any difficulties please email so I can provide updates that help everyone enjoy the adventure."

      "label": "The concept of the mental focus grid has been in existence for many years - as a tool/exercise used by coaches and sports performance/psychology professionals to assess and improve performance of their athletes.  \n\nThe objective of the concentration grid exercise is to select in sequence each of the numbers (randomly arranged and presented) in the grid.  Performance is timed.  The challenge is to complete the grid as quickly as possible.  The exercise calls for focus and concentration. \n\nThe concentration grid exercise has been a long-time favorite of many baseball/softball coaches and players (typically using printed/paper sheets, a pen and a stopwatch).  \n\nCoaches/sports performance staff and athletes now can do mental skills training work (and save paper) by using the Concentration Grid app on their mobile device.\n\nThe Concentration Grid app is intended to provide competitive challenge and a fun experience that is simple and straightforward ... like the printed paper grid exercise - but more convenient.  \n\nNothing fancy.  Nothing distracting.  Nothing flashy.  Only the grid.  Numbers.  Black. White. Red.  No on-screen timer or visible ticking clock.  \n\nFocus.  Concentration.\n\nWith the Concentration Grid app the level and nature of the challenge can be varied by changing the size of the grid - by selecting the number of rows and columns for the grid.  \n\nGrids can be generated in a variety of sizes - from 3 columns/rows to 14 columns/rows.  (A grid does not have to have the same number of rows and columns.)  More rows/columns, more numbers.  More numbers, more time.\n\nTry a 3x3 grid ... a 3x14 grid ... a 7x7 grid ... a 7x10 grid ... a 10x10 grid .... a 10x14 grid ... a 14x14 grid.   You get the idea.\n\nThe standard is a 10x10 grid - which a focused grid master should be able to complete in under 4 minutes.\n\nOther benchmarks ...\nA 3x3 grid can be completed in about 3 seconds.\nA 5x5 grid might be completed in under 15 seconds.\nA 7x7 grid can be completed by a master in well under a minute.\nA 9x9 grid might be completed in 3 minutes.\nA 14x14 grid will take well over 10 minutes to complete.\n\nTest yourself:  Can you complete a 6x6 grid in under 30 seconds? \n\nSmaller grids will call for dexterity and quick vision as well as focus/concentration.\n\nLarger grids will challenge your ability to sustain focus/concentration ... your mental stamina is put to the test.\n\nChallenge yourself with Concentration Grid.  Track and measure your improvement as you practice.  Then compare your best grid times against the best grid times of teammates and others ... who is the fastest?  Who is a master of the grid?  (Coaches and teachers can set up intrasquad competitions/tournaments to find out.)\n\nPractice makes perfect.   Sustained attention and effort are rewarded with improved performance/times in the grid exercise.\n\nThe grid exercise can be practiced in quiet places/at home or during road trips or during school/practices ... or under loud/distracting (game day) conditions.  Parents/teachers might have their children/students use the exercise regularly to practice and improve concentration ability.  In a world filled with distractions, anyone can use Concentration Grid to practice focus skills. \n\nThe Concentration Grid app will provide your grid time (elapsed time to complete the grid exercise) as well as a GRID_ID data set that includes additional information about your performance.  The app will also maintain a history/file for you to monitor your performance/improvement.  \n\nAnd Concentration Grid includes a SHARE feature which will allow you to share/post your grid times and screenshots on social media or to a leaderboard (community site).\n\nThe Concentration Grid app is perfect for coaches, athletes, students, teachers/educators, sports performance/psychology staff, parents, children, adults - young and old ....\n\nChallenge yourself.  Make self-development a daily habit.  \n\nWebsite - www.concentrationgrid.com\nCommunity - www.concentrationgrid.net"

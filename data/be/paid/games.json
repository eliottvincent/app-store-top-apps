      "label": "With 20 millions of downloads worldwide Real Drift Car Racing is the most realistic drift game on mobile devices, and yet easy to control and fun to play thanks to an innovative drift helper.\r\nGet ready to drive high performance cars (turbo or naturally aspirated) and make them drift at high speed in tracks designed specifically for drift racing.\r\nImprove your racing and drifting skills and earn virtual money to tune and customize your car.\r\nRace to battle the world record of the leaderboard or just for fun in the freeride mode.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n• The most realistic drift racing simulation on mobile devices;\r\n• Customizable difficulty: from total novice to professional drifter;\r\n• Extensive customization options: change body color, body vinyl, rims model, rims color and tire signature;\r\n• Extensive tuning options: increase engine power, add a turbo, change handling settings (weight distribution, camber angle etc.), change gear ratios and shift speed;\r\n• Photo mode to share your coolest drifts with your friends;\r\n• Realistic simulation of all aspect (engine, drivetrain, tires, etc.) of the car;\r\n• Specific engine sound for every car with turbo whistle and blow off valve;\r\n• Backfire effects with sounds;\r\n• Accurate points calculation: earn points by drifting at high speed, at high drift angle and, by light touching walls during a drift;\r\n• Online and local leaderboard to challenge your friends and people all over the world;\r\n• Big training track to improve your drifting and racing skills;\r\n• Cool dubstep soundtrack by Liquid Stranger and Simplify Recordings.\r\n• 35 racing tracks specifically designed for drifting;\r\n• 19 different cars with specific and realistic setup;\r\n• Challenging career mode with 38 championships with growing difficulty;\r\n\r\n\r\nGAMEPLAY\r\n• Accelerometer (gyroscope) or touch steering mode;\r\n• Slider or touch throttle;\r\n• Automatic or manual transmission;\r\n• Metric or Imperial units of measurement;\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANCED POINTS SYSTEM\r\nPoints grow proportionally to drift angle, drift time and speed.\r\nThere are also 2 different points multiplier: \"Drift Combo\" multiplier and \"Proximity\" multiplier.\r\nDrift Combo multiplier is increased by 1 whenever points reach a power of 2000 (1000, 2000,4000, 8000 etc.). If you change drift direction, points are added to Total Points Indicator (located in the top left of the screen) and reset. If points reach every multiple of 2000 again, Drift Combo is increased by 1 again. This works only if you keep drifting without too long interruptions between one drift and the other (less than 1 second), otherwise Drift Combo multiplier will be reset to 1.\r\nProximity multiplier is increased when you drift with the back of the car near a wall (less than 1.5 meters) proportionally to closeness. You'll notice this bonus with a slow motion effect and a text showing the multiplier factor.\r\nIf you hit anything you'll lose your partial points and all multipliers.\r\n\r\nWe will update and improve Real Drift constantly. Please rate and give your feedback for further improvement of the game.\r\nFOLLOW US\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Real-Drift/788082697884714"

The game generates these colors from the colored materials you add to your Arty Games profile such as paint and color pencils. You can also add Markers by brand (Copic, Mepxy, ProMarker, Prismacolor or 'Other') and build your materials from the official colors and sets for each brand! That way you can Play games like the 3-marker challenge without messing up your collection of markers!\n\n2 - CHARACTER CHALLENGE\nThe Character Challenge generates random combinations of Character Designs and Scenarios for you to draw. These can turn out funny, or epic – and there are billions of combinations to be explored!\n\n3 - ENVIRONMENT CHALLENGE\nThe Environment Challenge generates a scene for you to draw based in either an Interior or Exterior environment.\n\n4 - INCREMENTAL DESIGN\nIn the Incremental Design challenge, you draw a character’s head or body in 5 stages which are revealed one by one, so you won’t know what the final design will be until the very end – surprises lie in store!\n\n5 - SCRIBBLE CHALLENGE\nThe scribble Challenge generates a random doodle for you to copy down and turn into a work of art.\n\n6 - COPY CHALLENGE\nIn the Copy challenge, you are given an image to reproduce as closely as possible, which will help your observation and drawing skills, and can be a good warm-up to a drawing session too!\n\n7 - DESIGN MIX\nThe Design Mix challenge presents you with two random items which you must thematically or aesthetically combine in a creative way.\n\n8 - CUSTOM GENERATOR\nThe Custom Generator allows you to build your own lists to generate ideas and games from. The possibilities are LITERALLY endless!\n\nIf you’re really up for a challenge, you can start an Arty Party!\n\nARTY PARTY MODE:\nThis mode is great to challenge yourself in, or play with a group of friends. Simply select the number of challenges you want to play and the level of intensity – (be warned, 'Intense' is named that for a reason!), and after you pick the games you want to be included, hit GO and get ready for a mashup of insane challenges that will test the skill of even the most experienced artists.\n\nCREDITS and THANKS:\nJosiah (Jazza) Brooks - App design, lead development, art and animation addict/maker\nKate Taylor Marsden - Business manager, administration, shop overlord\nRobert Coulter (Kazilik) - Code and app development, destroyer of worlds\nSteelribs and Dungeonkills - Data sorting and gathering mega-super awesome assistants!

      "label": "NOTE: Remastered version from the PC version. A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English. Subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

      "label": "In an alternate reality in 1920s Europa, it's been several years since the \"\"Great War\"\", but the ashes of the conflict are still hot and the war is entering a new phase. The first conflict saw the emergence of some incredible engines of war known as Mechs. Built by \"\"The Factory\"\", an independent city-state which has since become the object of everyone's desire, these technological monstrosities roam the snowy landscapes of Europa. Be the hero of one of the five factions – Saxony Empire, Crimean Khanate, Rusviet Union, Polania Republic or Nordic Kingdom – and become the richest and most powerful nation in all of Europa during these dark times! To assure the victory of your people, you will need to explore and conquer new territories, enlist new recruits and deploy your forces by building formidable and terrifying combat Mechs. Replay history in a fictional past full of mechanical engines and technology, where each choice you make will be critical. Choose your battles with care, because in Scythe, victory is achieved with and for the people!\n\nGameplay: \n- Asymmetry: every player starts the game with different resources (energy, coins, keen combat sense, popularity…), a different starting location and a secret objective. The starting positions are specifically set to contribute to the uniqueness of every faction and the asymmetrical nature of the game.\n- Strategy: Scythe offers players almost complete control over their fate. The only elements of chance apart from each player's individual secrete objective card are the Encounter cards, which players draw to interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Combat is also handled by way of choice; no luck or chance is involved.\n- Engine Building: Players can improve their construction abilities to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits into their faction, activate mechs to dissuade opponents from invading and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. This aspect creates a feeling of energy and progression over the course of the entire game. The order in which players get to develop their economy and technologies adds to the unique feel of every game, even when playing as the same faction several times.\n\nFeatures:\n•\tOfficial adaptation of the award-winning board game\n•\t4X strategy game (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate) \n•\tCustomize the mat to sharpen your strategy\n•\tChoose a specialty for unique games: Agriculturalist, Industrialist, Engineer, Patriot or Mechanic. \n•\tFight alone against an AI, face your friends in Hotseat or face opponents from all over the world in Online Mode\n•\tCheck out artistic genius Jakub Rozalski's retro-futuristic illustrations!\n\nDiscover new challenges with the Invaders from Afar expansion!\r\n\r\nWhile empires rise and fall in Eastern Europa, the rest of the world takes notice, and covets the secrets of the Factory. Two distant factions, Albion and Togawa, send out their emissaries to scout the land and plan their best strategy for conquest. They will all lead their mechs to war, but who will come out victorious?\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Play as one of the two new redoubtable factions, Clan Albion and The Togawa Shogunate, and use their mechs with their unique abilities\r\n- Two new player mats: Militant and Innovative\r\n- Now up to 7 players!\n\nPlease note that Scythe: Digital Edition app requires a device with a minimum of 2GB Ram"

      "label": "In a land far, far away there once was a vast continent called Milton. It was a land where the power of rule came by the sword and the arcane, where Men who devoted themselves to the blade or to magecraft, could become the finest warriors, wisest wizards or the greatest adventurers. In this land, there are several kingdoms divided by borders but united through history. Countless stories of alliances, upheaval, and moments of peace bedeck this tapestry, but that is a tale for another day. \n\nOur story begins in a remote kingdom to the north, Iblis, an obscure and oft-forgotten place. It is a wild and barren land, a place where its people scrape a living from the earth, mining minerals for the lords of the south. On occasion, adventurers would stop by for the night but never linger. Until one day, a fledgling adventurer lost his way and stumbled into a hole. The story might have ended then had he not come back, but return he did, with sacks of gold and glittering treasure. \n\nLike a fierce gale from the north, news of his fame and fortune fanned across the kingdoms overnight, and kings sent their bravest warriors and adventurers to clear the cavern of monsters in search of treasure. Even peasants wanting a part of this newfound wealth partook in these expeditions. In no time at all, a bustling town had sprung up in this forgotten place. People set up camps, and formed their own groups to explore the cave. Clever merchants not missing this opportunity, built taverns and shops near the cave, selling equipment and potions to eager adventurers. At first, everything seemed fine. As explorers delved into the caves, they encountered new creatures and discovered new treasures. Mysteries continued to pour forth from the cave, yet nobody knew where the source of the secrets lay. However, as the explorations continued, the balance of wealth beyond the cave began to waver, and cracks appeared among those adventurers who had previously worked arm-in-arm. The latecomers or weak, limited to wandering the upper levels of the cave, could only watch as the veteran adventurers brought treasure after treasure from the deep. They began harboring dark thoughts as they watched the veteran adventurers grow arrogant from their largesse, ordering people around, hoarding secrets from the rest. The place became a festering pool of suspicions and greed, mired in a jealous rage. \n\nIt started with an adventurer disappearing in the cave. Rumors circulated he had found some legendary treasure and hoarded it for himself. Others said he had been guided to another world by some mysterious magic force in the cave. Still, the unspoken belief was that he had been murdered by a rival party and was buried somewhere beneath the caverns. Nobody knows exactly what happened, but people have continued to disappear ever since. As more people have gone missing, some adventurers have called it quits, others cling to hope, and a few continue to wait and see. Which brings us to you, an ordinary young man, coming into this extraordinary circumstance with purposes unknown to others. May you find what you seek in ...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nIn \" The Greedy Cave\", you are a brave adventurer tasked with exploring a mysterious cave and battling all kinds of monsters.\n\nUse your wits to defeat them, learn different skills, gain mighty equipment, challenge evil monster bosses, and decipher the mystery surrounding this cave...\n\nGame Features\n·Randomly generated cave levels provide a different game experience every time!                     \n·Hundreds of monsters to defeat!\n·Hundreds of equipment to collect!\n·Hundreds of quests and achievements to conquer!\n·Enchant/Reform/Level up/Gold collecting, and more abundant systems to explore!\n\nContact us\ncs.thegreedycave@avalongames.com\nhttps://www.facebook.com/greedycave/"

One Deck Dungeon lets you jump right in to bashing down doors, rolling dice, and squashing baddies with style. Get a full roguelike game experience, boiled down to its essence, and captured in a single deck of cards and a handful of dice!\n\nOne Deck Dungeon is a dungeon crawling adventure game for one or two players. Each time you play, choose one or two of these 6 brave heroes:\n\n• Mage - There's rarely a problem in the dungeon she can't solve with a spell.\n• Warrior - Her favorite dungeon activity is squashing her opponents immediately.\n• Rogue - Watch in awe as she dispatches monsters with style.\n• Archer - Accurate, brilliant, catastrophically deadly.\n• Paladin - She seeks out danger and shields her allies from deadly enemies.\n• Mist - This breach mage has crossed over from the world of Aeon's End to help defend Mynerva. Learn more at AeonsEndDigital.com!\n\nAfter every game, your heroes make progress toward unlocking up to 15 new talents, building up their power for future games.\n\nThere are 5 dangerous challenges to face:\n\n• Dragon’s Cave - The thick-skinned wyvern who occupies this dungeon prefers her heroes on the crispy side.\n• Yeti’s Cavern- If you can survive the freezing winds and biting cold, an abominable snowman awaits.\n• Hydra’s Reef - Chop off one head, and another appears! This regenerating venomous monstrosity is a slippery foe.\n• Lich’s Tomb - Hordes of undead foes, evil curses, and magical wards. What could possibly go wrong?\n• Minotaur’s Maze - Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!\n\nMore content is available via In App Purchase:\n\nThe Forest of Shadows expansion doubles the content in the game. It features adventures in all-new lush yet deadly locales. A vast network of mossy underground tunnels and connected forest areas await your heroes! \n• 5 new heroes - Alchemist, Druid, Hunter, Slayer, & Warden\n• 5 new dungeons - Lair of Indrax, The Mudlands, Realm of Venom, Smoldering Ruins, & The Vile Roots\n• A complete new 44-card encounter deck\n• Additional progression focuses, basic skills, potions, & more!\n\nThe Abyssal Depths expansion adds a new kind of threat: Fiends who hound you throughout your entire quest to reach the boss. It includes 6 different Fiends, each with two levels of difficulty. Plus, 2 new aquatic heroes join the fight in the murky waters!\n\nIndividual expansion cards:\n• Caliana - This faerie has decided that dungeoneering looks fun! Don't let her get bored...\n• Fanatic - A righteous Sentinel is here to smite evil wherever it may lurk!\n• Witch - Her chaotic magic hammer is ready to smash glooping oozes into glooping puddles!\n• Cinder Plains - The Hellhound awaits those reckless enough to venture here...\n• Phoenix's Den - Only the bravest heroes can handle the heat!\n\nOnce you know your way around the dungeon, a game takes about 15 minutes. It might take a little longer if you're learning, or a lot shorter if you jump into a pit of spikes.\n\nWarning: do not jump into a pit of spikes.\n\nAll cards in One Deck Dungeon have many colorful boxes. Roll your dice, and attempt to fill in as many boxes as possible. For every one you don't fill, you’ll suffer consequences in hearts and time! Once you complete an encounter you'll be able to learn a new skill, acquire a new item, or gain experience to level up your hero.\n\nWelcome to the world of One Deck Dungeon. Adventure awaits!\n\nOne Deck Dungeon is an officially licensed product of “One Deck Dungeon” from Asmadi Games.\n\nFor more information on One Deck Dungeon, check out OneDeckDigital.com"

      "label": "Things get messy when you’re stuck running a wildly popular pizza parlor in Papa’s Pizzeria To Go! Top, bake, and serve pizzas in this award-winning game that’s reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.\n\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the pizzeria, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Topping Station to add a variety of toppings to each pizza.  Move to the Bake Station to cook the pizzas in the oven until they're baked just right.  Jump to the Cutting Station to cut the pizza into perfect slices.  Each station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the pizza-building process.\n\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Pizzeria!  A well-crafted pizza also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\n\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S PIZZERIA TO GO **\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers don't get in the way of the action!\n\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\n\nTOPPING STATION - We've completely redesigned the Topping Station for smaller screens.  Bins of toppings can be scrolled with your thumb, which allows us to have many more toppings than in the original game.  Tap on a bin to select that topping, then tap multiple times on the pizza to add items directly onto the pizza.  You don't need to drag individual toppings onto the pizza, so you can top faster than ever!  A quick swipe on the pizza will send it off the to the Bake Station.\n\nBAKE STATION - Papa Louie's coal-fired oven gets an upgrade!  You can buy new Oven Alarms in the Shop to help you keep track of pizzas in the oven.  Simply drag an alarm onto one of the oven timers, and you'll hear an alert when that pizza is cooked just right.  Buy new Oven Boosters to cook your pizzas even faster than before!\n\nCUTTING STATION - When it's time to cut pizzas, simply touch and drag a line across the pizza to decide where to cut.  If you want even more control to fine-tune your slices, you can also cut using multi-touch!  Use two fingers or thumbs to move each end of the line at the same time, and release to slice your pizza.  If you're having trouble cutting pizzas at the right angle, buy a variety of Cutting Guides in the Shop to cut that perfect slice!\n\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients which can't be found in the original Papa's Pizzeria.  As you play the game, you'll unlock 26 unique ingredients to serve your customers!\n\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR LOBBY - You can spend your hard-earned tips in the Shop, where you can find a variety of posters, furniture, and wallpaper styles for your lobby!  Use the brand-new Lobby tool to add items to your restaurant, and move and arrange them however you like!  Choose from over 140 customization items, and every item you add to the lobby will improve your Waiting Score for your customers!\n\nUPDATED FEATURES - Serve picky closers at the end of the day, earn paychecks as you play, and try to please the finicky Food Critic to earn a Blue Ribbon!\n\n**GAME FEATURES**\n\nHands-on pizza shop in the Papa Louie universe\nAll new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\nMulti-task between topping, baking, and cutting\nShop to buy upgrades, furniture, and posters using your in-game tips\nNew Lobby Editor to customize and decorate your shop\n90 customers to unlock with unique orders\nChallenging Closers and Food Critic\n75 in-game achievements to earn\n\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens."

      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.

And you don't just play with them, you can also talk to them via built-in voice chat.\n\n\nBEAUTY IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER - GAME BOARDS\nWe didn't just strive to make a good AI and fluid gameplay, we also made it our mission to make it look good. No, not just good... we wanted to make them look drop dead gorgeous good. We found a skilled designer and then tortured him with feedback until we were satisfied. The result are two boards (metal and wood) which look awesome, while providing little visual distraction to let you focus on your strategy. And for those who love a little distraction, we let the designer run wild with a selection of (optional) fancy boards, rich with decor and beautiful details. Which one is your favorite?\n\n\nAAAND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BOARD, A MULTIPLE OLYMPIC CHAMPION AI - BEEE GEEEE BLITZ\nFrom time to time there is an olympic tournament for backgammon programs. We managed to convince the maker of the three times winner BGBlitz to make his AI available to the users of True Backgammon. This AI is a world class opponent for those who only want to match up against the best. And it is a patient mentor. BGBlitz offers a tutor mode, that will point out moves that are less than optimal, and it will show better ones.\n\nWHAT ELSE CAN WE SAY? \nLong story short, we put a lot of effort into this app, not just into the game play, but on every level. If you choose it, we are sure you will not be disappointed."

After you apply for a job as the barista of Papa's Mocharia, you learn that a year-long film is being made about the coffeehouse -- and you're now the main star!  Under the watchful eye of the documentary crew, you'll be brewing espresso, steaming and frothing milk, and crafting eye-catching layered drinks for your picky customers.  Work your way through the holidays as you serve seasonal coffee and cannoli, unlock new ingredients, and earn Daily Specials with delicious latte and macchiato recipes.\n\n-- GAME FEATURES --\n\nBREW ESPRESSO AND LAYER DRINKS - Use the Brew Machines to make freshly-brewed shots of espresso, and to steam and froth milk for the customers' drinks.  On the Build Station, you'll layer the espresso and milk into a large cup along with colorful powders and flavored syrups, creating a delicious layered latte that looks as great as it tastes!  Complete the drink with toppings, whips, and drizzles for that finishing touch.\n\nCRAFTING CANNOLI - Customers will order a custom-made cannoli along with their Papaccino drinks.  Choose the cannoli shell, line up the nozzles to pipe it full of cream, and garnish the cannoli with delicious toppings for the perfect sweet treat to enjoy with a coffee.\n\nHOLIDAY FLAVORS - Celebrate the seasons with delicious holiday flavors!  As you reach new ranks, the seasons and holidays in New Pepperton will change, and your customers will start ordering holiday-themed drinks and cannoli.

      "label": "After a lengthy radio silence, Taylor returns at last! This brand new adventure finds the hapless astronaut on the other side of a black hole, relying on you alone to help make life-or-death decisions in a playable, branching story of survival in the depths of unknown space.\n \nBut this time, there’s a twist: Players can also choose to communicate with T2, Taylor’s time-warped, alien-infected “evil twin,” helping or hindering as they see fit. Throughout the story, seemingly simple decisions can have profound effects. Make choices using your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch, and face the consequences alongside the desperate astronauts.\n \nWriter Dave Justus (Fables: The Wolf Among Us) returns to pen this fourth Taylor adventure -- the seventh overall in the acclaimed, multi-million-selling Green Series. Whether this is your first interaction with Taylor, or you’ve been a diehard fan from the beginning, you’ll discover a deep, immersive story of survival and perseverance, with many possible outcomes.\n \nThe original Lifeline took the App Store by storm -- reaching #1 Top Paid Game on iPhone and Apple Watch in 29 countries -- while pioneering a new narrative experience enabled by modern devices. This story plays out in real time as the astronauts work to stay alive, with notifications delivering new messages throughout your day. Keep up as they come in, or catch up later when you’re free. You can even respond to Taylor or T2 directly from your Apple Watch or your iPhone lock screen, without launching into the app.\n \nOr, dive in and jump back to earlier points in the story, and discover what happens when you make a different choice. Complete any single path to restart the story and unlock this mode.\n \nThe story contains no in-app purchases and no ads. An internet connection is not required. \n \nPraise for the original Lifeline:\n\n“I’ve played many games that I find engrossing, but Lifeline may be one of the first that changed the way I thought about my daily routine, which leapt off the screen and became a part of my lived experience.” - Eli Cymet, Gamezebo\n\n“I felt an immediate attachment to a fictional character pinging me from a strange galaxy to my wearable.” - Luke Hopewell, Gizmodo Australia\n\n“For a few brief hours I cared – really cared – about the fate of a completely fictional character. I don’t think any other game I’ve played has made me feel that way before.” - Matt Thrower, PocketGamer\n\nLifeline: Beside You in Time was created by:\nDave Justus\nMars Jokela\nColin Liotta\nCrystal Silva\nMatt Burchstead\n\nMusic by Rose Azerty\n\nIn loving memory of William Justus, my lifelong lifeline. Hope you dig this one, dad."

It follows the life of the doctors' new patient, Colin, as they attempt to unravel a life that is split down the middle, and fulfill a wish that appears to be self-contradictory by nature.\n\nDr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts have peculiar jobs: They give people another chance to live, all the way from the very beginning... but only in their patients' heads.\n\nDue to the severity of the operation, the new life becomes the last thing the patients remember before drawing their last breath. Thus, the operation is only done to people on their deathbeds, to fulfill what they wish they had done with their lives, but didn’t.\n\n*Like To the Moon, this is a standalone full game that does not require having played any previous games in the series.\n\nLanguages Supported: \n* English \n* Français \n* Deutsch \n* Español (Latinoamérica) \n* Español (Europa) \n* Português \n* Polski\n* lingua italiana (Italian)\n* Người việt nam\n* русский(Russian)\n* 한국어 (Korean) \n* 简体中文 (Simplified Chinese) \n* 繁體中文 (Traditional Chinese) \n* 日本語 (Japanese)\n* Türk dili(Turkish)\n* Українська（Ukraine）\n* Magyar（Hungarian）\n* català（Catalan）\n* čeština（Czech）"

Move your thumb on the piano-like keyboard and tap the selection cards. \n\n- STARTING HANDS EXPECTED VALUE: Even more important than your chance to win, this indicator corresponds to what you can expect as average gain/loss from your current situation (Pocket cards + number of players + position). By this way, you can accurately know the value of your current situation and play accordingly.\n\n- NUMBER OF OUTS ON FLOP AND ON TURN: This screen has been made to avoid you any headache while counting the outs.

In a few seconds, you will get your chance to win or tie against a set of representative pocket cards (between 30 to 70 pairs depending on the board and your own pocket cards). Those pairs are identified thanks to a powerful algorithm. You can then sub-select the groups of cards you are interested in, whether it should be the \"top starting hands\", straight draws, flush draws, ... or any combination of your choice. This feature is really powerful, especially for high stakes games, when you want to know your chance against the cards you think your opponent might have.\n\n- ODDS AGAINST 1 TO SEVEN KNOWN OPPONENT POCKET CARDS. This feature could be used after the game, once you really know your opponent cards, or to build some scenario and enrich your own experience."

      "label": "Finally, the \"casual\" card game with cult factor is now also playable as an app.\n\nEvery llama knows the most important rule of all: Discard all minus points! \nGet rid of your cards so as not to collect any chips. Do you fold, or do you hope to draw a suitable card? Decide! At the end, the winner is the one who could most casually avoid the minus points.\n\nReiner Knizia's multi-award-winning card game impresses with its simple rules and great fun:\n-Each player receives six hand cards.\n-Whoever's turn it is lays down a card. This card must be equal to or one higher than the top card of the discard pile.\n-You can also draw a card or pass and thus fold.\n-The round ends when one player discards all cards or all players have passed.\n-For hand cards or cards that a player still has after passing, there are minus points in the form of chips.\n-Whoever has got rid of all cards may hand in a 1 or 10 chip again.\n-After several rounds, the player with the fewest minus points wins.\n\nBut the app contains even more: The two spin-offs \"LAMA Party Edition\" and \"LAMA Dice\" are also included.These follow the same simple basic principles as the basic game, but offer new game elements and thus even more variety. Play all 3 modes with up to 5 AI opponents or with friends and family via Pass & Play. Of course, you can also mix both in one game.\n\nAs a special bonus, the completely new solo mode for \"LAMA Dice\" is included as a world premiere. Set yourself the special challenge of achieving the best possible result. To achieve the highest possible scores, however, you must first unlock the 3rd level by achieving good results in the previous levels. If you succeed in this, the way to the top of the global high score list is open to you!\n\nHighlights:\n\n- 3 games in one app\n- 4 game modes with separate scores\n- Single-user challenges in 3 difficulty levels\n- Compete with players from all over the world in weekly high score lists for all 4 game modes\n- Collect Achievements \n\nAwards:\n2019 Game of the Year nominee\n2020 GamesExpo Award in the \"best children's game\" category"

      "label": "CHILD SAFETY\n\nPloppy Pairs, a colorful fun memory game for everyone, is designed with your child's safety in mind. In addition to Apple's guidelines for children's games, we go one step further and firmly believe that any data about your children belongs exclusively to you and your children and should stay that way. Therefore, Ploppy Pairs does not store any of your children's data! There are additional security mechanisms in place to prevent your child from being routed out of the app while playing. This means that as soon as a link is called up, such as to rate the game, a short math problem must be solved beforehand. Furthermore, the game is also designed for the blind, colorblind and children who can't read yet.\nSo, if you are looking for a game that you can give to your children without hesitation, where they can also train their memory, then download Ploppy Pairs now! :)\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nA fun card matching game for everyone! What makes Ploppy Pairs special is the SharePlay functionality, which lets you play with friends and family together via FaceTime and makes you feel as if you are all in the same place.\n\nThere are various theme-based levels with difficulties from 4 up to 70 cards, which makes the game a great fun way to train the memory skills for all ages! Each level unlocks a new skin by reaching the best score possible. The score is dependent of the amount of needed turns.\n\nTry it out by downloading the App Clip with one level for free on the iPhone and iPad.\n\nHOW TO PLAY\n\nEach level starts with a randomized faced down set of cards. Tap a card to flip it and memorize its image. If the next tapped card's image matches the first one, the cards stay faced up, otherwise they will be covered up again. Keep doing so until all of the cards are matched to finish the level.\n\nHow to use SharePlay\n\nWhen you open the game while you are on a FaceTime call, an additional button will be next to the restart button within the game. Tap it to start the SharePlay session. All other participants will be notified about the newly started session. A popup will show up where they can either join the session if they have Ploppy Pairs already installed, or download it if it is not installed yet. As soon as one player flips a card, it will also flip on all the other participant's devices. The same behaviour appears for opening/closing the map and restarting/switching the level - all other interactions will only happen locally on the players device itself. The overlaying video window can be dragged to the specific placeholder position at the top left of the game and can be resized by pinching gestures. The shared gameplay is meant to be cooperative and not as one against the other, which means to communicate with each other as soon as someone knows a match and letting them flip the cards. A player can exit the session by tapping the previous mentioned SharePlay button again. \n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Play together via SharePlay during FaceTime calls\n- Kids-friendly designed - can be played by everyone even the youngest ones who cannot read yet\n- Five different themes with 30 levels overall\n- Different difficulties from 4 up to 70 cards\n- Endless gameplay by randomized cards\n- One level for trying out the game for free via App Clip\n- Unlockable skins in each level\n- Sticker Pack included - share the Ploppies with family and friends via iMessage\n- No advertisements or in-app purchases within the game\n- Offline playable\n\nAvailable on iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple TV."

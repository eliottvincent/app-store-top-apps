      "label": "What is WikiFarms Australia?\n\nWikiFarms Australia is the essential application for backpackers looking for a farm job in Australia. Whether you are looking for a casual job during your trip or aiming to complete your 88 days of farm work to get your Second Year Visa, WikiFarms Australia will be your guide!\nThe application will help you to be in direct contact with farmers by making available a map with thousands of farms around Australia!\nThe database is always growing and constantly being updated by our team: companies are added weekly, contacts are regularly verified, making it the largest database for fruit picking jobs in Australia! With more than 2000 companies listed in the app you’ll have all the information you need to find a farm job quickly.\n\n \nSo do not wait to get the best farm job tool available in Australia!\n\n \nWhat can I do with the app?\n\nWikiFarms Australia makes it easy to find a farm. Simply use the map screen to see exactly where are located the farms. Then tap a site to bring up its description. It will show you the name of the company, type of crops, phone number, and, for some of them, website and email. You can then call the farmers directly from the app and ask them if they need workers. If you are ready to go, you can also start an itinerary from your current location and ask them in person!\n\nThe app also allows you to use filters. If you are looking to work in a specific area or to pick a specific type of fruit during a specific time, you can do that!\n\nThe app lists also tons of working hostels, tourism offices, working agencies that can give you more information or help to find a job in a specific area.\n\nWith the app you can also calculate your 88 days of farm work easily and see if you’re ready to apply for the Second (or Third soon!) Year Visa.\n\n \nWho made WikiFarms Australia?\n\nFellow backpackers like you created WikiFarms Australia! When we were looking for farm work to get our Second Year Visa, we really struggled knowing where to look for farms! There was some information here and there but nothing really consistent. This is when we started to think about a tool that will have all the farmers at once and WikiFarms Australia started just like that J\n\n \nWhy is the app not free?\n\nWe are a very small team working on this project for more than 2 years! As a result, the profit of the app really helps us to make it better day after day. In addition, it also contributes to our travelling passion (which we are sure that if you are here you can relate!)\n\nIn addition, you certainly think that most apps are free, but are they really? Most of the time, free apps are full of unwanted and annoying ads and you often have to pay more to have the full use of it.\n\nWe made the choice to offer a complete, advertising-free experience for as low of a price as we could make it. Consider that half the price you pay for it goes to taxes and Google share.\n\nThe application helps you get what you need the most, find a farm job, and when you will get it, its price will be covered in less than half an hour of work!\n\nThanks for your purchase and we hope that you’ll have a good experience with our app!\n\n \nFeel free to join us on our Facebook page or to visit our website:\nhttps://wikifarmsaustralia.com/\n\n \nAre you a farmer looking for workers? You can contact us at: info.wikifarms@gmail.com\nWe will answer you within 24h."

The distance will count down as you approach your destination.\n5) Tap the button next to the distance to open the photo location on a map or copy the coordinates.\n\nKeep in mind this app only works with photos that have EXIF location data. Not all apps save location data with photos, and the Camera app will only save location data if you have granted it access to your location.\n\nThis app also relies on the accuracy of your device's GPS and compass sensors, as well as the accuracy of location and altitude data when the photo was taken. There can be significant error in all these measurements, so accuracy of the app is limited by these factors. Photo Find works best for navigating outdoors to photos that were taken outdoors with good GPS reception."

The timer counts either up or down, and will display an alert when reaching zero.\r\n\r\n27 AVIATION FUNCTIONS\r\n \r\n-Pressure & Density Altitude\r\n-Planned True Airspeed\r\n-Heading and Groundspeed\r\n-Compass Heading\r\n-Leg Time\r\n-Fuel Required\r\n-Crosswind, Headwind and Tailwind\r\n-Cloud Base and Freezing Level\r\n-Actual True Airspeed\r\n-Actual True Altitude\r\n-Wind Speed and Direction\r\n-Groundspeed\r\n-Planned Mach Number\r\n-Required True Airspeed\r\n-Required Calibrated Airspeed\r\n-Distance Flown\r\n-Endurance\r\n-Fuel per Hour\r\n-Actual Mach Number\r\n-Percent Mean Aerodynamic Chord (MAC)\r\n-Hydroplane Speed\r\n-Required Rate of Climb\r\n-Specific Range\r\n-Pivotal Altitude\r\n-Top of Descent\r\n-Required Rate of Descent\r\n-Glide Distance\r\n\r\n22 AVIATION CONVERSIONS\r\n \r\n-Celsius :: Fahrenheit\r\n-Nautical Miles :: Statute Miles\r\n-Nautical Miles :: Kilometers\r\n-Feet :: Meters\r\n-Pounds :: Kilograms\r\n-Avgas Gallons :: Pounds\r\n-Jet A Gallons :: Pounds\r\n-Gallons :: Liters\r\n-Hours/Minutes/Seconds :: Hours\r\n-Climb FT/NM :: Climb Percent\r\n-Climb FT/NM :: Climb Degrees\r\n\r\nCALCULATOR\r\n \r\n-Perform basic math without having to exit the application\r\n\r\nCLOCK/TIMER\r\n \r\n-Simultaneous tracking of Zulu, Home and Local time zones\r\n-Advanced timer counts up or down and operates independently so you can perform other calculations while the timer is running\r\n-Upon reaching zero in the countdown mode, a message will display no matter what app is active  – a useful feature for missed approaches, switching fuel tanks, etc."

We bieden kaarten aan van:\n\n- OpenStreetMaps\n- GMaps\n- OSM HikeBike\n\nMet 1 druk op de knop wordt je map naar keuze ingeladen op je toestel, zodat je zonder internet verbinding kunt wandelen.\n\n\nPlannen\n\nDeze app maakt het plannen van routes erg eenvoudig. Vanuit elk knooppunt krijg je een overzicht van de mogelijke volgende knooppunten. Je kunt knooppunt per knooppunt plannen of je kunt 2 niet-opeenvolgende knooppunten kiezen. De app berekent dan de kortste route tussen deze 2 knooppunten. Je ziet tijdens het samenstellen van je route hoeveel km route je reeds gepland hebt.\n\n\nWandelen\n\nTijdens het wandelen kun je de route volgen op een kaart of via een overzicht van knooppunten bordjes. Je kunt de kaart laten roteren in je wandelrichting door middel van het kompas zodat je heel eenvoudig de route kunt volgen. Je kunt de knooppunten op de kaart tonen in klein, medium en groot formaat.\n\n\nPOI integratie\n\nHeb je honger of dorst? Tijdens het wandelen kun je heel eenvoudig eet-en drankgelegenheden tonen op de kaart. Je kunt ook treinstations en medische faciliteiten zoals ziekenhuizen en apothekers tonen. Je kunt - binnen de app - de route bekijken tussen je huidige positie en een POI. Voor het laden van POI's is internet verbinding nodig.\n\n\nPanoramio\n\nOp elke route die je maakt kun je de mooiste Panoramio foto’s tonen. Zo krijg je automatisch de leukste plaatsen op je route te zien.\n\n\nGpx ondersteuning\n\nAlle routes die je gepland hebt, kun je eenvoudig bewaren in gpx formaat en doorsturen via e-mail. Onze gpx bestanden zijn compatibel met Basecamp.\n\n\nSocial Media\n\nDeel je activiteiten op Twitter en/of Facebook.\n\n\nNetwerk\n\nOpgelet: deze app toont enkel knooppunten in België.\n\n\nOpmerking batterijgebruik\n\nDeze app gebruikt gps in de achtergrond. Dit kan de batterijduur van je toestel beïnvloeden.\n\nAlle vragen en/of opmerkingen kun je mailen naar support@knooppuntenapp.be."

Watch in full screen, view in AR, search, add filters and so much more!\n\nShip Finder has been top rated and top ranking since 2009 and covers most of the world, tracking 20,000+ ships simultaneously.\n\nOur incredible app performance means that you can see all tracked vessels at once - no clustering here!\nSimply tap a ship to see its name, type, photos, speed, dimensions and much more.\nPowerful features such as filters, search and the ability to save favourite ships are included. (You can choose Apple or Google maps too!).\n\nAdd and browse bookmarks to saved locations around the globe to quickly navigate to areas or ports of interest.\n\nYou can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. \n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

      "label": "Theodolite is a multi-function viewfinder that combines a compass, two-axis inclinometer, rangefinder, GPS, map, nav calculator, and geo-overlay photo/movie camera into one indispensable app. Theodolite was one of the very first augmented reality (AR) apps when it was released in 2009, and it’s been downloaded and used by millions of customers since then. Uses are endless, and the app is great for land measurements, outdoor sports, sightseeing, navigation, and finding your way around. Theodolite is a pro grade app and is used extensively by surveyors, geologists, architects, engineers, competitive sportsmen, first responders, military personnel, and search and rescue workers around the world. \n\nTheodolite lets you take data-overlay photos and movies with 2X-8X zoom. Overlay geographical data, angle markings, date/time, author/company info, and project notes directly on photos and movies for later reference. The same data is written into the metadata record of images, making image files self-contained data records. Third-party apps can tap into Theodolite's advanced camera functions with a camera sharing feature.\n\nView current position on the built-in map with optional offline Outdoors maps that include topo contours, roads, trails, landmarks, campgrounds, ski lifts, and more. Live map markers continually update distance/heading relative to the current location and also show wayfinding info in the main viewfinder. Draw polygons on the map to mark things like property boundaries and trails, and import/export polygon data via KML.\n\nShare map markers and nav calculator points with other users of Theodolite via text messages or e-mail. This powerful capability opens up a wide range of collaborative uses including team land surveying, accident investigations, spotting wild fires, triangulation of landmarks, and advanced tactical observation and targeting. With an optional in-app purchase to enable team tracking, you can share location with up to 20 people on Theodolite's map.\n\nTheodolite includes features for serious users like a reference angle mode, nav calculator, map marker import/export, manual and automatic data logging with CSV and KML export, clipboard integration, %grade display, mil compass readout, optical rangefinders (including a mil-based reticle, sniper-style stadiametric graphs, and a variable 4X-24X scope), and night filters to improve use in dark conditions.\n\nTheodolite can provide location in military grid reference system (MGRS) coordinates, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, British/Irish National Grids, US National Grid, Maidenhead locator system, Map Grid of Australia, and six latitude/longitude formats. Optional US State Plane coordinates include SPCS27 and SPCS83 zones covering all US States. The optional Datum Pack adds over 230 geodetic datums to the app to improve position computation from GPS data, covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.\n\nAR Layers include navigational aids like the sun, moon, planets, and Polaris (North star), and the optional US Mountain Summits layer that shows over 70,000 US mountain summits in the viewfinder.\n\nTheodolite has been shown in Apple Keynotes, featured on the App Store, and has been a #1 selling Navigation app in App Stores around the world. Since its introduction in 2009, Theodolite has defined augmented reality navigation. The app continually introduces new technologies, pushing the limits of iOS app development and taking advantage of new hardware capabilities.\n\nFind out why Apple named Theodolite one of the most amazing apps available and showed it being used to explore the Great Wall of China. Where will you take it on your next adventure?\n\nNote: Theodolite is an iPhone app -- see “Theodolite HD” for use on an iPad. And be sure to check out the all-new \"Theodolite for Watch\" and put Theodolite on your wrist!"

Deel eenvoudig je routes met vrienden, zonder enige vorm van registratie. Wij zorgen ervoor dat je steeds de meest recente versie van het fietsknooppuntennetwerk op zak hebt.\n\nDe app is voorzien van een ingebouwde handleiding die alle aspecten van de app in detail bespreekt.\n\n\"Heb de app al vaak gebruikt en werkt prima.\"\n\n\"Ik ben trouwens erg tevreden over deze app.\"\n\n\"Super, dank je wel en succes met de volgende versie.\"\n\n\"Zet m op. De app wordt steeds fijner.\"\n\n\"Lekker gefietst vandaag mét stembegeleiding.\"\n\n\niPhone en iPad\n\nOnze app werkt zowel op iPhone als iPad, zowel in staande als liggende oriëntatie.\n\n\nZoeken\n\nVoortaan kun je zoeken door de recentste routes die door collega fietsers zijn gemaakt. Meer dan 1300 routes zijn beschikbaar en elke dag komen er nieuwe routes bij.\n\n\nStembegeleiding\n\nDe app kan je begeleiden door middel van stem en notificaties. De app laat je weten wanneer je een knooppunt nadert en zegt wat het volgende knooppunt is. Dit alles werkt in de achtergrond, dus je kunt het scherm van je telefoon uitzetten, veel batterij uitsparen en dus langer fietsen! Je kunt de stembegeleiding ook gebruiken in combinatie met muziek.\n\nJe kiest ook zelf aan welk knooppunt je wil beginnen en in welke richting je een route wil fietsen.\n\n\nBerekening van lusvormige routes\n\nKies het knooppunt waar je wil beginnen en eindigen en met 1 druk op de knop berekent de app een lijst van lussen met verschillende afstanden. \n\n\nOffline kaarten\n\nMet onze app kun je elke route die je maakt voorzien van offline kaarten. We bieden kaarten aan van:\n\n- OpenStreetMaps\n- Google Maps\n- OSM HikeBike\n\nMet 1 druk op de knop wordt je kaart naar keuze ingeladen op je toestel, zodat je zonder internet verbinding kunt fietsen.\n\n\nPlannen\n\nDeze app maakt het plannen van routes erg eenvoudig. Vanuit elk knooppunt krijg je een overzicht van de mogelijke volgende knooppunten. Je kunt knooppunt per knooppunt plannen of je kunt 2 niet-opeenvolgende knooppunten kiezen. De app berekent dan de kortste route tussen deze 2 knooppunten. Je ziet tijdens het samenstellen van je route hoeveel km route je reeds gepland hebt.\n\n\nFietsen\n\nTijdens het fietsen kun je de route volgen op een kaart of via een overzicht van knooppunten bordjes. Je kunt de kaart laten roteren in je rij richting door middel van het kompas zodat je heel eenvoudig de route kunt volgen. Je kunt de knooppunten op de kaart tonen in klein, medium en groot formaat.\n\n\nPOI integratie\n\nHeb je honger of dorst? Tijdens het fietsen kun je heel eenvoudig eet-en drankgelegenheden tonen op de kaart. Je kunt ook treinstations en medische faciliteiten zoals ziekenhuizen en apothekers tonen. Je kunt - binnen de app - de route bekijken tussen je huidige positie en een POI. Voor het laden van POI's is internet verbinding nodig.\n\n\nPanoramio\n\nOp elke route die je maakt kun je de mooiste Panoramio foto’s tonen. Zo krijg je automatisch de leukste plaatsen op je route te zien.\n\n\nGpx ondersteuning\n\nAlle routes die je gepland hebt, kun je eenvoudig bewaren in gpx formaat en doorsturen via e-mail. Onze gpx bestanden zijn compatibel met Basecamp.\n\n\nSocial Media\n\nDeel je activiteiten op Twitter en/of Facebook.\n\n\nNetwerk\n\nOpgelet: deze app toont enkel knooppunten in Nederland.\n\n\nOpmerking batterijgebruik\n\nDeze app gebruikt gps in de achtergrond.

      "label": "“Awesome!!! The best speed app on iphone” 5 Stars by kurtonic\n\nSpeed Box is a Speedometer and GPS app for both your iPhone and iPad. It displays your current speed, distance, direction and altitude along with your top speed and average speed. The app also keeps a record of the speed and altitude for the last few hours.\n\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n========================\n\n* MPH, KM/H and KNOTS\n* Show decimal speed (e.g. \"45.7 mph\")\n* One app for both the iPhone and iPad\n* \"Speak speed\" - Tap screen to have the speed spoken to you\n* 11 Analog and digital speedometers\n* Map view\n* Maximum and average speed\n* Altitude \n* Digital compass \n* HUD display to see speed in windshield \n* Odometer to measure distance traveled \n* Chart of the traveled speed and altitude \n* Warning signal when driving too fast \n* Export last 3 hours of data \n* Change maximum displayed speed on speedometer \n* Swipe finger over chart to display historic data \n* Display GPS accuracy by tapping the indicator in the top left corner \n\n\nUSER REVIEWS\n========================\n\n5 Stars by Darekakuta \n\"Just what I needed. My '58 chev's speedo doesn't work. This did the trick.\" \n\n5 Stars by Rawd \n\"Great My 79 Firebird speedo only goes to 140 kmh. ;). This worked perfectly.\" \n\n5 Stars \n\"Within 1 mile per hour +/- Great Job!\" \n\nSpeedBox was one of the very early Speedometer Apps for the iPhone. Take advantage of my experience and the refined algorithms that can get a much greater accuracy from the iPhone then a lot of other apps. I regularly update my application to make it even more accurate and usable. \n\nUsers have already used our application to verify the accuracy of their car's speedometer or they tried measuring the speed they achieved while skiing. Can you come up with more ideas? How about measuring the speed of the airplane you travel with? \n\nUSAGE NOTES\n========================\nThe \"GPS strength\" indicator in the top left corner should display a green dot. You can tap this indicator to display the current GPS accuracy.\n\nPlease allow the application up to a minute to find enough satellites to work correctly. \n\nIf you get a message to enable GSP, please go to ”Settings > General > Location Services“ on your iPhone and check if the little switch is set to \"On\" for Speed Box as well as for \"Location Services\" in general. \n\nATTENTION iPod touch users! Unfortunately this app doesn't work very well on the iPod touch and the iPad WiFI (without 3G) since these devices are missing a GPS!\n\n\nFEEDBACK\n========================\nIf you've got any wishes or suggestions for new features, please let me know with the contact form on this application's website (see link below).\n\nI am already working on the next update!"

      "label": "BACKGROUND:\n\nBuilt from the ground up in the rugged mountains of eastern Afghanistan, Tactical NAV comes from the mind of a U.S. Army Field Artillery officer who had a vision of creating a low-cost and highly accurate tactical navigation platform built specifically for military service members.\n\nTactical NAV's journey began in the notorious Pech River Valley of Kunar Province, Afghanistan. \n\nU.S. Army Capt. Jonathan J. Springer, a Fire Support Officer with the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), began developing the tactical navigation platform following the memorial services for Spc. Blair D. Thompson and Spc. Jared C. Plunk, who were killed in action on June 25, 2010.\n\nAfter pitching the idea and being turned away by the Department of Defense on multiple occasions, Captain Springer remained resolute in his mission to continue developing Tactical NAV — even to this day. His ultimate goals were (and still are) to make a difference for other Soldiers and honor the men and women who were killed and wounded in battle.\n\nHe ended up using his life savings to continue moving forward with the Tactical NAV project, all with the ultimate hope of saving military lives and helping his fellow service members accomplish their mission at home and abroad.\n\nTactical NAV officially launched on the App Store on February 14, 2011.\n\nMISSION:\n\nTactical NAV's mission is to provide military service members with a low-cost, highly accurate, and exceedingly powerful mobile tactical navigational solution.\n\nVISION:\n\nOur vision is to assist and support our nation's service members with their mobile navigational needs and further enable them to operate and win during Multi-Domain Operations (MDO).\n\nBUILT FOR ACCURACY:\n\nTactical NAV's performance is on par with the AN/PSN-13 Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR), and it has the feedback to prove it.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n\nPurpose-built by Soldiers and created to save military lives, Tactical NAV was the very first MGRS-focused app on the App Store. It has proven to be effective across a multitude of environments all throughout the world.\n\nTactical NAV has been successfully evaluated against other software platforms and devices such as Nett Warrior, JCR, BFT, JBC-P, and ATAK. Its accuracy is within 1-to-3 meters of these officially approved systems issued by the Department of Defense.\n\nIAPs & SUBSCRIPTIONS: \n\nTactical NAV contains in-app purchases (IAPs) and subscriptions. Currently, tactical drawing mode is available as an in-app purchase, and offline mapping is also available to users as either a monthly or yearly subscription. All revenue generated from these features goes towards further developmental coding and updates, and a portion of all proceeds are donated to charities that specifically benefit disabled veterans.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n• A military-quality precision targeting platform\n• Purpose-built for the individual Soldier\n• Offline mapping capabilities (complete usage of the TACNAV platform with no emission of a cellular signal)\n• WGS 84 standard (MGRS, UTM, BNG, and USNG coordinates)\n• Tactical drawing mode (e.g., useful for Joint Fires planning, creating overlays, route planning, and so forth)\n• Waypoint plotting functionality with military graphics (per FM 1-02.2)\n• Compass \"FastLock\" function for capturing quick azimuths\n• Snap and save photographs onto the main map for intelligence purposes and AARs\n• Location, waypoint, and photo-sharing capabilities (via email and text)\n• One-button night mode function for low-light situations \n• \"Go to Grid\" option for intelligent pinpoint planning and drawing of overlays\n• Created and tested to ensure utmost accuracy and reliability \n• iOS native code built for austere and contested environments\n• And so much more!!!\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n \nThe Department of Defense does not endorse Tactical NAV, nor should it be used in life-threatening or combat situations in place of a government-issued device."

      "label": "BlindSquare is pioneering accessible navigation both indoors and outdoors. Know where you are, know where you're going, travel with confidence.\n\nBlindSquare is a new solution that combines the latest technology to help the blind with their daily lives. It has been developed in collaboration with blind people and carefully field tested. You need either an iPhone or an iPad to get started. It also supports some additional accessories to enhance the experience. \n\nHow does it work? \n\nBlindSquare uses GPS and the compass to locate you. It then gathers information about the surrounding environment from FourSquare. BlindSquare has some unique algorithms to decide what information is the most relevant and then speaks it to you with high quality speech synthesis. \n“What's the most popular café within 200 meters radius? Where is the post office or the library?” \n\nYou can control BlindSquare also through voice commands. The Voice Command feature is a premium service requiring purchase of credits for continuous use.  Voice Command Credits are available as an in-app purchase on the App Store.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a GPS solution:\n\nWhen you start the app, it will start telling you the interesting places and street crossings around you. By changing the radius, you can limit the area you are interested in. You can also search by search term or by category. You can select an interesting place from the search results and perform the following tasks:\n\n1) Get contact info (address, phone number) \n2) Open twitter feed or restaurant menu (if provided)\n3) Make a phone call\n4) Start tracking the place (BlindSquare will assist you by repeating the distance and the clock face direction)\n5) Start your favourite navigator for turn-by-turn instructions (TomTom, Navigon or Apple Maps)\n\nBlindSquare is aware of when you travel by car, bus or train and starts to report interesting places in front of you (for example, the next stops) and street crossings when you are passing them.\n\nYou can also save your own private places to iCloud so they will be found with your every device.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a Foursquare client:\n\nIf you like to play Foursquare, you can do the following with BlindSquare:\n \n1) Get a list of nearby FourSquare venues\n2) When you are in a place, you can check in by shaking your device\n3) Do a check in with commenting and twitter/facebook sharing\n4) Correct the location of the place\n\nBlindSquare supports the following languages: English, Arabic, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean (South Korea), Norwegian, Polish, Portugues, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\nVoiceOver usage is supported but it also includes higher quality additional speech synthesis by Acapela Text-To-Speech from Acapela Group.\n \nInstructions in English: https://www.blindsquare.com/user-guide/ and https://www.blindsquare.com/faq/\n\nPlease note: This app retrieves data in real time from Foursquare and Open Street Map. Use of a flat rate data plan is highly recommended.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nHaving only been released in May 2012, BlindSquare has already received several prizes and awards:\n\n - GSMA: Global Mobile Awards 2013, Best Mobile Health Product or Service\n - Apps4Finland 2012\n - OpenCities App Challenge 2012\n - The Finnish Information Processing Association: Best Product 2012\n\nPlease note: To use BlindSquare, your iCloud account has to be active so BlindSquare can access it to save your settings and places.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer, GPS tracker and trip cost monitor for iPhones and cellular iPads. \n∙∙ When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! \n∙∙ The cost monitor shows you the current cost of the journey as you drive and tells you each passengers share. \n∙∙ GPS tracker records your trips so they can be analyzed, viewed and shared at any moment.\n\n‣‣ COST MONITOR. What's the cost of my driving?\nBased on gas price for a gallon or litre, MPG (U.S. or UK) or liters per 100 km the app will tell you what the cost is as you drive. You can add an extra cost per kilometer or mile! Useful for all cost aware drivers and for splitting the cost between passengers.\n\n‣‣ GPS TRACKING. Where I've been? How long did it take to get from A to B? \nSpeedometer records your trip statistics even when GPS tracker is switched off. When you need point by point data to see on the map later or export (Google Earth and GPX), speedometer gives you the first class GPS tracker.\n\n‣‣ INFOTAINMENT. \nWhen switched on, infotainment shows trip stats or weather/wind forecast  when you wait. Way better than just showing you a 0 speed!\n\n‣‣ Easy to set speed limits and SPEED LIMIT MEMORY option\nSet speed limits with 4 or 8 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! With SPEED LIMIT MEMORY you just apply the speed limit once and the app applies it for you automatically the next time!\n\n‣‣ MODES\nUse MENU>MODES to turn the app into a Rally computer, G-Force monitor, Camera alerter or taximeter! Currently there are 12 modes available and we are constantly adding new ones.\n\n‣‣ WAYPOINTS.\nSpeedometer gives you the unique way to leave a note with location and even optional photo or audio note attached! As easy as double tap on the big speed digits! You'll find more in a documentation section (star button).\n\n‣‣ RED LIGHT & SPEED CAMERAS\nImport camera data into speedometer in Garmin or iGO csv formats from poi-factory.com, scdb.info or poi-plaza and let speedo alert you on a camera approach and set speed limit automatically before you pass the speed camera!\n\n‣‣ SUNSET/SUNRISE\nWith the sunset and sunrise information that our speedometer provides, you'll be able to avoid driving in the dusk.\n\n‣‣ BARO VSI. Barometric Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI, IVSI) in both scale and graph forms.\n\n‣‣ VOICE COACH. When enabled and configured, voice coach will be telling you active track distance and duration as well as current speed and altitude.\n\n‣‣ MAPS. Google's native, Apple map, Blank map and Offline maps.\n\n‣‣ Siri shortcuts: New Track, Stop Track, Speed limits.\n\n+ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and cellular iPads. All in retina graphics.\n\n+ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KM/H AND KNOTS. Maximum/TOP, average speed, distance traveled.\n\n+ BACKGROUND MODE! Speedometer will work in background if told so and will still warn you with audio alert when exceed a preset speed limit. You can use other apps while speedometer does its job in the background!\n\n+ PRIVACY. Speedometer never shares your location data with 3rd parties or ad agencies. Location data is used solely for tracking your speed and recording the GPS tracks and never leave the app unless you decide to share by means of a track export. It always let you know when background mode is on and never runs in background unless it is explicitly told to do so.\n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone as well as on any cellular iPad. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS (external GPS module is required). \n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nDrive safely, keep the log and notes and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal companion no matter what journey you are going on!"

Do we really need one more?\n\nAriadne GPS is more than a simple gps app.\n\nBesides offering you the possibility to know your position and to get information about the street, the number, etc. it also lets you explore the map of what's around you.\n\nWhat do we mean by saying \"explore\"? You'll deal with a talking map. If you have VoiceOver activated on your device, you will be able to know the street names and numbers that are around you by touching them.\nJust put your finger on the screen of your device, when showing the map and moving it you will be told the info's about the street you're touching.\nYour position is on the center of the screen. What's in front of you is on the top half of the screen and things behind you are on the bottom half of the screen.\n\nYou can also explore a different region than the one around you by telling the app the street and the city.\n\nYou can ask for information about your position at any time, also activating a function, called monitor, that will give you this info periodically (Please read the note below).\nThis app has also got some other useful features that might help when walking or traveling by bus, train etc.\nIf you add your favourite points to the app database, you can be alerted when you get closer than a certain distance to one of them.\n\nThis app is completely accessible using VoiceOver and gives you access to information that are normally unavailable to people using the speech synthesizer and can be therefore especially useful to blind and partially sighted people. \n\nNote: The features of Ariadne GPS are based on the location services and on the Maps server for what concerns the information about the position. This information may not be accurate, due to the location accuracy, which is generally below fifteen metres but in some cases can be few tens of metres and to the Maps service, which might be unresponsive at certain times (Ariadne GPS will tell you if this is the case). The aim of Ariadne GPS is to give you an idea of your position and what is around you. Please do not completely rely on it.\n\nPlease note that the use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nFor more info and suggestions please visit http://www.ariadnegps.eu"

AyeTides displays tides and/or currents for over 12,500 locations worldwide and unlike many other tide apps, it does not require a network connection. With AyeTides you will never see those annoying ads or be asked to pay for additional features! Sailors, harbor pilots, beachcombers, nature photographers, and more use AyeTides to plan their outings on or around the world's oceans. \n\nHere are some of the things people are saying about AyeTides... \n\n\"AyeTides is a quality professional product”\n\n\"Your support has been the best I have experienced!\"\n\n“As a harbor pilot in New York I’ve been using your excellent tide and current app”\n\n\"I really appreciate the effort that you put into making AyeTides as accurate as it can be. It is a great program that has been very useful to us. I think we have 60 pilots using iPhones and iNavX and your app links in so well.\"\n\n\"I am a ships Pilot in BC and use Aye Tides a lot and it has become invaluable.”\n\nYou can see the day’s events in tabular form, or you can rotate the phone for an interactive graph that shows you the tide’s value at any point during the day. You can find a station on a map, by name, or based on your current location.\n\nAyeTides is updated regularly and stations are added whenever we find new data. We encourage our customers to contact us if you hare having any issues with the program so that we can help you. \n\nThis app is designed to run on your iPhone or iPod Touch. While it will run on your iPad, it does not offer the additional features available with AyeTides XL, which was designed specifically for the iPad. If you have multiple devices, you may want to consider our bundle. You get both apps at a discount!\n\nThis is the only place to install AyeTides. Other websites may look like they have AyeTides, but they do not. We only support iOS, any other version of AyeTides is not ours."

      "label": "This app puts the Mayan Dreamspell Calendar in your pocket! \"13:20:Sync makes it so much easier to understand and integrate the calendar into every day life. Highly recommend it.\" \n\nThe Mayan People have described, in breathtaking precision, the cycles of both the universe and nature around us. They created a harmonic calendar that is synchronized to all those cycles. Following these cycles can help you get a stronger connection with nature around you and become conscious of your essence.\n\nThis app provides a simple way to sync along those cycles, to raise our frequency and give us a new lens to view both our day-to-day and planetary events.\n\n- Did you ever realize that our (Gregorian) calendar is not a harmonic calendar? \n- Did you know that the moon has 13 (not 12!) orbits around the earth in 1 year? \n- Why do we live with this irregular calendar?\n- Are you interested in Astrology?\n\n-> All this, and more, is explained carefully in this app. (over 15.000 words on 37 pages) Please note that these text are in English language only.\n\nIn the New Time, synchronicity is the norm.\n\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n5 star rating across the world! \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\"Entertaining as well as enlightening\" \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\nMORE INFO: \nwww.1320sync.com \n\n\nFor the beginner this app is a learning tool because it contains an extensive explanation about Tones and Seals and the synchronizing order of the Mayan Astrology. You may think it's difficult at first but soon you will feel how it all connects. \n\n\"This app is great, and allows easy manipulation of dates. I spent years in books doing in hours what I can now do in seconds.\"\n\nFor the ones who are already familiar with the Mayan Calendar this app is a handy tool to navigate the cycles, and calculate the Combined Kin for any given combination. Furthermore this app can be of great assistance to teach other people about the 13:20 cycles and is used in teachings around the world.\n\n\n=== FEATURES ===\n\n+ Kin Calendar\nThis is your main Mayan Dreamspell Calendar Dashboard with all the details you need to stay in sync. Shows the Kin of today by default, and you can calculate the Kin for any other date.\n\n+ Personal Notes\nOn this new page you can keep your personal notes for the 2 main cycles of time: the Tzolkin cycle of 260 days and the 13 Moon cycle of 365 days. And with the powerful text search function you quickly find your notes.\n\n+ Kin Picker\nSelect any combination of the 13 Tones and 20 Seals. Top section can scroll to 4 pages with information.\n\n+ Combined Kin Calculator \nCalculate the Combined Kin of any combination of Kin. You can add as many Kin as you like to calculate the Combined Kin for a group of people. \n\n+ Tzolkin with indication of the GAP day's and Wavespell and more. Tap and hold to select a Kin number directly.\n\n+ Contact Import \nAll contacts in your Contacts App will be automatically imported and assigned to the correct Kin. See all your contacts with their Mayan Reading and how you relate to them. \n\n+ 13 Moon Calendar \nFull integration of 13 Moon Calendar. (doubles as a birthday calendar!) \n\n+ 13:20 Information \nLots of information about the theory behind synchronization to help you navigate the Mayan Dreamspell Calendar. The texts provide a clear explanation of the Cycles of Time. (More than 15.000 words on 37 pages) Please note that these text are in English language only.\n\n+ Sharing\nOn all the 3 main tabs you can share the current selected Galactic Signature using your favorite app. \n\n\n# Based on the work of José Argüelles.\n# This app was made with permission of and in cooperation with the Foundation for the Law of Time - www.lawoftime.org, \n# Ariel Spilsbury."

Use it for any image with a fixed URL (web address).\n\nImages you choose as \"Featured\" are downloaded and setup side by side so that you can swipe across the screen to view multiple images quickly.\nTrafficCamNZ works over the cellular network though it works best with WiFi because, usually, it's faster!\n\nTrafficCamNZ can also use the GPS features in your device to show cameras around you. Try the predictive mode that predicts where you are travelling to display the next cameras (with known GPS coordinates) on your journey.\n\nTrafficCamNZ now contains details of more than 7000 cameras from around the world. You choose which cameras are the \"featured\" ones. Featured cameras are easily identified in the Library; they have a Green dot next to them.\nManaging your own personal list of cameras is easy too. This can be done in two ways:\n1. Enter a new camera directly on the iPhone and key in the entire URL (http://mywebsite/image.jpg) or\n2. Create your own XML file for importing into the application. Instructions on how to do this are available at the support web site or by contacting the developer.\n\nUsage Notes:\n* Pictures are displayed in the order they are received unless you set the image sequence number, you can then order the images how you want them\n* Check your network usage when downloading over the cellular network\n* Images are not cached, if you receive an image that isn't right (i.e. daylight when you know it is night time, that camera may not be functioning)\n* Sometimes the traffic camera pictures are not up-to-date. You may see night pictures when it is supposed to be daylight or perhaps pictures don't change. TrafficCamNZ has no control over that\n* You receive updates to the camera list automatically; a check is performed every 7 days when the application starts\n* Tap the image on the main window to display it full screen\n\nFeatures:\n* Easily flick through the loaded images with your finger - this was the original idea behind the application\n* Load your own web images\n* Free version available, loads up to 3 images\n* Full version available, loads up to 19 images on iPhone and 32 images on iPad\n* Allows XML import of camera list\n* Camera list (XML Import file) can be updated from a web site - doesn't require the release of a new application\n* No advertising\n\nMany great comments from around the world have been made about TrafficCamNZ:\n* Great little app, what a time saver. I would often leave work to find the traffic all congested, now I can check before I leave and even if it gets busy I can check on the road and take a different route. I have set my own cameras and can quickly check what's what. A real must for driving commuters, couriers or even taxi's. \n* This app works very well and is awesome if you travel a lot. Going on a road trip for work or vacation?  Google the cameras for your cities, insert the URL into the app, and cameras appear \n* I set it up for all the traffic cameras from Douglas County down through El Paso County (Colorado) and it works great!  So well in fact, that I sprung for the paid version\n* Make sure you enter in the URL's correctly - that's where some people mess up.  What you see is basically what the traffic/weather cam sees wherever they are. They have to be viewable on the Internet first. Awesome app!\n* App is very easy to use and I use it for going to work every day\n* I put 2 of the most important traffic cams on the way to work and it works perfect"

It's like having a log book and data recorder in your pocket! Hot air is loaded with lots of different features; many based on pilot feedback from around the world.\n\n---------------------------\nMajor Features:\n---------------------------\n\n- Real-time tracking! Great for improving situationally awareness, see your current location on a map or satellite imagery\n\n- Waypoints to show your distance, bearing, and ETE to a target location\n\n- Offline maps available\n\n- Record your entire flight path (you can even turn your screen off during recording)! Then you can export your flight to your computer and view it in 3D using Google Earth\n\n- KML/KMZ overlays! Add custom overlay data to the real-time flight maps (can be used to map out electric lines, friendly or unfriendly places to land, denoting special airspaces, include information such as radio frequencies or phone numbers, etc.).\n\n- Wind data tracking - records wind speed and direction at the various altitudes as you fly\n\n- Integration of the Glympse location sharing service to allow ground crew, family, or others to track your flight in real-time. They can track you using almost any device with a data connection. \n\n- Flight Log- the log makes it easy to track information common to all pilots such as crew members, passengers, maximum envelope temperature, and propane used. The log also makes saving takeoff and landing locations convenient, thanks to the iPhone’s GPS or triangulation capabilities; plus, it has a \"favorites\" list for takeoff locations. The log can also aid in flight planning and separates future flights from past flights using a simple color-coding scheme. \n\n- Flight Data Summary: this tab quickly tallies flights and hours flown. The summary includes a total of all flights or just the ones made within the past 90 days. Plus a summary of the crew used for past flights.\n\n- Summary Map: on the map tab, the logged flights that have a saved takeoff and landing location can be plotted and compared on an interactive map \n\n- Data export: export your flight log in HTML, KML (for viewing in Google Earth), and GPX (GPS Exchange)\n\n- Data backup and restore - to be certain your data is safe!\n\n- Comprehensive payload calculator\n\n- Measure Tool\n\n- View weather conditions and forecasts from within the app\n\n- Universal app - works on iPad (landscape and portrait) as well as the iPhone and iPod touch! \n\n- Facebook integration - it is easy to post a quick summary of your latest flight to Facebook and even includes a link to a map! \n\n- Real-time tracking heading projection-line option\n\n---------------------------\nThis app includes translations in English, French, Czech, and Slovak!\n---------------------------\n\nNote: During real-time flight mode the GPS is continuously running in the background which can significantly decrease battery life."

      "label": "Boat Beacon is an internet AIS receiver and transmitter for your iPhone and iPad. It is the only AIS ship tracking app to provide Collision Warnings, share your boat’s position & use real-time AIS data.\n\nConnected to the largest network of AIS shore receivers world-wide covering most major ports, harbours and popular coastal areas.\n\n“An outstanding app, with great potential. Both interesting to use and very user friendly. This could be a life saver and especially of interest to small boat users. Everyone who goes on the water should have this on and use it!”  ***** Sun Dream, App Store Review\n\nBoat Beacon is specifically designed for boaters & provides continuous Bearing, Range & Closest Point of Approach (CPA) calculations and alarms in addition to standard AIS information even when in the background.\n\nBoat Beacon does not require any external AIS transponder or receiver equipment.\n\nKey Features\n------------\nOver-the-horizon collision avoidance (30 miles radius) using continuous CPA calculations - highlights boats that are on a potential collision course and alerts you with an alarm.\n\nContinually transmits and receives position information via the internet and calculates and alarms CPA even when the app is in the background.\n\nShares your position with Internet AIS Systems and apps and other Boat Beacon users in real time.\n\nReal time ship map view with North up and Heading up modes so you can look in the direction of the ships on the map to locate them.\n\nNav display showing own boat's speed, course, heading and position.\n\nMan Overboard tracking, SART Alarm, Anchor watch and Theft alarms.\n\nApple Watch App included\n\nExport tracks\n\nBoat-to-Boat & Boat-to-Group Messaging. \n\nLocal AIS and GPS via Wifi.\n\nBoat Beacon InApp Add-ons:-\n\nLiveView - Augmented Reality Camera view with ships, compass & horizon overlaid. Works with FLIROne Infra-red cameras as well to see ships & people in the dark & through fog (IAP)\n\n\"AIS Sharing\" to other apps like Navionics & iNavX (IAP subscription)\n\nUS, UK and IE Marine raster charts  (IAP).\n\nLet Friends and Family see where you are and where you're headed to with our free Boat Watch app or on web-based AIS systems like MarineTraffic which have free web viewers available.\n\nArm all the crews in a race with Boat Beacon and have real time updates on the race positions on the water and back in the club house.\n\nKeep a watch and in touch with other boats in your flotilla when sailing in a group.\n\nBoat Beacon requires internet access to work. Most popular coastal areas have cellular data access extending 12 or more miles out to sea. \n\nSubscriptions\nThe \"AIS Sharing \" subscription is monthly ($5.99) or yearly ($16.49), and will automatically renew at the end of the subscription period unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase, and will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be managed by the iTunes account holder and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase.  No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.\n\nTerms of Use: http://seanav.net/termsofuse.php\n\nPrivacy Policy: http://seanav.net/privacy.php\n\nSupport: help@pocketmariner.com\n\nYour position can be shared and seen on all our apps without using an MMSI number. To be seen on Global AIS systems like MarineTraffic you will need an MMSI number. In the US you can obtain one  by visiting http://www.boatus.com/mmsi or email us for a free internet MMSI number.\n\nPlease note that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nNOT FOR NAVIGATION\nBoat Beacon should only be used for basic navigation reference and should not be solely relied upon to determine precise locations, proximity, distance, or direction. You will not be visible to other ships on VHF only AIS systems."

      "label": "Featured by Apple in “Best New Apps”!\n\nPlan your next trip. Mark places you want to go. Remember your favorite spots. Across town or across the world, you’ll never forget another place with Pinbox!\n\nAdd pins where you are, where you’ve been, or where you want to go. Pinbox makes it easy to quickly record and organize your important places into distinct maps for every activity, occasion, or geographic region.\n\nUnlike other apps, Pinbox doesn’t force you to save all your places on a single map. You can make one map for your favorite local restaurants - make another map for your next business trip or vacation - and make another map for errands you need to run this weekend. The possibilities are endless!\n\nPinbox is about you and your places. It’s not a social network. You don’t have to create an account or enter your Facebook details to use the app. Your maps aren’t cluttered with random places bookmarked by strangers. Pinbox is simply the best app for privately bookmarking places that are important to YOU!\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Simple, easy-to-use interface\n• Drop a pin for each place you want to remember\n• Add photos, notes, and other details to each pin\n• Choose from seven different pin colors\n• Organize your pins into separate maps\n• See your location in relation to your pins\n• Send maps to other Pinbox users\n• Send pins to Apple Maps, Google Maps, Waze, or Transit for directions\n• Save up to 2,500 pins\n• Display maps in Standard, Hybrid, or Satellite\n\nEXAMPLES OF MAPS YOU MIGHT CREATE\n\n• Travel planning\n• Favorite restaurants or restaurants to try\n• Customer locations / sales calls\n• Friends and family locations\n• Real Estate listings\n• Favorite hiking / biking trails\n• Secret fishing spots\n• Dog-friendly places\n• Parking spots\n• Favorite stores\n• Multi-stop errands\n• Potential photoshoot locations\n• The list goes on and on and on…\n\n\nStill not convinced? Here’s a few of our favorite reviews…\n\n\n“Pinbox is one of those simple apps that does one thing so well it feels frictionless”.\n-- Stephen Grassie\n\n\n“The interface is gorgeous - I would say that it looks like something Apple designed”.\n-- Macaddict\n\n\n“I have been using this to keep track of all the places the kids and I go so they can see how spread out our world is and they can see where all we have gone. Will use it forever”.\n-- 1Cool Daddy\n\n\n“This app is extremely useful and so simple to use. A lifesaver for keeping track of locations”.\n-- Davies Photo\n\n\n“I love this app. It is exactly what it claims to be. I have wanted this app since the smartphone was invented. So simple, and so many uses”.\n-- T1Man\n\n\n\nUsing Pinbox on an iPod Touch or an iPad:\nLike other map apps, Pinbox uses GPS to determine your location. iPods and Wi-Fi-only iPads do not have a GPS receiver. On these devices, Pinbox provides your approximate location using information based on your proximity to known Wi-Fi networks (when on and available). The more accurate the available information, the smaller the circle identifying your position on the map. This feature is not available in all areas. Known Wi-Fi networks are predominantly in urban areas. An internet connection is required to load maps, look up addresses, and search. Although Pinbox can be installed on iPads, it’s not formatted for the larger iPad screen - it runs doubled like all other iPhone apps.\n\n\n\nPinbox is the result of a collaboration between Scott D. Smith and Paul Burd. We sincerely hope you like it!"

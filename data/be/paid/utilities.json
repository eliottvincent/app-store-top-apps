      "label": "TV Mirror+ for Chromecast is the easy screen sharing tool to mirror your iPhone or iPad screen and sound on Chromecast in Full HD Quality.\n\nMirror photos, videos, games, websites, apps, presentations, documents and spreadsheets on Chromecast.\n\n* Supported Chromecasts: Chromecast, Chromecast Ultra and all generations of the Chromecast family\n\n* Supported TVs and other devices: Xiaomi MI Box, NVIDIA Shield TV and all TVs with Google Cast or Chromecast built-in, e.g. Sony, TCL, Vizio, Sharp, Philips, Hisense, Skyworth, Soniq\n\n* Your iPhone/iPad and your Chromecast must be connected to the same wifi to enable screen mirroring. Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here. Chromecast is a trademark of Google LLC."

It works if they know your password and even if no password is set for the lock-screen.\niAmNotified is the solution to definitively secure your device! \nIt acts as a watchdog that lets you know if someone accessed your iPhone or iPad while you were not looking. It can also alert people that you are monitoring the device, discouraging any malicious access.  \n\nNo one can access your device without the password. But...\n\nWhat happens if your sneaky colleague or friend peeks while you type it in? \nWhat if your partner or parents simply demand it? (\"Why don't you give me your password, are you hiding something?\".... does this sound familiar?). \nWhat if someone uses your fingerprint to unlock your device while you sleep? (yeah, it has happened, check the press).\n\nThey would have access to your entire life: pictures, videos, contacts, whatsapp conversations, facebook chats, emails (which mean access to any of your online accounts via password reset), etc.\nThey might even install malware to spy on you remotely!\n\nTHE WORST PART IS YOU WILL NEVER KNOW THAT SOMEONE HAD ACCESS TO YOUR DEVICE. \nThat you need to change your password. That a tracking virus is running on your device. That you have to alert your bank. That your competitor has stolen your confidential data.  That your partner knows about \"those\" pictures and conversations and you'd better prepare a good excuse....\nThat people you trust don't respect your privacy!\n\n\n+++ HOW IT WORKS +++\n! THE SIMPLEST APP EVER !\n1. open the App\n2. lock the screen\n\nThat's it! Your device is Secured!\n\nYou will immediately receive a notification on the lock-screen. The notification will remain there until the screen stays locked. If anyone unlocks the screen while you are away, the notification will not be there when you return, alerting you that someone had access to your device.\nThe notification changes every single time for extra security.\n\nThe History Log keeps track of the last notifications shown, so by-passing the system is virtually impossible. \n\n+++FEATURES +++\nDouble Function: use the app with STEALTH NOTIFICATIONS to catch anyone who is spying on you, or with DETERRENT NOTIFICATIONS to let everybody know that you are monitoring any access to the device.\n\nYou choose what appears on the notification: \n\n+ STEALTH NOTIFICATIONS (simulate a useful notification, to disguise the true nature of iAmNotified)\n- Lucky Lottery Numbers - [Who doesn't play the lottery?  I mean... free money, right?!]\n- Famous Citations - [Because everyone needs some inspirational quotes every now and then]\n- Definition of a Complex Word - [Education is important! Anyone would want to expand his vocabulary]\n- Fake Stock Exchange Alert - [These are total random companies symbols and values. Not real data to be sued in the stock market!]\n\n+ DETERRENT NOTIFICATIONS (showing that you are monitoring the device, will discourage people from accessing it)\n- Custom Message - [You choose what appears on the notification]\n- \"Device locked at: #current date and time#\" - [Shows the time of the last screen lock]\n- \"Access to this device is monitored. Unique notification ID: #securityID#\" \n\n*** PRO OPTIONS ***\nImprove your stealthiness with these advanced options\n\n- Secret Lock -> Launch iAmNotified without anyone near you noticing. When the option is activated, a black dimmed screen is shown when the app is opened, simulating the lock screen. Now you can secretly press the lock button to lock the screen, or wait for it to lock automatically. To access the app with the option activated, simply tap anywhere on the black screen.\n\n- Random Notification Time -> The notification appears at a random time within 2 minutes from the screen lock, instead of immediately after\n\nStart to feel in control of your device!"

      "label": "This professional tool called Clinometer is the most precise (all you can get with some calculations) slope measurement tool for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad using all sides of the device plus the camera. It can be used for simple applications like aligning a frame as well as for more sophisticated fields of applications where an arbitrary slope needs to be measured exactly. Read the reviews (and write your own) for all the applications you find! Thank for all your positive feedback! Please use our support link if you have questions and suggestions, we don't read the iTunes reviews every day!\n\nWith this tool, the slope can be measured by all edges of the device and through the camera. The current features include:\n\n◆ 3 Modes (incl. auto switching): Clinometer mode (auto when holding upright), Camera mode (any direction, manual activation) and Bubble level (smoothly fading in when holding flat).\n\n◆ Relative angles: Besides measuring absolute angles, for every mode you can measure the relative angle between device positions\n\n◆ Advanced two way calibration on all sides: For every 4 sides plus the bubble mode you can calibrate in two steps, which allows you to calibrate exactly even on non-level surfaces. Each direction can be calibrated individually to achieve the optimal precision. \n\n◆ Speech synthesis: The device will speak the current reading, so you don't have to watch the display while measuring/aligning your object.\n\n◆ Five different unit modes: The device can display the slope in degrees (rounded or in tenth of degrees), percentage, rise over run (common for roof slope measurement in :12) and 1V:H (common in engineering)\n\n◆ Dial Rotation: You can smoothly rotate the background dial and thus define which side of the device represents 0° and 90° degrees. \n\n◆ Motion-sensitive Lock feature: Besides the common instant simple tap hold mechanism you can activate the motion-sensitive lock. If activated the device waits for the final lock until you hold your device steady enough for at least 2 seconds. You can set the lock sensitivity between 0.1° and 1.0° degrees. \n\n◆ Peer Mode: Use two devices to measure angles: One as a display, the other as the measurement device that can be attached to the hardware you want to align. \n\n◆ Fullscreen Mode: The full screen mode can be toggled by tapping the center of the screen and by the upper and lower arrows in the center. This prevents you from erroneous inputs while measuring.\n\n◆ Different color schemes: Press the S/C Button to instantly switch the color. The color can be selected differently for the bubble and the clinometer mode. The predefined color sets include day and night color schemes (Black on White, White on Black and Red). \n\n◆ Adjustable Auto-Lock: You can prevent the device from turning into the sleep mode. \n\nAccording to wikipedia: An inclinometer or clinometer is an instrument for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or inclination of an object with respect to gravity. It is also known as a tilt meter, tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. \n\nFor recreational use only. After the calibration it CAN (!) be very accurate especially for the main axis after calibration. The measurement is performed as well as possible (we try our best) by using the three inbuilt accelerometers. \n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! \n\nWe will improve the application long-term. This was the first application of this kind shortly after the opening of the App Store. Since then it is continuously updated and enriched with new features."

With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.\n\nAnd the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it is – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop. And with over 20 built-in themes and the ability to create your own, you can customize the results exactly the way you want.\n\nNoir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!\n\nBuilt from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Focus Filters and Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows. And your settings are automatically synced to all your devices using iCloud.\n\nAnd just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data.

      "label": "Convenience on the wrist - Watch app for Tesla is the ideal companion in day to day life with your Tesla vehicle. These are just a few of the day to day conveniences this app will help achieve:\n\n - Pair your watch as a proper vehicle key, just like your phone! Works under all conditions, including in underground parking garages or in the middle of a desert!\n\n - Forgot to plug in? Get a notification if vehicle is in a pre-configured location and not plugged in - all done directly on the watch, no external servers required, keeping your privacy!\n\n - Add the graphic corner complication to your watch face and enjoy the convenience of having easy access to state of charge, charging indicator, time remaining if charging, sentry mode active indicator and indicator if any windows, doors or trunks are open. All from one complication, that also will launch the app when tapped. \n\n - During and after charge, a panel will show how much energy was added. Convenient if you schedule your charge during the night - wake up each morning and easily check how much energy was added to the battery. \n\n - If you have multiple vehicles on your account, tap the vehicle name to quickly and easily switch between them. \n\n - You can queue up commands by tapping on buttons, then put your wrist down and the commands will execute in the background when the vehicle is successfully woken up. \n\n - When you tap the unlock vehicle button, the charge port will also unlock if a charging cable is attached. That's convenience right there!\n\n - Want to reduce phantom drain? Background updates can be configured to longer intervals between updates or to only update if car is already awake or can be disabled entirely for absolutely zero impact on phantom drain.\n\n - A warning panel will show up if any doors, windows or trunks are left open. Conveniently, you can tap the panel to close any open windows.\n\n - Need to access the frunk? Just do it from your wrist - no fiddling with your phone. \n\n - Sitting comfy in the couch, but just remembered you have a road-trip in the morning? Set the charge limit to 100% - or any value really - and start charging, right from the convenience of your wrist!\n\n - Leaving the office after a long hot day? Activate the HVAC when you're on your way, and enjoy a nice cool vehicle.\n\n - When charging, tap the time remaining label to switch to show time of expected completion - no more head calculus!\n\n - Need to run a quick errand, but you don't have your phone? Unlock your vehicle from your wrist, then activate remote start and off you go. Just please be mindful that this feature requires internet connectivity on both watch and vehicle - so don't drive into the desert and leave your vehicle, or you'll get stuck there!\n\nA note about security and privacy:\nThis app accepts two types of login. Either Tesla account credentials or a Tesla API token. Your account credentials are never stored in the app, but are used only once to obtain an authentication token and refresh token directly from the Tesla API server. If you would rather supply that token yourself, you can do so instead. It is required to supply a refresh token. Your token will be persisted in the app. Tokens will be revoked if you change your Tesla account password. No network traffic will ever be emitted from this app that goes anywhere other than directly to the Tesla API servers, unless the OPTIONAL cloud processing is enabled, in which case an in-flight encrypted ACCESS token with a lifespan of 8 hours will be transmitted and stored ONLY WHILE COMMAND IS EXECUTING. The source code for this application will at all times be made available to any security researcher for a voluntary security and safety audit. \n\nDisclaimer: \nThis app is not endorsed by Tesla Inc. Use at your own risk. No guarantee of proper function is given. Only you are responsible for any changes to your car caused by using this app.  \n\nMade in Denmark"

      "label": "Crowd GPS Scanner App that allows the user to quickly find the most common crowd locate GPS devices such as tile. These are the devices the size of a coin that will transmit signals back to the owners for anything up to a year with just a watch battery. Before these devices came to market tracking would require larger batteries & sim cards which would become quite large and simple to find.\nHow the Crowd Locate system works:\nCrowd locate works on the basis that when a tile is paired to a phone it will stay connected to that phone whilst paired and within approx. 30ft. Once the tile device goes out of range it will start sending a signal to \"Find me\" This signal will be collected by any persons phone that runs the tile app! This is how crowd locate works, the more people having the app the more chances the tile can be pinpointed. Once the tile has come within 30ft of another mobile phone running the app it will pinpoint that exact location on a map and send that information back to the owner of the tile! This will give the owner of the tile a real time location on a map with a time when located.\nWith our App you can search all devices within approx. 30ft and the App will list all devices detected.\nThe App will only detect devices that you don't have paired to your own phone or that are currently sending out signals because they are out of range to paired device. \nThis can be put to the test if you have a tile that has been paired to your phone. When you have a tile paired to your phone and the tile app is running on your phone the Crowd GPS Scanner App will NOT list any tiles that you own. Now swipe closed the tile app and turn off your phone then turn it back on. The tile you own will now be in lost mode because it's not connected to your phone. Whilst in lost mode it will be transmitting a signal \"Find me\" so now if you open the Crowd GPS Scanner App it will now list the tile device on the screen. Stop clear the results and start the tile App which will pair to the tile. Now if you run the Crowd GPS Scanner App it will NOT list your own device."

Length, distance, area of any surface… Measure everything with this virtual ruler and tape measure thanks to augmented reality. \n\nMeasuring a length is now easier than with a laser meter or any other measure tool. You draw your measurement lines in 3D thanks to the camera directly on the video of your phone or tablet. You export your plans in PDF, PNG or DXF. CamToPlan is the AR measuring app that brings your measures from cam…to…plan !\n\nFor personal or professional use, always measure like a pro. Thanks to Virtual Reality (VR), you can measure floors, dimensions of walls, windows, doors or a whole home in a few seconds. No more tape measure or ruler needed!\n\nThis app has infinite applications for everybody:\n- Personal use: the length measure app for the handyman who loves DIY !\n- Real estate professionals (real estate agent, interior design decorator or designer, architect, topographer, energy adviser...): this app will help you make a floorplan of a house, apartment, a specific room of a flat.\n- Construction workers can use it to quickly measure jobs : concreter, tile layer, carpet fitter, painter, drywall guy, plasterer, builder, carpenter, electrician, plumber, slater... \n- For gardener, landscaper, swimming pool builders and maintenance, digger, earth-moving, navvy: this app also works outside\n- Cost estimation professionals: this length measure app can make pricing estimates, it will be a great assistant for quantity surveyor, price studies technician, economist…\n- Building industry: foreman, site manager or engineer can drop their tape measure and ruler to perform a quick measurement check\n\nHow does this measuring app work?\nIt relies on ARKit by Apple. Machine learning algorithms combine the device sensors data (accelerometer, gyroscope…) with odometry which analyses in real time the video of the camera and relies on visual details of images, in order to scan the environment and find the position and rotation angle of the device.\n\nPlease note: \n- you can measure in metric (meters, centimeters) or imperial units (feet, inches)\n- the app measures distances horizontally (= on the ground) and vertically!\n- no need to remove the furniture from the room for measurements. The application determines the intersection between the floor and the target, even if it is hidden.\n- The application may have difficulty with some types of tiles.\n- The accuracy is not guaranteed.\n- you can move while performing measurements to get closer to your target point, for maximum precision, even if it is not visible and calculated by extrapolation."

Easily integrate the Prowl API into your applications.\n\nA list of supported apps/services: http://prowlapp.com/apps.php\n\nThe only limit of what the service can do is your imagination.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\nTo receive notifications from your computer, you need the latest:\n• Growl on your Mac @ growl.info, or\n• Growl for Windows @ growlforwindows.com, or\n• Snarl on Windows @ fullphat.net, or\n• Any program or web service using the public API.\n\nTHE CRITICS\n\"I was extremely impressed with Prowl and the elegance with which I was able to view Growl notifications on my iPhone.”\n—Aron Trimble, TUAW\n\n\"[A] powerful tool to connect your Mac with your iPhone, seamlessly over the air.\n—Federico Viticci, MacStories\n\n\"Great idea. This opens up iPhone push notifications for anything you can think of.”\n—John Gruber, Daring Fireball\n\n\"Probably the best $3 I’ve ever spent in the App Store.”\n—Darrell Etherington, The Apple Blog\n\nFEATURES\n• Push Notifications—When a Growl notification pops up on your computer, it's sent to Prowl and displayed on your iOS device within seconds.\n\n• Sweet application support—Prowl has support from a bunch of cool applications and services. Check out the full list at http://prowlapp.com/apps.php\n\n• Redirections—Launch a different application when you open a push notification. For example, a notification from your desktop Twitter client can relaunch into your favorite mobile client. You can even pick custom URLs to launch, so you can go anywhere!\n\n• Email to push—Use your Prowl email address (from the Prowl homepage's \"API keys\" tab) to get email delivery right on your device. Generate as many email addresses as you need!\n\n• An amazing API—Use the Prowl API with a multitude of libraries in various programming languages. You can send notifications from anything that can talk to the internet, and do some fun things along with it.\n\n• Quiet Hours—During the hours you specify, only the badge numbers are updated. No matter the source. Instead of getting a noisy alert, messages are quietly delivered. You can allow emergency-priority items to break quiet hours.\n\n• Do Not Disturb—Keep the application quiet whenever you're busy, or when you need a break from a constant alert. Controllable from within the application.\n\n• Control—Open the edit view to get a quick glance at your notifications, and do away with pesky ones. Quickly copy, email or SMS a notification directly from Prowl (depending on device and iOS version).\n\n• Browse quickly—Use Prowl's internal browser to quickly open links from a notification without having to open Safari.\n\n• History—Up to 10 days of notifications are kept on the server. You can delete notifications that you don't want to see any more, or remove all of your history.\n\n• Customized notifications—Only events you want are sent to Prowl. You can specify all kinds of conditions from the Prowl plugin for Growl.\n\n• Send any message to your device—From the Prowl website, you can send any text to your device: links and phone numbers are automatically linked, so you can easily navigate around without having to worry about typos. From the website or API, you can also automatically redirect to the attached URL.\n\nSETUP\nProwl is built into Growl 2.0. For earlier versions: http://prowlapp.com/installation.php — for Mac.\nhttp://growlforwindows.com — for Windows.\n\nSUPPORT\n@prowlapp on Twitter\nhttp://prowlapp.com/support.php"

But I was unable to find a complication that provided an astronomically accurate moon display...which just kinda bothered me.  So I made Geneva Moon.\n\nGeneva Moon seeks to provide a highly accurate, visually pleasing indication of what the moon looks like right now, right where you are.  My goal was to make it so that if you look down at your wrist and then up into the sky the images you see should match.  \n\nIt includes a robust set of complications for every watch face type.  \n\nChoose between either a visually rich 'actual ' appearance or a more simplified version, to fit your own personal style.\n\nThe main display indicates the current azimuth and elevation of the moon along the horizon along with a visual indication of its phase and orientation. \n\nRotate the Digital Crown to shift forward and backwards through time and see how the moon will shift (tap on the screen to reset to now)\n\nOn Apple Watches equipped with a compass (Series 5) you can have Geneva Moon orient itself towards the actual moon to make it easier to locate the moon in the sky.\n\nThank you for considering Geneva Moon, I hope you enjoy having the moon on your wrist as much I do.  \n\n—Dave"

      "label": "TslaMirror for iOS \nTslaMirror is an App that will help your iPhone App mirroring to Tesla vehicle! Also, it can support App screencast to a Chrome browser.\n\nFor Tesla vehicle built-in browser\n1 Make sure the car is PARKED (0mph/0kph)! \n2 The Tesla vehicle network must be connected to the iOS device Personal Hotspot (cellular data needed) first. Tesla MCU2 hardware is needed. MCU2 is available on the Tesla Model \n3 Model Y, Model X (late than March 2018), Model S (late than March 2018), or the Tesla vehicles that are upgraded to MCU2 from MCU1.3 Start the TslaMirror App. Confirm \"Tesla Proxy\" switch is on in the TslaMirror App\n4 Click the \"Start\" button, then click \"Start Broadcast\" to start Screen Broadcast in the TslaMirror App\n5 Access the link http://240.3.3.3 via Tesla vehicle in-car browser\n6 Pinch the Tesla vehicle built-in browser screen to zoom in/out the picture\n7 There is no audio support for the moment. Only the App screen will be mirrored to the browser. You can use the Bluetooth audio link to the Tesla vehicle play the audio of the iOS device simultaneously during the App mirroring.\n8 Do not lock the screen. The Screen Broadcast API limitation needs the screen to keep unlocked. Once the screen is locked, Screen Broadcast needs to be restarted.\n\nFor normal desktop browser\n1 Devices are on the same Wi-Fi network\n2 Start the TslaMirror App.\n3 Click the \"Start\" button to start Screen Broadcast in the TslaMirror App\n4 Access the link below the \"Stop\" button via a normal desktop browser (Safari or Chrome)\n\nKey Features\n1 No extra internet traffic for the screencast, the App mirroring traffic is only locally on iOS device Personal Hotspot. However, please note that during the screenshot, the Tesla vehicle will use the hotspot traffic for its internet access when the hotspot is connected\n2 No extra hardware needed\n3 Private, the screencast is only available to the devices connected to the iOS Personal Hotspot Wi-Fi network\n4 Fast network\n5 5GHz Personal Hotspot(iPhone 12 series supports it) Wi-Fi is highly recommended. Do not enable the \"Maximize Compatibility\" setting for iPhone 12 series. By default, iPhone 12 series come with a 5GHz Wi-Fi Personal Hotspot. Once the \"Maximize Compatibility\" setting enabled, it will go back to the 2.4GHz Wi-Fi hotspot.\n\nFAQ\n1 This is not CarPlay\n2 iOS Apps that use the AVPlayer framework cannot be supported, such as the Apple Music App and Netflix App. For the Apple Music App, although the screen can be streamed to the browser, the audio part will be muted during the Screen Broadcast.\n3 Netflix App not supported\n\nPrivacy/Security notice: This App does not collect any statistics, personal information, or analytics from our users.This Application does use Location service to access Wi-Fi access point network name on iOS 13 or later.

      "label": "Sunnytrack transforms your device into a professional tool for planning sunlight, the sun’s position, path and shadows for every place in the world (and at every time) accurately, on the map or in AR. Whether for photography, real estate, your new flat or house, gardening, photovoltaics or all outdoor activities: sunlight, sun position and shadows play a major role. See sun’s elevation, its direction, exact sun movement over day and year, objects’ shadows, shadow lengths, shadow differences between seasons, and more.\n\nRECOMMENDED BY PROFESSIONALS:\n\n„This app is awesome! It has helped me to align the PV modules (solar panels) optimally.“ – Jürgen\n\n„For me as a photographer Sunnytrack is an extremely practical tool. Always knowing the sun’s position in real time brings enormous relief. Planning photo shootings becomes significantly easier.“ – Aki from Akigrafie Live\n\n„I am absolutely thrilled. I work in the real estate industry and can now use AR to check with my clients when the sun is shining on the balcony. Amazed customers guaranteed.“ – Toni K.\n\n„It's very useful and professional. It helps me coordinate my trips.“ – Dino\n\nPHILOSOPHY: No ads. No user tracking. Sunnytrack tracks the sun, but only the sun, not the user! For sure. This app is a professional product. It can be bought for a one-time price to get all the high quality features it offers at once, without distracting ads or the need for further in app purchases.\n\n• CREATORS (in photography/filming) all over the world love Sunnytrack not only for its easy usage but also for the extensive functionality it offers. With it you're guaranteed to not miss a perfect scene and optimal light – during the day, Golden Hour or Blue Hour, for instance. Precise, location-dependent planning of the sun’s position and natural lighting of your subjects are extremely relevant in photography – whether capturing landscapes, objects or humans.\n\n• You would like to know the effective AMOUNT OF SUNLIGHT a flat or house/property offers? During Winter, when days are shorter? Get a general picture in advance on Maps or impress at site visits and property tours with showing the sun’s path at the kitchen window for the whole year, live in 3D in your camera image using Augmented Reality (AR)! It’s an insiders’ tip for real estate agents, house builders or interested individuals in general.\n\n• PHOTOVOLTAICS: Sunnytrack provides professional support in placing, adjusting and optimizing your solar modules. Where does sun rise, where does it set? See the differences between the seasons at your location.\n\n• We love green! We love GARDENS. Plan your garden with Sunnytrack. Simulate the exact shadows of multiple objects in Shadow Simulation mode, by adding them on the map defining their heights. For example, you can see the length and impact of shadows casted by objects like houses or a trees when the sun follows its path.\n\n• SAVE all planned scenes, sun paths, shadow simulations and your places for later use.\n\n• As you can see in the screenshots, DAY VIEW provides precise, location-dependent information on the sun like day length, solar noon, sunrise, sunset and twilight times (like Blue Hour, Golden Hour, Astronomical Twilight, …)\n\n• For all OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES Sunnytrack wants to be your faithful companion as a sun tracker and planner. Whether in cities, in the mountains or when touring through valleys, meadows and fields, the app develops its full potential: on Maps, live in AR or even in advance when planning.\n\n\nNOTE:\n\nIdeas and feedback are very welcome. Please use the provided feedback function in the app.\n\nAR 3D functionality: Sunnytrack shows the sun’s position and path based on the orientation of your device with high precision. For identifying its orientation, your devices’ internal sensors are used. In order to achieve exact results, a calibration can be required by moving your device in a figure-eight-pattern and keeping it away of metallic objects."

Developed specifically with energy consumption in mind, Battery Grapher has almost no impact on battery life. \n\nSMART PREDICTIONS\nBattery Grapher uses historical battery levels to intelligently predict what your battery level will be throughout the rest of the day, allowing you to plan when to next charge your device. The longer you have Battery Grapher installed, the more accurate future battery level predictions will be.\n\nLOW ENERGY CONSUMPTION\nBattery Grapher is made for people who want to extend the battery life, meaning that low energy usage is a priority. The app runs a background task only once an hour, and doesn't require a network connection, which keeps energy consumption extremely low.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE NOTIFICATIONS \nBattery Grapher allows you to set notifications that fit your needs. You can  get the app to notify you when you battery drops below a preset percentage, or if you only have a certain number of hours left before your battery runs out. (currently only available on watchOS)\n\nALL COMPLICATIONS & WIDGET SIZES SUPPORTED\nBattery Grapher supports all complications & widget sizes. Complications can show hours before needing to charge, or battery %. Both complications and widgets are customizable from within the app."

This is because the clock mechanism is influenced by temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, breeze and others environmental conditions and therefore requires frequent adjustment.\n\nWhen you are regulating the pendulum of your Cuckoo Clock today, you are attempting to achieve the best timekeeping possible by a trail and error method by lifting the pendulum bob up or down and hope for a better accuracy.\nUsing this app you can finally get a reading of your Clock ticks timing and precisely calibrate it to a known value.\n\n\nHow to calibrate your Clock using this app:\n1.\tRun this App and measure your Clock timings using the iPhone microphone\n2.\tUse the Signal Gain and the Detection Threshold sliders to adjust the measured signal\n3.\tSelect a reference timing for calibration from the clock reference table or set your own reference timing\n4.\tRead the accuracy level of your clock vs. the reference timing\n5.\tAdjust your Clock pendulum bob to get the best accuracy!\n6.     Review how many seconds/minutes your Clock will gain or lose per day based on your current calibration\n\nThe app will presents your Clock beats period reading as well as BPH (beats per hour) and BPM (beats per minutes) values.\nAn accurate waveform display of the microphone signal will help you to adjust the tick readings for the best measurement.\nAnimated Indicators will guide you through the calibration process.\n\nManage the app Reference Timings table and add user defined clocks in addition to the predefined ones to support all your clocks.\n\nThis app will turn your iPhone into a powerful measurement tool which normally costs hundreds of dollars."

It can be very dangerous If the cable is too small, as the cable will heat up and potentially cause a fire. On contrast an oversized cables might cause energy or money waste.\n\nFormula:\nVDI = (Amps x Distance)/(%Volt Drop x Voltage)\n\nVDI - Voltage Drop Index (a reference number based on resistance of wire)\nDistance - One way wiring distance in feet\n%Volt Drop = acceptable voltage drop \n\nCable Size by cross-sectional area [Cooper]\nmm² = VDI x 1.1 \n\nThe voltage drop value will vary depending on your application. The standard 2% are use to ensure delivering full potential to any needed electrical source. And 5% or more voltage drop is more common in automotive applications. \n\nSafety Guide:\n- Cable sizes should only be used as a guideline and all figures should be checked against the manufacturers data sheet. \n- Cables should be fused / current protected to their max rating or less.\n\nThanks for your support and do visit nitrio.com for more apps for your iOS devices."

      "label": "Rowmote lets you seamlessly control audio, video, and presentation applications on your Mac from your iOS device.\n\nYou love the remote control which came with your Mac - so simple yet elegant, with easy control of Front Row, iTunes, Quicktime, DVD Player, Keynote, and more.\n\nOr, your Mac didn’t come with a remote control or doesn’t even have an infrared port. Buying a remote control, from Apple or a third party, would carry a significant cost!\n\nYou carry your iPhone or iPod Touch wherever you go... so why should you carry a second device just to control your computer?  Furthermore, why should you need line-of-sight to do so?\n\nEnter Rowmote!  Rowmote is like your Mac’s remote control, but over the wireless network and even better! By tapping the Apps button, you get bonus abilities, switching between controlled programs, toggling the iTunes Visualizer, and more. Rowmote will even wake sleeping Macs.\n\nFEATURES\n\n - Control your Mac over a wireless network. No line of sight necessary.\n\n - Functions just like the hardware Apple Remote Control in:\n• Adobe Lightroom\n• Airfoil Video\n• Amarra\n• Aperture\n• BBC iPlayer\n• Beamer\n• Boxee\n• Decibel\n• DVD Player\n• Ecoute\n• eyeTV 3.x\n• Firefox\n• Front Row\n• Hulu Desktop\n• iPhoto\n• iTunes\n• Keynote ‘08 & later\n• kJams Pro\n• Kodi\n• Last.fm\n• Logic\n• Microsoft Powerpoint ‘04 & later\n• mPlayer\n• Movist\n• OpenOffice Impress\n• Preview\n• PandoraBoy\n• PandoraJam\n• PandoraOne Desktop\n• Photos\n• Plex, Plex Home Theater, & Plex Media Player\n• Quicktime\n• Rdio\n• Safari\n• Skim\n• Songbird\n• Spotify\n• Squire\n• The Tube\n• VLC\n• xbmc (Xbox Media Center)\n\n- SWITCH: Access your Mac’s Dock, launching & switch between all controllable applications on the Mac, toggle the iTunes visualizer, and more. Order & display customizable.\n\n - Click-and-hold works just like on the physical remote in applications; for example, holding the right button fast-forwards, while a single click is ‘next’. This is a feature no other iPhone remote control I know of does properly!\n\n- Sleep on demand; wake the Mac automatically\n- Pause the music or video automatically when you answer a call on your iPhone\n- Proximity sensor support to automatically turn the screen off if the device is face-down\n- Secure authentication\n- Optional dark interface\n- Connect via WiFi or Bluetooth (Bluetooth requires Personal Hotspot Bluetooth tethering)\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n • Mac OS X 10.4.0 or later.\n • Mac: The free Rowmote Helper program must be running on the Mac to be controlled. Download at www.rowmote.com. Some features require later versions of Mac OS X.\n\nRowmote is a steal! Couple it with Apple’s free Remote app to turn your iPhone or iPod Touch into the ultimate controller for home stereo, mobile presentation, or casual video viewing.\n\nThe artwork of Rowmote was designed by Rik Schennink."

      "label": "With SatFinder you can adjust your satellite antenna in a few seconds and with 4 simple steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - CHOOSE YOUR ANTENNA\nChoose one of the four different antenna designs: \n - Offset antennas (the most common, is slightly oval, the LNB is not in the center).\n - Special design (e.g. Oblong shaped Offset antenna, Multifeed antenna)  \n - Parabolic antenna (LNB is located in the center of the reflector, usually larger than 100cm)\n - Flat or planar antenna (small, camping antennas)\n\nIf you have an offset antenna, enter the height and width of the antenna. If your antenna has a special shape, enter the offset angle and the size of the satellite antenna. You can find the offset angle in the manual of your satellite antenna. For parabolic antennas it is sufficient to enter the antenna diameter. With a flat antenna you do not have to set anything. If you know the exact antenna name, check if your antenna is already in the database.\n\nTip: Press the wizard button to measure the size of the satellite antenna using the iPhone camera and LiDAR scanner. \n\nSTEP 2 - CHOOSE YOUR SATELLITE\nTo quickly and easily select a suitable satellite, simply press the \"AUTO\" button. The SatFinder will now automatically search for satellites that are in your reception area and that offer TV or radio stations in your language (the language setting of your iPhone will be selected). The stars (1-10) shown in the table result from the number of radio and TV channels offered and the reception strength at your location.  \n\nIf you want to receive a special satellite, switch off \"AUTO\": Now you can simply scroll through the table and select the satellite. Faster is the search function - just enter the name of the satellite, the channel or the orbit position. You can also reduce the number of table entries by hiding satellites that are not available at your location or do not broadcast in your language. With the button \"Channel Info\" you can check which channels the selected satellite is currently broadcasting - including all channel parameters for your satellite receiver.  \n\nSTEP 3 - CHECK OBSTACLES\nFor a smooth satellite reception, there must not be any obstacles between the satellite and your satellite antenna. You can check this with the \"View\" function. Simply aim at the satellite and watch the signs (GREEN - no obstacle, RED - caution, free view may not be given).\n\nTip: Press the button for the assistant to activate the voice output.\n\nSTEP 4 - ADJUST ANTENNA\nIn the menu item \"Align\" different graphics appear depending on the selected antenna type. If you use an offset antenna, you have to adjust the azimuth and elevation separately. With planar or parabolic antennas the adjustment of the angles is done together. Before you press the \"Start\" button, a video clip shows how to position your iPhone at the antenna. \n\nTip: Press the button for the assistant to activate the voice output.\n\nSTEP 5 - FINE TUNING \nIf necessary, you can optimize the reception of your satellite system. The SatFinder provides you with the function \"FineTuning\". To use this function, you need a second iOS device. One device serves as a camera; the second device as a monitor. Simply place an iPhone in front of your reception screen and observe changes in picture quality while slightly rotating or tilting your satellite antenna. With the FineTuning feature, you'll have visual contact with your TV even when you're out of sight. \n\nTHAT'S IT. YOU SHOULD NOW BE ABLE TO ENJOY INTERFERENCE-FREE SATELLITE RECEPTION... \nNote: Satellite antenna tuning is only available on iOS devices with LiDAR sensor (e.g. iPhone 12 Pro)."

      "label": "-------------------------\n\nPreviously the #1 App worldwide in all categories according to applyzer.com!  Thank you for your support.  We have more updates coming soon!\n\nBluetooth Photo Share Pro does not display any Advertisements.  Other than that is basically the same as the free version right now, except that we are working on new \"pro-only\" features that will be coming soon!  Please support us and buy now!\n\n-------------------------\n\nTransfer photos and/or contacts between two iPhones and/or iPod Touches over bluetooth.  Requires iPhone 3G or later or 2nd generation iPod Touch or later (Bluetooth data transfer cannot be supported on the original iPhone or original iPod Touch due to hardware limitations).  Does not require any 3G or WiFi connection.\n\nThis is the best bluetooth photo sharing app out there!!\n\nHere are some features that make this app stand out:\n- Unlike some other photo sharing apps, Bluetooth Photo Share does not scale down or do any lossy compression of your photos before transferring.  In other words, the receiver gets the exact image that was in the sender's photo library.\n- Allows you to transfer contacts from your address book.\n- The receiver transfer screen includes a thumbnail preview of the photo AS IT IS BEING TRANSFERRED and a cancel button so that you can cancel the transfer if you decide you do not want it.\n- Shows a scrollable list of thumbnails and file sizes for all of the images that you've received.\n- Allows you to view your photo albums that your photos were saved in.\n- Select Multiple Photos\n\nWe are also working on some great new features that we hope you'll really like.  We have a website: http://iphonemart.net.  Also check us out on twitter at http://www.twitter.com/iphonemart\n\n-------------------------\n\nMost of the time, the app works great.  However, when people experience problems, 99% of the time it is related to connecting with bluetooth, which would be the same for any bluetooth App.  If you have any trouble connecting, please check our support webpage for troubleshooting information.\n\nNote that if you are trying to transfer photos from your old phone or to/from your computer, there is no way to do that on the iPhone with bluetooth."

      "label": "This tool shows you the ultimate precise time of day. To achieve this, it uses a special internet time protocol to fetch the time from an atomic time server.\n\nWe are proud to offer version 5 of the Gorgy Timing Atomic Clock. The program is one of the classic applications since the early days of the Apple App Store and has been continually improved based on user feedback.\n\nThe Gorgy Timing Atomic Clock shows the precise time of day. To achieve this, it uses a special internet time protocol to fetch the ultimate precise time from cesium atomic clocks available on the internet, or any other time server you like.\n\nThe graphical display mimics the clock display of the legendary Gorgy Timing clocks, which are used in professional radio and television studios, and we spent much effort to bring the original feeling of these wickedly expensive clocks to your iPhone. This app is used by BBC studios, astronomers, concert promoters, etc. \n\nVersion 5 contains the following functions:\n\n* Universal support for all iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices running iOS 8 or higher (including iPhone 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, and all of the latest iPads and iPads Pro)\n* Optimized for iOS 13 and watchOS 6, full 64 bit support\n* Alarm function with snooze (touch anywhere on the screen), volume fade-in, based on weekdays\n* Alarm time based on seconds (not minutes)\n* Local time / UTC time mode\n* Alarm notification window instead of normal alarm sound, if app is not running or in the background\n* Use playlists or a manual picker selection from your own music library as alarm sounds\n* The alarm sound is also playing when the device is muted, or the display is switched off, and also works in AirPlay environments\n* Customizable time server sources\n* Colors: green, red, blue, yellow, white, dark green, violet, pink, orange, turquoise and hidden, with a separate color option for digits, seconds and segments\n* Alternative visual display of fractional seconds (1/60th sec. resolution)\n* 12/24 hours display\n* Optional second tick sound\n* Full landscape support (including settings dialog)\n* Touching the display lets the buttons and status bar fade out\n* Touching the display again will add the current date (in all orientations)\n* Disabled screen auto-lock\n* Options \"sync at startup\", \"hourly\", \"daily\", or a sync button for manual syncing\n* The last known time delta is used when started without sync\n* \"Night mode\", which dims the display using a slider, shows the seconds with only one dot (to prevent a hard brightness switch between second 59 and second 0), switches off the tick sound, and reduces screen updates to save battery\n* To minimize burn-in effects (especially on the iPhone X OLED display), the clock is doing micro movements when running longer than 5 minutes\n* VoiceOver support\n\nAnswers to common questions:\n\n* An application can not set your device's system time, so a time sync between the atomic time and the device time is not possible.\n* If you want to wakeup with music, please do not exit the app before going to sleep (which would result in a local notification dialog without music in the morning), and do not lock your device. Be aware that running an application all the time, even without display, consumes battery, so please make sure that your iPhone is fully charged before you go to bed, connect it to your charger, or use the app's Night mode, which is much more energy-saving."

Typewise is different. It’s the first keyboard that is specifically designed for smartphones. It’s revolutionary yet easy to use, and after a couple of messages you’ll love it.\n \n80% FEWER TYPOS\nA recent study with 37,000 participants showed that on current keyboards 1 out of 5 words contains typos. With Typewise you finally get rid of these ARRGGHH-moments. Thanks to the hexagon layout, keys are 70% larger and much easier to hit. This reduces typos by 80%.\n\nINTUITIVE GESTURES\nSwipe up to capitalize a letter, swipe left to delete or swipe right to restore. It's as simple as that.\n\nSMART AUTOCORRECT\nStop getting annoyed by wrong autocorrections or senseless predictions. Typewise learns what you type and helps you write that perfect sentence.\n\n100% PRIVACY\nWhat you write is personal. That's why the keyboard does NOT require “full access” and none of your typing data is transmitted to the cloud.\n\nSPEAKS YOUR LANGUAGES\nHaving to switch between different languages is cumbersome. With Typewise you can write in all your languages at once. Choose from 40+ languages and type in the accents you really need. Typewise supports:\n- English (United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada)\n- Afrikaans\n- Albanian\n- Basque\n- Breton\n- Catalan\n- Croatian\n- Czech\n- Danish\n- Dutch (Belgium, Netherlands)\n- Estonian\n- Filipino\n- Finnish\n- French (France, Canada, Switzerland)\n- Galician\n- German (Austria, Germany, Switzerland)\n- Hinglish\n- Hungarian\n- Icelandic\n- Indonesian\n- Irish\n- Italian\n- Latvian\n- Lithuanian\n- Malaysian\n- Norwegian\n- Polish\n- Portuguese (Portugal, Brazil)\n- Romanian\n- Serbian\n- Slovak\n- Slovene\n- Spanish\n- Swedish\n- Swiss German\n- Turkish\n\nSUPPORTED DEVICES\nTypewise is optimized for iPhones with iOS 12 or later."

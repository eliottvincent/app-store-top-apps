      "label": "This professional tool called Clinometer is the most precise (all you can get with some calculations) slope measurement tool for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad using all sides of the device plus the camera. It can be used for simple applications like aligning a frame as well as for more sophisticated fields of applications where an arbitrary slope needs to be measured exactly. Read the reviews (and write your own) for all the applications you find! Thank for all your positive feedback! Please use our support link if you have questions and suggestions, we don't read the iTunes reviews every day!\n\nWith this tool, the slope can be measured by all edges of the device and through the camera. The current features include:\n\n◆ 3 Modes (incl. auto switching): Clinometer mode (auto when holding upright), Camera mode (any direction, manual activation) and Bubble level (smoothly fading in when holding flat).\n\n◆ Relative angles: Besides measuring absolute angles, for every mode you can measure the relative angle between device positions\n\n◆ Advanced two way calibration on all sides: For every 4 sides plus the bubble mode you can calibrate in two steps, which allows you to calibrate exactly even on non-level surfaces. Each direction can be calibrated individually to achieve the optimal precision. \n\n◆ Speech synthesis: The device will speak the current reading, so you don't have to watch the display while measuring/aligning your object.\n\n◆ Five different unit modes: The device can display the slope in degrees (rounded or in tenth of degrees), percentage, rise over run (common for roof slope measurement in :12) and 1V:H (common in engineering)\n\n◆ Dial Rotation: You can smoothly rotate the background dial and thus define which side of the device represents 0° and 90° degrees. \n\n◆ Motion-sensitive Lock feature: Besides the common instant simple tap hold mechanism you can activate the motion-sensitive lock. If activated the device waits for the final lock until you hold your device steady enough for at least 2 seconds. You can set the lock sensitivity between 0.1° and 1.0° degrees. \n\n◆ Peer Mode: Use two devices to measure angles: One as a display, the other as the measurement device that can be attached to the hardware you want to align. \n\n◆ Fullscreen Mode: The full screen mode can be toggled by tapping the center of the screen and by the upper and lower arrows in the center. This prevents you from erroneous inputs while measuring.\n\n◆ Different color schemes: Press the S/C Button to instantly switch the color. The color can be selected differently for the bubble and the clinometer mode. The predefined color sets include day and night color schemes (Black on White, White on Black and Red). \n\n◆ Adjustable Auto-Lock: You can prevent the device from turning into the sleep mode. \n\nAccording to wikipedia: An inclinometer or clinometer is an instrument for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or inclination of an object with respect to gravity. It is also known as a tilt meter, tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. \n\nFor recreational use only. After the calibration it CAN (!) be very accurate especially for the main axis after calibration. The measurement is performed as well as possible (we try our best) by using the three inbuilt accelerometers. \n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! \n\nWe will improve the application long-term. This was the first application of this kind shortly after the opening of the App Store. Since then it is continuously updated and enriched with new features."

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here. Chromecast is a trademark of Google LLC."

      "label": "Convenience on the wrist - Watch app for Tesla is the ideal companion in day to day life with your Tesla vehicle. These are just a few of the day to day conveniences this app will help achieve:\n\n - Pair your watch as a proper vehicle key, just like your phone! Works under all conditions, including in underground parking garages or in the middle of a desert!\n\n - Forgot to plug in? Get a notification if vehicle is in a pre-configured location and not plugged in - all done directly on the watch, no external servers required, keeping your privacy!\n\n - Add the graphic corner complication to your watch face and enjoy the convenience of having easy access to state of charge, charging indicator, time remaining if charging, sentry mode active indicator and indicator if any windows, doors or trunks are open. All from one complication, that also will launch the app when tapped. \n\n - During and after charge, a panel will show how much energy was added. Convenient if you schedule your charge during the night - wake up each morning and easily check how much energy was added to the battery. \n\n - If you have multiple vehicles on your account, tap the vehicle name to quickly and easily switch between them. \n\n - You can queue up commands by tapping on buttons, then put your wrist down and the commands will execute in the background when the vehicle is successfully woken up. \n\n - When you tap the unlock vehicle button, the charge port will also unlock if a charging cable is attached. That's convenience right there!\n\n - Want to reduce phantom drain? Background updates can be configured to longer intervals between updates or to only update if car is already awake or can be disabled entirely for absolutely zero impact on phantom drain.\n\n - A warning panel will show up if any doors, windows or trunks are left open. Conveniently, you can tap the panel to close any open windows.\n\n - Need to access the frunk? Just do it from your wrist - no fiddling with your phone. \n\n - Sitting comfy in the couch, but just remembered you have a road-trip in the morning? Set the charge limit to 100% - or any value really - and start charging, right from the convenience of your wrist!\n\n - Leaving the office after a long hot day? Activate the HVAC when you're on your way, and enjoy a nice cool vehicle.\n\n - When charging, tap the time remaining label to switch to show time of expected completion - no more head calculus!\n\n - Need to run a quick errand, but you don't have your phone? Unlock your vehicle from your wrist, then activate remote start and off you go. Just please be mindful that this feature requires internet connectivity on both watch and vehicle - so don't drive into the desert and leave your vehicle, or you'll get stuck there!\n\nA note about security and privacy:\nThis app accepts two types of login. Either Tesla account credentials or a Tesla API token. Your account credentials are never stored in the app, but are used only once to obtain an authentication token and refresh token directly from the Tesla API server. If you would rather supply that token yourself, you can do so instead. It is required to supply a refresh token. Your token will be persisted in the app. Tokens will be revoked if you change your Tesla account password. No network traffic will ever be emitted from this app that goes anywhere other than directly to the Tesla API servers, unless the OPTIONAL cloud processing is enabled, in which case an in-flight encrypted ACCESS token with a lifespan of 8 hours will be transmitted and stored ONLY WHILE COMMAND IS EXECUTING. The source code for this application will at all times be made available to any security researcher for a voluntary security and safety audit. \n\nDisclaimer: \nThis app is not endorsed by Tesla Inc. Use at your own risk. No guarantee of proper function is given. Only you are responsible for any changes to your car caused by using this app.  \n\nMade in Denmark"

      "label": "Sunnytrack transforms your device into a professional tool for planning sunlight, the sun’s position, path and shadows for every place in the world (and at every time) accurately, on the map or in AR. Whether for photography, real estate, your new flat or house, gardening, photovoltaics or all outdoor activities: sunlight, sun position and shadows play a major role. See sun’s elevation, its direction, exact sun movement over day and year, objects’ shadows, shadow lengths, shadow differences between seasons, and more.\n\nRECOMMENDED BY PROFESSIONALS:\n\n„This app is awesome! It has helped me to align the PV modules (solar panels) optimally.“ – Jürgen\n\n„For me as a photographer Sunnytrack is an extremely practical tool. Always knowing the sun’s position in real time brings enormous relief. Planning photo shootings becomes significantly easier.“ – Aki from Akigrafie Live\n\n„I am absolutely thrilled. I work in the real estate industry and can now use AR to check with my clients when the sun is shining on the balcony. Amazed customers guaranteed.“ – Toni K.\n\n„It's very useful and professional. It helps me coordinate my trips.“ – Dino\n\nPHILOSOPHY: No ads. No user tracking. Sunnytrack tracks the sun, but only the sun, not the user! For sure. This app is a professional product. It can be bought for a one-time price to get all the high quality features it offers at once, without distracting ads or the need for further in app purchases.\n\n• CREATORS (in photography/filming) all over the world love Sunnytrack not only for its easy usage but also for the extensive functionality it offers. With it you're guaranteed to not miss a perfect scene and optimal light – during the day, Golden Hour or Blue Hour, for instance. Precise, location-dependent planning of the sun’s position and natural lighting of your subjects are extremely relevant in photography – whether capturing landscapes, objects or humans.\n\n• You would like to know the effective AMOUNT OF SUNLIGHT a flat or house/property offers? During Winter, when days are shorter? Get a general picture in advance on Maps or impress at site visits and property tours with showing the sun’s path at the kitchen window for the whole year, live in 3D in your camera image using Augmented Reality (AR)! It’s an insiders’ tip for real estate agents, house builders or interested individuals in general.\n\n• PHOTOVOLTAICS: Sunnytrack provides professional support in placing, adjusting and optimizing your solar modules. Where does sun rise, where does it set? See the differences between the seasons at your location.\n\n• We love green! We love GARDENS. Plan your garden with Sunnytrack. Simulate the exact shadows of multiple objects in Shadow Simulation mode, by adding them on the map defining their heights. For example, you can see the length and impact of shadows casted by objects like houses or a trees when the sun follows its path.\n\n• SAVE all planned scenes, sun paths, shadow simulations and your places for later use.\n\n• As you can see in the screenshots, DAY VIEW provides precise, location-dependent information on the sun like day length, solar noon, sunrise, sunset and twilight times (like Blue Hour, Golden Hour, Astronomical Twilight, …)\n\n• For all OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES Sunnytrack wants to be your faithful companion as a sun tracker and planner. Whether in cities, in the mountains or when touring through valleys, meadows and fields, the app develops its full potential: on Maps, live in AR or even in advance when planning.\n\n\nNOTE:\n\nIdeas and feedback are very welcome. Please use the provided feedback function in the app.\n\nAR 3D functionality: Sunnytrack shows the sun’s position and path based on the orientation of your device with high precision. For identifying its orientation, your devices’ internal sensors are used. In order to achieve exact results, a calibration can be required by moving your device in a figure-eight-pattern and keeping it away of metallic objects."

Measurements are displayed on top of a target curve, making it easy to see where adjustment is needed.  Multiple measurements can be averaged to fully capture how the system sounds in the listening area.  With small changes and repeat measurements, you can manually tune your system to the target curve.  If your audio system has a parametric equalizer or convolution engine, HouseCurve can automatically generate filter settings to match the target curve.\n\nHouseCurve can help with home and car audio system tuning, from system equalization and room correction to subwoofer time alignment and speaker placement.  Visit housecurve.com for more information on how HouseCurve works and how to use it.\n\nFree trial - visit housecurve.com and give the HouseCurve app clip a try.\n\nHouseCurve will produce acceptable results with the built in iPhone/iPad microphone. Using calibrated external microphones will provide higher accuracy."

      "label": "iNet - explore your network!\nFind out about security risks and keep your network under control. Which devices are connected to my network? Are they online? Which services do they provide? Does somebody use my wifi network without my knowledge? These and other questions answers iNet fast and simple.\n\nWith iNet you know exactly what's going on! This easy to use App outlines a computer network even to the unexperienced user. And iNet never phones home, your data is absolutely private on your iPhone.\n\niNet provides you with information about networks your iPhone or iPod touch is connected to. Its very easy and user friendly design even allows the unexperienced user to get a profound and understandable overview of a network and the running services.\n\nIn the current release of iNet we implemented the following features:\n\n    • Network scan\n    • Ping\n    • Bonjour browser\n    • Portscan\n    • Device info\n    • Wake on Lan\n    • Sleep on Lan (Macintosh only)\n    • Extensive help section\n    • Send scan results via email\n\nScan Network:\niNet shows the devices connected to your local network, e. g. a computer or router, along with their name, IP and vendor. iNet discovers and distinguishes between windows and macintosh computers with different icons. For most Apple Computers the particular computer model can be seen. Find out the name, vendor and IP of the connected devices as well as the number of running Bonjour services on that particular device. (MAC and Vendor cannot be detected anymore since iOS 11) A classic portscan on the choosen device can also be performed.\n\nThe technology used in iNet scans on a very low level, therefore one can even find machines that don't want to be found, for instance a Mac OS X computer running in stealth mode.\n\nPing:\nPing is a computer network tool used to test whether a particular host is reachable across an IP network or not. The ping section in iNet enables you to find out if an IP exists (if its ping service is enabled; otherwise you will get no response :-)). For your convenience we added a bookmark function to store often needed addresses.\n\nBonjour browser:\nBonjour, also known as zero-configuration networking, enables automatic discovery of computers, devices, and services on IP networks. Bonjour uses industry standard IP protocols to allow devices to automatically discover each other without the need to enter IP addresses or configure DNS servers. The Bonjour-Browser in iNet scans the connected local network for Bonjour services, detecting any hardware that ist connected via the Bonjour protocol (for instance computer, router, printer, …) and any software running Bonjour services, e. g. iTunes or Filemaker.\n\nWake on lan:\nThe outstanding feature of our implementation is that it is very easy to use and simple to setup. For more information see iNet WOL, our stand-alone tool for WOL.\n\nPortscan:\nApplications on devices communicate with the outside world through so called TCP ports. iNet detects wether a port is open or closed. For all detected open ports the service using this port is displayed by its real name (if available).\n\nDevice Info: \nThe device info in iNet shows some information related to your iPhone or iPod touch, e. g. its name or its IP.\n\nFuture:\nThe modularisized structure of iNet allows to add more features and scanning methods in the future. We will implement by time more network monitoring tools, e. g. DNS-Querys, Traceroute, Whois lookup etc.. iNet Pro will be updated on a regular basis as before. In addition we released iNet for Mac in December 2010 - available via the App Store.\n\nIf you want to know what's going on in your local network - iNet Networks Scanner gives you a profound answer.\n\nP.s.: In case you need just the network scan feature of iNet Pro, use the free version iNet - Network Scanner.  You can always update to iNet Pro from within iNet to access its full feature set. \n\nP.p.s: iNet never \"phones home\"!"

Ishraq prayer is 10 to 12 minutes after sunrise. There is a misconception where Islamic websites and people use the word \"Ishraq\" and then give timings for actual Sunrise. Praying at sunrise is forbidden and must be performed after at least 10 minutes of sunrise. iPray for this reason adds 10 minutes to sunrise and labels it correctly as \"Ishraaq\".\n\n* Prayer Alerts will ONLY alert you with an initial Takbir. The full azan (and its length) is NOT supported by the iOS alert mechanism as there is a maximum limit of 30 seconds of audio playback."

The measurement can be initiated from an Apple Watch and the speed displayed on the watch face.\n\n  High Speed Video Recording \nAn additional speed tool records and processes a video, which enables SpeedClock to track small, fast object, such as flying balls, that can be difficult to catch with regular motion detection.   It also calculates additional parameters like acceleration.\n\nSynchronized Timing Gates \nA third speed instrument uses two iPhone/iPads equipped with motion detection to start and stop the timer and measure the speed. The distance between the devices is used as reference, and the speed is calculated based on the time taken by the object to travel between the 'Start' and 'Stop' devices. The time is transmitted wirelessly over WiFi or Bluetooth.\n\n  Distance Measurement \n The stadimeter uses the size of a known object, e.g. a car, to calculate the distance.  The clinometer uses your own height as reference, along with the angle of the iPhone, to estimate the distance to a point on the ground.  The distances obtained from either tool can then be used to calculate the speed.  \n\nSee a demo video at the application website (www.appmaker.se/speedClock)\n\nON LINE REVIEWS\n“All I can say is, Fantastic”\nhttp://www.madxperts.com/2010/12/03/measure-speed-app-speedclock-iphone-download/\n\n\"Wow, how cool is that!\"\nhttp://www.ithinkdiff.com/turn-iphone-speed-measuring-gun-speedclock-download/\n\n\"You really going to like this app\"\ndailyappshow.com/speedclock (video)\n\n\"A useful utility for anyone needing to measure speed\"\nappmodo.com/44581/\n\n\"Useful, easy to use and quite a bit of fun (4 of 5)\"\nappvader.com/2011/03/review-speedclock-iphone/\n\n\"speedClock is a useful app when you need to check the speed of yourself, or an object for exercise, racing or simple curiosity (4.5 of 5)\"\nwww.cooliphoneipadapps.com/2010/12/speedclock.html\n\n\"Astonishing\"\niphonelife.com/blog/5/speedclock-velocity-radar-099-app-lets-you-use-camera-measure-speed-objects\n\n\"It is a pleasure to use and operate.

See the ratings and reviews for yourself. \n\nOther apps simply blow up the video preview without active stabilization resulting in terrible picture quality. Binoculars actually processes the full resolution photo sensor as fast as possible and then crops in on that full resolution photo image resulting in a much higher quality enlargement and a much more useful image. \n\nWhy pack binoculars when they can now be a part of your phone? Zoom in up to 32x (on latest iOS devices with Telephoto Lens) and up to 16x on older devices. For a closer look at nature, sporting events, or someone in the distance use our digital binoculars for high-resolution photo or video while in extreme zoom mode.\n\nFrom i4software, creators of Vizzywig, Flashlight and Fast Camera!\n\n• Binoculars incorporates GPS technology and displays your location on the map, shows your latitude and longitude coordinates, and remembers the exact location of your pictures. \n\n• Binoculars’ simple user-interface makes it fast and easy to use for all ages.\n\n• Includes Google Cardboard mode in landscape orientation."

The built in magnetometer can be used to detect these magnetic fields.\n\n◆ How it works:\n    • Remove any cover or frame that contains magnetic or metallic parts from your iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad. Magnetic and metallic parts are disturbing the measurement!\n\n    • Start the App.\n\n    • Move your iPhone slowly close to the area where you suspect a power line carrying voltage.\n\n▸If a voltage is present the display will flash and the mG reading grows while the message \"Voltage detected\" appears.\nNote: mG stands for milliGauss, which is used to measure the strength of a magnetic field.\n\n\nYou may want to test it before use by slowly moving it to an area where you are sure there is a voltage present, like the cable running to your room light. Computer and electronic devices are not the best choice to test the fundtion of the app, they are often heavily shielded against magnetic and electric fields (which denies a proper reading since a shielding alwaysx works both ways).\n\nHave fun with this handy tool!"

Maintaining husbandry tasks, testing, stability, water changes, inhabitant stats etc. are all vital to keeping successful aquariums. \n\nPocket Marine was designed to make inputting, storing and keeping all information with you at ease. Often, any issues that we have with our aquariums can be linked to actions that were performed a short time beforehand. For this reason, a log of changes made, actions performed or additions can be vital when trying to decipher a problem that may be in play. Pen and paper has always been a great way to keep this information at hand but, Pocket Marine offers a place to store this somewhere that, this day and age, is with us at all times.\n\nNot just for tracking events. Pocket Marine is a great way to help you log your inhabitants into specific tanks, record your latest water change for your mixed reef tank or simply log your latest maintenance action performed on the fish only office tank. Recording your information couldnt be easier and keeping it on your mobile device saves on that frantic search incase of needing the information at a later date.\n\nHelp with that last second impulse buy at the store. With an in depth library of over 800 species of fish, invertebrates and coral and being added to daily, you will always have the information on hand that you need to make that informed decision on a purchase. \n\nWe hope you enjoy using the app and that we can help with your success in the hobby and welcome any feature requests you may have.\n\nHappy Reefing!"

Length, distance, area of any surface… Measure everything with this virtual ruler and tape measure thanks to augmented reality. \n\nMeasuring a length is now easier than with a laser meter or any other measure tool. You draw your measurement lines in 3D thanks to the camera directly on the video of your phone or tablet. You export your plans in PDF, PNG or DXF. CamToPlan is the AR measuring app that brings your measures from cam…to…plan !\n\nFor personal or professional use, always measure like a pro. Thanks to Virtual Reality (VR), you can measure floors, dimensions of walls, windows, doors or a whole home in a few seconds. No more tape measure or ruler needed!\n\nThis app has infinite applications for everybody:\n- Personal use: the length measure app for the handyman who loves DIY !\n- Real estate professionals (real estate agent, interior design decorator or designer, architect, topographer, energy adviser...): this app will help you make a floorplan of a house, apartment, a specific room of a flat.\n- Construction workers can use it to quickly measure jobs : concreter, tile layer, carpet fitter, painter, drywall guy, plasterer, builder, carpenter, electrician, plumber, slater... \n- For gardener, landscaper, swimming pool builders and maintenance, digger, earth-moving, navvy: this app also works outside\n- Cost estimation professionals: this length measure app can make pricing estimates, it will be a great assistant for quantity surveyor, price studies technician, economist…\n- Building industry: foreman, site manager or engineer can drop their tape measure and ruler to perform a quick measurement check\n\nHow does this measuring app work?\nIt relies on ARKit by Apple. Machine learning algorithms combine the device sensors data (accelerometer, gyroscope…) with odometry which analyses in real time the video of the camera and relies on visual details of images, in order to scan the environment and find the position and rotation angle of the device.\n\nPlease note: \n- you can measure in metric (meters, centimeters) or imperial units (feet, inches)\n- the app measures distances horizontally (= on the ground) and vertically!\n- no need to remove the furniture from the room for measurements. The application determines the intersection between the floor and the target, even if it is hidden.\n- The application may have difficulty with some types of tiles.\n- The accuracy is not guaranteed.\n- you can move while performing measurements to get closer to your target point, for maximum precision, even if it is not visible and calculated by extrapolation."

      "label": "Rowmote lets you seamlessly control audio, video, and presentation applications on your Mac from your iOS device.\n\nYou love the remote control which came with your Mac - so simple yet elegant, with easy control of Front Row, iTunes, Quicktime, DVD Player, Keynote, and more.\n\nOr, your Mac didn’t come with a remote control or doesn’t even have an infrared port. Buying a remote control, from Apple or a third party, would carry a significant cost!\n\nYou carry your iPhone or iPod Touch wherever you go... so why should you carry a second device just to control your computer?  Furthermore, why should you need line-of-sight to do so?\n\nEnter Rowmote!  Rowmote is like your Mac’s remote control, but over the wireless network and even better! By tapping the Apps button, you get bonus abilities, switching between controlled programs, toggling the iTunes Visualizer, and more. Rowmote will even wake sleeping Macs.\n\nFEATURES\n\n - Control your Mac over a wireless network. No line of sight necessary.\n\n - Functions just like the hardware Apple Remote Control in:\n• Adobe Lightroom\n• Airfoil Video\n• Amarra\n• Aperture\n• BBC iPlayer\n• Beamer\n• Boxee\n• Decibel\n• DVD Player\n• Ecoute\n• eyeTV 3.x\n• Firefox\n• Front Row\n• Hulu Desktop\n• iPhoto\n• iTunes\n• Keynote ‘08 & later\n• kJams Pro\n• Kodi\n• Last.fm\n• Logic\n• Microsoft Powerpoint ‘04 & later\n• mPlayer\n• Movist\n• OpenOffice Impress\n• Preview\n• PandoraBoy\n• PandoraJam\n• PandoraOne Desktop\n• Photos\n• Plex, Plex Home Theater, & Plex Media Player\n• Quicktime\n• Rdio\n• Safari\n• Skim\n• Songbird\n• Spotify\n• Squire\n• The Tube\n• VLC\n• xbmc (Xbox Media Center)\n\n- SWITCH: Access your Mac’s Dock, launching & switch between all controllable applications on the Mac, toggle the iTunes visualizer, and more. Order & display customizable.\n\n - Click-and-hold works just like on the physical remote in applications; for example, holding the right button fast-forwards, while a single click is ‘next’. This is a feature no other iPhone remote control I know of does properly!\n\n- Sleep on demand; wake the Mac automatically\n- Pause the music or video automatically when you answer a call on your iPhone\n- Proximity sensor support to automatically turn the screen off if the device is face-down\n- Secure authentication\n- Optional dark interface\n- Connect via WiFi or Bluetooth (Bluetooth requires Personal Hotspot Bluetooth tethering)\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n • Mac OS X 10.4.0 or later.\n • Mac: The free Rowmote Helper program must be running on the Mac to be controlled. Download at www.rowmote.com. Some features require later versions of Mac OS X.\n\nRowmote is a steal! Couple it with Apple’s free Remote app to turn your iPhone or iPod Touch into the ultimate controller for home stereo, mobile presentation, or casual video viewing.\n\nThe artwork of Rowmote was designed by Rik Schennink."

      "label": "With SatFinder you can adjust your satellite antenna in a few seconds and with 4 simple steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - CHOOSE YOUR ANTENNA\nChoose one of the four different antenna designs: \n - Offset antennas (the most common, is slightly oval, the LNB is not in the center).\n - Special design (e.g. Oblong shaped Offset antenna, Multifeed antenna)  \n - Parabolic antenna (LNB is located in the center of the reflector, usually larger than 100cm)\n - Flat or planar antenna (small, camping antennas)\n\nIf you have an offset antenna, enter the height and width of the antenna. If your antenna has a special shape, enter the offset angle and the size of the satellite antenna. You can find the offset angle in the manual of your satellite antenna. For parabolic antennas it is sufficient to enter the antenna diameter. With a flat antenna you do not have to set anything. If you know the exact antenna name, check if your antenna is already in the database.\n\nTip: Press the wizard button to measure the size of the satellite antenna using the iPhone camera and LiDAR scanner. \n\nSTEP 2 - CHOOSE YOUR SATELLITE\nTo quickly and easily select a suitable satellite, simply press the \"AUTO\" button. The SatFinder will now automatically search for satellites that are in your reception area and that offer TV or radio stations in your language (the language setting of your iPhone will be selected). The stars (1-10) shown in the table result from the number of radio and TV channels offered and the reception strength at your location.  \n\nIf you want to receive a special satellite, switch off \"AUTO\": Now you can simply scroll through the table and select the satellite. Faster is the search function - just enter the name of the satellite, the channel or the orbit position. You can also reduce the number of table entries by hiding satellites that are not available at your location or do not broadcast in your language. With the button \"Channel Info\" you can check which channels the selected satellite is currently broadcasting - including all channel parameters for your satellite receiver.  \n\nSTEP 3 - CHECK OBSTACLES\nFor a smooth satellite reception, there must not be any obstacles between the satellite and your satellite antenna. You can check this with the \"View\" function. Simply aim at the satellite and watch the signs (GREEN - no obstacle, RED - caution, free view may not be given).\n\nTip: Press the button for the assistant to activate the voice output.\n\nSTEP 4 - ADJUST ANTENNA\nIn the menu item \"Align\" different graphics appear depending on the selected antenna type. If you use an offset antenna, you have to adjust the azimuth and elevation separately. With planar or parabolic antennas the adjustment of the angles is done together. Before you press the \"Start\" button, a video clip shows how to position your iPhone at the antenna. \n\nTip: Press the button for the assistant to activate the voice output.\n\nSTEP 5 - FINE TUNING \nIf necessary, you can optimize the reception of your satellite system. The SatFinder provides you with the function \"FineTuning\". To use this function, you need a second iOS device. One device serves as a camera; the second device as a monitor. Simply place an iPhone in front of your reception screen and observe changes in picture quality while slightly rotating or tilting your satellite antenna. With the FineTuning feature, you'll have visual contact with your TV even when you're out of sight. \n\nTHAT'S IT. YOU SHOULD NOW BE ABLE TO ENJOY INTERFERENCE-FREE SATELLITE RECEPTION... \nNote: Satellite antenna tuning is only available on iOS devices with LiDAR sensor (e.g. iPhone 12 Pro)."

      "label": "Convenience on the wrist - Watch app for Tesla is the ideal companion in day to day life with your Tesla vehicle. These are just a few of the day to day conveniences this app will help achieve:\n\n - Pair your watch as a proper vehicle key, just like your phone! Works under all conditions, including in underground parking garages or in the middle of a desert!\n\n - Forgot to plug in? Get a notification if vehicle is in a pre-configured location and not plugged in - all done directly on the watch, no external servers required, keeping your privacy!\n\n - Add the graphic corner complication to your watch face and enjoy the convenience of having easy access to state of charge, charging indicator, time remaining if charging, sentry mode active indicator and indicator if any windows, doors or trunks are open. All from one complication, that also will launch the app when tapped. \n\n - During and after charge, a panel will show how much energy was added. Convenient if you schedule your charge during the night - wake up each morning and easily check how much energy was added to the battery. \n\n - If you have multiple vehicles on your account, tap the vehicle name to quickly and easily switch between them. \n\n - You can queue up commands by tapping on buttons, then put your wrist down and the commands will execute in the background when the vehicle is successfully woken up. \n\n - When you tap the unlock vehicle button, the charge port will also unlock if a charging cable is attached. That's convenience right there!\n\n - Want to reduce phantom drain? Background updates can be configured to longer intervals between updates or to only update if car is already awake or can be disabled entirely for absolutely zero impact on phantom drain.\n\n - A warning panel will show up if any doors, windows or trunks are left open. Conveniently, you can tap the panel to close any open windows.\n\n - Need to access the frunk? Just do it from your wrist - no fiddling with your phone. \n\n - Sitting comfy in the couch, but just remembered you have a road-trip in the morning? Set the charge limit to 100% - or any value really - and start charging, right from the convenience of your wrist!\n\n - Leaving the office after a long hot day? Activate the HVAC when you're on your way, and enjoy a nice cool vehicle.\n\n - When charging, tap the time remaining label to switch to show time of expected completion - no more head calculus!\n\n - Need to run a quick errand, but you don't have your phone? Unlock your vehicle from your wrist, then activate remote start and off you go. Just please be mindful that this feature requires internet connectivity on both watch and vehicle - so don't drive into the desert and leave your vehicle, or you'll get stuck there!\n\nA note about security and privacy:\nThis app accepts two types of login. Either Tesla account credentials or a Tesla API token. Your account credentials are never stored in the app, but are used only once to obtain an authentication token and refresh token directly from the Tesla API server. If you would rather supply that token yourself, you can do so instead. It is required to supply a refresh token. Your token will be persisted in the app. Tokens will be revoked if you change your Tesla account password. No network traffic will ever be emitted from this app that goes anywhere other than directly to the Tesla API servers, unless the OPTIONAL cloud processing is enabled, in which case an in-flight encrypted ACCESS token with a lifespan of 8 hours will be transmitted and stored ONLY WHILE COMMAND IS EXECUTING. The source code for this application will at all times be made available to any security researcher for a voluntary security and safety audit. \n\nDisclaimer: \nThis app is not endorsed by Tesla Inc. Use at your own risk. No guarantee of proper function is given. Only you are responsible for any changes to your car caused by using this app.  \n\nMade in Denmark"

      "label": "Noir is a Safari extension that automatically adds a dark mode to every website you visit.\n\nIt makes browsing the web at night so much better. With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.\n\nAnd the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it is – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop. And with over 20 built-in themes and the ability to create your own, you can customize the results exactly the way you want.\n\nNoir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!\n\nBuilt from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Focus Filters and Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows. And your settings are automatically synced to all your devices using iCloud.\n\nAnd just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data. Period.\n\nNoir is made by a solo iOS developer. It does not include any subscriptions or ads. Buy Noir once, use it forever.\n\nNotes:\n• Found a website where Noir’s dark mode doesn’t look just right? Let me know by reporting it. The app will be frequently updated to address issues that are reported.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\n• The Noir extension requires access to the websites you visit to analyze the existing style of the page and to override it with Noir's dark style.\n• Noir never collects your browsing data. The only data Noir ‘collects’ are your settings, and those will never leave your device.\n• You can read Noir’s full Privacy Policy at https://getnoir.app/privacypolicy"

This means if you are near a powerful EMF, electromagnetic radiation isn’t just around you, it’s inside you. Your body’s electrical signals are well within the range of those that can be stimulated by ambient radio waves, microwaves and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. That harmful, unnatural type of stimulation can seriously impact your bodily health.\n\nEMF Detector Radiation Meter helps you find out the EMF Radiation levels you are exposed to, so you can be alert and safe from EMF and can visualize the radiation on EMF Meter.\n\n\nEMF Detector - Radiation Meter is very simple to use: open the app and your iPhone will begin to detect the electromagnetic fields nearby, showing you the current emf activity levels. The app will warn you and beeps if the emf activity levels are highger, so you can maually inspect further. The app uses your iPhone's built-in magnetometer sensor to detect electromagnetic field around you. \n\nFeatures:\n- Radiation Meter\n- EMF Meter \n- Reading in MicroTesla(µT)\n- Beep on/off option\n- EMF Activty Levels\n\nDownload EMF Meter - Radiation Detector from the App Store and find out EMF Acitivity levels around you!\n\nNote: To ensure the accuracy of the data keep the iPhone away from metal objects, magnets and speakers.\n\nThanks!"

Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here. Chromecast is a trademark of Google LLC."

      "label": "GEOFENCY enables fully automatic location-based time recording on iPhone, iPad, Mac & Apple Watch, where manual check-in and check-out becomes an absurdity of the past. Arrival and departure times are automatically recorded as soon as you enter or leave an interesting place – it works like magic! Of course all very energy efficient, thanks to the latest Geofencing & iBeacon technologies! With the integrated webhook feature you can even trigger your home automation system as you arrive or leave (e.g. switch on the lights when coming home)!\n\nIdeal for automatic monitoring of working hours, client visits, lunch breaks or the stays on your favorite places! GEOFENCY offers the easiest and most effective way to MONITOR your DURATION OF STAYS on interesting places. Unpleasant manual time recording was yesterday!\n\n• Are you tired of having to write down working hours again and again?\n• Fed up leaving the office absently, missed to check the clock?\n• Can't you remember when you came or left your favorite places?\n\nLet the iPhone take over this nerve-racking time monitoring for you!\n\nWith GEOFENCY this is now possible in a smart and clever new way! Simply mark your points of interest on a map and leave the rest to Geofency!\n\nGEOFENCY automatically tracks the times when you enter or leave your points of interest. Simply carry your iPhone in your pocket or bag with you. You will automatically receive extensive statistics and graphics over time!\n\nAutomatic Location-based Time Tracking – The (GEO)FANCY way!\n\nFEATURES\n• Automatic location-based time tracking - 24/7 time recording for your points of interest!\n• Graphical visualization of your dwell times (by simply rotating your device to landscape) - with zoom!\n• Rich statistics: Single-, Day-, Week- & Month-Summaries.\n• Map-View: Manage your points of interest directly on a beautiful fullscreen map view.\n• Add new locations in seconds – With just one tap!\n• Runs completely in the background while trying to maintain good battery life!\n• Automatic recognition when you enter or leave a place or region.\n• Tags: To group places into tags.\n• Webhook feature: Lets you control your home automation system to e.g. switch on lights as you arrive!\n• Journaling feature: Automatic recognition of frequent visited places – to know exactly when you've been where and how long!\n• Calendar-Export: Export events automatically into your calendar (iCloud, CalDAV & Exchange) – view your data comfortable even from Mac or PC!\n• Today Widget: See the most interesting details right from the Notification Center with one swipe and be more productive!\n• Apple Watch App!\n• Export feature: Send time recordings via e.g. email in an Excel-friendly format!\n• Export time data and use it directly in Excel, Numbers or Harvest!\n\nBENEFITS\nSimple to use daily timesaver! You don't have to fiddle around with time recordings on yourself. Free your mind and just don't bother about manual time tracking anymore!\n\nPRIVACY\n100% Private: Only YOU can see your data. We will never collect or share any information about you. We respect and care about the privacy of our users!\n\nREQUIREMENTS\nFor the best and most accurate monitoring results, Wi-Fi, carrier and location services should always be enabled for Geofency. iBeacon monitoring requires at least Bluetooth 4.\n\nBATTERY USE\nContinued use of GPS in the background can significantly reduce battery life. Geofency was designed to use GPS very sparingly and never in the background. The app relies mostly on cell tower + Wi-Fi locations. This has been carefully chosen to get the best battery life.\n\nWHAT PEOPLE SAY\n• \"I had no idea that my iPhone could do such things!\"\n• \"Beautiful, polished and elegant designed. Extremely simple to use.\"\n• \"Perhaps the most overall effective app available.\"\n\nFind out more on our landing page: www.geofency.com\nSample-Scripts for easy webhook integration: www.geofency.com/geo.zip"

Ishraq prayer is 10 to 12 minutes after sunrise. There is a misconception where Islamic websites and people use the word \"Ishraq\" and then give timings for actual Sunrise. Praying at sunrise is forbidden and must be performed after at least 10 minutes of sunrise. iPray for this reason adds 10 minutes to sunrise and labels it correctly as \"Ishraaq\".\n\n* Prayer Alerts will ONLY alert you with an initial Takbir. The full azan (and its length) is NOT supported by the iOS alert mechanism as there is a maximum limit of 30 seconds of audio playback."

It works if they know your password and even if no password is set for the lock-screen.\niAmNotified is the solution to definitively secure your device! \nIt acts as a watchdog that lets you know if someone accessed your iPhone or iPad while you were not looking. It can also alert people that you are monitoring the device, discouraging any malicious access.  \n\nNo one can access your device without the password. But...\n\nWhat happens if your sneaky colleague or friend peeks while you type it in? \nWhat if your partner or parents simply demand it? (\"Why don't you give me your password, are you hiding something?\".... does this sound familiar?). \nWhat if someone uses your fingerprint to unlock your device while you sleep? (yeah, it has happened, check the press).\n\nThey would have access to your entire life: pictures, videos, contacts, whatsapp conversations, facebook chats, emails (which mean access to any of your online accounts via password reset), etc.\nThey might even install malware to spy on you remotely!\n\nTHE WORST PART IS YOU WILL NEVER KNOW THAT SOMEONE HAD ACCESS TO YOUR DEVICE. \nThat you need to change your password. That a tracking virus is running on your device. That you have to alert your bank. That your competitor has stolen your confidential data.  That your partner knows about \"those\" pictures and conversations and you'd better prepare a good excuse....\nThat people you trust don't respect your privacy!\n\n\n+++ HOW IT WORKS +++\n! THE SIMPLEST APP EVER !\n1. open the App\n2. lock the screen\n\nThat's it! Your device is Secured!\n\nYou will immediately receive a notification on the lock-screen. The notification will remain there until the screen stays locked. If anyone unlocks the screen while you are away, the notification will not be there when you return, alerting you that someone had access to your device.\nThe notification changes every single time for extra security.\n\nThe History Log keeps track of the last notifications shown, so by-passing the system is virtually impossible. \n\n+++FEATURES +++\nDouble Function: use the app with STEALTH NOTIFICATIONS to catch anyone who is spying on you, or with DETERRENT NOTIFICATIONS to let everybody know that you are monitoring any access to the device.\n\nYou choose what appears on the notification: \n\n+ STEALTH NOTIFICATIONS (simulate a useful notification, to disguise the true nature of iAmNotified)\n- Lucky Lottery Numbers - [Who doesn't play the lottery?  I mean... free money, right?!]\n- Famous Citations - [Because everyone needs some inspirational quotes every now and then]\n- Definition of a Complex Word - [Education is important! Anyone would want to expand his vocabulary]\n- Fake Stock Exchange Alert - [These are total random companies symbols and values. Not real data to be sued in the stock market!]\n\n+ DETERRENT NOTIFICATIONS (showing that you are monitoring the device, will discourage people from accessing it)\n- Custom Message - [You choose what appears on the notification]\n- \"Device locked at: #current date and time#\" - [Shows the time of the last screen lock]\n- \"Access to this device is monitored. Unique notification ID: #securityID#\" \n\n*** PRO OPTIONS ***\nImprove your stealthiness with these advanced options\n\n- Secret Lock -> Launch iAmNotified without anyone near you noticing. When the option is activated, a black dimmed screen is shown when the app is opened, simulating the lock screen. Now you can secretly press the lock button to lock the screen, or wait for it to lock automatically. To access the app with the option activated, simply tap anywhere on the black screen.\n\n- Random Notification Time -> The notification appears at a random time within 2 minutes from the screen lock, instead of immediately after\n\nStart to feel in control of your device!"

      "label": "This professional tool called Clinometer is the most precise (all you can get with some calculations) slope measurement tool for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad using all sides of the device plus the camera. It can be used for simple applications like aligning a frame as well as for more sophisticated fields of applications where an arbitrary slope needs to be measured exactly. Read the reviews (and write your own) for all the applications you find! Thank for all your positive feedback! Please use our support link if you have questions and suggestions, we don't read the iTunes reviews every day!\n\nWith this tool, the slope can be measured by all edges of the device and through the camera. The current features include:\n\n◆ 3 Modes (incl. auto switching): Clinometer mode (auto when holding upright), Camera mode (any direction, manual activation) and Bubble level (smoothly fading in when holding flat).\n\n◆ Relative angles: Besides measuring absolute angles, for every mode you can measure the relative angle between device positions\n\n◆ Advanced two way calibration on all sides: For every 4 sides plus the bubble mode you can calibrate in two steps, which allows you to calibrate exactly even on non-level surfaces. Each direction can be calibrated individually to achieve the optimal precision. \n\n◆ Speech synthesis: The device will speak the current reading, so you don't have to watch the display while measuring/aligning your object.\n\n◆ Five different unit modes: The device can display the slope in degrees (rounded or in tenth of degrees), percentage, rise over run (common for roof slope measurement in :12) and 1V:H (common in engineering)\n\n◆ Dial Rotation: You can smoothly rotate the background dial and thus define which side of the device represents 0° and 90° degrees. \n\n◆ Motion-sensitive Lock feature: Besides the common instant simple tap hold mechanism you can activate the motion-sensitive lock. If activated the device waits for the final lock until you hold your device steady enough for at least 2 seconds. You can set the lock sensitivity between 0.1° and 1.0° degrees. \n\n◆ Peer Mode: Use two devices to measure angles: One as a display, the other as the measurement device that can be attached to the hardware you want to align. \n\n◆ Fullscreen Mode: The full screen mode can be toggled by tapping the center of the screen and by the upper and lower arrows in the center. This prevents you from erroneous inputs while measuring.\n\n◆ Different color schemes: Press the S/C Button to instantly switch the color. The color can be selected differently for the bubble and the clinometer mode. The predefined color sets include day and night color schemes (Black on White, White on Black and Red). \n\n◆ Adjustable Auto-Lock: You can prevent the device from turning into the sleep mode. \n\nAccording to wikipedia: An inclinometer or clinometer is an instrument for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or inclination of an object with respect to gravity. It is also known as a tilt meter, tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. \n\nFor recreational use only. After the calibration it CAN (!) be very accurate especially for the main axis after calibration. The measurement is performed as well as possible (we try our best) by using the three inbuilt accelerometers. \n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! \n\nWe will improve the application long-term. This was the first application of this kind shortly after the opening of the App Store. Since then it is continuously updated and enriched with new features."

      "label": "Crowd GPS Scanner App that allows the user to quickly find the most common crowd locate GPS devices such as tile. These are the devices the size of a coin that will transmit signals back to the owners for anything up to a year with just a watch battery. Before these devices came to market tracking would require larger batteries & sim cards which would become quite large and simple to find.\nHow the Crowd Locate system works:\nCrowd locate works on the basis that when a tile is paired to a phone it will stay connected to that phone whilst paired and within approx. 30ft. Once the tile device goes out of range it will start sending a signal to \"Find me\" This signal will be collected by any persons phone that runs the tile app! This is how crowd locate works, the more people having the app the more chances the tile can be pinpointed. Once the tile has come within 30ft of another mobile phone running the app it will pinpoint that exact location on a map and send that information back to the owner of the tile! This will give the owner of the tile a real time location on a map with a time when located.\nWith our App you can search all devices within approx. 30ft and the App will list all devices detected.\nThe App will only detect devices that you don't have paired to your own phone or that are currently sending out signals because they are out of range to paired device. \nThis can be put to the test if you have a tile that has been paired to your phone. When you have a tile paired to your phone and the tile app is running on your phone the Crowd GPS Scanner App will NOT list any tiles that you own. Now swipe closed the tile app and turn off your phone then turn it back on. The tile you own will now be in lost mode because it's not connected to your phone. Whilst in lost mode it will be transmitting a signal \"Find me\" so now if you open the Crowd GPS Scanner App it will now list the tile device on the screen. Stop clear the results and start the tile App which will pair to the tile. Now if you run the Crowd GPS Scanner App it will NOT list your own device."

Length, distance, area of any surface… Measure everything with this virtual ruler and tape measure thanks to augmented reality. \n\nMeasuring a length is now easier than with a laser meter or any other measure tool. You draw your measurement lines in 3D thanks to the camera directly on the video of your phone or tablet. You export your plans in PDF, PNG or DXF. CamToPlan is the AR measuring app that brings your measures from cam…to…plan !\n\nFor personal or professional use, always measure like a pro. Thanks to Virtual Reality (VR), you can measure floors, dimensions of walls, windows, doors or a whole home in a few seconds. No more tape measure or ruler needed!\n\nThis app has infinite applications for everybody:\n- Personal use: the length measure app for the handyman who loves DIY !\n- Real estate professionals (real estate agent, interior design decorator or designer, architect, topographer, energy adviser...): this app will help you make a floorplan of a house, apartment, a specific room of a flat.\n- Construction workers can use it to quickly measure jobs : concreter, tile layer, carpet fitter, painter, drywall guy, plasterer, builder, carpenter, electrician, plumber, slater... \n- For gardener, landscaper, swimming pool builders and maintenance, digger, earth-moving, navvy: this app also works outside\n- Cost estimation professionals: this length measure app can make pricing estimates, it will be a great assistant for quantity surveyor, price studies technician, economist…\n- Building industry: foreman, site manager or engineer can drop their tape measure and ruler to perform a quick measurement check\n\nHow does this measuring app work?\nIt relies on ARKit by Apple. Machine learning algorithms combine the device sensors data (accelerometer, gyroscope…) with odometry which analyses in real time the video of the camera and relies on visual details of images, in order to scan the environment and find the position and rotation angle of the device.\n\nPlease note: \n- you can measure in metric (meters, centimeters) or imperial units (feet, inches)\n- the app measures distances horizontally (= on the ground) and vertically!\n- no need to remove the furniture from the room for measurements. The application determines the intersection between the floor and the target, even if it is hidden.\n- The application may have difficulty with some types of tiles.\n- The accuracy is not guaranteed.\n- you can move while performing measurements to get closer to your target point, for maximum precision, even if it is not visible and calculated by extrapolation."

Buying a remote control, from Apple or a third party, would carry a significant cost!\n\nYou carry your iPhone or iPod Touch wherever you go... so why should you carry a second device just to control your computer?  Furthermore, why should you need line-of-sight to do so?\n\nEnter Rowmote!  Rowmote is like your Mac’s remote control, but over the wireless network and even better! By tapping the Apps button, you get bonus abilities, switching between controlled programs, toggling the iTunes Visualizer, and more. Rowmote will even wake sleeping Macs.\n\nFEATURES\n\n - Control your Mac over a wireless network. No line of sight necessary.\n\n - Functions just like the hardware Apple Remote Control in:\n• Adobe Lightroom\n• Airfoil Video\n• Amarra\n• Aperture\n• BBC iPlayer\n• Beamer\n• Boxee\n• Decibel\n• DVD Player\n• Ecoute\n• eyeTV 3.x\n• Firefox\n• Front Row\n• Hulu Desktop\n• iPhoto\n• iTunes\n• Keynote ‘08 & later\n• kJams Pro\n• Kodi\n• Last.fm\n• Logic\n• Microsoft Powerpoint ‘04 & later\n• mPlayer\n• Movist\n• OpenOffice Impress\n• Preview\n• PandoraBoy\n• PandoraJam\n• PandoraOne Desktop\n• Photos\n• Plex, Plex Home Theater, & Plex Media Player\n• Quicktime\n• Rdio\n• Safari\n• Skim\n• Songbird\n• Spotify\n• Squire\n• The Tube\n• VLC\n• xbmc (Xbox Media Center)\n\n- SWITCH: Access your Mac’s Dock, launching & switch between all controllable applications on the Mac, toggle the iTunes visualizer, and more. Order & display customizable.\n\n - Click-and-hold works just like on the physical remote in applications; for example, holding the right button fast-forwards, while a single click is ‘next’. This is a feature no other iPhone remote control I know of does properly!\n\n- Sleep on demand; wake the Mac automatically\n- Pause the music or video automatically when you answer a call on your iPhone\n- Proximity sensor support to automatically turn the screen off if the device is face-down\n- Secure authentication\n- Optional dark interface\n- Connect via WiFi or Bluetooth (Bluetooth requires Personal Hotspot Bluetooth tethering)\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n • Mac OS X 10.4.0 or later.\n • Mac: The free Rowmote Helper program must be running on the Mac to be controlled. Download at www.rowmote.com. Some features require later versions of Mac OS X.\n\nRowmote is a steal! Couple it with Apple’s free Remote app to turn your iPhone or iPod Touch into the ultimate controller for home stereo, mobile presentation, or casual video viewing.\n\nThe artwork of Rowmote was designed by Rik Schennink."

      "label": "With SatFinder you can adjust your satellite antenna in a few seconds and with 4 simple steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - CHOOSE YOUR ANTENNA\nChoose one of the four different antenna designs: \n - Offset antennas (the most common, is slightly oval, the LNB is not in the center).\n - Special design (e.g. Oblong shaped Offset antenna, Multifeed antenna)  \n - Parabolic antenna (LNB is located in the center of the reflector, usually larger than 100cm)\n - Flat or planar antenna (small, camping antennas)\n\nIf you have an offset antenna, enter the height and width of the antenna. If your antenna has a special shape, enter the offset angle and the size of the satellite antenna. You can find the offset angle in the manual of your satellite antenna. For parabolic antennas it is sufficient to enter the antenna diameter. With a flat antenna you do not have to set anything. If you know the exact antenna name, check if your antenna is already in the database.\n\nTip: Press the wizard button to measure the size of the satellite antenna using the iPhone camera and LiDAR scanner. \n\nSTEP 2 - CHOOSE YOUR SATELLITE\nTo quickly and easily select a suitable satellite, simply press the \"AUTO\" button. The SatFinder will now automatically search for satellites that are in your reception area and that offer TV or radio stations in your language (the language setting of your iPhone will be selected). The stars (1-10) shown in the table result from the number of radio and TV channels offered and the reception strength at your location.  \n\nIf you want to receive a special satellite, switch off \"AUTO\": Now you can simply scroll through the table and select the satellite. Faster is the search function - just enter the name of the satellite, the channel or the orbit position. You can also reduce the number of table entries by hiding satellites that are not available at your location or do not broadcast in your language. With the button \"Channel Info\" you can check which channels the selected satellite is currently broadcasting - including all channel parameters for your satellite receiver.  \n\nSTEP 3 - CHECK OBSTACLES\nFor a smooth satellite reception, there must not be any obstacles between the satellite and your satellite antenna. You can check this with the \"View\" function. Simply aim at the satellite and watch the signs (GREEN - no obstacle, RED - caution, free view may not be given).\n\nTip: Press the button for the assistant to activate the voice output.\n\nSTEP 4 - ADJUST ANTENNA\nIn the menu item \"Align\" different graphics appear depending on the selected antenna type. If you use an offset antenna, you have to adjust the azimuth and elevation separately. With planar or parabolic antennas the adjustment of the angles is done together. Before you press the \"Start\" button, a video clip shows how to position your iPhone at the antenna. \n\nTip: Press the button for the assistant to activate the voice output.\n\nSTEP 5 - FINE TUNING \nIf necessary, you can optimize the reception of your satellite system. The SatFinder provides you with the function \"FineTuning\". To use this function, you need a second iOS device. One device serves as a camera; the second device as a monitor. Simply place an iPhone in front of your reception screen and observe changes in picture quality while slightly rotating or tilting your satellite antenna. With the FineTuning feature, you'll have visual contact with your TV even when you're out of sight. \n\nTHAT'S IT. YOU SHOULD NOW BE ABLE TO ENJOY INTERFERENCE-FREE SATELLITE RECEPTION... \nNote: Satellite antenna tuning is only available on iOS devices with LiDAR sensor (e.g. iPhone 12 Pro)."

      "label": "With Group SMS you can send an SMS text message to a group of contacts. Group SMS is the perfect app to send your Christmas and New Year greetings to your loved ones and friends.\n\nThese groups can be small or very large (Bulk SMS) and send to tens, hundreds or thousands of contacts. You can also send email to groups. Group SMS is ideal when you need to send the same message to any number of contacts.\n\nGroup SMS will show you the groups that are already defined in the Contacts app of your iPhone. It also allows you to create new groups as well as modify your existing groups and contacts.\n\nUsing the built-in Templates feature, you can reuse often-used text messages or emails that you need to send to groups.\n\nYou can also add attachments to your messages, like photos or PDFs.\n\nGroup SMS will send the SMS using the built-in Messages app OR you can use the special SMS gateway of Group SMS.\n\nThe costs of the SMSs will be charged by your mobile operator or you can buy SMS from within the app itself. If a group contains 12 contacts, you will be charged 12 SMS.\n\nWhen you have a very large group (more than 50 contacts), you can choose to bypass your own mobile provider and select to use the SMS gateway of Group SMS instead. This will allow you to send your Group SMS with less cost and with more control. This feature is also ideal for marketing campaigns. You can import a large set of numbers via a .CSV file.\n\nGroup Mail is always without costs. You can also forward email attachments to groups.\n\nFEATURES\n\n√ Text message a group (SMS)\n√ Text message very large groups (Bulk SMS)\n√ Email a group and forward email attachments to groups\n√ Text message to a CSV file of mobile numbers\n√ Text message with attachments (photo, PDF)\n\n√ Create groups\n√ Delete groups\n√ Rename groups\n\n√ Add contact to group\n√ Delete contact from group\n√ Edit contact information\n\n√ Templates\n\n√ Supports your built-in contacts and groups\n√ Supports your iCloud contacts and groups\n\n√ Uses built-in Messages app ór Bulk SMS Gateway\n√ Replies are received in Messages\n\n√ Uses built-in Mail app\n√ Forward attachments of any type\n\n√ Built-in video tutorials\n\nGroup SMS requires iOS 6 or higher and is localized in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish and Dutch.\n\nVideo tutorials are available on the web site (see link below) and in the app itself.\n\nREVIEWS\n\n\"Works Perfectly\" - USA\n\n\"This app does what it says it can, and does it very well.\" - United Kingdom\n\n\"WELTKLASSE.

Place lightly and hold your finger against the back camera lens and flashlight:\n      - do not press too hard, do not use with cold fingers (these may negatively affect your results)\n      - when using a device without a flashlight, be sure to use in a well-lit area (bright daylight)\n\n2. Remain calm and try not to move too much during the measurement. Your Heart Rate result will appear shortly! \n\nDownload Heart Rate PRO app today, check your heart rate regularly, stay healthy!\n\n--\nNOTE: Works best with devices equipped with flash. When using the device without flash the app has to be used in good lighting. Place your fingertip on the camera (make sure it completely covers the camera lens & flashlight). Press gently, make sure that your fingers are not cold (these may reduce blood flow in your finger and effects result).\n\nWARNING: This is not a medical product. This app is for recreational use only."

We have more updates coming soon!\n\nBluetooth Photo Share Pro does not display any Advertisements.  Other than that is basically the same as the free version right now, except that we are working on new \"pro-only\" features that will be coming soon!  Please support us and buy now!\n\n-------------------------\n\nTransfer photos and/or contacts between two iPhones and/or iPod Touches over bluetooth.  Requires iPhone 3G or later or 2nd generation iPod Touch or later (Bluetooth data transfer cannot be supported on the original iPhone or original iPod Touch due to hardware limitations).  Does not require any 3G or WiFi connection.\n\nThis is the best bluetooth photo sharing app out there!!\n\nHere are some features that make this app stand out:\n- Unlike some other photo sharing apps, Bluetooth Photo Share does not scale down or do any lossy compression of your photos before transferring.  In other words, the receiver gets the exact image that was in the sender's photo library.\n- Allows you to transfer contacts from your address book.\n- The receiver transfer screen includes a thumbnail preview of the photo AS IT IS BEING TRANSFERRED and a cancel button so that you can cancel the transfer if you decide you do not want it.\n- Shows a scrollable list of thumbnails and file sizes for all of the images that you've received.\n- Allows you to view your photo albums that your photos were saved in.\n- Select Multiple Photos\n\nWe are also working on some great new features that we hope you'll really like.  We have a website: http://iphonemart.net.  Also check us out on twitter at http://www.twitter.com/iphonemart\n\n-------------------------\n\nMost of the time, the app works great.  However, when people experience problems, 99% of the time it is related to connecting with bluetooth, which would be the same for any bluetooth App.  If you have any trouble connecting, please check our support webpage for troubleshooting information.\n\nNote that if you are trying to transfer photos from your old phone or to/from your computer, there is no way to do that on the iPhone with bluetooth."

      "label": "This tool shows you the ultimate precise time of day. To achieve this, it uses a special internet time protocol to fetch the time from an atomic time server.\n\nWe are proud to offer version 5 of the Gorgy Timing Atomic Clock. The program is one of the classic applications since the early days of the Apple App Store and has been continually improved based on user feedback.\n\nThe Gorgy Timing Atomic Clock shows the precise time of day. To achieve this, it uses a special internet time protocol to fetch the ultimate precise time from cesium atomic clocks available on the internet, or any other time server you like.\n\nThe graphical display mimics the clock display of the legendary Gorgy Timing clocks, which are used in professional radio and television studios, and we spent much effort to bring the original feeling of these wickedly expensive clocks to your iPhone. This app is used by BBC studios, astronomers, concert promoters, etc. \n\nVersion 5 contains the following functions:\n\n* Universal support for all iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices running iOS 8 or higher (including iPhone 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, and all of the latest iPads and iPads Pro)\n* Optimized for iOS 13 and watchOS 6, full 64 bit support\n* Alarm function with snooze (touch anywhere on the screen), volume fade-in, based on weekdays\n* Alarm time based on seconds (not minutes)\n* Local time / UTC time mode\n* Alarm notification window instead of normal alarm sound, if app is not running or in the background\n* Use playlists or a manual picker selection from your own music library as alarm sounds\n* The alarm sound is also playing when the device is muted, or the display is switched off, and also works in AirPlay environments\n* Customizable time server sources\n* Colors: green, red, blue, yellow, white, dark green, violet, pink, orange, turquoise and hidden, with a separate color option for digits, seconds and segments\n* Alternative visual display of fractional seconds (1/60th sec. resolution)\n* 12/24 hours display\n* Optional second tick sound\n* Full landscape support (including settings dialog)\n* Touching the display lets the buttons and status bar fade out\n* Touching the display again will add the current date (in all orientations)\n* Disabled screen auto-lock\n* Options \"sync at startup\", \"hourly\", \"daily\", or a sync button for manual syncing\n* The last known time delta is used when started without sync\n* \"Night mode\", which dims the display using a slider, shows the seconds with only one dot (to prevent a hard brightness switch between second 59 and second 0), switches off the tick sound, and reduces screen updates to save battery\n* To minimize burn-in effects (especially on the iPhone X OLED display), the clock is doing micro movements when running longer than 5 minutes\n* VoiceOver support\n\nAnswers to common questions:\n\n* An application can not set your device's system time, so a time sync between the atomic time and the device time is not possible.\n* If you want to wakeup with music, please do not exit the app before going to sleep (which would result in a local notification dialog without music in the morning), and do not lock your device. Be aware that running an application all the time, even without display, consumes battery, so please make sure that your iPhone is fully charged before you go to bed, connect it to your charger, or use the app's Night mode, which is much more energy-saving."

      "label": "This app is the offline version of the popular, privacy-friendly \"Typewise Keyboard\" app. This offline version adds an additional layer of security. Note: online features will not be available in this app.\n\nThis app also includes Typewise PRO features:\n- Type in multiple languages without switching\n- Get personalized word suggestions\n- Additional 16 awesome themes\n- Create your own text replacements\n- Turn on key vibration\n- Turn on tablet mode\n- Change font size\n- Change swiping behavior\n- Change space button sensitivity\n- Automatically go back to letters after a space\n- Flick down to undo auto corrections\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\nCurrent keyboards are based on the 140-year-old mechanical typewriter layout. Typewise is different. It’s the first keyboard that is specifically designed for smartphones. It’s revolutionary yet easy to use, and after a couple of messages you’ll love it.\n \n80% FEWER TYPOS\nA recent study with 37,000 participants showed that on current keyboards 1 out of 5 words contains typos. With Typewise you finally get rid of these ARRGGHH-moments. Thanks to the hexagon layout, keys are 70% larger and much easier to hit. This reduces typos by 80%.\n\nINTUITIVE GESTURES\nSwipe up to capitalize a letter, swipe left to delete or swipe right to restore. It's as simple as that.\n\nSMART AUTOCORRECT\nStop getting annoyed by wrong autocorrections or senseless predictions. Typewise learns what you type and helps you write that perfect sentence.\n\n100% PRIVACY\nWhat you write is personal. That's why the keyboard does NOT require “full access” and none of your typing data is transmitted to the cloud.\n\nSPEAKS YOUR LANGUAGES\nHaving to switch between different languages is cumbersome. With Typewise you can write in all your languages at once. Choose from 40+ languages and type in the accents you really need. Typewise supports:\n- English (United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada)\n- Afrikaans\n- Albanian\n- Basque\n- Breton\n- Catalan\n- Croatian\n- Czech\n- Danish\n- Dutch (Belgium, Netherlands)\n- Estonian\n- Filipino\n- Finnish\n- French (France, Canada, Switzerland)\n- Galician\n- German (Austria, Germany, Switzerland)\n- Hinglish\n- Hungarian\n- Icelandic\n- Indonesian\n- Irish\n- Italian\n- Latvian\n- Lithuanian\n- Malaysian\n- Norwegian\n- Polish\n- Portuguese (Portugal, Brazil)\n- Romanian\n- Serbian\n- Slovak\n- Slovene\n- Spanish\n- Swedish\n- Swiss German\n- Turkish\n\nSUPPORTED DEVICES\nTypewise is optimized for iPhones with iOS 12 or later."

      "label": "iNet - explore your network!\nFind out about security risks and keep your network under control. Which devices are connected to my network? Are they online? Which services do they provide? Does somebody use my wifi network without my knowledge? These and other questions answers iNet fast and simple.\n\nWith iNet you know exactly what's going on! This easy to use App outlines a computer network even to the unexperienced user. And iNet never phones home, your data is absolutely private on your iPhone.\n\niNet provides you with information about networks your iPhone or iPod touch is connected to. Its very easy and user friendly design even allows the unexperienced user to get a profound and understandable overview of a network and the running services.\n\nIn the current release of iNet we implemented the following features:\n\n    • Network scan\n    • Ping\n    • Bonjour browser\n    • Portscan\n    • Device info\n    • Wake on Lan\n    • Sleep on Lan (Macintosh only)\n    • Extensive help section\n    • Send scan results via email\n\nScan Network:\niNet shows the devices connected to your local network, e. g. a computer or router, along with their name, IP and vendor. iNet discovers and distinguishes between windows and macintosh computers with different icons. For most Apple Computers the particular computer model can be seen. Find out the name, vendor and IP of the connected devices as well as the number of running Bonjour services on that particular device. (MAC and Vendor cannot be detected anymore since iOS 11) A classic portscan on the choosen device can also be performed.\n\nThe technology used in iNet scans on a very low level, therefore one can even find machines that don't want to be found, for instance a Mac OS X computer running in stealth mode.\n\nPing:\nPing is a computer network tool used to test whether a particular host is reachable across an IP network or not. The ping section in iNet enables you to find out if an IP exists (if its ping service is enabled; otherwise you will get no response :-)). For your convenience we added a bookmark function to store often needed addresses.\n\nBonjour browser:\nBonjour, also known as zero-configuration networking, enables automatic discovery of computers, devices, and services on IP networks. Bonjour uses industry standard IP protocols to allow devices to automatically discover each other without the need to enter IP addresses or configure DNS servers. The Bonjour-Browser in iNet scans the connected local network for Bonjour services, detecting any hardware that ist connected via the Bonjour protocol (for instance computer, router, printer, …) and any software running Bonjour services, e. g. iTunes or Filemaker.\n\nWake on lan:\nThe outstanding feature of our implementation is that it is very easy to use and simple to setup. For more information see iNet WOL, our stand-alone tool for WOL.\n\nPortscan:\nApplications on devices communicate with the outside world through so called TCP ports. iNet detects wether a port is open or closed. For all detected open ports the service using this port is displayed by its real name (if available).\n\nDevice Info: \nThe device info in iNet shows some information related to your iPhone or iPod touch, e. g. its name or its IP.\n\nFuture:\nThe modularisized structure of iNet allows to add more features and scanning methods in the future. We will implement by time more network monitoring tools, e. g. DNS-Querys, Traceroute, Whois lookup etc.. iNet Pro will be updated on a regular basis as before. In addition we released iNet for Mac in December 2010 - available via the App Store.\n\nIf you want to know what's going on in your local network - iNet Networks Scanner gives you a profound answer.\n\nP.s.: In case you need just the network scan feature of iNet Pro, use the free version iNet - Network Scanner.  You can always update to iNet Pro from within iNet to access its full feature set. \n\nP.p.s: iNet never \"phones home\"!"

      "label": "Prowl is an easy push notifications client iOS. Push to your device notifications from your Mac or Windows computer, or from a multitude of apps and services. Easily integrate the Prowl API into your applications.\n\nA list of supported apps/services: http://prowlapp.com/apps.php\n\nThe only limit of what the service can do is your imagination.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\nTo receive notifications from your computer, you need the latest:\n• Growl on your Mac @ growl.info, or\n• Growl for Windows @ growlforwindows.com, or\n• Snarl on Windows @ fullphat.net, or\n• Any program or web service using the public API.\n\nTHE CRITICS\n\"I was extremely impressed with Prowl and the elegance with which I was able to view Growl notifications on my iPhone.”\n—Aron Trimble, TUAW\n\n\"[A] powerful tool to connect your Mac with your iPhone, seamlessly over the air.\n—Federico Viticci, MacStories\n\n\"Great idea. This opens up iPhone push notifications for anything you can think of.”\n—John Gruber, Daring Fireball\n\n\"Probably the best $3 I’ve ever spent in the App Store.”\n—Darrell Etherington, The Apple Blog\n\nFEATURES\n• Push Notifications—When a Growl notification pops up on your computer, it's sent to Prowl and displayed on your iOS device within seconds.\n\n• Sweet application support—Prowl has support from a bunch of cool applications and services. Check out the full list at http://prowlapp.com/apps.php\n\n• Redirections—Launch a different application when you open a push notification. For example, a notification from your desktop Twitter client can relaunch into your favorite mobile client. You can even pick custom URLs to launch, so you can go anywhere!\n\n• Email to push—Use your Prowl email address (from the Prowl homepage's \"API keys\" tab) to get email delivery right on your device. Generate as many email addresses as you need!\n\n• An amazing API—Use the Prowl API with a multitude of libraries in various programming languages. You can send notifications from anything that can talk to the internet, and do some fun things along with it.\n\n• Quiet Hours—During the hours you specify, only the badge numbers are updated. No matter the source. Instead of getting a noisy alert, messages are quietly delivered. You can allow emergency-priority items to break quiet hours.\n\n• Do Not Disturb—Keep the application quiet whenever you're busy, or when you need a break from a constant alert. Controllable from within the application.\n\n• Control—Open the edit view to get a quick glance at your notifications, and do away with pesky ones. Quickly copy, email or SMS a notification directly from Prowl (depending on device and iOS version).\n\n• Browse quickly—Use Prowl's internal browser to quickly open links from a notification without having to open Safari.\n\n• History—Up to 10 days of notifications are kept on the server. You can delete notifications that you don't want to see any more, or remove all of your history.\n\n• Customized notifications—Only events you want are sent to Prowl. You can specify all kinds of conditions from the Prowl plugin for Growl.\n\n• Send any message to your device—From the Prowl website, you can send any text to your device: links and phone numbers are automatically linked, so you can easily navigate around without having to worry about typos. From the website or API, you can also automatically redirect to the attached URL.\n\nSETUP\nProwl is built into Growl 2.0. For earlier versions: http://prowlapp.com/installation.php — for Mac.\nhttp://growlforwindows.com — for Windows.\n\nSUPPORT\n@prowlapp on Twitter\nhttp://prowlapp.com/support.php"

      "label": "The iPhone speed radar - easy-to-use speed measurement in your pocket, anytime, anywhere!\n\nA unique, advanced app designed to easily measure the speed of cars, boats, skaters, skiers, cyclists, animals, models, footballs, tennis serves, etc. The system is based on motion detection, enabling you to track a moving object using a hand-held device alone. SpeedClock includes three separate speed measurement tools and two distance estimation tools.   \n\nSpeed Radar  \nSpeedClock uses the camera to detect and analyze motion, and a reference distance to calculate the speed of an object. Define the distance to the object of interest, hold the iPhone still and let the object pass across the the screen. The speed is displayed automatically. SpeedClock is also able to automatically measure the speed and save an image of passing objects. The measurement can be initiated from an Apple Watch and the speed displayed on the watch face.\n\n  High Speed Video Recording \nAn additional speed tool records and processes a video, which enables SpeedClock to track small, fast object, such as flying balls, that can be difficult to catch with regular motion detection.   It also calculates additional parameters like acceleration.\n\nSynchronized Timing Gates \nA third speed instrument uses two iPhone/iPads equipped with motion detection to start and stop the timer and measure the speed. The distance between the devices is used as reference, and the speed is calculated based on the time taken by the object to travel between the 'Start' and 'Stop' devices. The time is transmitted wirelessly over WiFi or Bluetooth.\n\n  Distance Measurement \n The stadimeter uses the size of a known object, e.g. a car, to calculate the distance.  The clinometer uses your own height as reference, along with the angle of the iPhone, to estimate the distance to a point on the ground.  The distances obtained from either tool can then be used to calculate the speed.  \n\nSee a demo video at the application website (www.appmaker.se/speedClock)\n\nON LINE REVIEWS\n“All I can say is, Fantastic”\nhttp://www.madxperts.com/2010/12/03/measure-speed-app-speedclock-iphone-download/\n\n\"Wow, how cool is that!\"\nhttp://www.ithinkdiff.com/turn-iphone-speed-measuring-gun-speedclock-download/\n\n\"You really going to like this app\"\ndailyappshow.com/speedclock (video)\n\n\"A useful utility for anyone needing to measure speed\"\nappmodo.com/44581/\n\n\"Useful, easy to use and quite a bit of fun (4 of 5)\"\nappvader.com/2011/03/review-speedclock-iphone/\n\n\"speedClock is a useful app when you need to check the speed of yourself, or an object for exercise, racing or simple curiosity (4.5 of 5)\"\nwww.cooliphoneipadapps.com/2010/12/speedclock.html\n\n\"Astonishing\"\niphonelife.com/blog/5/speedclock-velocity-radar-099-app-lets-you-use-camera-measure-speed-objects\n\n\"It is a pleasure to use and operate.

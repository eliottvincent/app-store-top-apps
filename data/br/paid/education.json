      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

      "label": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch. Let them explore and learn with their senses.

Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside.

      "label": "The VokabelBox is a vocabulary trainer with which you can learn your vocabulary in a structured and lasting way. \n\nLearn your vocabulary with three different exercises:\n\n- Exercise\n- Vocabulary test\n- Card box\n\nWith the exercises, you playfully add new words to your vocabulary. You either have to choose the correct translation from a series of suggestions, find the correct word pair, choose the initial letter or put the letters of the translation in the correct order. Your learning progress is shown in a diagram at any time.\n\nThe vocabulary test prepares you ideally for your next exam. If you have made mistakes, you can repeat the wrong answered vocabulary immediately, or you can start a test with new vocabulary. \n\nThe card box helps you to consolidate your vocabulary in your long-term memory. The card box has six compartments. The aim is to bring the vocabulary to the last compartment. If you make a mistake, the vocabulary goes back into the first compartment. The learning distance increases with each compartment. \n\nOverview of the learning gaps:\n\nBox 1: immediately\nTray 2: 4 days \nBox 3: 7 days \nBox 4: 14 days \nBox 5: 60 days\nBox 6: every 180 days\n(You can adjust the gaps to your needs)\n\nWith the folders you can structure your vocabulary and learn in a systematic way. For example, you can create a folder for a learning a book, then add a folder for each chapter and a box with the individual lessons for each chapter. So you can learn a single lesson, a whole chapter or even the whole book. \n\nBook (folder) -> Chapter (folder) -> Lessons (box with vocabulary).\n\nNot only can you create new vocabulary lists directly in the app, but you can also easily import them into the VokabelBox on your PC using your spreadsheet program. You can find instructions for this here: www.vokabelbox.com/xlsx-import\nThe app contains no vocabulary.\n\nWith the backup file you can save all your vocabulary along with your learning progress or transfer it to a second device.\n\nSupported languages:\n\n-Arabic\n-Bulgarian\n-Catalan\n-Chinese\n-Croatian\n-Czech\n-Danish\n-Dutch\n-English\n-Esperanto\n-Estonian\n-Finnish\n-French\n-Greek \n-Hebrew\n-Hindi\n-Hungarian\n-Indonesian\n-Icelandic\n-Italian\n-Japanese\n-Korean\n-Kurdish\n-Latin\n-Malagasy\n-Norwegian\n-Persian \n-Polish\n-Portuguese\n-Romanian\n-Russian\n-Serbian\n-Swedish\n-Spanish\n-Swahili\n-Thai\n-Turkish\n-Vietnamese\n\nIf you would like to have more languages, you have found errors, you have suggestions for improvement or you have questions about the VokabelBox, please send me an e-mail at:\n\nios-support@vokabelbox.com\n\nI wish you much fun learning!\n\nMarcel"

      "label": "Welcome to Toca Life: Pets, where you and your animal friends run the show! What’s your favorite pet like? Furry and fast? Wet and wiggly? A little bit creepy? With more than 120 animals, Toca Life: Pets has every kind of pet you can imagine.\n\nEXPLORE FIVE LOCATIONS\n\nPET PARK: Enjoy the great outdoors with the pets! Take a dip in the river, have a picnic on the grass, play a game or discover a hidden cave. Or build an agility course to train your pets and test their skills. Poke around a bit, explore the tree — you might find some surprises to expand your pet family!\n\nPET HOTEL: Sometimes families go on trips without their pets, but thanks to the pet hotel, pets get a vacation of their own! With lots of cozy spaces, an aquarium and outdoor space, every pet will find a nice spot to play or relax — dog or cat, bird or sloth-bat!\n\nVETERINARY: The vet can help sick pets feel better and help healthy pets stay that way! You’ll find pills, drops and the instruments needed to operate on sick or injured pets. Pets can play outdoors or wait on the cozy beds until the vet is ready to see them.\n\nPET SHOP: Find everything you need for to groom, feed, play with and care for your pets at the pet shop. After shopping, grab a bite to eat at the pet shop cafe, where pets get a table too!\n\nBREEDER’S BUNGALOW: Here’s where the pet breeder starts and ends their day. The bungalow is, of course, filled with pets — hiding in the greenhouse and playing in the yard and splashing in mud. Don’t worry, the giant bathtub gets everyone clean again!\n\nENJOY A FREE GIFT\nBundled with Toca Life: Pets is a free pack of 18 exclusive iMessage stickers! Add pet stickers to your messages to express yourself in a fun way.\n\nFEATURES\nRole-play in five locations: pet park, pet hotel, veterinary, pet shop and breeder’s bungalow.\n- Meet 23 new characters.\n- Play with and care for 124 real and fantasy animals. \n- Bathe muddy pets and get them clean again!\n- Pretend to be a vet and care for sick and injured pets.\n- Dress your pets in fun hats — stack hats on hats on hats!\n- Pets can pee and poop!\n- Keep spaces clean by cleaning up all the pet poop!\n- Poop is also stackable! Stack the poop high, bag it up and discard!\n- Build an agility course to train pets and help them get the exercise they need.\n- Pull the branch in the pet park to discover a surprise!\n\nLIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice and your characters’ movements as you’re telling the story. Create videos up to two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share your storytelling later! \n\nAbout Us:\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

      "label": "Experiment with plant characters, evolve them into new species and discover their unique personalities. Keep collecting plants until you’ve collected them all! The world of science just got a little bit weirder and a lot more fun with Toca Lab: Plants!\n\nJust like with the first app in the Toca Lab Series, Toca Lab: Elements, your curiosity will lead the way. Choose your plant, then visit five different locations in the lab:\n\n● Grow light: Shine the light on your plant and watch what happens! Does your plant bask and happily sigh in the light, or groan and wriggle away? What happens when you turn the light up a notch or two?\n\n● Watering tank: Put your plant in the tank and fill it up with water. Will your plant float? How does your plant behave when it’s soaking wet?\n\n● Nutrition station: What’s the optimal diet for your plant? Try the three different nutrition formulas and discover which ones your plant character likes!\n\n● Cloning machine: Spin the wheel on the cloning machine and before you know it, you’ll have five little versions of your plant. Wonder what the clones can do? Experiment and find out!\n\n● Crossbreeding apparatus: Here you can mix two plants to create something unexpected. Try it and see what happens!\n\nHave fun experimenting at each station to see how the plants evolve. Keep experimenting until you’ve collected all 35 plant characters in the app. Once you’ve collected a plant, keep experimenting to continue to evolve it! Who says kids can’t be scientists? Toca Lab: Plants brings out the budding botanist in everybody!\n\nFEATURES\n- Start with one plant and experiment your way to 35 different plant characters, each with its own unique personality!\n- Continue to evolve existing plants through experimentation!\n- Evolve plants with five lab tools: grow light, watering tank, nutrition station, cloning machine and the crossbreeding apparatus.\n- Discover plants from five groups: green algae, mosses, ferns, trees and flowering plants.\n- Learn the names and Latin names of real-life plants!\n\n--\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

      "label": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training. It is yet another beautifully designed and easy-to-use app for kids“ by lilmagoolie.com"

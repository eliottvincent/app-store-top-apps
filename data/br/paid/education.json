      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training. It is yet another beautifully designed and easy-to-use app for kids“ by lilmagoolie.com"

      "label": "Best origami instructions App! Full version. 120 3D Animated instructions.\n\n\"OK, so everyone can fold paper in half. What’s so exciting about that?\" you may say. But you’ll soon think differently when you learn more about the art of origami.\nRemember making paper airplanes at school? And remember how someone, instead of an airplane, made a flower, a jumping frog, or a parrot? That was like magic. And they only had their two hands and a plain piece of paper. How did they do it? We’ll show you how.\nThe \"How to Make Origami\" app is simple and easy to use. Follow the step-by-step instructions and watch the 3D animation carefully. And don’t worry, you’d have to try really hard to get confused.\n\n\"Hey, that point shouldn’t be sticking out like that!\" Something went wrong? That’s because even an airplane requires concentration and patience. Let this tranquil pastime completely absorb you, and your complete relaxation is guaranteed. You know, those wise Japanese invented a great thing.  \n\nBy the way, origami develops logical reasoning, attention span, spatial thinking and fine motor skills. Consider that when you’re trying to keep fidgety kids busy.\n\nDownload for free over 100 traditional origami instructions for our app. \n\nThe most famous are\n— Origami Frog\n— Origami Giraffe\n— Origami Crane\n— Origami Dinosaur\n— Origami Flower\n— Duck\n— Origami Rose\n— Origami Lily\n— Origami Jumping frog\n— Origami Pigeon\n— Origami Rabbit"

The difficulty of the exercises is gradually increased, starting with whole hours and continuing with half hours, quarter hours and so on. If it’s too challenging, just press the Hints button to get help with the time expressions. The app also contains exercises on elapsed time, such as ”What time is it in 20 minutes?”. In the final category you can test your acquired skills with a mix of different styled clocks.\n\nIn addition to the many exercises, there is also an experimental mode where the relationship between the clock and the time of day is illustrated with the passing of the sun and moon across the sky. You can freely drag the hands of the clock and see how the sky changes and also get the time read out load.\n\nThe app is suitable for children in grades K-3.\n\nCategories\n1. Tell the time\n2.

Wash them, brush them, then saddle up for a trot. When you're finished grooming your horses (and cleaning up their poop!), take a well-deserved break in the club room.\n\nTHE ARENA: Next, advance to the arena and show off your horse's jumping skills. Hear the cheers when the winners take their place on the podium. After the celebration, you can race motorcycles in the arena — vroom! — or get a snack in the food court.\n\nTHE FOREST: Ready to frolic in the forest? Choose your most trusted horse and head off for an adventure in the woods, where you can sleep under the stars in your sleeping bag, then wake up for a swim in the waterfall.\n\nTHE SHOP: When you need more horse tack, head over to the shop — you'll find everything you need.\n\nTRAVEL BETWEEN LOCATIONS\nEach location gives you access to the horse transport, so you can get your horses, equipment, bikes and even characters from here to there. Put what you want to move into the transport, close the door and select the new location by tapping an icon.

This app will turn your English text into its phonetic transcription using International Phonetic Alphabet.\n \nFeatures:\n \n- See phonetic transcription of the whole text, not just the dictionary forms of separate words.\n- Choose between British and American* pronunciation. When British dialect is selected the [r] sound at the end of the word is only voiced if followed by a vowel, which follows British phonetic convention.\n- International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) symbols used.\n- The structure of the text and sentences in it (line breaks, punctuation marks, etc.) is preserved in phonetic transcription output making it easier to read.\n- You can output the text and its phonetic transcription along each other line-by-line to make back-reference to the original text easier.\n- An option to vary pronunciation depending on whether words are in stressed or weak position in the sentence, as in connected speech.\n- In addition to commonly used vocabulary the database contains a very substantial amount of place names (including names of countries, their capitals, US states, UK counties), nationalities and popular names.\n- Where a word has a number of possible pronunciations (highlighted in blue in the output) you can select the one that agrees with the context by tapping on it.\n- Print out the output results, share via email or copy to pasteboard.\n- Let the built-in speech synthesiser read your text out loud. Control the playback and follow IPA transcription of the current word with a highlight.\n- Custom URL scheme to open toPhonetics from 3rd-party apps.\n\nGestures (IPA transcription screen):\n1. Single tap\n    - Tap a word to set the cursor to it and speak it (you can mute/un-mute it with the button at your bottom-right).\n    - Tap in a blank space to stop speech and hide the cursor.\n2. Double-tap\n    - Double-tap a word to open it in the built-in dictionary; if the word has multiple pronunciations you'll see the list of them first.\n    - Double-tap in a blank space to reset the font to the size set in iOS preferences.\n3. Pinch in or out to make the text smaller or larger.\n4. Start to slide horizontally to select a part of your text. The Speak button respects current selection.\n\n\n*) American transcriptions are based on the open Carnegie Mellon University Pronouncing Dictionary."

      "label": "WH Questions is a multi-player game designed specifically to help kids answer and ask WH questions. Children with language disorders often struggle to answer WH questions in a meaningful way1. In addition, many children with language disorders are unable to ask grammatically correct questions. Designed by a certified speech-language pathologist, WH Questions features over 400 WH opportunities to answer and ask real-world questions.\nHow to Play\nWhen WH Questions first opens, the adult has the option of looking at results, starting a new game, adjusting settings, or viewing support. By tapping the “new game” button, the adult is brought to the players screen. Here the adult can select a current student or add a new student. WH Questions is fully compatible with the Therapy Report Center (TRC) which allows the adult to import students from the TRC and export data to TRC for easy report writing. \nAfter the players are selected, the adult must select what type of WH questions should be asked. Questions available include: Why, How, Where, Who, When, and What. Because WH Questions is a multi-player game, the adult must choose the type of questions for each student by simply touching the appropriate box. \nOnce the questions are selected, play begins. The picture stimulus is shown with the WH Question posed at the top of the page and an audio recording asks the question. At the top of the page is a record button which allows the student to record his or her answers. A play button is provided to allow the student to develop self-monitoring skills and determine if the answers make sense. Data is collected by clicking the appropriate square.  \nAlternately, if the target is for the student to ASK questions, the written questions can be removed to allow the student to ask the question. The Record button could be used to record the student asking the question instead of the answer. In this scenario, the adult would track if the target was asking or answering questions.\nData Collection\nWhen the session is complete, a simple touch to the All Done button brings the app to the reports function. Highlighting the student’s name will bring up that student’s data. A graph is provided showing the session date, the WH Question(s) targeted, and the percent accurate. The squares are colored coded to indicate accuracy: green 80% or better, pink under 80%, white not addressed that session. \nWH Questions data collection reports can be exported to The Therapy Report Center for easy progress monitoring and report writing. \nCustomization\nWH Questions has a settings button accessible from the home page. Customization allows the adult to tailor WH Questions for the child’s specific needs. \n•Randomize Questions. By selecting OFF the questions will finish one type of WH question before moving to the next. \n\n•Display written questions. Selecting OFF removes the written question from the picture. This is perfect for working with students who are working on attending to auditory stimuli or whose goal is to ask questions.  \n\n•Transition sounds. Allows the adult to determine if there is auditory feedback between questions. \n\n•Number of questions per student. At times, the adult may want to ask more than one question for each student. Selecting the number of questions per student is ideal for increasing the number of opportunities per student between turns.\n \n\nSources\n1Parnell, M., Amerman, J., Harting, R.

      "label": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside.

      "label": "Experiment with plant characters, evolve them into new species and discover their unique personalities. Keep collecting plants until you’ve collected them all! The world of science just got a little bit weirder and a lot more fun with Toca Lab: Plants!\n\nJust like with the first app in the Toca Lab Series, Toca Lab: Elements, your curiosity will lead the way. Choose your plant, then visit five different locations in the lab:\n\n● Grow light: Shine the light on your plant and watch what happens! Does your plant bask and happily sigh in the light, or groan and wriggle away? What happens when you turn the light up a notch or two?\n\n● Watering tank: Put your plant in the tank and fill it up with water. Will your plant float? How does your plant behave when it’s soaking wet?\n\n● Nutrition station: What’s the optimal diet for your plant? Try the three different nutrition formulas and discover which ones your plant character likes!\n\n● Cloning machine: Spin the wheel on the cloning machine and before you know it, you’ll have five little versions of your plant. Wonder what the clones can do? Experiment and find out!\n\n● Crossbreeding apparatus: Here you can mix two plants to create something unexpected. Try it and see what happens!\n\nHave fun experimenting at each station to see how the plants evolve. Keep experimenting until you’ve collected all 35 plant characters in the app. Once you’ve collected a plant, keep experimenting to continue to evolve it! Who says kids can’t be scientists? Toca Lab: Plants brings out the budding botanist in everybody!\n\nFEATURES\n- Start with one plant and experiment your way to 35 different plant characters, each with its own unique personality!\n- Continue to evolve existing plants through experimentation!\n- Evolve plants with five lab tools: grow light, watering tank, nutrition station, cloning machine and the crossbreeding apparatus.\n- Discover plants from five groups: green algae, mosses, ferns, trees and flowering plants.\n- Learn the names and Latin names of real-life plants!\n\n--\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

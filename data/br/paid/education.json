      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

      "label": "Set Up Your Child for Reading Success, for Less!  GraphoGame Helps Kindergarten and Elementary School Kids Learn to Read and Spell Letters, Syllables and Words with American English Phonics.  \n\nFEATURES: \n\n• NO ADS OR IN-APP PURCHASES   \n• Rated for Kids 4 to 9 Years Old \n• Play Without Internet   \n• Levels Adapt to Player Ability \n• In-App Progress Reports and Literacy Analytics   \n• Earn Rewards and Use Them to Customize Your Avatar!   \n• Two Game Modes: Stars (school use) and Map (at home use)   \n• New 3D Map Immerses Kids in an Engaging Learning Adventure \n• GDPR, CCPA and COPPA-compliant; plus, We Do Not Collect Personal Data  \n• Proven Efficacy in Children with Dyslexia and Autism \n• Full Content Forever. Never Pay More for New Content or Features!   \n\nGraphoGame was created by pedagogical experts, linguists and neuroscientists from Yale and Cambridge Universities to achieve basic literacy in children - from kindergarten onwards.  Research trials show that by playing just 15 minutes, 3 times per week, kids can improve their letter knowledge, phonics awareness, reading speed and overall confidence in literacy.  Literacy outcomes are equivalent with 1-to-1 teacher support as shown by a randomized controlled trial conducted by the Centre for Neuroscience in Education, University of Cambridge.  Witness kids learning their first letters, syllables and words at home or in school with GraphoGame!   \n\nKids learn to read with American English phonics and a variety of engaging 3D levels – all with their own unique avatar.  Players gradually move from graphemes and phonemes, through vowels, consonants, syllables and rhymes, to eventually learn how to blend what they have mastered into complete words.  Play at home or in school! \n\nThis version of GraphoGame is the result of work done by Haskins Laboratories, an independent, not-for-profit research institute founded in 1935, investigating the biological basis of speech, language and reading, and their related disabilities. GraphoGame is based on decades of research in dyslexia, autism, neurolinguistics and phonics by the University of Jyväskylä in Finland and was adapted to English by the University of Cambridge Centre for Neuroscience in Education and Yale’s Haskins Laboratories.  Kindergarten to grade 3 students - including those with dyslexia or autism - have shown the most literacy improvement playing GraphoGame American English. \n\nVisit www.graphogame.com to learn more.   \n\n  \n\nGame icon © Grapho Group Oy, Ville Mönkkönen & Mika Halttunen"

(Hello friends!)\n\nTake the first step toward learning a new language with Russian Alphabet.\n\nThis app teaches you the foundations of Russian in a fun and unique way allowing you to:\n\n• See each letter.\n• Hear the proper pronunciation for each letter phonetic.\n• For each letter, see and hear a common Russian word which begins with that letter.\n\nRussian Alphabet is not only fun, but it’s also accurate because it was developed by a native Russian speaker.\n\n*This app requires no network connection allowing you to take your studies with you anywhere. Beware – similar apps require internet connectivity.\n\nRussian Alphabet contains two in-app purchases, so that you can expand your learning:\n\n• The practice feature which allows you to “finger-write” on the screen so that you can memorize and perfect the strokes for each character.\n\n• The quiz feature which will help you put everything you’ve learned to the test.    With a little practice, you’ll learn to recognize and write the Russian Alphabet in no time!"

I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside.

Then they can go to work at the harbour, play with the crane and unload ships.\n\nFRANCE\nIn venerable France, for example, children can sit in the evening in a chic café on the Seine under the Eiffel Tower, or they can play robber and gendarme with the police. Of course there is also a police helicopter, a police boat and a police car.\n\nINDIA\nIn densely populated India, the children can harvest tropical fruits and squeeze juices, change tires in the Auto Werkstadt, ride an elephant or work on the latest robot technology.

All switches are working and need to be operated in the correct sequence in order to start the engine successfully.\n\nYou can choose from random failures or select a specific scenario such as:\n- Hot Start (you will need to do the correct actions to abort the start correctly)\n- Starter Sluggish (the battery voltage will be low and you need to make the right decision)\n- MGT too high (there will be a high residual temperature)\n- Oil Pressure Failure\n \nAlso there is an 'No Error Mode' This enables you to try all buttons, do all checks without any consequences. CFIs can use this mode to setup scenarios for their students.\n\nThe check begins with the 'Starting Engine and Run-Up' checklist (Battery, strobe switches - ON ... etc)\nand concludes with N1 stable at 65% to 67%.\n\nThere is an in-app-purchase available that enables to begin the checks with the 'Before Starting Engine' checklist.\n\nThe app uses the initial cockpit design.\nFor further information on how to avoid hot starts, please check the training section at www.robinsonheli.com\n\nVisit our website www.gyronimo.com for a demo video.\n\nFor iPad and iPhone in portrait or landscape format.

      "label": "Musical Meter makes learning to read and play music rhythms fun. Thanks to its innovative, two-hand design, our app teaches you not only when to play a note but how long to hold it. Visual representations and animated examples let you see and hear how to play each music symbol. Interactive, randomly generated levels ensure you truly understand the subject matter. Our notation looks professionally engraved so you’ll be ready to read real sheet music. This precision app will hone your timing and help you develop a strong, internalized sense of rhythm.\n\nThis second app in the Musical Meter suite introduces the following concepts:\n• compound time (6/8, 9/8, and 6/4)\n• eighth and sixteenth notes and rests\n• dotted quarter and eighth notes\n\nNOTE: This app comes with all features enabled.\n\nSight reading and timing exercises are mentally demanding, so have fun but remember to pace yourself.\n\nEnjoy!"

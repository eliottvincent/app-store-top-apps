      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

With more than 120 animals, Toca Life: Pets has every kind of pet you can imagine.\n\nEXPLORE FIVE LOCATIONS\n\nPET PARK: Enjoy the great outdoors with the pets!

Poke around a bit, explore the tree — you might find some surprises to expand your pet family!\n\nPET HOTEL: Sometimes families go on trips without their pets, but thanks to the pet hotel, pets get a vacation of their own! With lots of cozy spaces, an aquarium and outdoor space, every pet will find a nice spot to play or relax — dog or cat, bird or sloth-bat!\n\nVETERINARY: The vet can help sick pets feel better and help healthy pets stay that way! You’ll find pills, drops and the instruments needed to operate on sick or injured pets. Pets can play outdoors or wait on the cozy beds until the vet is ready to see them.\n\nPET SHOP: Find everything you need for to groom, feed, play with and care for your pets at the pet shop. After shopping, grab a bite to eat at the pet shop cafe, where pets get a table too!\n\nBREEDER’S BUNGALOW: Here’s where the pet breeder starts and ends their day. The bungalow is, of course, filled with pets — hiding in the greenhouse and playing in the yard and splashing in mud. Don’t worry, the giant bathtub gets everyone clean again!\n\nENJOY A FREE GIFT\nBundled with Toca Life: Pets is a free pack of 18 exclusive iMessage stickers! Add pet stickers to your messages to express yourself in a fun way.\n\nFEATURES\nRole-play in five locations: pet park, pet hotel, veterinary, pet shop and breeder’s bungalow.\n- Meet 23 new characters.\n- Play with and care for 124 real and fantasy animals. \n- Bathe muddy pets and get them clean again!\n- Pretend to be a vet and care for sick and injured pets.\n- Dress your pets in fun hats — stack hats on hats on hats!\n- Pets can pee and poop!\n- Keep spaces clean by cleaning up all the pet poop!\n- Poop is also stackable! Stack the poop high, bag it up and discard!\n- Build an agility course to train pets and help them get the exercise they need.\n- Pull the branch in the pet park to discover a surprise!\n\nLIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice and your characters’ movements as you’re telling the story. Create videos up to two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share your storytelling later! \n\nAbout Us:\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

      "label": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training. It is yet another beautifully designed and easy-to-use app for kids“ by lilmagoolie.com"

Discover all the foods you can make and how you can make them!\n\nCREATE AN ORIGINAL VIDEO OF YOUR STORY\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice as you’re telling the story, along with your characters’ movements. Create farm videos up two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share later!\n\nFEATURES:\n- Explore four locations: barn, house, field and store.\n- Create stories for 29 new characters plus all the animals!\n- Feed the animals, milk the cow and gather eggs from your hens.\n- Bottle the milk from the milk tank.\n- Help the vet check the animals.\n- Let the pigs (or people!) wallow in the mud.\n- Clean up different types of animal poop!\n- Grab the banjo, fiddle, guitar or washbucket bass and jam into the night!\n- Pick fruit in your orchard.\n- Farm your crops from planting to harvest.\n- Use your tractor's different functions to farm faster!.\n- Fire up the food machine to turn your harvest into food.\n- Record your stories in the app and share with your friends!\n- No time limit or high scores — play for as long as you like!\n- No third-party advertising\n\nWE LISTEN\nSo many of you asked for a farm in the Toca Life series, and we're excited to give you what you want!

Some say that strange experiments are going on in the living room. One kid I know absolutely swears they heard weird music coming from the basement. Can a house sing? I’ve also talked to kids who say the entire kitchen is covered in slime. Even my best friend, who never believes anything, told me the house is alive!\n\nI had to see for myself\n\nI did, I swear. I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside. I could really use a partner, though. Seriously, will you come with me?\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nPrivacy is an issue that we take very seriously.

But du jeu : appuyer sur les Numberblocks quand ils pointent le bout de leur nez. \n \nUne fois que les petits chercheurs ont trouvé deux Numberblocks, ils doivent les faire glisser l'un sur l'autre pour révéler la magie des chiffres.\n \nQue se passera-t-il en additionnant les blocs ? S'ils ne connaissent pas la réponse, les enfants peuvent tenter de la deviner.\n \nEnsuite, c'est à leur tour de s'essayer à la magie des chiffres en faisant glisser les deux Numberblocks dans la forme qui s'affiche. \nReste alors à trouver la cachette d'autres Numberblocks pour arriver jusqu'à dix.\n \nChaque fois que le nombre dix est atteint, des animations encouragent les enfants à poursuivre leur apprentissage. \nDe nouveaux objets viennent également agrémenter le jeu, invitant à l'interaction.\nPetit à petit, les sommes deviennent plus difficiles et les Numberblocks prennent de nouvelles formes. Les enfants gagnent ainsi en confiance en apprenant à reconnaître les nombres de manière spontanée. Et s'ils croisent un Numberblock qui leur est inconnu, ils peuvent toujours essayer de compter ses blocs.\n \nLa partie continue jusqu'à ce que le parc soit rempli d'objets et de jeux en tout genre. Au bout de 20 objets, les petits mathématiciens en herbe peuvent reprendre le jeu à zéro et continuer à jouer. La répétition est un excellent moyen d'apprendre à manier les chiffres et les additions.\n \n \n \nConfidentialité et sécurité\nNous faisons de la confidentialité et de la sécurité de vos enfants notre priorité absolue.

For each letter you will be able to:\n\n• See it in great detail.\n• Hear the proper pronunciation of its phonemes.\n• Hear the proper pronunciation of its name.\n• See and hear a common Arabic word which begins with that letter.\n\nArabic Alphabet is not only fun, but it's also accurate because it was developed by a native Arabic speaker, and all audio samples were recorded by a college professor of Arabic.\n\n\"I was born and raised in Morocco with Arabic as my language of origin. When I moved to America, I wanted to be sure that I didn't lose my identity and my culture. After my first son was born, this became even more important to me as I want him to understand the importance of his heritage. I developed Arabic Alphabet so that adults and children alike could have a fun way to accurately learn the foundations of the language. I hope you enjoy it!\" —from the developer\n\nWe have finally added two in-app upgrades, so that you can expand your learning:\n\n• The Write feature which allows you to “finger-write” on the screen so that you can memorize and perfect the strokes for each character.\n• The Quiz feature which will help you put everything you’ve learned to the test.    With a little practice, you’ll learn to recognize and write the Arabic Alphabet in no time!"

Choose your plant, then visit five different locations in the lab:\n\n● Grow light: Shine the light on your plant and watch what happens! Does your plant bask and happily sigh in the light, or groan and wriggle away? What happens when you turn the light up a notch or two?\n\n● Watering tank: Put your plant in the tank and fill it up with water. Will your plant float? How does your plant behave when it’s soaking wet?\n\n● Nutrition station: What’s the optimal diet for your plant? Try the three different nutrition formulas and discover which ones your plant character likes!\n\n● Cloning machine: Spin the wheel on the cloning machine and before you know it, you’ll have five little versions of your plant. Wonder what the clones can do? Experiment and find out!\n\n● Crossbreeding apparatus: Here you can mix two plants to create something unexpected. Try it and see what happens!\n\nHave fun experimenting at each station to see how the plants evolve. Keep experimenting until you’ve collected all 35 plant characters in the app. Once you’ve collected a plant, keep experimenting to continue to evolve it! Who says kids can’t be scientists? Toca Lab: Plants brings out the budding botanist in everybody!\n\nFEATURES\n- Start with one plant and experiment your way to 35 different plant characters, each with its own unique personality!\n- Continue to evolve existing plants through experimentation!\n- Evolve plants with five lab tools: grow light, watering tank, nutrition station, cloning machine and the crossbreeding apparatus.\n- Discover plants from five groups: green algae, mosses, ferns, trees and flowering plants.\n- Learn the names and Latin names of real-life plants!\n\n--\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

Kids explore and play with the geological forces that change the Earth—above and below the surface, in minutes and over millions of years. Kids can also learn about conservation as they test clean energy sources, clean up beaches, and preserve forests.\n\nThe Earth is No. 5 in Tinybop’s Explorer’s Library. Each Explorer’s Library app lets kids explore the invisible and awesome wonders of STEM. Kids (and kids at heart!) develop foundational science literacy. \n\n\"This is a great way to let children informally and playfully discover some of the big ideas they’ll encounter later on in their school curriculum. Apps like this one are good reminders for why you spent hundreds of dollars on a phone or tablet for your child.\" — Warren Buckleitner, editor, Children's Technology Review\n\nFeatures: \n     * Investigate how landforms are created.\n     * See the Earth transform over time, from a sphere of boiling rock to the continents we live on today.\n     * Dig under the surface and observe the Earth’s layers from the crust to core.\n     * Weather, erode, and deposit rocks and sediment. Shape the land with your fingertips!\n     * Make a river meander. Make a glacier recede and advance. Create sand dunes, sea stacks, and beaches. Trigger a rockslide!\n     * Discover fossils as you investigate rock formations.\n     * See how plants weather the Earth by making your own garden. \n     * Discover mysteries like frost wedging, stalactites and stalagmites, and hotspots.\n     * Experiment with four different types of volcanoes.\n     * Earth Day ecology bonus interactions about conservation: test clean energy sources, clean up beaches, and preserve forests.\n     * Learn new vocabulary in 40+ languages with interactive labels in close-up scenes.  \n     * Original artwork by Sarah Jacoby.\n     * Intuitive, safe, and kid-friendly design.\n     * Entertaining for kids and adults alike — play together and learn together!\n\nFREE handbook\nOur expert-reviewed handbook is full of facts, interaction tips, and discussion questions to support learning in this app, in the classroom or at home.

      "label": "•  \"This is a must-have app, for any early learning setting\" - Editor's Choice - 4.8 stars out of 5 -Children's Technology Review \n•  \"A fantastic app for helping the young students understand the relationship between numbers and the quantity they stand for” - NBCNews.com \n• Featured by Apple as \"Best for Ages 5 and under\" & as 'New and Noteworthy' (Education)\n• 26,000 units sold to US schools !\n_____\n\nMontessori Numbers is designed to help build sound mathematical foundations in children aged 3-7 by using a concrete, visually significant material inspired from the Montessori methodology.\n\nMontessori Numbers offers a sequence of guided activities that gradually help children reinforce their skills. Each activity offers several levels of increasing complexity.\n\n• Learn to count up to 999\n• Experiment with quantities and learn their names\n• Learn the numerals and their names\n• Understand the relationship between numbers and quantities\n• Understand the decimal system and place value\n• Master the numerical order\n• Learn to trace numbers \n\nMontessori Numbers builds on the iPad’s touch feature, and uses verbal feedback for more efficient learning. The app can pronounce any number between 0 and 1009 (American, British and Australian voices available).\n\n___________\n\nCommon Core State Standard\n___________\n\nThis app will help your child in learning the following Common Core State Standards domains:\n• Counting and Cardinality (K.CC) \n• Operations and Algebraic Thinking (K.OA, 1.OA.1/2/5) \n• Number & Operations in Base Ten (K.BNT,1.NBT.1/2/4/5/6, 2.NBT.1/2/3/5/8/9, 3.NBT.1/2). The app is great to deal with place value.\n\n___________\n\n Activities \n___________\n\n• Hundred Board \nA great activity to help your child master the numerical order of 1-1000, and to introduce numerical patterns. The hundred board displays 100 numbers in a square. The first number (1,101,201,...) can be chosen so it can customized for each child\n\n• 1 to 20\nThis activity is designed to introduce numbers.\n3 levels of difficulty: 0 to 5, 0 to 10 and 11 to 20.\n\n• Quantity\nIn this activity, kids associate quantities to numbers by manipulating units, bars of 10, and squares of 100 to match a given number which is pronounced and optionally displayed.\nLevels of difficulty: 0 to 9, 10 to 99, 100 to 999 or custom\n\n• Numerals\nIn this activity, number names are to be associated with numerals. As a number name is pronounced, kids are invited to build the corresponding numeral. Kids can freely experiment with numerals and hear the names associated with each numeral they build. The quantity representing the numbers built is also displayed to reinforce the association between quantity and numerals.\nLevels of difficulty: 0 to 9, 10 to 99, 100 to 999 or custom\n\n• Numerals (from Quantity)\nIn this activity, a quantity is to be associated with a given numeral. The child must build the number that matches the quantity displayed. This is the most complex activity because the child must count the quantity displayed, and then build the number using the numerals. \nLevels of difficulty: 0 to 9, 10 to 99, 100 to 999 or custom\n\n• Number Tracing \nLearn to trace numbers with animations that follow the child's touch. Several options (size, difficulty, tracing style, show/hide model) are available to tailor the activity to your needs.\n\n• Building Block Game:\nA game can be started at the end of each activity (availability can be modified in settings). There is no “real” goal to this game - kids can play freely with the materials, thus becoming more familiar with them. \n___________\n\nMore Accolades !\n___________\n\n• \"Overall, Montessori Numbers is a great way to expose kids to math in a meaningful way.\" CommonSenseMedia.com\n• Wired's GeekDad Approved \n• \"Montessori Numbers is among the best educational apps for young children I've seen.  The verbal feedback is very supportive. \"   Mary Ellin Logue, Ed.D, Early Childhood Education, University of Maine\n• Rated 5 stars on BestKidsApps.com and MindLeap.com"

Features include enhanced graphics and interactivity, Classical Conversations® Classical Acts & Facts® timeline, and the U.S. presidents!\n\nClassical educators know the importance of memorizing the grammar—the basic facts and vocabulary—of a subject. Now you can memorize the foundational knowledge of seven topics in a fun, interactive iPad and iPhone application. \n\nIn Cycle 2, Classical Conversations students memorize 161 events and people in the timeline, including the U.S. presidents; 24 history sentences from medieval to modern world history; 24 sites or features of European and world geography; 24 science questions and answers on ecology, astronomy, and physics; multiplication tables (1 through 15), squares, roots, cubes, and basic math laws and conversions; Latin verb endings; and English grammar rules. This app corresponds to the Foundations Curriculum, Fifth Edition Second Printing.\n\nMedieval to modern world history is presented in an interactive application with songs and artwork designed to make memorizing enjoyable.\n\nNow integrated with other Classical Conversations resources, each history sentence and science question points you to the corresponding Classical Acts & Facts® card, handy flashcards for classical educators that will expand your memory work in depth and breadth.\n\nNo matter your age, you can build a firm foundation of knowledge by memorizing these building blocks of education.\n\nClassical Conversations Foundations students, ages 4 through 12, have been using these tools in our online subscription service, CC Connected®. The iPad and iPhone application offers these features:\n• Touch screen slides horizontally to reveal memory work by subject\n• Touch screen slides vertically to study each subject by week\n• Touch screen allows students to slide back and forth through the U.S. presidents \n• Navigates back and forth and home easily\n\nClassical Conversations® empowers homeschooling parents and establishes classical, Christian communities that equip children with a biblical worldview and the classical tools of learning in order to impact the world for God’s glory.\n\nVisit us online to learn more: \nClassicalConversations.com\nClassicalConversationsBooks.com\n\nPlease send questions or comments to: customerservice@classicalconversations.com"

Or how far or close they are to each other? Now you can visualize those distances in 3D with a star map divided into 10 parsec sectors (cubes) or 32.62 light years, for an easier observation. Sector (0,0,0) is our home sector and Sol is the Solar System.\r\n\r\nFrom the outskirts of the galaxy, in the Norma-Outer spiral arm to the galactic center's supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*, discover a galaxy full of amazing facts. Notable structures included: the Pillars of Creation, Helix Nebula, the Engraved Hourglass Nebula, the Pleiades, the Orion Arm (where the solar system and the Earth are located) with its Orion belt. Check out neighboring dwarf galaxies such as Sagittarius and the Canis Major Overdensity, stellar streams as well as internal galactic components such as a variety of nebulae, star clusters or supernovae.\r\nPhotos are taken by NASA spacecraft and ground based telescopes like Hubble Space Telescope, Chandra X-Ray, Herschel Space Observatory and the Spitzer Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n▶ Almost 4.5 milion stars, over 4000 exoplanets, 200 circumstellar disks, 38 black holes, 11 magnetars and around 2500 pulsars in the database\r\n▶ Planets are updated daily from multiple sources, without needing to update the app\t\r\n▶ Stars extracted from SIMBAD from multiple catalogs like the European Space Agency's Hipparcos mission, the Gliese catalogue and parts of the ASCC - All Sky Compiled Catalogue and the most recent GAIA catalogue\r\n▶ 3D representations of all star systems and their orbits (green stars = unknown spectrum)\r\n▶ black holes in binary systems, including the famous Cygnus X-1 and the Great Annihilator (the only binary system with a black hole and a pulsar)\r\n▶ pulsars and pulsar planets - the first type of planet ever discovered beyond our solar system, orbiting the extremely dense core of a massive star that exploded as a supernova. Fewer than 1% of pulsars have been found to host planets.\r\n▶ magnetars, a special and rare type of neutron star\r\n▶ Search for stars, planets, disks, black holes, neutron stars and magnetars by a wide range of parameters: name, type, system type, constellation, catalog, star type (color)\r\n▶ Detailed information for every stellar object\r\n\r\nExplore space and get a little closer to our wonderful universe with this awesome astronomy app! \r\nThis interactive 3D map is excellent for teachers to use for instruction, and it is a great resource for students to explore the Milky Way galaxy and space as they learn more about the universe we live in. \r\n\r\nAn internet connection is necessary to access the online stellar database as well as the wiki information. A subset of the database between sectors (-10,-10,-10) and (10,10,10) can be queried offline including planetary and orbit data."

      "label": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

      "label": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

Some say that strange experiments are going on in the living room. One kid I know absolutely swears they heard weird music coming from the basement. Can a house sing? I’ve also talked to kids who say the entire kitchen is covered in slime. Even my best friend, who never believes anything, told me the house is alive!\n\nI had to see for myself\n\nI did, I swear. I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside. I could really use a partner, though. Seriously, will you come with me?\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nPrivacy is an issue that we take very seriously.

The world of science just got a little bit weirder and a lot more fun with Toca Lab: Plants!\n\nJust like with the first app in the Toca Lab Series, Toca Lab: Elements, your curiosity will lead the way. Choose your plant, then visit five different locations in the lab:\n\n● Grow light: Shine the light on your plant and watch what happens! Does your plant bask and happily sigh in the light, or groan and wriggle away? What happens when you turn the light up a notch or two?\n\n● Watering tank: Put your plant in the tank and fill it up with water. Will your plant float? How does your plant behave when it’s soaking wet?\n\n● Nutrition station: What’s the optimal diet for your plant? Try the three different nutrition formulas and discover which ones your plant character likes!\n\n● Cloning machine: Spin the wheel on the cloning machine and before you know it, you’ll have five little versions of your plant. Wonder what the clones can do? Experiment and find out!\n\n● Crossbreeding apparatus: Here you can mix two plants to create something unexpected. Try it and see what happens!\n\nHave fun experimenting at each station to see how the plants evolve. Keep experimenting until you’ve collected all 35 plant characters in the app. Once you’ve collected a plant, keep experimenting to continue to evolve it! Who says kids can’t be scientists? Toca Lab: Plants brings out the budding botanist in everybody!\n\nFEATURES\n- Start with one plant and experiment your way to 35 different plant characters, each with its own unique personality!\n- Continue to evolve existing plants through experimentation!\n- Evolve plants with five lab tools: grow light, watering tank, nutrition station, cloning machine and the crossbreeding apparatus.\n- Discover plants from five groups: green algae, mosses, ferns, trees and flowering plants.\n- Learn the names and Latin names of real-life plants!\n\n--\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

GraphoGame Helps Kindergarten and Elementary School Kids Learn to Read and Spell Letters, Syllables and Words with American English Phonics.  \n\nFEATURES: \n\n• NO ADS OR IN-APP PURCHASES   \n• Rated for Kids 4 to 9 Years Old \n• Play Without Internet   \n• Levels Adapt to Player Ability \n• In-App Progress Reports and Literacy Analytics   \n• Earn Rewards and Use Them to Customize Your Avatar!   \n• Two Game Modes: Stars (school use) and Map (at home use)   \n• New 3D Map Immerses Kids in an Engaging Learning Adventure \n• GDPR, CCPA and COPPA-compliant; plus, We Do Not Collect Personal Data  \n• Proven Efficacy in Children with Dyslexia and Autism \n• Full Content Forever. Never Pay More for New Content or Features!   \n\nGraphoGame was created by pedagogical experts, linguists and neuroscientists from Yale and Cambridge Universities to achieve basic literacy in children - from kindergarten onwards.  Research trials show that by playing just 15 minutes, 3 times per week, kids can improve their letter knowledge, phonics awareness, reading speed and overall confidence in literacy.  Literacy outcomes are equivalent with 1-to-1 teacher support as shown by a randomized controlled trial conducted by the Centre for Neuroscience in Education, University of Cambridge.  Witness kids learning their first letters, syllables and words at home or in school with GraphoGame!   \n\nKids learn to read with American English phonics and a variety of engaging 3D levels – all with their own unique avatar.  Players gradually move from graphemes and phonemes, through vowels, consonants, syllables and rhymes, to eventually learn how to blend what they have mastered into complete words.  Play at home or in school! \n\nThis version of GraphoGame is the result of work done by Haskins Laboratories, an independent, not-for-profit research institute founded in 1935, investigating the biological basis of speech, language and reading, and their related disabilities. GraphoGame is based on decades of research in dyslexia, autism, neurolinguistics and phonics by the University of Jyväskylä in Finland and was adapted to English by the University of Cambridge Centre for Neuroscience in Education and Yale’s Haskins Laboratories.  Kindergarten to grade 3 students - including those with dyslexia or autism - have shown the most literacy improvement playing GraphoGame American English. \n\nVisit www.graphogame.com to learn more.   \n\n  \n\nGame icon © Grapho Group Oy, Ville Mönkkönen & Mika Halttunen"

Imitation is what children do best and how they learn best. \nThe recommended three minutes fly by and \"MyTeeth\" can even play your child's favourite music. (Some adults use the app for a relaxing brushing time). \nYour child will be motivated to brush regularly with small stickers and new toothbrushes. Additionally, each character has his own little story, of course about the toothbrushing topic.\n„MyTeeth“ can be easily adapted to your child's current abilities, from circular brushing to the bass method, and contains lots of useful tips and information in the parent area, from oral hygiene during pregnancy to dental floss and the choice of the right toothbrush - all-round care. Co-developed and recommended by dentists, loved by children.\n\nChange your child's tooth future today.\n\n_____________________________________\n“MyTeeth“ makes all the difference\n\n• 6 lovingly animated toothbrush friends:\n• With their own personality and individual quotations\n• With its own background story\n• With personal trait\n• With own stickers\n• Left- and right-handed\n• 4 cleaning techniques: simple brushing, circular cleaning, red-to-white and the bass method\n• 2 sequences: Pedagogical and Classical (KAI)\n• Motivation for your children:\n• New stickers for daily cleaning\n•  New toothbrushes every 6 weeks\n• Generic and individual slogans to engage\n•  Illustrations by Christian Heuser\n•  Includes iMessage app\n•  Individual settings for each toothbrush buddy possible\n•  „MyTeeth“ Music included\n•  Or choose your own music\n•  Step-by-step instructions for parents in our How & Why reference book:\n• Current medical knowledge\n• Learn everything you need about kids teeth\n• How kids gradually learn to brush their teeth\n• Explanation of the different brushing techniques\n• And many useful tips and details \n\nWebseite: TheKeptPromise.com \nFacebook: facebook.com/TheKeptPromise \nTwitter: @TheKeptPromise"

(Hello friends!)\n\nTake the first step toward learning a new language with Russian Alphabet.\n\nThis app teaches you the foundations of Russian in a fun and unique way allowing you to:\n\n• See each letter.\n• Hear the proper pronunciation for each letter phonetic.\n• For each letter, see and hear a common Russian word which begins with that letter.\n\nRussian Alphabet is not only fun, but it’s also accurate because it was developed by a native Russian speaker.\n\n*This app requires no network connection allowing you to take your studies with you anywhere. Beware – similar apps require internet connectivity.\n\nRussian Alphabet contains two in-app purchases, so that you can expand your learning:\n\n• The practice feature which allows you to “finger-write” on the screen so that you can memorize and perfect the strokes for each character.\n\n• The quiz feature which will help you put everything you’ve learned to the test.    With a little practice, you’ll learn to recognize and write the Russian Alphabet in no time!"

You can travel around the world with numerous flying objects, cars and ships.\nYou can disguise yourself as a Viking, pirate or pilot. \n\nWith its numerous objects, this \"\"digital doll's house\"\" is perfect for creative role-playing.\nYour children will learn about the special features of different countries (Mexico, USA, India, France, the Caribbean and Germany) and discover differences but also numerous similarities.\nTo ensure that no child feels excluded, Fiete World contains a variety of people with different skin colours.\n\nNEW in this version: \nMEXICO\nWith horses, jeep, or pick-up truck through the jungle, walking through the city with a huge mechanical skeleton or with a hot air balloon over the cactus-covered desert. \nFeeding jungle animals, making chocolate, painting murals, making tacos or fighting with wrestlers. Mexico offers a lot of extreme variety.\n\nUSA\nChildren can ride a Ferris wheel in the colourful theme park and re-enact the moon landing or Jurassic Park in the film studio. They play with Kong the giant ape, visit the school and the record shop and when they are hungry they visit the burger shop or eat something at the hot dog stand. Then they can go to work at the harbour, play with the crane and unload ships.\n\nFRANCE\nIn venerable France, for example, children can sit in the evening in a chic café on the Seine under the Eiffel Tower, or they can play robber and gendarme with the police. Of course there is also a police helicopter, a police boat and a police car.\n\nINDIA\nIn densely populated India, the children can harvest tropical fruits and squeeze juices, change tires in the Auto Werkstadt, ride an elephant or work on the latest robot technology. What is particularly exciting here are the clear contrasts between tradition and technology.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS OF THE APP\n- Discover a huge world\n- Switch between day and night mode\n- Go on a treasure hunt, sail the pirate ship\n- Ride an elephant, dinosaur \n- Play with a robot or with a huge skeleton\n- Fell trees and use the wood to make a fire\n- Disguise yourself\n- plant flowers and vegetables\n- Change the wheels of all cars\n- Bake a cake\n- Fly a helicopter, a jet, a historic aircraft, a hot air balloon or a U.F.O.\n- have a picnic on the beach - deliver packages\n- Send postcards around the world\n- Discover souvenirs from all over the world in Fiete's room\n\nIMPROVE CHILDREN\n- Fantasy role playing games\n- Telling your own stories\n- Experiment\n- Interaction with others\n- Understanding the world\n- Open-mindedness\n\nABOUT US\nWe are Ahoiii, a small app development studio from Cologne.

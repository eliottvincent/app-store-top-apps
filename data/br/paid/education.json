      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

Some say that strange experiments are going on in the living room. One kid I know absolutely swears they heard weird music coming from the basement. Can a house sing? I’ve also talked to kids who say the entire kitchen is covered in slime. Even my best friend, who never believes anything, told me the house is alive!\n\nI had to see for myself\n\nI did, I swear. I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside. I could really use a partner, though. Seriously, will you come with me?\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nPrivacy is an issue that we take very seriously.

If it’s too challenging, just press the Hints button to get help with the time expressions. The app also contains exercises on elapsed time, such as ”What time is it in 20 minutes?”. In the final category you can test your acquired skills with a mix of different styled clocks.\n\nIn addition to the many exercises, there is also an experimental mode where the relationship between the clock and the time of day is illustrated with the passing of the sun and moon across the sky. You can freely drag the hands of the clock and see how the sky changes and also get the time read out load.\n\nThe app is suitable for children in grades K-3.\n\nCategories\n1. Tell the time\n2.

This app contains an in-depth guide to the most popular and widely used Programming language C++. If you are a new Programmer or starting C Plus Plus Programming then this app is going to be your best friend.\n\nC++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of the C language. It is, therefore, possible to code C++ in a \"C style\" or \"object-oriented style.\" In certain scenarios, it can be coded in either way and is thus an effective example of a hybrid language.\n\nC Plus Plus is considered to be an intermediate-level language, as it encapsulates both high- and low-level language features. Initially, the language was called \"C with classes\" as it had all the properties of the C language with an additional concept of \"classes.\" However, it was renamed C++ in 1983.\n\nWhat you will learn: \n\n1- C++ Programming Overview\n2- C++ Programming Environment\n3- Learn C++ Syntax\n4- Learn C++ Comments\n5- Learn C++ Data Types\n6- C++ Variable Types\n7- Variable Scopes\n8- Constants & Literals\n9- Learn C Plus Plus Modifiers Types\n10- Storage Classe\n11- Learn C Plus Plus Operators\n12- Learn C Plus Plus Loops\n13- Decision making\n14- C Plus Plus Functions\n15- Numbers\n16- C++ Arrays\n17- C++ Strings\n18- C++ Pointers\n19- References\n20- Learn Date & Time in C++\n21- Basic Input & Output in C++\n22- C++ Data Structure\n23- Classes Objects\n24- Inheritance\n25- Learn C++ Overloading\n26- C++ Polymorphism\n27- Abstraction\n28- C++ Interfaces\n29- Files and Streams in C++\n30- Exception Handling\n31- Dynamic Memor\n32- Namespaces\n33- Learn C++ Templates\n34- C++ Preprocessor\n35- Signal handling\n36- Multithreading\n37- Learn Web Development with C++\n\n\nSo Why you Should Learn C++?\n\n1- Scalability\nC++'s greatest strength is how scalable it could be, so apps that are very resource-intensive are usually built with it. Graphics require a lot of resources, which is why the most beautiful 3D games you happily feast your eyes on are often built with C++.\n\n2- Fast\nAs a statically typed language, C++ is generally more performant than dynamically typed languages because the code is type-checked before it is executed. Java is gaining ground in terms of speed, but in the end, depending on how talented the C++ developer is, C++ can still be faster than Java.\n\n3- Control\nAs mentioned before, since you have a lot of control over how your app uses resources, your app can take up very little resource. All in all, since C++ can be very performant in the right hands, enterprises often use C++ to code functions that have a critical reliance on speed and resource usage.\n\nSo if you like our effort please rate this app or comment below if you want to give us any suggestions or ideas. Thanks"

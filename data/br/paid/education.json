      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "Flashnote Derby is a fun way for kids to learn and practice reading music notes. \n\nEach race is a timed test in which the student identifies different notes in order to urge their horse on towards the finish line. Answering quickly and correctly will cause their horse to gain ground, while incorrect answers will cause it to fall behind. At the end of each race, students can review the notes they missed and see the correct answers. \n\nPlayers can respond to flashcards by simply playing the note on their acoustic or MIDI instrument. They can also choose to answer by tapping letter buttons or playing a key on an on-screen piano.\n\nThe game is fully customizable to allow for any desired notes in the treble, bass, alto, or tenor clefs to be included. You can select ranges of notes, or several individual notes to focus on specific areas that need work. Notes can be shown with sharps and flats and key signatures can even be added to increase the challenge for more advanced students. The amount of time the player is given for each flashcard can be increased or decreased depending upon their age and level of experience.\n\nDrills can start out simply, with only a handful of notes, and gradually be made more challenging until the full staff is mastered (up to five and a half ledger lines above or below the staff.) The more difficult the settings, the more points are awarded. The 'high score' is tracked so that players always have a goal to shoot for.\n\nAs a bonus, over a dozen instructional video lessons are easily accessible from right inside the app! Even children with no prior music instruction can start using Flashnote Derby right away to begin learning about the music alphabet, the staff, and how to identify different notes.\n\nBecause it can be set up so quickly, Flashnote Derby provides a perfect motivational tool for music teachers to use with students, even for just a minute or two of each lesson. Teachers have the ability to email homework assignments to their students for them to play on their own devices at home. Each player's performance is recorded so that their progress can be tracked. You can easily see which notes are most in need of review.  \n\nWhen students give up on their music lessons, it's usually because they find it too difficult. Learning basic skills early is key to laying the groundwork for future success. Flashnote Derby makes this process more enjoyable and helps students stay motivated in their music learning.\n\nSometimes it takes only a little extra effort to make the difference between success and failure. Download Flashnote Derby and get on the road to music reading mastery today!"

      "label": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

      "label": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training. It is yet another beautifully designed and easy-to-use app for kids“ by lilmagoolie.com"

From sunup to sundown, Toca Life: Farm is fun on the farm!\n\nEXPLORE LIFE ON THE FARM\nThe four locations in Toca Life: Farm will give you everything you need to tell your farm stories. Tend to the animals in the barn — feed them and clean up their poop! Once you've taken care of the animals, head to the house, where you can have a meal then grab your banjo for an impromptu jam session.

Harvest your produce and head to the store, where you can sell your food, make new products and buy goods!\n\nTURN YOUR HARVEST INTO FOOD\nPlant your seeds and find out how to make them grow! Tinker with your tractor to see what it can do! The food machine magically turns your raw ingredients into food: Use milk to make cheese, then use the cheese and corn to make cheese puffs! Use berries to make jam, wheat to make bread, and then use those ingredients to make donuts! Discover all the foods you can make and how you can make them!\n\nCREATE AN ORIGINAL VIDEO OF YOUR STORY\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice as you’re telling the story, along with your characters’ movements. Create farm videos up two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share later!\n\nFEATURES:\n- Explore four locations: barn, house, field and store.\n- Create stories for 29 new characters plus all the animals!\n- Feed the animals, milk the cow and gather eggs from your hens.\n- Bottle the milk from the milk tank.\n- Help the vet check the animals.\n- Let the pigs (or people!) wallow in the mud.\n- Clean up different types of animal poop!\n- Grab the banjo, fiddle, guitar or washbucket bass and jam into the night!\n- Pick fruit in your orchard.\n- Farm your crops from planting to harvest.\n- Use your tractor's different functions to farm faster!.\n- Fire up the food machine to turn your harvest into food.\n- Record your stories in the app and share with your friends!\n- No time limit or high scores — play for as long as you like!\n- No third-party advertising\n\nWE LISTEN\nSo many of you asked for a farm in the Toca Life series, and we're excited to give you what you want!

The child can then choose an activity to do while waiting. \n\nFeelings Board \nThe Feelings Board provides a tool for helping children understand and express emotions. The user can begin by reading the companion book, When I Get Upset, to provide an example of how the child might recognize an emotion and choose a coping strategy. On the Feelings Board, the user can then help the child indicate how they are feeling from a range of options, select a coping strategy, and then request an activity to help them feel better or re-engage with others. \n\nFeelings Scale\nHelps users identify, manage and cope with feelings across environments throughout the day. By tracking their feelings on the board, users can analyze the data for trends to learn if tasks done at different times of day or in different environments affect outcome. Environments and schedules can then be altered to achieve better results.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.beevisual.com/mobile-app-eula.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.beevisual.com/mobile-app-privacy.html"

You can travel around the world with numerous flying objects, cars and ships.\nYou can disguise yourself as a Viking, pirate or pilot. \n\nWith its numerous objects, this \"\"digital doll's house\"\" is perfect for creative role-playing.\nYour children will learn about the special features of different countries (Mexico, USA, India, France, the Caribbean and Germany) and discover differences but also numerous similarities.\nTo ensure that no child feels excluded, Fiete World contains a variety of people with different skin colours.\n\nNEW in this version: \nMEXICO\nWith horses, jeep, or pick-up truck through the jungle, walking through the city with a huge mechanical skeleton or with a hot air balloon over the cactus-covered desert. \nFeeding jungle animals, making chocolate, painting murals, making tacos or fighting with wrestlers. Mexico offers a lot of extreme variety.\n\nUSA\nChildren can ride a Ferris wheel in the colourful theme park and re-enact the moon landing or Jurassic Park in the film studio. They play with Kong the giant ape, visit the school and the record shop and when they are hungry they visit the burger shop or eat something at the hot dog stand. Then they can go to work at the harbour, play with the crane and unload ships.\n\nFRANCE\nIn venerable France, for example, children can sit in the evening in a chic café on the Seine under the Eiffel Tower, or they can play robber and gendarme with the police. Of course there is also a police helicopter, a police boat and a police car.\n\nINDIA\nIn densely populated India, the children can harvest tropical fruits and squeeze juices, change tires in the Auto Werkstadt, ride an elephant or work on the latest robot technology. What is particularly exciting here are the clear contrasts between tradition and technology.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS OF THE APP\n- Discover a huge world\n- Switch between day and night mode\n- Go on a treasure hunt, sail the pirate ship\n- Ride an elephant, dinosaur \n- Play with a robot or with a huge skeleton\n- Fell trees and use the wood to make a fire\n- Disguise yourself\n- plant flowers and vegetables\n- Change the wheels of all cars\n- Bake a cake\n- Fly a helicopter, a jet, a historic aircraft, a hot air balloon or a U.F.O.\n- have a picnic on the beach - deliver packages\n- Send postcards around the world\n- Discover souvenirs from all over the world in Fiete's room\n\nIMPROVE CHILDREN\n- Fantasy role playing games\n- Telling your own stories\n- Experiment\n- Interaction with others\n- Understanding the world\n- Open-mindedness\n\nABOUT US\nWe are Ahoiii, a small app development studio from Cologne.

I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside.

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

The goal is to solve the puzzles and roll through the end of the maze where a new Thinkroll waits to be unlocked and lead the next quest! \n\nHOW TO PLAY\n\nThe app offers 207 clever puzzle levels filled with fun science concepts. Seven playful elements with unique physical properties are gradually introduced. Kids will discover through hands-on manipulation how to use these objects to their advantage and clear a path. \n\n• Cookies • Munch them to clear a path or resist those treats to avoid getting trapped!\n\n• Crates • Push them to fill gaps or stack them to reach higher ground.\n\n• Balloons • Burst them on spikes to get them out of your way.\n\n• Rocks • Get a crash course in Newtonian physics by dropping heavy, dense boulders to break through cracked ground. \n\n• Jelly • Bounce Thinkrolls and objects on springy jellies to launch them up.\n\n• Fire • Use ice blocks to put out the fire and safely pass through. \n\n• Elevators • Timing is added to the mix! Synchronize movements of two different elevators to navigate through the maze.\n\nMASTER THE ART OF THINKING\n\nLittle players will master the art of thinking while using to their advantage force, acceleration, buoyancy, heat, elasticity and gravity to reach the end of the maze. The puzzles gradually build upon successive science lessons to strengthen observation, creative thinking, logic, problem solving, spatial cognition and memory.\n\nThere are unlimited tries and no penalties. Thinkrolls not only challenges the brain but also develops and rewards patience and perseverance. As kids try different combinations to achieve their goal, they intuitively learn through trial and error what works. They must think ahead, use precise timing and rely on their memory to reunite their Thinkroll buddies. \n________________________________\n\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n\n• 207 levels with mind-sharpening puzzles\n• Easy mode for ages 3-5, hard mode for ages 5-8\n• Hands-on physics lessons\n• Experiment with gravity, heat, buoyancy, speed, elasticity, friction and other science concepts\n• Enhance logic, spatial cognition, problem solving, memory, perseverance \n• 26 hilarious, super smart characters to play with\n• Fun brain training for the whole family\n• Track progress for up to 9 player profiles\n• Supreme design and beautiful artwork\n• Original soundtrack and sound design\n• Language neutral game-play\n• COPPA compliant, no 3rd party ads, no in-app purchases\n\nMore info: avokiddo.com\n________________________________\n\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\nWe respect your privacy!

      "label": "NoteWorks is a musical game, designed to teach note recognition and improve sight reading skills. Hungry Munchy is eager to swallow elusive blue notes. Your goal is to help Munchy catch each note as quickly as possible. \n\nThe game combines learning and fun into a single gratifying experience. The app is both educational and entertaining, with an intuitive and visually appealing interface. \n\nNoteWorks was created for: \n• iPhone, iPod touch and iPad users.\n• Players of all ages. \n• Beginners to advanced music students. \n• Families with multiple players. \n• Music teachers with multiple students. \n\nGame design features include: \n• A funny animated character. \n• User-friendly menus. \n• Superb graphics. \n• Engaging sound effects. \n\nNote reading options: \n• On-screen piano keyboard input.\n• On-screen guitar fretboard input.\n• MIDI keyboard input.  \n• \"A, B, C\" note naming:\n. . . CDEFGAB\n. . . CDEFGAH\n. . . ABCDEFG\n. . . AHCDEFG \n• \"Do, Re, Mi\" (Fixed Do) note naming. \n• Treble clef. \n• Bass clef. \n• Tenor clef. \n• Alto clef. \n• Custom note range in all four clefs.\n\nEducational features: \n• Students learn by playing and having fun. \n• Multiple game settings allow players to stay in control. \n• Students can choose to play with hints. \n• Students play without hints to earn points and stars. \n• Players learn to recognize notes instantly, on sight. \n• For beginners, the game starts by teaching a limited range of notes. \n• Note range can be easily customized as students advance. \n• After mastering accidentals, students learn key signatures. \n• Game speed is controlled to increase or decrease difficulty, or students may choose to play without any time limit.\n• Sharing of game progress: ability to share game results with teachers.\n\nWhile music teachers persistently stress the importance of sight reading, most teachers prefer not to spend valuable lesson time on basic note recognition skills. Thus, NoteWorks helps music teachers concentrate on more interesting aspects of their art, such as technique and musicality. \n\nSerious music students can take advantage of the game to learn clefs outside of their own instruments, as well as prepare for music theory exams. In addition, non-musicians could use NoteWorks as an interesting memory game, to help keep their minds sharp and quick. \n\nNoteWorks was created for people who like to learn by playing and having fun. It was designed with the objective of neither being too easy nor too hard, and never boring. We hope you'll find NoteWorks both useful and entertaining, and we would greatly appreciate it if you could share your thoughts and opinions about the game by rating it."

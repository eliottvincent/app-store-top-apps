      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

Kids explore and play with the geological forces that change the Earth—above and below the surface, in minutes and over millions of years. Kids can also learn about conservation as they test clean energy sources, clean up beaches, and preserve forests.\n\nThe Earth is No. 5 in Tinybop’s Explorer’s Library. Each Explorer’s Library app lets kids explore the invisible and awesome wonders of STEM. Kids (and kids at heart!) develop foundational science literacy. \n\n\"This is a great way to let children informally and playfully discover some of the big ideas they’ll encounter later on in their school curriculum. Apps like this one are good reminders for why you spent hundreds of dollars on a phone or tablet for your child.\" — Warren Buckleitner, editor, Children's Technology Review\n\nFeatures: \n     * Investigate how landforms are created.\n     * See the Earth transform over time, from a sphere of boiling rock to the continents we live on today.\n     * Dig under the surface and observe the Earth’s layers from the crust to core.\n     * Weather, erode, and deposit rocks and sediment. Shape the land with your fingertips!\n     * Make a river meander. Make a glacier recede and advance. Create sand dunes, sea stacks, and beaches. Trigger a rockslide!\n     * Discover fossils as you investigate rock formations.\n     * See how plants weather the Earth by making your own garden. \n     * Discover mysteries like frost wedging, stalactites and stalagmites, and hotspots.\n     * Experiment with four different types of volcanoes.\n     * Earth Day ecology bonus interactions about conservation: test clean energy sources, clean up beaches, and preserve forests.\n     * Learn new vocabulary in 40+ languages with interactive labels in close-up scenes.  \n     * Original artwork by Sarah Jacoby.\n     * Intuitive, safe, and kid-friendly design.\n     * Entertaining for kids and adults alike — play together and learn together!\n\nFREE handbook\nOur expert-reviewed handbook is full of facts, interaction tips, and discussion questions to support learning in this app, in the classroom or at home.

      "label": "NoteWorks is a musical game, designed to teach note recognition and improve sight reading skills. Hungry Munchy is eager to swallow elusive blue notes. Your goal is to help Munchy catch each note as quickly as possible. \n\nThe game combines learning and fun into a single gratifying experience. The app is both educational and entertaining, with an intuitive and visually appealing interface. \n\nNoteWorks was created for: \n• iPhone, iPod touch and iPad users.\n• Players of all ages. \n• Beginners to advanced music students. \n• Families with multiple players. \n• Music teachers with multiple students. \n\nGame design features include: \n• A funny animated character. \n• User-friendly menus. \n• Superb graphics. \n• Engaging sound effects. \n\nNote reading options: \n• On-screen piano keyboard input.\n• On-screen guitar fretboard input.\n• MIDI keyboard input.  \n• \"A, B, C\" note naming:\n. . . CDEFGAB\n. . . CDEFGAH\n. . . ABCDEFG\n. . . AHCDEFG \n• \"Do, Re, Mi\" (Fixed Do) note naming. \n• Treble clef. \n• Bass clef. \n• Tenor clef. \n• Alto clef. \n• Custom note range in all four clefs.\n\nEducational features: \n• Students learn by playing and having fun. \n• Multiple game settings allow players to stay in control. \n• Students can choose to play with hints. \n• Students play without hints to earn points and stars. \n• Players learn to recognize notes instantly, on sight. \n• For beginners, the game starts by teaching a limited range of notes. \n• Note range can be easily customized as students advance. \n• After mastering accidentals, students learn key signatures. \n• Game speed is controlled to increase or decrease difficulty, or students may choose to play without any time limit.\n• Sharing of game progress: ability to share game results with teachers.\n\nWhile music teachers persistently stress the importance of sight reading, most teachers prefer not to spend valuable lesson time on basic note recognition skills. Thus, NoteWorks helps music teachers concentrate on more interesting aspects of their art, such as technique and musicality. \n\nSerious music students can take advantage of the game to learn clefs outside of their own instruments, as well as prepare for music theory exams. In addition, non-musicians could use NoteWorks as an interesting memory game, to help keep their minds sharp and quick. \n\nNoteWorks was created for people who like to learn by playing and having fun. It was designed with the objective of neither being too easy nor too hard, and never boring. We hope you'll find NoteWorks both useful and entertaining, and we would greatly appreciate it if you could share your thoughts and opinions about the game by rating it."

Using this app, you can let someone know what he’s working for, how much work he needs to do, and how close he is to earning a reward for that work. You can use this for lessons in school, chores at home, getting your children to eat their vegetables, and much more! Start the app by selecting the number of tokens (1-5) your student must earn. Then set up your student's reinforcer choice board by selecting 1-6 items from our pre-loaded symbol library or your own photo library. To delete a picture from the teacher choice screen just press down on an image for 5 seconds. Show the choice board to your student to select what to work for and then begin your lesson. Each time a student earns a token, slide a token to the empty dot. Once the student has earned all of his tokens, push the \"cash in\" button to show your student what he's earned! The token board resets to start the next deal or you can create a new choice board for your student to select a new reinforcer.\n\nThis app is now available in American English and Brazilian Portuguese. To enable Brazilian Portuguese please make sure your Apple device is set to use Portuguese as its main language via Settings->General->International.\n\nVisit www.pecs.com for more information on using visual reinforcement systems.\n\nFeature Summary\n•Select number of tokens for each deal (1-5)\n•Customize student choice board to include up to 6 images selected from preloaded images or images in your photo library\n•Bright token board to contrast with materials on student's desktop\n•Token board shows student what he's working for, how many tokens he needs, his progress in the deal.\n•Student \"cashes in\" at end of deal by pushing button.

After a good night's sleep head out to the field to tend to your crops. Harvest your produce and head to the store, where you can sell your food, make new products and buy goods!\n\nTURN YOUR HARVEST INTO FOOD\nPlant your seeds and find out how to make them grow! Tinker with your tractor to see what it can do! The food machine magically turns your raw ingredients into food: Use milk to make cheese, then use the cheese and corn to make cheese puffs! Use berries to make jam, wheat to make bread, and then use those ingredients to make donuts! Discover all the foods you can make and how you can make them!\n\nCREATE AN ORIGINAL VIDEO OF YOUR STORY\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice as you’re telling the story, along with your characters’ movements. Create farm videos up two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share later!\n\nFEATURES:\n- Explore four locations: barn, house, field and store.\n- Create stories for 29 new characters plus all the animals!\n- Feed the animals, milk the cow and gather eggs from your hens.\n- Bottle the milk from the milk tank.\n- Help the vet check the animals.\n- Let the pigs (or people!) wallow in the mud.\n- Clean up different types of animal poop!\n- Grab the banjo, fiddle, guitar or washbucket bass and jam into the night!\n- Pick fruit in your orchard.\n- Farm your crops from planting to harvest.\n- Use your tractor's different functions to farm faster!.\n- Fire up the food machine to turn your harvest into food.\n- Record your stories in the app and share with your friends!\n- No time limit or high scores — play for as long as you like!\n- No third-party advertising\n\nWE LISTEN\nSo many of you asked for a farm in the Toca Life series, and we're excited to give you what you want!

I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside. I could really use a partner, though. Seriously, will you come with me?\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nPrivacy is an issue that we take very seriously.

The world of science just got a little bit weirder and a lot more fun with Toca Lab: Plants!\n\nJust like with the first app in the Toca Lab Series, Toca Lab: Elements, your curiosity will lead the way. Choose your plant, then visit five different locations in the lab:\n\n● Grow light: Shine the light on your plant and watch what happens! Does your plant bask and happily sigh in the light, or groan and wriggle away? What happens when you turn the light up a notch or two?\n\n● Watering tank: Put your plant in the tank and fill it up with water. Will your plant float? How does your plant behave when it’s soaking wet?\n\n● Nutrition station: What’s the optimal diet for your plant? Try the three different nutrition formulas and discover which ones your plant character likes!\n\n● Cloning machine: Spin the wheel on the cloning machine and before you know it, you’ll have five little versions of your plant. Wonder what the clones can do? Experiment and find out!\n\n● Crossbreeding apparatus: Here you can mix two plants to create something unexpected. Try it and see what happens!\n\nHave fun experimenting at each station to see how the plants evolve. Keep experimenting until you’ve collected all 35 plant characters in the app. Once you’ve collected a plant, keep experimenting to continue to evolve it! Who says kids can’t be scientists? Toca Lab: Plants brings out the budding botanist in everybody!\n\nFEATURES\n- Start with one plant and experiment your way to 35 different plant characters, each with its own unique personality!\n- Continue to evolve existing plants through experimentation!\n- Evolve plants with five lab tools: grow light, watering tank, nutrition station, cloning machine and the crossbreeding apparatus.\n- Discover plants from five groups: green algae, mosses, ferns, trees and flowering plants.\n- Learn the names and Latin names of real-life plants!\n\n--\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

      "label": "The Choiceworks app is an essential learning tool that helps children complete daily routines (morning, day, & night), understand & manage feelings and improve waiting skills (taking turns and not interrupting).  Choiceworks is designed for caregivers to provide clear and consistent support to foster a child’s independence, positive behavior, and emotional regulation at home and in the community. It can also be customized for teachers in a school setting. \n \nKey features included with Choiceworks:\n■ Full, unlimited access to all four board types: Schedule, Waiting, Feelings and Feelings Scale\n■ Image Library preloaded with over 180 images and audio \n■ Add your own images and record your own audio for limitless customizability \n■ Attach video to any board image\n■ Easily create profiles to personalize and manage multiple users\n■ Save an unlimited number of boards for multiple children or different routines \n■ Speaks boards out loud with child or adult voice\n■ Share boards by Email, Files app or iTunes with other Choiceworks app users \n■ Ability to print boards or save as PDF\n\nAdditional features included with Choiceworks+ (Early Access):\n■ Synchronize across all your devices\n■ Advanced sharing options\n■ Custom themes\n■ Library Assistant\n■ Custom timer sounds\n\nWhat do you get with Choiceworks and Choiceworks+?\nWith your Choiceworks purchase you get access to all the features that have made it an award winning support app used in classrooms and homes around the globe for over a decade. No additional in-app purchase or subscriptions are required and there are no limits to how many boards or images you can create and share.\n\nIf you subscribe to Choiceworks+, you will get additional time saving data management features and customization options that further enhance your experience.  You will also receive additional premium features as they are released in future updates.  Note: Choiceworks+ features require an Apple ID to function properly.  If you are in a school or business setting, check with your IT administrator for any restrictions before you subscribe.\n\nSchedule Board \nThe Schedule Board makes task completion easier and more fun! The schedule is paired with an ‘all done’ column to check off steps toward a motivating reward. Timers can be added to any task or activity. The schedules are easy to edit and fully customizable. Once you have created a schedule, it will be saved automatically.\n\nWaiting Board \nThe Waiting Board teaches waiting skills like taking turns and not interrupting. The user can begin by reading the companion book, When Do I Have to Wait? Using the waiting board, the top picture indicates the reason why the child is waiting and a timer can be set to show how long the child will wait. The child can then choose an activity to do while waiting. \n\nFeelings Board \nThe Feelings Board provides a tool for helping children understand and express emotions. The user can begin by reading the companion book, When I Get Upset, to provide an example of how the child might recognize an emotion and choose a coping strategy. On the Feelings Board, the user can then help the child indicate how they are feeling from a range of options, select a coping strategy, and then request an activity to help them feel better or re-engage with others. \n\nFeelings Scale\nHelps users identify, manage and cope with feelings across environments throughout the day. By tracking their feelings on the board, users can analyze the data for trends to learn if tasks done at different times of day or in different environments affect outcome. Environments and schedules can then be altered to achieve better results.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.beevisual.com/mobile-app-eula.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.beevisual.com/mobile-app-privacy.html"

      "label": "The EduCalc Classic app, rewritten from the ground up:\n\n-- All screens have portrait and landscape\n-- Polynomial solver up to 10th degree\n-- Wide range of settings for font sizes and graph line widths\n-- Updates to this version will be more frequent, going forward\n-- Matrix calculator more intuitive and is integrated with main calculator screen\n-- Table has an \"ask\" mode where you enter input values and it gives you the outputs.\n-- Please report bugs to the email address inside the app\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n1)  Scientific Calculator.  A lot of thought has gone into the design of the keyboard, which gives you everything you need while keeping the keys as large as possible.  Available functions include the following:\n\n• the usual arithmetic functions and exponentiation.\n• square root, cube root, nth root, natural log, log base 10, log of arbitrary base, absolute value, factorial, permutations (nPr), combinations (nCr), modulus, random integer, bell curve, cumulative normal distribution.\n• Define and name your own constants\n• Summations\n• Complex numbers!\n• Sig figs (enable under settings)\n• Programmable keys (enable under settings)\n\n2)  Graphing.  Capabilities:\n• Graph up to nine equations at once.\n• Graphs are labeled.\n• You can drag the graph or pinch to zoom in or out.\n• Calculator can find roots and intersections.\n• Can graph in polar coordinates.\n• Can graph parametric equations.\n• Can graph parametric equations.\n• Can graph implicit functions, such as x^2+y^2-4=0.  Most calculator apps can't do this!\n\n3)  Vector and Matrix calculator.  Vector dot and cross products.  Multiply and add matrices.  Determinant, transpose, Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors.  \n\n4)  It can make a table of the values of any function you care to enter.  You can choose the starting x value of the table, as well as how much x increases for each successive row.\n\n5) Triangle solver.  Enter three sides, two sides and an angle, or two angles and a side, and the solver calculates the rest.\n\n6) Polynomial solvers.  Find the roots of a polynomial, up to 10th degree.\n\n7)  System of linear equations solver.\n\n8)  The  reference hits the high points of the following subjects:\nalgebra, calculus, geometry, trigonometry, vectors, vector calculus, and classical mechanics.  So if you need a reminder of a trig identity . . . or the quadratic formula . . . or the chain rule from calculus . . . and so on, it's right there for you.\n\n9)  A unit converter.  Your data are in meters, and you need an answer in feet?  No problem!  With a tap, you can enter the result of your conversion into the calculator.  Currently converts different units of the following: acceleration, angle, area, density, distance, energy, force, mass, power, pressure, speed, temperature, time, and volume.  Great for physics problem sets!  You can also define your own units.\n\n10)  Constants for scientific calculations -- speed of light, strength of gravity at Earth's surface, etc. etc. etc.  Tapping on a constant will insert it into your calculation -- i.e, you don't have to key in the value.  Again, great for physics problem sets!\n\n11)  Statistics mode, including options for scatter plots and for regression lines.\n\n12)  Works on both iPhone and iPad.\n\n13)  Derivatives! (Answer simplification is limited.)\n\n\nI'd love to learn about your comments or suggestions.  You can write me at the email address on the settings screen of the app. Thanks!"

Feed your monsters, dance with them, watch them skate, get to know their quirks. \n\n• App Store \"Best of 2015\"\n• Reached #1 in Kids & Education on the App Store in US, UK & many more countries\n• Digital Ehon Award - Prize Winner 2017\n• Tutora Award - Best Educational App 2017\n• \"App of the Week\" by BBC Focus Magazine\n• Featured in \"Apps of the Month\" by The Guardian\n• \"Learning about genetics becomes child’s play\" - Cool Mom Tech\n• \"A playful and amusing introduction to a big STEM concept!\" - Madison Public Library\n• \"Sneak scientific knowledge under a child’s radar by turning it into a game\" - The Sunday Times\n\nThis fun monster maker game introduces kids to the basic science of DNA in an easy pure-play style. Learn how to build creatures by completing a series of simple DNA puzzles. Get creative and experiment with quirky mutations of different body parts by altering genes. Have fun playing with your monsters and change their form in real-time while they dance, skate, eat or sleep! \n\nCREATE & MUTATE\n\nStart with a basic unformed figure and complete the gene puzzles to give it a fully grown torso, face and limbs. Then tweak the genes or simply tap on the monster's body parts to trigger mutations. Observe how the tiniest change in the DNA code can lead to unimaginable new characteristics. \n\nWatch your monster turn from yellow to red, grow pink hair and 6 eyes, have its ears transform into fish fins and its belly pop out and crave for food. Best of all, these are emotional creatures with vivid personalities, so prepare to be surprised!\n\nPLAY & EXPLORE\n\nOnce you complete all 6 body parts it's time to play with your monsters and have fun! Feed them, tweak them, push them, squeeze them, make them jump or slide! Go for a skateboard ride with them! Get to know their quirks.

Discover what makes them sneeze, laugh or cry, how their voice changes after mutating their faces! \n\nTry, experiment and evolve! Why stick with 2 short legs when 4 tall ones are so much better for flamenco dancing? Keep transforming and observe which forms look better in various activities! Take photos and share your genetic blueprints so friends can clone your beasts. Build your personal library of ready-to-play, cute little monsters. Science has never been so fun!\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n\n• A playful introduction to DNA, biology and genetics\n• Build over 200 billion unique monsters!\n• Complete the DNA puzzles, swap their pieces to mutate\n• Tap on body parts to trigger random mutations\n• Plenty of unexpected and hilarious interactions\n• Transform monsters in real-time while they dance, sleep, eat, skate & more!\n• Save your monsters in a ready-to-play library \n• Save snapshots of your creations stamped with their DNA code\n• Parents' section includes basic info on DNA, illustrated tutorial, interaction hints & play ideas\n• Ideal for kids 4-9 years old\n• Perfect for STEM education (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math)\n• Language neutral game-play\n• No time limits, free-play style\n• Exceptional graphics, superb music & original sound design\n• Safe for kids: COPPA compliant, no 3rd party ads, no in-app purchases\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\n\nWe respect your privacy!

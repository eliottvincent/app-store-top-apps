      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

After shopping, grab a bite to eat at the pet shop cafe, where pets get a table too!\n\nBREEDER’S BUNGALOW: Here’s where the pet breeder starts and ends their day. The bungalow is, of course, filled with pets — hiding in the greenhouse and playing in the yard and splashing in mud. Don’t worry, the giant bathtub gets everyone clean again!\n\nENJOY A FREE GIFT\nBundled with Toca Life: Pets is a free pack of 18 exclusive iMessage stickers! Add pet stickers to your messages to express yourself in a fun way.\n\nFEATURES\nRole-play in five locations: pet park, pet hotel, veterinary, pet shop and breeder’s bungalow.\n- Meet 23 new characters.\n- Play with and care for 124 real and fantasy animals. \n- Bathe muddy pets and get them clean again!\n- Pretend to be a vet and care for sick and injured pets.\n- Dress your pets in fun hats — stack hats on hats on hats!\n- Pets can pee and poop!\n- Keep spaces clean by cleaning up all the pet poop!\n- Poop is also stackable! Stack the poop high, bag it up and discard!\n- Build an agility course to train pets and help them get the exercise they need.\n- Pull the branch in the pet park to discover a surprise!\n\nLIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video!

And don't forget the mighty X-ray that will help to locate and mend a fractured bone!\n\nAfter successful treatment, little Doctors will receive an emotional reward from their patients in the form of smiles and applauds. \nIn addition to all of this, we believe that PEPI DOCTOR also serves as a playful reminder about hygiene and safe behavior.\n\nKey Features:\n• 3 cute characters\n• 5 conditions to cure\n• More than 20 different doctors’ tools\n• Amazing artwork, animations and sounds\n• Uses no spoken language, needs no translation\n• No win or lose situations\n• No in-app purchases \n• Recomended ages: 3 to 6."

That is why these combinations must be learned by heart, which is always difficult. \"Verben mit Präpositionen\" will undoubtedly help you in this task.\n\nDo you naturally want to succeed in your German certification examinations from A1 to C1 level? Then \"Verben mit Präpositionen\" will contribute positively to your ultimate goal.\n\n\"Verben mit Präpositionen\" is a practical application that consists of four game modes:\n\nCLASSIC MODE:\nNine sentences will be presented in which you must properly place the corresponding preposition among four possible alternatives. Solve the nine sentences in the shortest possible time !. For each incorrect answer, 5 seconds will be added and for a correct answer, 3 seconds will be subtracted.\n\nTIME ATTACK:\nQuick! You have 90 seconds to answer as many correct sentences as possible. For each incorrect answer, 5 seconds will be subtracted and for each correct answer, 3 seconds will be added.\n\nBRAIN SURVIVAL:\nYou only have three unique chances to have mistakes. Solve the most phrases without losing the three lives.\n\nAKKUSATIV / DATIV:\nYou must properly match the verb presented on the screen with its respective preposition and wisely select whether it is \"Akkusativ or Dativ\". You have 15 opportunities. When you have reached at least five times in a row 100%, you can reasonably consider you have reached an important level in the German language.\n\nAdditionally, the application typically has a comprehensive list of verbs and their respective combinations with the prepositions. We have so far about 200 verbs reviewed by language professionals, and the list continues growing. This list will be updated automatically, at no additional cost and without having to reinstall the application."

      "label": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

Tinker with your tractor to see what it can do! The food machine magically turns your raw ingredients into food: Use milk to make cheese, then use the cheese and corn to make cheese puffs!

Discover all the foods you can make and how you can make them!\n\nCREATE AN ORIGINAL VIDEO OF YOUR STORY\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice as you’re telling the story, along with your characters’ movements. Create farm videos up two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share later!\n\nFEATURES:\n- Explore four locations: barn, house, field and store.\n- Create stories for 29 new characters plus all the animals!\n- Feed the animals, milk the cow and gather eggs from your hens.\n- Bottle the milk from the milk tank.\n- Help the vet check the animals.\n- Let the pigs (or people!) wallow in the mud.\n- Clean up different types of animal poop!\n- Grab the banjo, fiddle, guitar or washbucket bass and jam into the night!\n- Pick fruit in your orchard.\n- Farm your crops from planting to harvest.\n- Use your tractor's different functions to farm faster!.\n- Fire up the food machine to turn your harvest into food.\n- Record your stories in the app and share with your friends!\n- No time limit or high scores — play for as long as you like!\n- No third-party advertising\n\nWE LISTEN\nSo many of you asked for a farm in the Toca Life series, and we're excited to give you what you want!

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

      "label": "Flashnote Derby is a fun way for kids to learn and practice reading music notes. \n\nEach race is a timed test in which the student identifies different notes in order to urge their horse on towards the finish line. Answering quickly and correctly will cause their horse to gain ground, while incorrect answers will cause it to fall behind. At the end of each race, students can review the notes they missed and see the correct answers. \n\nPlayers can respond to flashcards by simply playing the note on their acoustic or MIDI instrument. They can also choose to answer by tapping letter buttons or playing a key on an on-screen piano.\n\nThe game is fully customizable to allow for any desired notes in the treble, bass, alto, or tenor clefs to be included. You can select ranges of notes, or several individual notes to focus on specific areas that need work. Notes can be shown with sharps and flats and key signatures can even be added to increase the challenge for more advanced students. The amount of time the player is given for each flashcard can be increased or decreased depending upon their age and level of experience.\n\nDrills can start out simply, with only a handful of notes, and gradually be made more challenging until the full staff is mastered (up to five and a half ledger lines above or below the staff.) The more difficult the settings, the more points are awarded. The 'high score' is tracked so that players always have a goal to shoot for.\n\nAs a bonus, over a dozen instructional video lessons are easily accessible from right inside the app! Even children with no prior music instruction can start using Flashnote Derby right away to begin learning about the music alphabet, the staff, and how to identify different notes.\n\nBecause it can be set up so quickly, Flashnote Derby provides a perfect motivational tool for music teachers to use with students, even for just a minute or two of each lesson. Teachers have the ability to email homework assignments to their students for them to play on their own devices at home. Each player's performance is recorded so that their progress can be tracked. You can easily see which notes are most in need of review.  \n\nWhen students give up on their music lessons, it's usually because they find it too difficult. Learning basic skills early is key to laying the groundwork for future success. Flashnote Derby makes this process more enjoyable and helps students stay motivated in their music learning.\n\nSometimes it takes only a little extra effort to make the difference between success and failure. Download Flashnote Derby and get on the road to music reading mastery today!"

      "label": "This is a project for Drilling and Well Control optimized for newer iPhones and iPads.\n\nThis is a basic drilling simulator that simulates drilling operations based in panels for kick detection, shut-in the well, stabilization of pressures and the choke operations during the well control operations using a hydraulic choke panel simulator.\n\nFeatures:\n1. Drilling, kick detection, shut-in, pressures stabilization and control\n2. MULTIPLE KICKS (3 SINGLE BUBBLES) \n3. DIRECTIONAL/HORIZONTAL WELL \n4. WELL CONTROL ON CHOKE PANEL WITH  2 REMOTE CHOKES\n5. Standpipe Manifold and Choke Manifold\n6. FLOAT VALVE, \n7. GESTURE SWAIPE UP/DOWN TO MOVE DRILLSTRING \n8. FAILURES SCHEDULE WITH RANDOM OPTION (Mud Pumps 1 and 2 “power end failure” or “fluid end failure”, Chokes 1 and 2 “plugged” or “washed”, One Drill Bit Nozzle “plugged” or “washed”)\n9. Set a KICK without the drilling need.\n10. Subsea Stack BOP and Surface Stack BOP\n\nAdditional features:\n \n1. Optionally it is possible to use others apps as Remote Choke like \"Driller's Method Simulator\" and \"Wait and Weight Simulator\". Both are available for sale in our Portfolio.\n\n2. Swabbing effect simulation \nThis effect occur when the drill string is pulled out of the wellbore to reduce the bottom hole pressure enough to create an underbalance condition and to cause a flow from formation into the wellbore.\nThis effect is performed on this Simulator by moving the finger up in the well layout on the screen.\n\niPad version:\n1. Pre-recorded data view\n2. Screen layout optimized for 12.9-inch iPad Pro  (High Resolution)\n3. Three codes (default \"0000\" for all: admin, instructor, student) to view the gas into the borehole, the pressure at bottom, at shoe and at bop and to enable / disable the Lag Time (by adjusting the choke to change the kill pressure and drill pipe pressure, etc).\n4. Use the arrow keys on keyboard for iPad Pro to operate the choke.\n\niPhone version:\n1. Pre-recorded data available in the well configuration views.\n2. Screen layout optimized for iPhone and iPad Pro (High Resolution)\n3. All features available without codes.\n\nOther features also available:\n\nA graphical very useful tool for training of roughnecks, derrickmen, drillers, toolpusher, drilling engineers, mud engineers and students in the well control procedures.\n\n- Well configuration, drilling, kick detection, shut-in and control.\n- Interactive system: no pre-set methods;\n- Ability to apply control methods: Driller's method, Wait and Weight method (or Engineer's method), dynamic volumetric and static volumetric (lubricate and bleed);\n- Hydraulics and Hydrostatics;\n- Behavior of the kick (until 3 single kick bubbles simultaneously in borehole);\n- Applied with subsea stack or surface stack;\n- Set well with until 4 sections: riser, casing, liner, open hole ;\n- Set Drill String with drill pipe1, drill pipe2, heavy weight, drill collar1, drill collar2\n- Support for horizontal and directional wells (builder and plotter)\n- Bop flow meter (volume to close and to open bop)\n\nOthers apps available on our portfolio that may be useful for you:\n\n- Drilling Hydraulics\n- Kick Tolerance\n- Leak-Off Test Simulator\n- Leak-Off Test Analyzer\n- MPD Simulator\n- Well Control Methods\n- Well Control Worksheets\n- Well Control Simulators specific for each method (Driller's Method, Wait and Weight and Volumetric)\n\nThese tools can complement (work with) this simulator by creating files which can be used in this application; \n\nand more Oil & Gas in our website.\n\nDISCLAIMER: \n\nThese tools & materials are provided 'as is' without warranties of any kind, express or implied. \nPlease verify the tools provided by this application by yourself before you use them.

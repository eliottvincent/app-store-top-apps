All you need is an open mind and a passion to be successful!\n\nWhat is Forex?\n\nForex, also known as foreign exchange, FX, or currency trading, is a decentralized global market where all the world's currencies trade. The Forex market is the largest, most liquid market in the world with an average daily trading volume exceeding $5 trillion. All the world's combined stock markets don't even come close to this. But what does that mean to you? Take a closer look at Forex trading and you may find some exciting trading opportunities unavailable with other investments.\n\nWhy Learn Forex Trading: Advantages Of Forex Trading\n\nThere are many benefits and advantages of Forex Trading for Beginners. Here are just a few reasons why so many people are choosing Forex Trading:\n\nNo commissions Forex Trading\n\nNo clearing fees, no exchange fees, no government fees, no brokerage fees. Most retail brokers are compensated for their services through something called the “bid/ask spread“.\n\nNo middlemen in Forex Trading\n\nSpot currency trading eliminates the middlemen and allows you to trade directly with the market responsible for the pricing on a particular currency pair.\n\nNo fixed lot size in Forex Trading\n\nIn spot Forex, you determine your own lot or position size. This allows traders to participate with accounts as small as $25.\n\n\nForex Trading is a 24-hour market\n\nThere is no waiting for the opening bell. From the Monday morning opening in Australia to the afternoon close in New York, the forex market never sleeps. This is awesome for those who want to trade on a part-time basis because you can choose when you want to trade: morning, noon, night, during breakfast, or in your sleep.\n\nNo one can corner the market in Forex Trading\n\nThe foreign exchange market is so huge and has so many participants that no single entity can control the market price for an extended period of time.\n\nLow Barriers to Entry\n\nYou would think that getting started as a currency trader would cost a ton of money. The fact is, when compared to trading stocks, options, or futures, it doesn’t. Online forex brokers offer “mini” and “micro” trading accounts, some with a minimum account deposit of $25.\n\nTopics Included in this App\n\n1- Introduction to Forex Trading to Beginner\n2- The Structure of the Forex Market\n3- Major Currencies & Trade System in Forex Trading\n4- Market Analysis in Forex Trading\n5- Type of Foreign Exchange Market in Forex Trading\n6- Benefits of Forex Trading\n7- Fundamental Market Forces in Forex Trading\n8- Technical Indicators in Forex Trading\n9- Pattern Study of Trends in Forex Trading\n10- Forex Trading Technical Strategy in Price Patterns\n11- Forex Trading Oscillator Divergences\n12- The Role of Inflation in Forex Trading\n13- The Commodity Connection in Forex Trading\n14- Position of Money Management in Forex Trading\n15- Foreign Exchange Risks in Forex Trading"

Professional! Highly Recommended... finally the currency application I have been waiting for so long...\"\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ \"...I tried all other similar apps, and I am proud to announce that this app is simply the best of them all..\"\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ \"Smart, intuitive and flexible!... slick interface with great functionality which further impresses with its great selection of currencies and immediate updates. Good job! Highly recommend!\"\n\nFeatures:\n\n-- Simple Interface -- \niCurrencyPad was designed to be fast and easy to use. Just select the currencies to convert and tap in the amount to convert. A convenient calculator allows for basic math calculations, showing the results as the values are tapped. Swipe across the display to swap the left and right currencies, or swipe up and down to select different currencies. Tap and hold to copy/paste. \n\n-- Favorite Currencies -- \nWhile iCurrencyPad offers exchange rates for 160+ currencies from around the world, you may be interested in only a few currencies. To reduce clutter on the screen, iCurrencyPad allows you to select and sort your Favorite Currencies, so only those currencies that interest you appear on the screen, thereby making the application easier and faster to use. \n\n-- Charts -- \nDetailed charts show the history of exchange rates for any two currencies. Tap on the chart for the exchange rate on any particular day. Tap with two fingers to show the change in rates between any two dates. Rotate the device for a larger chart in landscape view. Charts for most currencies are available for 1-day, 5-days, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, 5-years and 10-years. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Listing -- \nThe exchange rates listing shows a base currency compared to all other currencies, similar to the electronic exchange rate boards seen in \"Change\" shops around the world. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Updates -- \niCurrencyPad updates Exchange Rates on demand, or automatically at pre-defined intervals ranging from 15 seconds to 1 day. Exchange Rates are automatically updated when the app is launched, or auto-updates can be turned off when roaming. An Internet connection is required to update rates, either via cellular network or a Wifi connection. Without a connection, rates can still be accessed and converted using the last data downloaded. \n\n-- Easy to Get Started -- \nA short 20-second tutorial will play when you first launch iCurrencyPad and guide you through the app's features. \n\n-- Languages -- \nThe user interface is offered in 9 languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese and Arabic. Please visit the App Store in your language for a translated description and screenshots.\n\n-- Reviews -- \n\"...iCurrency Pad is a great piece of software powered by a stunning design and usability. It’s beautiful, useful, powerful yet simple and straightforward...\" \n\n-- MacStories (http://bit.ly/94Y9IT)"

      "label": "More than 30 years ago we saw the birth of the most popular financial calculator ever created--you probably had one (and probably still do!).\n\nCalculator12 puts a rock solid emulation of that calculator on your iPhone, iPod touch and iPad, whether you need it for school or are looking to retire old faithful. What you get is true (albeit non-programmable) emulation with 100% compatible operation keystroke for screentap and computational and operational reliability every bit as good as the original.\n\nBut wait, there's more! (sorry about that). Calculator12 is not stuck in the 80s. You have the option to work with cash flows in the cash flow diagram format, changing values or inserting/deleting cash flows with just a tap. Three independent cash flow scenarios can be evaluated side-by-side, and with capital multiplication you can evaluate an exit strategy for outside investors. Results can be emailed from Calculator12 so you don't have to redo things like an amortization schedule or comparative investment report at your lap or desktop. \n\nAnd you can see what was once hidden... the contents of the financial registers or optionally the stack are always displayed. For me at least confirming the accuracy of my entries relieves a lot of anxiety and prevents confusion when the results don't stack up. It's not programmable, but advance payment leasing functions have been pre-programmed in as well as conversions to APR and Effective Rate to fill some of the gaps. And it is blisteringly fast--what used to take 30 seconds now is done almost before your finger leaves the touchscreen. \n\nCalculator12 was the very first emulator of that physical machine on the App Store, v1.0 released July 30th of 2008, introducing features (now almost universally copied) that take advantage of the unique features of iOS to improve your ability to deal with financial problem solving. There are lots of emulators now, but only one that has moved out of the 80s. (this one!)\n\n*** This application listing provides an upgrade path for early adopters to the redesigned and renamed Calc-12E. It is identical to Calc-12E and is maintained on the App Store to provide a way for existing customers to upgrade their original purchase to Calc-12E free-of-charge... It will appear on your home screen as Calc12E***"

See more in customer reviews.\n\nMathU 12D, the Deluxe Financial RPN Calculator, is written from the ground up to behave exactly like and surpass the classic HP-12C.\n\nMathU 12D uses the same RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) entry system and supports the same mathematical functions as the HP-12C. In fact, if you are familiar with the HP-12C you will be able to use MathU 12D right away.\n\nMade by Creative Creek, LLC.  We have been making calculators for mobile devices for over 20 years. Also check out MathU RPN, our advanced scientific and financial RPN calculator.\n\nMathU 12D adds some big improvements over the original HP-12C:\n\n1) Visible Financial Registers -- The values of the financial registers are displayed prominently above the associated buttons. This allows you to quickly verify that the loan parameters are correct and builds confidence in the results.\n\n2) Computation Speed -- You will be amazed how quickly MathU 12D produces results.  Even complicated calculations like the determination of interest rate, IRR or NPV are finished in a fraction of a second.\n\n3) Two line display -- A two line display can be chosen so that the x and y register values are always visible. You can immediately see results and verify input values.\n\n4) Visible Programming -- Program lines are displayed using the function name instead of the key pad location.  This makes reading and writing MathU 12D programs easier.\n\n5) 20 Registers unaffected by programs - The registers are not shared with the program space so you can create up to 99 line programs without sacrificing any storage space.\n\nDocumentation for MathU 12D is available from within the app.  All the functions work exactly the same as on the HP-12C, so if you are familiar with the HP-12C you will be able to use MathU 12D right away.\n\nFeatures\n\n- Fast and accurate computation based on \n   IEEE double precision (up to 16 digits)\n- 5 financial registers (visible on the main screen)\n- 20 storage registers\n- Programmable with up to 99 program steps\n- Program steps show function name directly\n- Two line display\n- FIX, SCI, and ENG display modes\n- Access to on-line documentation\n- Settings screen\n- Thousands and decimal separators follow international format settings\n- Copy and paste support\n- Support for  iOS 8.x or higher.\n- Support for iPhone and iPad\n\nFunctions Supported:\n\n- Time value of money (N,i,PV,PMT,FV)\n- Net Present Value (NPV)\n- Internal Rate of Return (IRR)\n- Simple interest\n- Cash Flows (CF0, CFj, Nj)\n- Bond pricing and yield (PRICE, YTM)\n- Depreciation based on \n   - Straight line (SL)\n   - Sum-Of-the-Years-Digits (SOYD)\n   - Declining balance (DB)\n- Date in future (DATE) or days between dates (DYS)\n- Statistics mean, std, wieghted mean, factorial\n- Percent, percent change and percent of total\n- Linear curve fitting (x,r y,r)\n- Scientific functions (y^x, e^x, sqrt, 1/x, ln)\n- Integer and fractional parts (INTG, FRAC)"

The built in calculator lets you focus on two selected currencies on one screen. The built in calculator remains on the screen at all times making data entry quick and easy.\n\nApple Watch\nUse Currency+ on the Apple Watch. See your favorites currency list and your Currency Alerts directly on the watch.\n\nToday Widget\nUse the Today Widget to quickly see the conversion rates between all your favorite currencies. Tap the rate to reverse the conversion. Tap any of the currencies on the list to set as the base currency.\n\nSupport For Over 150 World Currencies & Precious Metals\nFor times where you want to keep track of many currencies at one time, the favorites list is where you need to go. You pick from  over150 world currencies and precious metals (powered by Yahoo.com). Selecting any currency in your list, enter a value and the rest of the currencies in your list will show you that amount in their own currency in real time.\n\nHistorical Charts\nCurrency+ has historical charts. You can view historical currency conversion charts for any two currencies. Touch the chart with a single finger to see data from any period in the past. Touch the chart with two fingers to compare currency exchange rates from any two past periods. Show charts for 1 day (real time intraday), 5day, 3 month, 6 month, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years.\n\nCurrency Trends\nWith Trends, you can select any of the 150+ world currencies and compare it to a list of other currencies to see how it has performed over time. See if your currency has strengthened or weakened. Select your time period from days to years. Export your work to an email, text, note, etc using the trend share sheet.\n\nBackground Rate Updates & Currency Alerts\nCurrency+ will go out and update your currency rates without taking your device out of your pocket. Whenever you open Currency+, your data will always be up to date. Do you want to be notified when a currency goes above or below a certain value? If so, Currency+ can notify you of these changes without the need to open the app. You will receive a push notification on your device whenever the currency you are watching goes beyond the limit you set.\n\nEditable Calculator Tape\nCurrency+ has an integrated calculator tape that keeps track of everything that you do. You can send any value from the tap to any of your favorite currencies. You can edit/delete/insert tape values and your calculations will automatically update. Finally, you can put comments on any of your tape values to help you keep track of what your numbers stand for.\n\nInverse Currency Calculations\nNeed to do inverse or reverse currency calculations? Currency+ can switch between standard and inverse currency conversion modes on the fly.\n\nTransaction Fees or Taxes\nCurrency+ can factor in transaction fees (or tax) automatically. Individuals rarely convert money at published exchange rates - most banks and exchange offices charge a fee. Enter the transaction fee percentage to give you a better estimate of your 'real' conversion rates.\n\nMake the leap with Jump Gap Software's Currency+, the currency converter that takes you around the world and back."

But, once you need to start validating them,  a large canvas on paper isn’t the most practical  tool to carry with you. Also, there is no clear path to go from a Business Model to a Financial plan.\n\nSo, we adapted it to fit mobile devices and added new layers to help you go beyond design:\n\n> Financials: For helping you access your business model viability.\n\n> Goals: For keeping track of your ambitions.\n\n> Next Steps: For tracking what you need to do to reach your goals\n\nThe app provides a practical way to organize your goals and tasks in each business model block. This will help you to keep focus on specific areas when working on a task or experiment. Also, it will be easier to see which parts of your business you are moving forward and what it's being left behind.  \n\nDESIGN A BETTER BUSINESS MODEL:\n\nAdd your \"sticky notes\" to the business model canvas and benefit from automatic charts that will provide better visuals for showcasing your business ideas to others.\n\nEVALUATE KEY METRICS:\n\nThe built-in Customer Lifetime Value Simulator helps to understand the value of your customers and how much you can spend on customer acquisition to be sustainable. \n\nYou can also generate Profit & Loss projections painlessly from you business model data to make a long term analysis of your margins.\n\nGET READY FOR ACTION:\n\nAchieve you most Important goals with the powerful OKR - Objectives and Key Results methodology, used by fast growing startups and companies.\n\nEXECUTE, THE AGILE WAY:\n\nCreate lists of tasks to move your business forward or experiments to validate you business model assumptions. Reflect on the results and adapt your goals and business model, all with the same tool. \n\nTO DO WHAT YOU LOVE, YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY START!\n\nWe live in an amazing era. Technology  like artificial intelligence, blockchain and crypto-currencies is disrupting current business models. Business model innovation is an imperative. \n\nIf you have the courage to build your business, instead of dreaming about it, this app is for you. \"The true entrepreneur is a doer, not a dreamer\":\n\nDownload MetaCanvas today, the app for agile entrepreneurs."

We were working on the pro forma balance sheets and cash flows for a new project I'm working on.  They were all asking why I had switched to the iPhone for I used to be a die hard \"brandX phone\" fan. I said that one could do so much more. They said \"yea...sure\" (they were all using \"brandX phones\") until I started using your calculator. We were analyzing different payment and amortization schedules. They were so impressed by how easily we could figure out the amount of interest, principal and remaining loan balance for any certain period or combination of periods that in the end they were saying \"I have to get me one of those\".   Great product. Thanks.\""

Non financial data, such as the change in mileage and average fuel consumption can also be calculated, and displayed in brief or in detail. \n\nA carbon footprint can also be calculated, depending on the consumption of the vehicle, as well as the mass of carbon dioxide (CO2) it produces (total and average per day and per mile traveled). \n\nCar Manager also allows all these data (costs, fill-ups, vehicle information) to be exported and sent by e-mail directly from your iPhone as a CSV file (comma separated values, which can opened and processed by Excel or any other spreadsheet program), should you feel the need to create your own personalized statistics. \n\nThe application also enables you to manage a directory containing all the information about the service providers for your vehicles: insurance companies, garages, stores, clubs, associations, etc. You can then easily locate them thanks to the Maps interface. \n\nCar Manager also provides you with a Tools section, which allows you to geolocate your current position or your parking spot in a single click, so you can easily go back there later with the integrated GPS visual guiding function (or with Maps directions). This tools section can also help you find various services around your location: gas stations, garages, restaurants, hotels and others. \n\nCar Manager also gives you the opportunity to stay tuned to car news: it comes with a number of RSS feeds (internet information channels) allowing you to be informed of anything related to cars and motorsports. You can of course add any RSS feed you want. \n\nThe application automatically adapts itself to the units of measurement effective in your country: kilometers or miles for distances, liters or gallons for fuel. \n\niOS 7.1 or higher. \nUniversal application with full resolution support for iPad"

As such, people have to directly and manually manage and adjust it.\n\nThat is why people think that maintaining a housekeeping book is very difficult and cumbersome. We made this for such users.\nDo not think that complex functions are difficult. Gradually start maintaining a housekeeping book with Weple Money. We can also do it.

This app provides 1) quick identification and interpretation of current market trading direction, 2) a complete reference on 100+ Japanese Candlestick patterns, and 3) two training games to build your knowledge of charting patterns.\n\nCandice helps you quickly find the possible Japanese candlestick patterns in a chart from input of the trading situation. No more looking through numerous graphic images to match or memorizing what each pattern means. Enter specific values to find possible matches and then see the trade action. Patterns can also be found by name, prior trend, signal type (bearish/bullish), number of candles, or marked favorites. Each candle pattern provides image, name, signal, reliability, rating, trend, colors, how to recognize, recommended trade actions, and your own custom notes.\n\nCandice employs a visual table of contents as well as a full index dictionary name reference. Caveat notes are provided as a separate extendable database on chart patterns as well as other references.\n\nCandice comes with three game study operations: Flashcards, Guess and Press, and Slide Show to learn candle patterns. You can configure which patterns to learn or all of them."

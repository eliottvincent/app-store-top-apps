      "label": "Your pocket app for removing unwanted stuff from photos on the go. It gives your photos a clean look while saving you valuable time.\n\nAn accidental object, even though it may look tiny and harmless, can completely ruin the entire composition of a photo and make it worthless. However, it’s not a pain if you have your favorite TouchRetouch at hand.\n\nHere at ADVA Soft, we never stop creating. We are constantly developing new technologies and features to improve TouchRetouch both functionally and visually. The most recent additions, such as the mesh removal feature, new algorithm for edge-aware object removal, and a few more great new things, reflect the needs expressed by you and reveal our appreciation of your loyalty.\n\nBelow you'll find more details on what features TouchRetouch has to offer.\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\n• No subscriptions, ads, and in-app purchases\n• No personal information requests\n• No quality and EXIF data loss\n• Professional photo edits with ease\n\nNOTE\n\nThe automatic object removal algorithm works best on uniform backgrounds.\n\nWhat magic can you do with TouchRetouch?\n\n• Remove wires, power lines, and other linear objects\n• Eliminate objects like street signs, trash cans, stop lights\n• Get rid of meshes in the foreground\n• Remove background people\n• Erase pimples, skin blemishes, and wrinkles in the most natural way\n• Clean up travel photos\n• Remove text from Instagram and Snapchat posts\n• Restore old photos\n\nHow will you create magic in your photos?\n\nSINGLE-TOUCH RETOUCH\n\nThe app works great for quick retouches.\nMake minor imperfections disappear just by marking them. It takes seconds for the app to remove small details that ruin your photos.\n\nIf the task is to erase a line from your pic, mark only a section of the line or just tap it to remove it completely; no need to be precise — the app will find the line! In the manual retouch mode, all lines have control points, thus giving you more control and flexibility over adjusting curved segments.\n\nOBJECT REMOVAL LIKE MAGIC\n\nThe app declutters your images in a matter of seconds. That could either be people or other background details you may need to erase. Use automatic content removal with the Brush tool or, when the result is not that perfect, manual retouching with the Clone Stamp tool to repair a photo. \n\nAUTOMATIC MESH DETECTION AND REMOVAL\n\nIf you think that \"getting past the mesh netting\" is quite a challenging task, you probably haven’t tried using TouchRetouch yet. The app offers a way to deal with the problem in two simple steps. Select the tool from the main menu and tap the Go button to have the mesh removed just like magic. The whole detection and selection work between these two steps is done by the algorithm; no action is required on your part.\n\nHELPFUL TUTORIALS\n\nCheck out the in-app tutorials and play around a bit with the app to learn how to get the most out of it.\nLittle effort and experience are needed to become a pro in using TouchRetouch. The interface and layout are clear and intuitive enough to make you feel comfortable the very first time you use it.\n\nDownload TouchRetouch now to harness photo magic from your pocket.\n\nTouchRetouch is brought to you by ADVA Soft — a team of like-minded professionals and enthusiastic innovators committed to designing intelligent yet simple apps that create magic in your photos and save you time. Visit our website at www.adva-soft.com to learn more about the company and the apps it develops.\n\nFor any assistance with TouchRetouch, contact ADVA Soft Support at touchretouch@adva-soft.com.

      "label": "Watch any web-video, online movie, livestream or live tv show on your LG Smart TV. Enjoy the show on your big screen with the no#1 web video streamer.\n\nWith Video & TV Cast for LG Smart TV you can browse the web and stream any web video, online movie, livestream or live tv show you want on your LG Smart TV. Mp4, m3u8, hls livestreams and also video-over-https are supported.\n \nThere is no time limit at all! You can watch videos of 2 minutes or 2 hours or even more. Just open Video & TV Cast, navigate to a website, wait for link detection and send the video with a single tap to your LG Smart TV. The discovered link will be shown below the browser. A tap on the link will start the show. You don't need to install a big media server like Plex or any other third party software.\n\n>>> Important Notes\n\n* To enable video casting please open the LG App Store (LG Smart World / LG Content Store) on your TV, search for 'TV Cast' and install the companion app.\n\n* Please enter the ip-address of your iPhone/iPad by using the number pad and up/down/left/right keys on your TV Remote or scroll wheel on your Magic Remote. Just enter the numbers, no need to press the enter key.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* Please test your favorite videos with the free edition before upgrading!\n\n* Please use the hardware remote of your LG for controlling the TV app and video playback.\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a specific video is not working, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: Use the Playbar for advanced video control while browsing, including video scrubbing, forward, rewind, play, pause, stop. The playbar works on all LG Smart TVs. \n\n* Local Videos: Cast your camera roll videos from an iPhone or iPad. Supports mp4, m4v and mov videos that were saved to the camera roll via Apples SD-Card/USB Adapter, iTunes Desktop Software or third party apps.\n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with LG Electronics or any other trademark mentioned here."

All you need to do is drag, grow or shrink the body parts you want to distort. Find out how you would look like with a different nose, chin, buttock, less weight... \n\nOur app, downloaded 10 million times on all platforms worldwide stands out because of 2 particular features:\n\n1) The distortion algorithm we are using produce very smooth image distortions, such as the ones you find in 100x more expensive professional liquify apps. \n\n 2) Our dual display mode, which clones your image into the other half of the screen when you rotate your device, allows you to modify your image without the encumbrance of your finger hiding the area you are working on. This is ideal for small touch devices such as your phone !!\n\n- New Feature: You can now save morphing animations as videos! \n\n************************ \nWHAT CAN THE APP DO? \n************************ \n\nWith this photo distortion app you can transform any face and body part:\n\n• Nose reshaping\n• Lips augmentation \n• Chin and face contouring \n• Weight loss \n• Muscle augmentation \n• anything you can reshape or shrink! \n\nFor fun or simply because you are curious about how you would look with a differently shaped body part, this app will help you.\n\n\n************************ \nHOW TO USE THE APP? \n************************ \n\nUsing the app is very easy, even on small screens: \n\n• Import a head-shot or full body picture from your camera or device image library. Preferably the subject should be photographed on a unified color background and well lit, so the contours are clearly visible. \n\n• Use your finger to drag or shrink the body parts that you want distorted. For example you can crush this bump on your nose, or even make you slimmer. \n\n• Undo latest changes if you are not satisfied with latest modifications. \n\n• By rotating your device, switch from single to dual view, to easily compare the before / after images on the same screen. \n\n• Zoom in, and use the dual view to see your changes on a real time workspace mirror without your finger in the way. This is a great solution to perform precise distortions on small screens!! \n\n• Launch a morphing animation between the original photo and the modified one to see the old you transforming into the new you! \n\nDownload our app now. Then see how those changes you’ve been wanting to see might look."

It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a specific video is not working, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: Use the Playbar for advanced video control while browsing, including video scrubbing, forward, rewind, play, pause, stop.\n\n* Local Videos: Cast your camera roll videos from an iPhone or iPad.

Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Sony or any other trademark mentioned here."

Slow Shutter Cam puts an end to mere snapshots and gives you some of the most powerful features of a DSLR camera. All this, in a package that fits in your pocket.\n \nSlow Shutter Cam offers three capture modes to capture unique images:\n \nMOTION BLUR: Equivalent to the shutter priority mode on a DSLR, the Motion Blur mode is perfect for creating ghost images, waterfall effects or suggesting movement in your photographs by adding a blur.\n\nLIGHT TRAIL: The Light Trail mode allows you to 'paint' with light, show car light trails and fireworks or capture any other moving light in a unique way. Unlike shooting with a DSLR and being tied to specific rigid settings to obtain good results, the Light Trail mode takes care of the essentials, letting your creativity soar!\n\nLOW LIGHT: In low light conditions, this capture mode allows the camera to accumulate every photon of light hitting the sensor. The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!\n\nHighlights:\n\n•  Unlimited Shutter Speed and manual ISO\n•  Option to resume capture \n•  Real time live preview - See the result in real time\n•  Innovative 'Freeze'  and ‘Blur Strength’ controls\n•  Tap to adjust focus/exposure\n•  Time-lapse Intervalometer\n•  Apple Watch support and handy Self-Timer \n•  Full resolution support on every devices\n\nWith Slow Shutter Cam on your iPhone or iPod touch you get the features of a DSLR camera with the convenience of a device that you can drop in your pocket and take with you wherever you go.

There are some limitations outlined below.\n• Currently only fully supports Pocket 4K, but as of v1.4 we now have limited support for EF mount cameras - Pocket 6K, Ursa Mini Pro G1 & G2\n• The camera does not supply the app with any information on the lenses current focus distance, so the app will not update in real time if you pull focus manually on the lens\n• Due to the nature of bluetooth, focus pulls may not be 100% smooth. It works well for nice slow pulls, but fast pulls my not feel entirely natural and organic. Unfortunately this is a limitation of the available technology.\n• On EF mount cameras, we can only offset focus from its current position, with no broader knowledge of where the lens is in its focus range. This means that focus marks are not possible. In addition, focus pulls on EF mount cameras can be quite jerky depending on the lens in use.\n\n\n-- Playback Control --\nWith Bluetooth+ you can control the playback of clips right from your iOS device. There are some notable limitations at this point. Currently you can:\n• Start playing a clip, either forwards or backwards\n• Navigate between clips, either forwards or backwards\n\nFor now, you will not be able to:\n• Pause a clip that is already playing\n• Change the speed of a clip that is already playing\n• Control clip looping\n\n\n-- Zoom Control --\nControl the zoom level on supported lenses. For the most part, this will only work on MFT lenses with electronic zoom. We are currently unaware of EF lenses that support this feature\n\n\n-- Slate-Only Mode --\nAs the name suggests, this feature locks the app into Slate-Only mode, without the ability to change critical camera settings or start/stop recording. This means you can let an assistant keep metadata up to date without the fear of interfering with important camera settings."

From 4 minutes to 1/8000 sec., aperture from 1.0 to 512 and iso from 3 to 6400.\n\n• Automatic priority for aperture or speed. (Automatic Av and Tv modes).\n\n• Automatic ISO or locked ISO options.\n\n• Point metering in camera view.\n\n• Maximum aperture limited by the selected lens.\n\n• Calculate the average of any number of measurements you want.\n\n• Read the exposure data of any photo from the gallery.\n\n• Calculate hyperfocal distance for 5 memorized lenses. Which also blocks maximum aperture.\n\n• Memory for 5 lenses with maximum aperture, focal length and film/sensor size for calculating hyperfocal distance and aperture.\n\n• Hyperfocal distance also for infrared light. (IR button)\n\n• Exposure value EV on an analog scale or right up front.\n\n• Two LED indicators show whether the measurement is unreliable due to lack of light in the scene, or if we have under 30% battery left.\n\n• On 3.5 \" displays preset lens buttons tilting the device or tapping at the bottom.\n\n• Be advised that accurate incident light reading needs a diffuser attached to the front camera. Without the diffuser still can be used but think about it, it will be a reflected reading taken with the front camera.\n\nI'm an independent photographer/designer/developer and am very grateful for your support. Trying to do the best lightmeter app ever, a lot more to come. You can ask for any improvement and I'll be happy to help. This app is constantly reviewed and improved because it is my tool, if you have any questions or suggestions feel free to contact me by email at davidquiles@me.com\n\nThank you!\n\nDavid Quiles"

Filmic Remote puts your spare iOS devices into the production process.\n\nRemote v3 offers three modes of capability:  Control, Monitor and Director.\n\nControl mode provides the familiar Filmic Pro interface for complete remote camera control over hard to reach camera placements such as sliders, jib arms, car mounts, microphone stand or other compelling live event camera placements.  Set up your Filmic Pro device and then control all settings and recordings from the Remote:\n- Start/Stop record functions.\n- Focus/exposure reticle placement and locking.\n- Dual arc slider manual controls for focus and exposure.\n- Pull-to-point focus and exposure pulls.\n- Create and load Filmic Pro presets from Filmic Remote.\n\nMonitor mode gives you cinema production capability for a fraction of the cost, offering a four-up display with the following powerful analytics:\n- Video preview:  Reference video for use with analytics screens.\n- Waveform monitor:  Visually identifies signal brightness segmented from left to right across a video feed.  Used in conjunction with the video preview it can provide a quick snapshot of brightness in your video.\n- Vectorscope:  Displays color saturation, by channel, across the entire image.\n- Histograms:  RGB composite, Luminance,  Zone and RGB channel. \n\nDirector mode provides a clean video preview.  This is perfect for providing a director, producer or crew with a device to monitor the production remotely. \n\nYou can switch between modes on the fly to check analytics and composition.  Remote can also be set up in ‘preview-only’ mode allowing a camera operator to perform all controls from the device running Filmic Pro and allowing the Remote to be used solely for monitoring.\n\nCreate your mobile studio today with Filmic Remote!\n\nNotes: \n- The use of Filmic Remote on one iOS device requires the simultaneous use of Filmic Pro on an additional device.  Both devices must be running iOS 13 or later.\n- Filmic Remote connects to Filmic Pro using Wi-Fi either on an established network or using a peer-to-peer network (for using in areas where a Wi-Fi network is not present).\n- Filmic Remote can connect to any iPhone or iPad running Filmic Pro and is not cross platform."

      "label": "Camera list updated to beginning January 2021. If yours is not listed please email stating which one is missing and I will be happy to add it to the next release.\n\nEver taken a picture and wished that either more of it had been in focus or the exact reverse and that less had been in focus?  Of course you have I certainly have.  But what settings on your camera give which results and what if you change one of those settings what is the Depth of Field then.  You can calculate it all yourself but it is not easy.  This App takes all of those problems and makes it easy to find the answers.  Just type in the distance to the subject, the focal length being used and the f-stop and the App calculates the near and far distances of acceptable focus and therefore the depth of field.  This is all shown on an easy to understand diagram.  \n\nAn example is: You are trying to take a photo of a bee on a flower and all but the bee is to be out of focus. Set the distance of the subject to be 200 mm (20 cm, approx 8 inches), set the f-stop to be f/5.6 and set the focal length at 50 mm.  The App calculates that the depth of field is 3.41 mm (0.3 cm, a small fraction of an inch).  The bee will be partially in focus but bees are more than 3.4 mm across so that depth of field is probably not what you were looking for.  Set the camera to f/22 and now the depth of field is 13.39 mm (1.39 cm or just over half an inch) now this is much closer to what you wanted.  Now maybe the whole of bee is in focus but still all of its surroundings are out of focus.\n\nThis App will help you take much better photographs by being able to understand the relationship between the settings on your camera and the depth of field that they produce.  The diagram shown is better than a thousand words of text (as the saying goes).  You can now easily see what effect a change in the settings will make.\n\nThe Depth of Field Calculator allows you to quickly calculate the near and far distances of acceptable focus.  Just select the distance you are focused at, the f/stop and the len's focal length and the diagram shows you at what distance acceptable focus starts and at what distance it ends.  You can select to express the focus distance in metres, millimetres, feet and inches.  Unlike other Apps this App does not use picker wheels for the f/stop and focal length values so you can enter whatever values you want.\n\nThe only other thing you have to do is select the camera you are using.  The Camera button takes you to a page with the makers of cameras listed to the left.  Select the maker of your camera and then scroll down the list to the model.  Select Save and you are now ready to calculate the correct values.  The calculations work using a value called the Circle of Confusion.  This changes depending on the camera make and model.\n\nIf you camera is not listed then email and it will be added.  You can generally find your Circle of Confusion value on the web.  Once you know this value just set it manually in field at the top and Save.\n\nYou can manually specify the Circle of Confusion to use.  Just select the field at the top and type in the value required.  Select OK and then select Save.  The user-defined Circle of Confusion will be used."

      "label": "Watch any web-video, online movie, livestream or live tv show on your Samsung Smart TV or Blu-ray Player. Enjoy the show on your big screen with the no#1 web video streamer.\n\nWith Video & TV Cast for Samsung Smart TV you can browse the web and stream any web video, online movie, livestream or live tv show you want on your Samsung Smart TV. Mp4, m3u8, hls livestreams and also video-over-https are supported.\n \nThere is no time limit at all! You can watch videos of 2 minutes or 2 hours or even more. Just open Video & TV Cast, navigate to a website, wait for link detection and send the video with a single tap to your Samsung Smart TV. The discovered link will be shown below the browser. A tap on the link will start the show. You don't need to install a big media server like Plex or any other third party software.\n\n>>> Important Notes\n\n* To enable video casting please open the Samsung App Store (Smart Hub) on your TV or Blu-ray Player, search for 'TV Cast' and install the receiver app.\n\n* Please enter the ip-adress of your iPhone/iPad by using the number pad and up/down/left/right keys on your Samsung TV Remote. Just enter the numbers, no need to press the enter key.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and other DRM protected videos like HBO now are not supported!\n\n* Please use the Remote Playbar for video control while browsing (see more info below)\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a specific video is not working, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: Use the Playbar for advanced video control while browsing, including video scrubbing, forward, rewind, play, pause, stop. The playbar works on all Samsung Smart TVs and Blu-ray Players. You can also use the included TV Remote for basic video control (play, pause, stop, forward and rewind videos) and navigating in Samsung Smart Hub. The TV Remote currently works on 2010 - 2013 TVs.\n\n* Local Videos: Cast your camera roll videos from an iPhone or iPad. Supports mp4, m4v and mov videos that were saved to the camera roll via Apples SD-Card/USB Adapter, iTunes Desktop Software or third party apps.\n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Samsung or any other trademark mentioned here."

Watermarking can also be used to add your email, url, a personal message or fun graphics to any photo or Pokemon Go screenshot.\n\n\"It's by far the best watermarking App I've seen to date on iOS.\"\n- Terry White, review on bestappsite.com\n\nVideo Review by the Daily App Show:\nhttp://dailyappshow.com/iwatermark\n\nThanks to all iWatermark users for the great reviews, feedback and suggestions. \n\niWatermark, is the only watermarking tool available for all 4 platforms iPhone/iPad, Mac and Windows. iWatermark is the most popular professional watermarking tool for photos.\n\nSocial media sharing at full resolution to Facebook, Flickr, Instagram, Twitter, Camera Album, Clipboard or Email (3 resolution options).\n\nFeatures\n\n  * Touch gestures.\n     ** Click to move the watermark location.\n     ** Pinch/zoom to expand/contract the size of the watermark. \n     ** Two fingers at once to rotate the watermark to any angle.\n  * Batch processing (all at once) or sequential.\n  * Easily adjust the watermarks scale, opacity, font, color, size, position and angle.\n  * Create your own subtle text or graphic watermarks or select from the included example watermarks (both text and graphics).\n  * Included examples are both text (names, dates, tag data, etc.) and graphic (signatures, logos, etc.) watermarks which can be used immediately. \n  * 162 fonts for your text watermarks 112 + 50 iOS fonts.\n  * Displays each font.\n  * 34 high-res watermarks.\n  * Import your own graphic watermarks by sending yourself an email with attached graphic.\n  * One button import of your signature for use as a watermark.\n  * Complete and easy to understand manual.\n  * Create a QR watermark which is like a barcode. QR codes can contain up to 4000 chars of information. QR codes can then be read with a scanner or smartphone with the right app revealing the info you encoded. \n\nWhy Watermark?\n\nDigitally sign your photos/artwork with iWatermark to claim, secure and maintain your intellectual property and reputation.\n\n- Photos go viral then they fly off globally. Watermark with name, email or url so your photo has a visible and legal connection to you.\n- Build your company brand, by having your company logo on all your images.\n- Promote your company, name and website by using QR codes as watermarks.\n- Avoid the surprise of seeing your photos and/or artwork elsewhere on the web or in an ad.\n- Avoid the conflicts, costly litigation and headaches from plagiarists who claim they didn't know that you created it.\n- Avoid intellectual property (IP) squabbles.\n\nQ:I want to stamp my signature as my watermark. How do I add my graphic signature like the examples, Picasso, Ben Franklin, etc.? \nA:Use our signature tool or make the .png graphics on your computer, email it to yourself, open the email on your iOS device and save to your photo album. In iWatermark create a graphic watermark and choose the graphic from your photo album to add it as a new watermark.\n\nQ:Will it work with Canon, Sony, Nikon, Fuji, Olympus?\nA:Yes\n\nSee the manual for more details:\nhttp://www.plumamazing.com/iphone/iwatermark-iphone/iwatermarkhelp/\n\nIMPORTANT: The signatures of John Hancock, Ben Franklin, Galileo are just examples of graphic watermarks. They are the real signatures of these historic people. They are there as examples to show what is possible. We recommend you create your own signature, logo or QR code watermarks.\n\nContact us if you need help or have a suggestion."

      "label": "\"Spectre is a new iOS camera app that uses AI to create stunning long exposures” — the Verge\n\nIntroducing Spectre, from the makers of Halide, one of the top camera apps in the App Store.\n\nSpectre uses AI to help you make amazing long exposure photographs. Spectre can remove crowds, turn city streets into rivers of light, make waterfalls look like paintings, and much more. Until now, it was difficult to take long exposures: from keeping the camera steady to guessing the amount of light you need. Spectre takes care of all of that!\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n\n• MAKE CROWDS DISAPPEAR: Spectre helps take photos of crowded, touristy places. Simply set a medium or long duration and take a shot to erase the crowd from a location. Capture the those special moments like you remember them.\n\n• RIVERS OF LIGHT: At night, AI scene detection automatically switches modes to draw beautiful light trails, for stunning nighttime city photography or light painting.\n\n• GORGEOUS WATER: Capture waterfalls, ocean waves, fountains and more with beautiful ghostly water. \n\nLIVE PHOTOS AND VIDEO\n\nSpectre’s intelligent computational shutter takes hundreds of shots over the span of a few seconds, and saves them in an accompanying live photo. That means you can pick a different frame as your photo, apply live-photo effects, and even use the long exposure as a live-wallpaper!\n\nENDLESS SMARTS\n\nSpectre is a packed with powerful technology from by the team that brought you Halide.\n\nFrom machine learning-based scene detection to computer vision aided image stabilization, Spectre is jammed full of impressive technologies to get the best possible image.\n\nDESIGNED FOR HUMANS\n\nSpectre is meticulously designed. Its dark UI is gentle on the eyes when you shoot at night. Gorgeous glowing highlights infuse it with a unique style. Custom typefaces and iconography combined with unique, smooth controls make it as tactile and delightful as an actual physical camera. Like its sister app Halide, the app is easily usable with one hand, even on the largest iPhones.\n\nHIGH-TECH SHOWCASE \n\nBuild with the latest tech, Spectre isn't just a long exposure camera — it’s the cutting edge technology showcase of one of the App Store’s foremost camera apps, Halide. Here’s just a few of the latest technologies that we use in Spectre:\n\n- DCI-P3 Wide Color Pipeline\n- Live Photos\n- Metal Graphics Acceleration\n- Tripod Detection\n- Siri & Shortcuts\n- AI Stabilization\n- Machine Learning & CoreML\n- Computer Vision\n\nCOMPATIBILITY:\n\nSpectre’s smart Automatic Scene Detection requires iOS 12. AI-based stabilization features are available on iPhone 6S and later.* For the best experience, we recommend iPhone 8 or later.\n\nOn iPhone 6, Spectre captures in lower resolution. \n\n* (Full compatibility device list: iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max)\n\nABOUT US \n\nWe’re Ben and Sebastiaan, two friends living in the San Francisco Bay Area that love building fantastic apps for photography. \n\nWe hope you love Spectre! We’d love your feedback to make it even better or any reports of bugs you run into.

      "label": "“Cortex Camera Takes Great Low Light iPhone Photos”\n-Lifehacker\n\n“In my experience, I found that Cortex Camera greatly reduced noise in low-light conditions. And I was able to get crisp shots without the need for a stand or tripod.”\n-CNET\n\nCortex Camera improves on your device’s already excellent camera to achieve quality that rivals a DSLR. It combines dozens of exposures to create a single noise free, high resolution photo. If you want the best quality for a static scene and you aren't carrying a bulky DSLR with you, Cortex Cam is an excellent alternative.\n\nPLEASE NOTE that while a tripod is not required, the camera must be held steady and your subject must be still for the duration of the exposure, which takes 2-10 seconds with default settings.\n\nIn addition to the image quality benefits mentioned above, Cortex Cam also enables long exposure effects such as motion blur and soft water. Switch off the \"remove motion blur\" option to capture these effects.\n\nCortex Cam is all about achieving the best image quality possible on a mobile device. It uses RAW data (when available) to increase sharpness and image detail. Professional exposure controls (including shutter priority, ISO priority, and full manual) enable great photos even in the most challenging lighting situations. It may not replace your DSLR (or the default camera app for that matter), but for certain situations you will find it indispensable.\n\n- Advanced image processing techniques combine information from multiple frames to remove noise and increase resolution.\n- Motion compensation enables hand-held long exposure photography.\n- The “enhance shadows” option brightens dark areas of your photos without making them look unnatural or processed.\n- Uses RAW data as input to increase sharpness and image detail (iPhone 6s and above).\n- Supports JPEG or TIFF file formats.\n- Supports telephoto lens on iPhone 7 plus and above.\n- Manually choose to combine 10-99 frames or let Cortex Cam automatically determine number of frames.\n- Includes support for front camera, shutter timer, and grid overlay.\n- Most of all, image quality! The majority of development time has been spent on making image quality unreasonably good for a mobile device.\n\nImage resolution depends on which device you’re using:\n\niPhone 6s, 6s plus: 19 megapixels\niPhone 7 and above: 27 megapixels\n\nFollow @CortexCamera on twitter for more Cortex Camera goodness!"

Thankfully, you have your trusty iPhone or iPad!  \n\nOK!  Now what??\n\nDo you know the tips and tricks to take photos of the northern lights ? Great, if you do!

ISO, shutter speed, long exposure mode, temperature, check check check. There are 3 presets that you can choose from based on the brightness of the aurora lights that you're seeing.

So we created RNI Flashback — an app that works like film not like an app.\n\nUsing Flashback is simple. You just press the button and it generates editing options for you. And then you choose the best one. Because you’re the boss.\n\nUnlike other apps, RNI Flashback has no pre-defined filters. Instead it mixes virtual 'chemicals' and creates a unique look every time you press the button. This transforms digital medium making it more true to life and more refreshing. \n\nFlashback is created for everyone. But professional photographers and aficionados familiar with shooting film will especially love it. Because Flashback works more like photographic film rather than like digital software. Unlike any other existing software, Flashback uses real film data and simulates the response of real film layers by light when processing digital colours. This results in a completely unique output which can't be achieved in traditional image editors with conventional tools.\n\nSome of its looks can be weird, some can render skintones too red. But some will be just absolutely fabulous, making for film-like colour harmony and colour separation, far beyond what’s achievable in any other piece of software you have ever tried. \n\nExperience RNI Flashback now. Bring custom artistic flair into your photos and never get bored again.\n\n--\n#RNIFlashback \nTag your photos with #RNIFlashback for a chance to get featured in RNI’s official newsletter, blog and Instagram @reallyniceimages.\n\nTo find out more about RNI products please visit\nreallyniceimages.com"

      "label": "DoubleTake by Filmic transforms your iPhone into a multi-cam studio allowing you to capture video from two cameras at the same time on recent devices*\n\n*NOTE:  Per iOS 15 capabilities, multi-cam video is restricted to the following devices only:  iPhone 13 series devices, iPhone 12 series devices, iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro, 11, Xs Max, Xs, Xr, SE 2. iPad Pro 2018 and newer.  While this app will install and function on all devices supported by iOS 15, all devices outside of this list will be restricted to recording video from on a single camera.\n\nUse DoubleTake to record video in new ways:\n\n- Camera Visualization:  Better than a director’s viewfinder!  Use DoubleTake’s camera picker view to visualize all available cameras for your device.  Use this view to help decide how to frame your shot and which cameras you will select.\n\n- Shot/Reverse shot:  To capture all the organic and intimate interaction between two actors or interviewer and interviewee.  Traditionally, filmmakers would need to employ two cameras and place these in cumbersome ‘over the shoulder’ locations.  With DoubleTake you can place one device in between your actors and place the audience right in the middle of the conversation.\n\n- Multi-cam:  Capture two different focal lengths of the same subject at the same time.  Use DoubleTake with the Ultra Wide lens (iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro and 11 only) and the Tele to capture both an establishing shot and a punch-in on your subject simultaneously. Or use any other combination of front and rear lenses for unrivaled multi-cam capture.\n\n- PiP or Discreet:  The DoubleTake interface allows you to see both cameras of your video capture at the same time through the use of a Picture in Picture (PiP) window.  You can move this PiP around the screen, tap to zoom in, or swipe it away if it’s distracting (the second video will continue to record).  With DoubleTake you can decide if you want to record your videos as separate discrete files or if you want the video recorded as a composite video that includes the PiP window animated as you see it on the screen.\n\n- Split-screen: Doubletake also allows you to use any two cameras to create a 50/50 split-screen effect that is saved as a single video. This is great for capturing engaging interviews, or any scenario where two sides of the story need equal weighting on screen.\n\n- Focus & Exposure Controls: DoubleTake allows you to set and lock your focus and exposure on both cameras during multi-cam capture with our unified reticle. Just tap anywhere to set an area of interest with the reticle, then tap again to lock or unlock. Our easy to use camera switcher lets you effortlessly move between your A and B cams during a recording to adjust the focus and exposure for each independently of one another.\n\nVideo Specs:\n- Full frame focus and exposure for smooth and easy automated focus and exposure adjustments.\n\n- Selectable broadcast frame rates:  24fps, 25fps, and 30fps depending on your project requirements.\n\n- 1080p video at high bitrate encoding for maximum quality.  (note: 1080p video is the maximum resolution supported by the Apple API for multi-cam capture).\n\n- Composited PiP or separate discreet video files recorded as .h264 .mov files are saved to DoubleTake’s internal library which supports batch export to the Camera Roll."

A lens out of focus captured the light of a candle which resulted in a blurred image with octagonal-shaped diamonds dots.\n\nWithout losing the characteristics that made it a great success, we listened the opinions from our users and created an even better and more complete app! \n\nNow you can have even greater customization for your photos! \n\nIncrease, decrease, move, rotate, adjust the opacity of the effects and save at high resolution, are some of the most anticipated news!\n\nThere are now 121 effects!!! Including the new category NEON \n\nEasier to apply effects! And it looks even more beautiful and fresh! \n\nWe hope everyone can have again a unique experience with Lumiè!\n\n=====================\n\nUse #lumie tag on instagram\n\nfollow our inspirations instagram @lumieinspiration\n\n====================="

It's the most advanced screen mirroring solution with zero delay and the highest screen quality.\n\nMirror photos, videos, games, websites, apps, presentations, documents and spreadsheets on Fire TV.\n\n* Supported Fire TVs: Fire TV Box+Stick, Fire TV Cube and all other devices of the Fire TV Family.\n\n* Supported TVs: Insignia TV and Toshiba TV with Fire TV Edition\n\n* Your iPhone/iPad and your Fire TV must be connected to the same wifi to enable screen mirroring. Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Amazon or any other trademark mentioned here.

Please do not trust other apps that ask you for 5-star ratings in exchange for premium upgrades.

How dark? It depends on the iPhone but moonlight is enough. On any iPhone it will still work when the iPhone Camera app only sees black.\n\nHow does it work? It uses a live camera view and special photo enhancement techniques to boost light levels, plus 3 special camera modes (Fast, High and Max). Fast produces good results when you’re on the move, Max produces amazing results when you’re still, and High is balanced between the two.\n\nAnd you can take HD photos with enhancement and effects.\n\n== 3 powerful modes: ==\n\n• Fast: best results with fast motion\n• High: balanced between speed and performance for all-purpose use\n• Max: for stationary use. Ultimate enhancement!\n\n== Features: ==\n\n• Live, adjustable night vision enhancement. Enhance as much or as little as you want to get the picture just right\n• 3 operating modes ensure best results in any situation\n• Smooth, fast, live fullscreen display\n• Powerful 8x live zoom\n• Multiple live color modes: Full Color, Black and White, Red, Green and Blue filters\n• Multiple live effects:\n- Thermal Image (this is an effect, not real thermal imaging)\n- Monochrome shade: Highlights patterns of light and shadow\n- False Color\n- Posterize: See the world in a limited palette of colors\n• Negative. Sometimes produces better images, also makes a cool X-Ray effect!\n• Built-in camera, captures exactly what you see on screen and saves automatically to your photo library at HD resolution\n• Built-in image viewer\n• Built-in binocular simulation\n\n== Please note: ==\n\n• Night vision in extremely dark or pitch black conditions is impossible with the iPhone camera\n• Thermal imaging is a video effect only!\n• Virtual NightVision is compatible with iPhone 4S and later, iPod Touch with camera and iPad with camera.

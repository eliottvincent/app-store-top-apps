      "label": "Ship's Bell is primarily an acoustic clock that sounds half-hourly or hourly time signals. Without taking the phone out of your pocket you can easily keep track of time.\n\nThe principle of this bell was founded in traditional seafaring. Seafarers used the bell to keep track of their four-hourly duty watches. The first half hour is signaled by a single bell strike. Another bell strike is added every half hour, ending with eight bell strikes. To hear the bell strikes better, they are grouped into double chimes. Eight bell strikes signaled a watch change – at midnight, 4 am, 8 am, 12 pm, 4 pm and 8 pm. With just eight different signals, being repeated in six cycles during the day, you will know what time it is every half and full hour.\n\n• Ship's bell according to the seafaring tradition\n• Two different kinds of chimes: classic bell or a modern synthesized sound\n• Option to strike only once each hour\n• Two different chimes for hourly signals: a single beep or a triple signal counting down to the full hour\n• Displays the current time on a maritime 24-hour clock face\n• Shows Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)\n• Switch to quickly enable or disable the acoustic signals\n\nA new addition in version 3.0 is the Tide Clock.\nAn additional clock hand and a tide ring can now be activated on the two dials of the glass clock (12-hour or 24-hour dial). This makes it possible to estimate the time until the next high or low tide in the style of a mechanical tide clock. The tide clock hand makes one revolution within 12 hours and 25 minutes independently of the hour clock hand and thus shows the average time between two high or low tides. The indices on the tide ring show the hours before and after a coming or past high or low tide.\n\nDear customers,\nIf there are any issues with this app, please send an email to our support team. We will get back to you as soon as possible!"

The results will show how many seats are available for sale right now in total of \"Economy, Comfort, Business, First\" Classes and this may include the overbooking. Overbooking level is not shown. Some low cost airlines or charter flights may not be shown. British Airways (BA) flights are not shown. Copa Airlines (CM) flights are not shown. Southwest Airlines (WN) flights are not shown. San Diego departure flights and San Diego arrival flights are not shown. Lufthansa City Line (CL) flights are not shown.

Complete list of airports are in Airports Section, complete list of airlines are in Airlines Section. There are 233 airlines in ZED Airlines List. Some of the airlines in ZED airlines list are not shown. There are 20 questions and answers in FAQ Section. You don't have to be an airline employee to use iFlyZED. All airline passengers who have frequent flyer cards may use iFlyZED in order to use their miles on a flight since they cannot use their miles on an overbooked flight. If there are several flights per day, you can avoid an overbooked flight. Even if you have a confirmed ticket, your seat cannot be guaranteed for that flight due to the overbooking policy of most airlines. Internet connection is required for Seat Availability Search and other sections do not need internet connection. Password is not required for this application. This application can be downloaded and used on iPads. Just Search \"iFlyZED\" on iPad App Store but select iPhone only as filter selection. Search again with iPhone only filter, download it on your iPad."

Those passwords are then sent to foXnoMad for verification and approval before they are added to the map.\n\n*In ‘List View’ you can update passwords for airports already added (when you’ve noticed some changes). As you travel you can also rate the wireless hotspot information to let us know if the details worked for you or not. Based on traveler feedback, the connection information is updated, verified, or removed.\n\n*WiFox icons indicate how fresh, reliable, and highly rated a given airport wireless network’s information is.\n\n*WiFox is updated continuously with information travelers, pilots, and other users send through the WiFox app, foXnoMad website, and foXnoMad Facebook and Twitter accounts. WiFox currently has wireless Internet information for over 700 airports around the world.\n\n*The map is updated automatically upon opening the app (when you have Internet access) or by clicking the ‘Update’ button on the map or refresh icon on the List View.\n\n*WiFox also protects users on free (open) wifi networks by telling you the proper network name, so you don't unintentionally connect to a rogue or malicious access point.\n\nWiFox Premium subscriptions unlock the following features:\n\n* Automatic notifications of the highest rated password, with network connection information, as soon as you land. WiFox Premium detects the airport you're at and displays the most relevant wifi network name and password so you can get online as soon as you step off the plane.\n\n* View password ratings to see which passwords work best throughout an airport so you can connect to the strongest and most reliable connection.\n\n* Be able to add your own password ratings within WiFox. Premium user priority ratings ensure the best wifi passwords are always displayed.\n\nAfter a 30-day free trial period a $24.99/year purchase will be applied to your iTunes account following confirmation of a Premium upgrade. Subscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can cancel anytime with your iTunes account settings.

Street View coverage is displayed in blue.\n\n\nEASY TO USE\nWalking through panoramas has never been easier using the interactive, expandable mini map that also displays your viewing angle and field of view. Virtually traveling abroad is even more immersive and fun with Live Panorama mode: Turn around in the panorama simply by rotating the device.\n\n\nAPPLE WATCH APP\nStreets is the only app capable of displaying 360° Street View panoramas on the Apple Watch. Just turn your wrist or pan to turn around in any direction. Use the digital crown to zoom. Streets for Apple Watch automatically syncs favorites and recent searches with your iPhone.\n\n\nOPEN FROM MAPS & OTHER APPS \n“Open location in Streets” displays nearby panoramas from websites, from „Maps“ or „Contacts“, or from many other apps that support sharing of locations and addresses. If you’re already using our location finder app Where To?, you’ll also be able to take advantage of a tight, bidirectional integration.\n\n\nDRAG & DROP\nOn iPad or Mac, drag a pin location from the Maps app, a contact, or a textual address into the Streets app to find nearby panoramas. Even geotagged photos can be dropped in Streets to find 360° spherical images near the photo location.\n\n\nCOMMUNICATIVE\nShare Street View panoramas using drag-and-drop (on iPad) or the share sheet. Handoff and AirDrop let you easily transfer the currently viewed panorama between multiple devices. Mark panoramas as favorites that are automatically synced between devices. Rename favorites and organize them in folders.\n\n\n2000+ GALLERY PLACES \nMore than 2000 hand-picked “Gallery Places” show spectacular places such as museums, castles, national parks, ski slopes and even underwater attractions. Geysers in Yellowstone national park, old masterpieces in Amsterdam’s van Gogh museum or NASA’s rocket launch pad in Cape Kennedy are just a few of the breathtaking places waiting to be explored. Gallery places also include background information such as descriptions and links.\n\n\n\nMORE FEATURES\n- Supports iPad Pro, Split View and Slide Over\n- Supports keyboard navigation (with Bluetooth or Smart Keyboard)\n- Spotlight search also finds Streets panoramas\n- Siri can create reminders with a link to the currently displayed panorama\n- Supports the “Shortcuts” app\n\n\nWHAT OTHERS SAY\n\n“I highly recommend Streets 3.“\n- John Voorhees, MacStories\n\n“it’s hard to imagine Cupertino doing it better than Streets 3”\n4.5/5 mice\n- J.R. Bookwalter, Macworld\n\n“If you haven't migrated to Google Maps on iOS because you're OK with Apple Maps but you miss Google Street View, here's a pretty easy solution.“\n- Mel Martin, Engadget\n\n“Thankfully, with Streets, you can continue using Maps and still be able to quickly pull up Street View without ever feeling like you’ve left the app.“\n- Jordan Khan, 9to5Mac\n\n\nTwitter & Facebook\nCheck us out on Twitter: @futuretap\nand Facebook: http://facebook.com/streetviewapp"

      "label": "eCurrency is far more than an easy to use currency converter and handy calculator. It supports over 200 popular currencies; works without active internet connection and even supports custom rates. eCurrency offers rich graphical charts for all exchange rates and supports calculations with historical exchange rates, making this the perfect tool for business, overseas travel and for anyone interested in currency trading.\n\neCurrency offers the following features:\n\n► Easy-to-use appealing interface\n► One screen for all major functionalities\n► Designated keypad for fast number entry; plus a handy built-in math’s calculator\n► Configures up to 8 converters; swipe through as on the iPhone‘s home screen\n► Supports over 200 currencies (for a full list see: http://bit.ly/knBkeS)\n► Detailed graphical charts for all exchange rates (1-week, 1-month, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, and 5-years)\n► Automatic setting of home currency and number formatting \n► Reliable functionality: No active internet connection required\n► Exchange rates automatically updated on startup (Automatic update can be deactivated to avoid roaming costs)\n► Supports custom exchange rate entry\n► One touch reverse currency conversion\n► Special ‘shake to inverse calculation’ feature\n► Select and create a list of preferred currencies for fast access\n\n\n==Easy to use interface==\neCurrency interface is designed for ease of use. Just start the application and type in the amount you want to convert and eCurrency converts instantly. Tap on one of the flags to change the currency you want to convert to. A built-in calculator allows for math calculations. The current exchange rate and rate change compared to the previous day is conveniently displayed in the main interface.\n\n==Favorites Support==\neCurrency supports over 200 currencies. The “Favorites” functionality allows you to define the currency pairs you use as favorites. To create a new favorite go into the “Settings” and touch the “+” Button.

No Login. \n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Francés, the most popular route across Spain. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 900 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 900+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

      "label": "A simple and easy to use odometer. GPS Odometer only does one thing, and does it well: measure distance traveled. Includes run in background capability. Ideal for almost anything that requires measuring outdoor distance traveled such as walking, running, driving, boating, or hiking.  Note that GPS does not work well under a roof.  For best results, use outdoors.\n\nBenefits of the paid version:\n- Landscape and splitscreen support.\n- Ability to have multiple trips.  Each trip can be stopped and started independently.\n- Receive notifications while the application is closed at distance intervals of your choosing.\n- Custom units readout.  For example, you want to know how many calories you have burned.  You can customize this to include anything that has a linear relationship with distance traveled.  This can be different for each trip.\n- No advertisements.\n- Export trips via email and optionally restore later.\n\nDisplays:\n- Distance\n- Time elapsed\n- Speed (average or current)\n- Displacement (straight line distance from your starting point) This can be hidden.\n\nDistance units include:\n- Kilometers\n- Miles\n- Nautical miles\n- Meters\n- Feet\n\nSpeed units include:\n- Kilometers per hour\n- Miles per hour\n- Nautical miles per hour\n- Meters per second\n- Feet per second\n\nOther features:\n- Large font adjustable display.\n- Accurate to within 1 percent when compared to most car odometers under normal driving conditions.\n- Includes a lock to help prevent accidental reset of your trip. After unlocked, it locks back in a few seconds, or you can lock it yourself.\n- Approximates distance traveled in some GPS dead spots such as driving through a tunnel by adding the as-a-bird flies distance to your trip.\n\nPlease also note:\n- GPS Odometer does run in the background if you leave it running.  Be sure to pause the trip when you are finished or battery life will be negatively affected.  The timer stops when the trip is paused.\n- To change the display, tap the unlock button and notice the three green boxes that temporarily appear. Each button adjusts a different part of the display.\n- You can change the language to English in the application settings.\n\nPlease visit the web page for more details."

Then the new list will contain all the things from the \"base\" list.\nYou can also create a new list from several \"basic\" lists at once.\n            \nThis is very convenient: first you can create your own basic lists, for example: women's clothes, beach set, photo equipment, etc.\nThen, add to the new list not one thing at a time, but several basic lists at once.\n            \n- Add new things, create new sections;\n            \n- Rename things and move them to another section;\n            \n- Add \"action\" to any thing. For example, there are things that need to be prepared (hemming, ironing, mending, etc.) - you can specify “Prepare”.\nIf you need to buy some things, you can specify \"Buy\".\nThen these things can be viewed and marked in the \"Prepare\" and \"Buy\" sections.\nIf the item is prepared or bought, then mark it and it is moved to the \"Pack\" list.\n            \n- Add the quantity for the item to the list. This amount is taken into account when calculating the weight of the suitcase.\n            \n- Add weight for each item. For any list (suitcase), you can specify the \"Consider weight\" property. If this box is checked, then you can see the total weight of all items in the list plus the weight of the suitcase itself.\n            \n- Set priority (importance) for each thing.\n\nThe priority is indicated by color:\n            \n   ∙ Red - it's important not to forget\n   ∙ Yellow - just don't forget\n   ∙ Green - take just in case\n            \nThe items on the list are shown in order of priority - important at the top, not very important at the bottom.\n            \n- Arrange your suitcase lists. The lists can be placed in any order you like.\nThere are three conditional groups of lists: Actual, Archived, and Basic. In the properties of each list, you can move it to any of these groups.\nThis is done only for presentation convenience when there are a lot of lists.\n            \n- Arrange sections.\nSections can be arranged in any convenient order. This is how they will be displayed in the lists.\nSections can be renamed or deleted.

This helps in routing your travels (requires separate purchase of the Road Trip Planner app).\n\nWe want to expand our RV dump station database as much as possible, so we have made it easy for you to easily submit a new RV dump station - simply tap the + button below the map.  To correct or update dump station information, tap “Location Comment” in the detail view. We will be updating the database often.\n\nDue to the nature of dump stations constantly changing their status it's recommended you contact the dump station prior to using it to verify its existence."

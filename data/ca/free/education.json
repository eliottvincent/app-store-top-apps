Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

You can go back and review the questions that you got wrong.\n• Passing Probability score is calculated in real-time based on your activity and displays how you'd score on the official G1 test if you took it today.\n• Multiple difficulty levels: Study at your own pace as you move from Easy to the Exam Simulator.\n• Simple and fun to use: We’ve simplified the vague and complex language of driving rules so you can quickly master the concepts and answer the question correctly next time, no matter how it’s worded on the exam.\n• Works offline: no internet connection needed.\n• Detailed explanations reveal the \"why\" behind every answer. For each question, you’ll see an explanation of the right answer immediately.\n• Smart hints help with tricky questions and steer you in the right direction.\nG1 Genie is the perfect practice app for beginners, but it also includes plenty of challenging G1 practice questions for renewal applicants and advanced drivers. Every question is based on the official Driver's Handbook issued by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario, so you can be sure you're studying the most recent materials.\nYou'll be surprised how close the app is to the real thing!\n\"Really prepares you for the G1 test. I passed with flying colours and it’s the closest thing you can get to taking the actual test in advance. So worth it!\" - Terry G., Markham\n\"Just study with this every day for like 30 mins, and when you write the actual exam, you'll be fine.\" - Jaden Bediako, Team Canada, National basketball player\nPremium membership pricing and terms:\nG1 Genie offers a one-time Premium Lifetime membership to provide you with unlimited access to the training materials, which is paid for by a one-off upfront payment with unlimited access to the full functionality forever.\nHave questions, problems, or feedback?

      "label": "Backed by Occupational Therapists, Teachers, and Child Psychologists, Joon is the future of motivating kids and helping them focus. Using a kid-friendly game (for ages 8-12), Joon helps you motivate your child to focus and stay on top of their daily tasks & habits.\n\n\n**JOON’S GOAL**\n\nHelp you motivate your kids with ADHD, ADD, or OSD to focus and complete their daily tasks while learning basic responsibility and independence. Not only does Joon make it extremely easy to motivate your ADHD kids to do important tasks, but it also teaches them valuable life skills that they won’t be able to learn in school. We’ve helped thousands of families complete more than 100k tasks and teach their kids important life skills, so why can't we help you?\n\n\n**HOW IT WORKS**\n\nAssign tasks as \"Quests\", then the game does the rest.\n\n1) Start with age-appropriate tasks & habits to focus on: Choose a couple focus areas, and we'll provide you with a small list of recommended tasks (known as Quests) or create your own tasks to get your child started!\n\n2) Use gamification to keep your child on track: Your child chooses a virtual pet (called a Doter) to feed, wash, and grow. They stay motivated and focused on completing the tasks you assigned them, so they can take care of their pet and level it up!\n\n3) Your child stays focused and even develops life skills! As they progress in the game, your child will naturally start building their tasks as habits into their daily routine and even pick up on learning important life skills. All because they want to keep playing a fun game!\n\n\n**THE PARENTING TOOL YOU NEED**\n\n+ We make it easy to manage your child’s tasks and add to your existing routine.\n\n+ We'll do the reminding to help your child stick to their routine. No more nagging from your end.\n\n+ Your child will stay focused to do the activities assigned to them. In fact, 90% of kids on Joon complete all tasks assigned.\n\n+ Choose from a large list of research-backed activities to help your child build important life skills that teach independence.\n\nJoon is less than a year old and already has the attention of press, parenting publications, and parenting experts. To see the complete list, visit our website here: https://joonapp.io\n\n\n**HOW TO GET STARTED**\n\n1) Install Joon on your device, create your family, and select a few beginning tasks you’d like your child to initially focus on.\n\n2) Help your child set up their account so they can see the tasks that you’ve assigned them. You can have them download Joon on their own device or share you phone.\n\n3) Add a few more activities that are most important to your family (such as chores, learning, or exercising) and assign them to your child. Your child will be motivated to complete these activities in order to feed and take care of their virtual pet.\n\n4) Once your child completes their tasks, you can review and approve them to make sure they were completed correctly.\n\n5) Once approved, your children receive coins and experience points that let them feed, level up, buy things, and progress in the game with their virtual pet. As your child continues to progress in the game, they actually progress in real life too!\n\n6) Keep adding quests (and we’ll recommend you new ones too to help your children develop good habits! Your children cannot grow on their own. Make sure to stay involved in the process and keep assigning new quests as needed to allow your children to continue helping, learning, growing, and progressing in the game.\n\nTerms Of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

Seemed a little bit magical to both my son and I.” \n\n “My son really enjoyed the app. As a science kid he loved that it was sharing and telling him all about the solar system. We found out facts about different planets that we had no idea about. And he was just really loving the game, that’s great. It allowed him to feel immersed into this super science technical space right from home, right from our living room!”\n\n“Hi I’m Leandra, I work with teachers every day....One of the biggest complaints that they have about the different learning resources available to students is the lack of focus on student engagement...Magic Kids help kids learn in this really hands-on way where they can move around and access topics like space and dinosaurs and learn in a way where the environment actually responds to them!”\n\n“What Magic Kids is making with these augmented reality lessons, it really has student engagement and student participation at its core in a way that a lot of other tech products don’t.”"

Hemos creado el SISTEMA DE ENSEÑANZA DE LA GRAMÁTICA más claro y sencillo, conveniente a los principiantes.

Cada regla gramatical del curso autodidacta Simpler es una instrucción corta que enseguida se refuerza con preguntas y prácticas.\n\n2. Hemos creado un SISTEMA sencillo y claro de MEMORIZACIÓN DEL VOCABULARIO INGLÉS. Aparte de la traducción, se visualiza una imagen especial que ilustra el significado de la palabra desconocida. Además, se le muestra un texto asociativo que acompaña la imagen y le permite idear sus propias asociaciones mnemónicas. El curso autodidacta Simpler organiza el repaso del vocabulario en intervalos que fueron calculados con la curva del olvido de Ebbinghaus. ¡Con Simpler su vocabulario de inglés se ampliará notablemente!\n\n3. Es imprescindible poder entender el lenguaje oral en inglés. Para ello, los audios de las frases fueron grabados por hablantes nativos, lo que es especialmente importante para aquellos que empiezan a estudiar inglés desde cero. Asimismo, creamos un apartado especial de audiciones que llamamos PRÁCTICAS. Después de estudiar las reglas gramaticales, se le ofrece una tarea auditiva con el fin de entender frases en inglés.\n\n4. Creamos un sistema de tareas de toda clase que llamamos ENTRENADOR. Incluye una gama de actividades variadas que suponen un entrenamiento de traducción de frases del español al inglés y viceversa. Además, las reglas están pensadas de tal manera que el estudiante pueda aprender a aplicarlas con facilidad. Las lecciones del Simpler no se pasan al olvido, gracias a que el ENTRENADOR incluya también actividades de lecciones anteriores.\n\n5. ¡EXCLUSIVIDAD! Historias policíacas en inglés adaptado. Le harán pensar en inglés, con ellas podrá ampliar su vocabulario y mejorar la destreza oral.\n\n6. ¡La eficacia está en la regularidad!

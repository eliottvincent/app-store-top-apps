      "label": "Safe driving can add up to savings with TD MyAdvantage.\n\nBy clicking \"Install\", you consent to the installation of the TD MyAdvantage app provided by TD Insurance* and to any future updates or upgrades. You are also acknowledging that you understand that the TD MyAdvantage app and any future updates and upgrades will or may perform the functions described below. You may withdraw your consent at any time by deleting the TD MyAdvantage app from your device.\n\nWhat is the TD MyAdvantage program?\n\nThe TD MyAdvantage program is a usage-based insurance savings program that is 100% voluntary and free! It's designed to reward safe driving behaviour - the safer you drive, the more you could save. The data collected will only be used to calculate your potential savings.\n\nTD MyAdvantage rewards safe drivers based on individual driving behaviours. Using a technology called telematics, it allows actual driving habits to be analyzed and measured.\n\nThe TD MyAdvantage app is free to download, however standard wireless carrier message and data rates may apply.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nIf you’re a TD Insurance auto customer, saving is easy:\n\n1. Contact a TD Insurance Representative at 1-866-223-1030 to enroll in the TD MyAdvantage program and receive a unique Activation Code.\n2. Log in with your code and start driving. The app will capture your driving data on each trip, including GPS locations, mileage and driving style elements such as speed, acceleration, cornering and braking.\n3. This information will be used to create your personalized driving score.\n4. This score is used to calculate discounts that could be applied to your premium when it’s time to renew your policy, and suddenly safe driving makes even more cents.\n\nBenefits of enrollment:\n\n• Get a discount of 10% (5% in Quebec) on your insurance premium just for enrolling in TD MyAdvantage, and potentially save up to 25%** on renewal.\n• Encourage all drivers on your policy to adopt safe driving habits by getting them to enroll in the TD MyAdvantage program.\n\nAdditional app features:\n\n• Safer driving habits – get helpful driving tips and advice based on your current driving habits, so you can continue to drive safely and possibly earn a discount on your premium when it’s time to renew.\n• Earn badges - badges are fun awards you can earn through the app by meeting challenges designed to help you become a safer driver. The better you drive the more badges you can earn!\n\nImportant Disclosures:\n\nThe TD MyAdvantage app collects the following data for each trip you make:\n• GPS data (location information, speed)\n• Acceleration, speeding, braking and cornering derived from GPS or accelerometer data\n• Time of day\n• Confirmation of when the app is being turned on and off\n• Mobile device ID\n• Mileage\n• Battery level and charging status\n• Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connection information\n• Internet connectivity (Cellular or Wi-Fi)\n\nPlease note: TD MyAdvantage uses your phone's GPS services. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nYour driving data is used to calculate your driving score. Your data is then securely transmitted to the app to display scores.\n\nNeed help?\n\nIf you experience problems with the TD MyAdvantage app you can call 1-866-223-1030, Monday to Friday 8:00 am to 10:00 pm and Saturday 9:00 am to 6:00 pm EST.\n\nIf you require assistance, contact us by phone at 1-866-223-1030, or by mail at TD CASL Office, Toronto Dominion Centre, PO Box 1, Toronto, ON, M5K 1A2 or by e-mail at service@tdinsurance.com.\n\n*For the purpose of this App, TD Insurance refers to the following personal lines insurance companies within TD Bank Group: Security National Insurance Company, Primmum Insurance Company, TD Home and Auto Insurance Company and TD General Insurance Company. Product availability may vary by province. Please contact us at 1-866-223-1030 for eligibility.\n**Conditions and exclusions apply to all offers.

Mydoh makes it easy for kids to gain real life money skills, and parents can coach, guide, or just keep an eye on things.\n\nMydoh’s card helps kids take responsibility for their spending. And, because it’s a reloadable prepaid card (not a credit card), kids can only spend what they have. No surprises!\n\nSPEND ONLY WHAT YOU HAVE. ANYWHERE VISA IS ACCEPTED\nWith the Mydoh Smart Cash Card, kids can gain valuable money skills and safely spend their earnings using their physical or digital card in-store and online. \n  - Use the card anywhere VISA is accepted,\n  - Tap or insert the card at in-store terminals (no PIN required),\n  - Cannot be used at an ATM,\n  - And, because it’s a prepaid card, kids can’t spend more than they have.\nIf kids are 13 or older, they can add their card to their Apple Wallet (with iPhone 6 or above) to make in-store purchases anywhere Visa or Apply Pay is accepted.\n\nTASKS/ALLOWANCE: KIDS LEARN THE VALUE OF MONEY\nYou can start teaching your kids about money at an early age! Set up one-off or recurring tasks from your parent account, to teach your kids that money is earned. You can also set a weekly allowance and send them money instantly through the app. \n\nPLAY: KIDS LEARN MONEY BASICS\nHelp your kids learn money basics through Play.  Kids can learn about credit cards, taxes, and much more by completing trivia in the app. From your parent account, see what your kids are learning, and some handy tips to keep the money conversation going.\n\nSAFE AND SECURE\nThe Mydoh Smart Card is issued by Royal Bank of Canada and powered by Visa. Rest assured that there is no risk of your kids going into debt - they cannot spend more money than they have on their Mydoh Smart Card.\n\nKIDS GAIN INDEPENDENCE WHILE YOU STAY IN CONTROL\nYour kids build strong money values by making their own spending decisions. You stay involved by tracking their spending and checking their balances, all in real-time. Lock and unlock your kid’s Smart Card if you need to, through the app.\n\nPOWERED BY ROYAL BANK OF CANADA\nMydoh was created with the support of Royal Bank of Canada, providing security and peace of mind. RBC goes beyond banking, by creating products and services that help solve problems and make peoples’ lives better.\n\nDETAILS\nYou can try Mydoh for free for a limited time*. After your free trial ends, a monthly fee of $2.99 will be taken out of your Mydoh Wallet. You can cancel at any time by contacting Mydoh customer support.\n\n*Royal Bank of Canada reserves the right to cancel, modify or withdraw this at any time.\n**RBC Client means an individual who holds at least one personal deposit account with Royal Bank of Canada (excluding saving accounts and US dollar accounts), or a personal RBC Royal Bank Credit Card.\n\nOpening a Mydoh account is fast, and easy.

The app is very intuitive\" - Michael P.\n\"Makes sharing bills with friends so much easier, many useful options, an absolute must have.\" - Tom C.\n\"Super useful - my flatmates and I can't live without it anymore!\" Sarah P.\n\nTHEY RECOMMEND TRICOUNT :\n\nFORBES:\n\"With Tricount, you can create a group expense report on your phone. It tracks spending by person, and then splits up how much each individual owes or is owed from the total balance. When you’re ready to share the final breakdown, the app sends each person a link to Tricount’s site to review the data.\"\n\nBUSINESS INSIDER:\n\"Next time you organize a group activity, Tricount will split up the expenses for you\".\n\nABOUT IN-APP PURCHASES\n\nAs of version 2.1, Tricount offers in-App purchase subscriptions valid for one year. \n\nThe price of the subscription is 6.99€ (Premium) and may depend on your territory and is clearly indicated on the subscription page. Payment will be directly charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. The subscription renewal costs the same price as the one of the original subscription. After purchase, you can disable auto-renewal in your user's Account Settings. Note that no cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during the active subscription period. Tricount's terms and conditions are available at https://tricount.com/en/terms\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\n\ncreate a tricount, share your link with friends ... et voilà!\n\nTricount makes sorting out and divvying your group expenses very easy when you organize activities (for example: ski trip, citytrip, holidays with a classroom, flatmates etc.)\n\nGone are the days of the old excel file: an easier and effective solution exists to breakdown the costs, sharing expense reports, list tickets and spending. Tricount does the accounting and balances the cost for your group expenses.\n\nIt lets you breakdown the budget of a group and track expenses during a trip or any occasion with friends. It can be used by couples, between colleagues, roommates & flatmates. It is a simple yet powerful tool to figure out who owes what to whom and balance spendings : I owe you, you owe me (IOU) ... so easy!\n\nCreate your group expenses on your mobile (even offline), during your group activity. Send everyone the link (a la Doodle), and your friends too can add their own expense or see your changes.\n\nTricount then tells you who should pay what to whom to balance the group.\n\nVery useful for any activity with friends and colleagues: holiday, city-trip, flat sharing & flatmates, week-ends, everyday lunch with colleagues, parties, etc. In your couple, you can create a tricount to know who has paid what this month, or on holiday.\nThe app exists for most mobile devices, and on the web! All currencies are accepted, even bitcoins if you want."

      "label": "Building wealth isn't as complicated as the \"experts\" say it is. It just comes down to investing early, consistently, and passively. \n\nMoka makes it easy to achieve financial freedom. Automate your savings and investing with Moka to build long-term wealth while crushing other money goals. With the industry’s lowest fees and growth-optimized portfolios, Moka can help maximize your returns and earn more over time. All you have to do is set up recurring deposits to invest every week, effortlessly.\n\nJoin the 500,000+ Canadians getting rich with Moka. Download the app to get started! \n\nFINANCIAL FREEDOM \nRather than trying to time the market or guess which stocks are going to win big, investing early, often, and consistently with a portfolio of index funds is a tried and true investment strategy. \n\nFor example, the S&P 500 is a benchmark index with an average return of 10% per year since inception that lists some of the world’s biggest companies. \n\nInvesting just $50/week over the last 40 years in the S&P would have turned into $1.2M.*\n\nPERSONALIZED INVESTMENTS MANAGED BY PROS\nWhatever you’re investing for, you can trust that your dedicated portfolio manager will select the perfect portfolio for you and manage your investments every step of the way. \n\nINVEST WITH IMPACT\nWhen you invest with Moka, you join Mogo's 1.8+ million members in using your money for good, and creating positive social impact just by building personal wealth. Amplify impact by choosing Moka's Socially Responsible Investment Fund.\n\nACCOUNTS THAT FIT YOUR GOALS\nCustomizing your financial goals starts with opening a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP), or a Personal Account. The choice is yours.\n\nPEACE OF MIND\nQuestions? Concerns? You can access your money or talk to a (real) human at any time.\n\nApple named Moka a “New App We Love” and the company has also been featured in The Globe & Mail, Financial Post, CBC, BNN, Global, and many more.\n\nQuotes provided here are unsolicited and unedited reproductions of actual reviews and comments made publically on third party websites and application stores. They may not represent the opinion of other individuals or investors.\n\n*All calculations are for illustrative purposes only and do not indicate the past or expected future performance of any Moka portfolios. These calculations assume a 10% gross return based on the S&P' 500s historical average annual return to illustrate the impact of investing early, consistently and the impact of fees. This assumed return is not indicative of either Moka or Mutual Funds past performance and is not meant as an expectation of future performance. The total investment figure for Moka factors a deduction of the 3.99$ monthly fee by reducing the weekly contribution amount by 1$. It also factors a deduction of 0.14% from the gross 10% rate due to the average weighted MERs of the underlying ETF funds contained in the Moka Equity Growth portfolio, based on the asset mix of these ETFs in the portfolio at May 31, 2022.  Where a total investment figure for Mutual Funds is shown, it factors a deduction of a 2% MER from the gross 10% rate based on the 2019 IFIC Report \"Monitoring Trends in Mutual Fund Cost of Ownership and Expense Ratios\". There is no amount deducted from the weekly deposit amount in this case.\n\nThe “S&P” and “S&P” 500 are registered trademarks of the Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC.\n\nMoka Financial Technologies Inc is a wholly owned subsidiary of Mogo Inc. and an affiliate of Mogo Finance Technology Inc.

The MogoCard is designed to help you spend less than you make while erasing your carbon footprint. Now anyone can get on the path to financial freedom while making a positive impact. \n\nGetting started takes less than 3 minutes and won’t impact your credit score. \n\n“BUY NOW, PAY NOW”\nThe MogoCard can help you avoid debt traps like credit cards and buy now pay later plans because it works like cash—you only ever spend what you load onto the card. \n\nCHANGE YOUR CARD, CHANGE THE WORLD\nThe MogoCard is the only card in Canada that can make it easy for Canadians to be climate positive just by using the card. It turns your day-to-day spending into climate action by planting a tree for each purchase you make. \n\nZERO YOUR CARBON FOOTPRINT\nEvery month, the average MogoCard user offsets nearly 2x the average Canadians monthly carbon footprint, for free. If just 25% of transactions in Canada were made with the MogoCard, Canada would be climate positive today.\n\nSTAY ON TOP OF YOUR SPENDING\nFor every transaction you make with the card, we’ll send you an instant balance alert so you can always stay on top of your spending. You’ll also see a monthly spending analysis in the app to help you budget better and make your money last longer. \n\nSTAY IN CONTROL\nIn a Mogo survey, 90% of users said the card helps give them better spending control, and users reported saving an average of $201 per month just by using the MogoCard for their daily spending. \n \nFREE CREDIT SCORE MONITORING\nThe MogoCard comes with free credit score monitoring so you can always stay on top of your financial health. Track your score in the app and learn helpful tips for levelling up your credit score. \n\nFREE IDENTITY FRAUD PROTECTION\nWe monitor your Equifax credit bureau daily and notify you of any hard credit checks, which can be a sign of attempted ID fraud. Other providers charge $240/year for this service.\n\nSpending less with the MogoCard is just one half of the formula for achieving financial freedom and a better world for all. The other half is investing consistently while making an impact. \n\nMoka is an automated investing app powered by Mogo, made to help you invest consistently. Or, if active trading is more your style, you can trade with impact using MogoTrade. \n\nBoth are available on the app store. \n\nGet the money app trusted by over 1.8 million Canadians. \n\n*The Mogo app is currently only available in Canada (excluding Quebec). Not all Mogo products and services are available in all provinces and territories. Download the app and visit mogo.ca to learn more. \n\nThe MogoTrade app is owned by Mogo Finance Technology Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Mogo Inc. Your investment account is opened with MogoTrade Inc., an order execution only broker registered with IIROC."

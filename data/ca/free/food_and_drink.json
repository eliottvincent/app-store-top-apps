Flashfood shows you nearby grocery stores with up to 50% savings on regular priced food nearing its best by date.\n\nWho should use Flashfood?\nPeople who buy groceries. That’s who. And people who love a great deal. And a great meal. Love the planet too? Flashfood’s for you.\n\nYou’ll find us on the east coast and across the Midwest with partners GIANT, Tops Friendly Markets, Family Fare, Giant Eagle, Martin’s, and Stop & Shop. Not yet in your area? Don’t worry, Flashfood is on the way!\n\nThe bargain hunt is on!\nOpen the app and you’ve got a bargain hunter’s treasure map of deliciousness. It’s easy to use. Super simple.

We’re glad you asked. \n• Download Flashfood and create an account.\n• Browse discounted groceries nearby.\n• Add items to your cart and purchase from your phone. \n• Zip over to the Flashfood Zone at your local store for quick pick-up.\n• Freeze, preserve or simply enjoy!\n\nNo coupons. No flyers. No food waste. \n\nWARNING: Upon finding your first amazing flash deal, spontaneous dancing for joy may occur.\n\nIt seems too good to be true, what’s the catch?\nThere’s no catch! Grocers are working hard to reduce waste. By partnering with Flashfood, they’re able to sell food nearing its best by date faster and more reliably because of our passionate Flashfoodies. For the grocer, that means reducing waste. For our shoppers, that means a steady stream of deals. A real win-win! To date, our 2 million plus users have helped get over 20 million pounds of delicious food to dinner tables—instead of landfills.\n\nThe biggest reason of all\nJust in case the sheer joy of a great meal at a killer price isn’t enough—shopping with Flashfood means you’re directly helping to reduce food waste in your community.\n\n30-40% of food in the US gets wasted and it’s the biggest category of material placed in municipal landfills in America. When good food gets sent to a landfill, it decomposes and emits methane gas—a greenhouse gas even more brutal than carbon dioxide. That’s why we’re here. Who knew service to the planet could also be delicious?\n\nNeed help? We’re here.\n\nReach out on live chat from the app or email us at support@flashfood.com. \n\n********\n\nTo learn more about how we reduce food waste, the cities we operate in, and our plans for the future, visit Flashood.com."

Simply select the type of meat, cut, and cook you want in the MEATER® app, then sit back and relax as perfect results are achieved.\n\n* For veteran chefs, fully customizable cooking and alert options are available to give you total control over your cooking experience.\n\n* Access your complete cooking history with ‘Previous Cooks’ so you can repeat your favorites whenever you want.\n\nCook smarter with MEATER®!

Whatever you’re in the mood for, find it in the App.\n\nNo sneaky fees (they leave a bad taste in our mouths.)\nWe love extras — extra shot of espresso, extra cheese, extra spicy — customize away. The exception? Extra fees. We never add service charges or other fees on your orders.\n\nBe the office hero.\nDoing a lunch or coffee run? Get your coworkers in on it.

      "label": "Found a recipe on the internet that looks great? Yum! Add it to Whisk and start creating your personal cookbook. Pull recipes from any website or cooking site/app, substitute ingredients, adjust serving sizes or, if you want to, just change the way the recipes are written. No need to continue memorizing the recipe edits or writing them down on paper.\r\n\r\nGet inspired! Check out our community of home cooks for new gourmet dishes, quick meals, recipes with 10 ingredients or less, everyday healthy ideas, you name it. Add all your go-to recipes to Whisk and create your own personal recipe book!\r\n\r\nWant to plan your weekly meals ahead? Unlike other meal planning apps, Whisk Meal Planner is entirely free.\r\n\r\n...And best of all: with the push of a button turn all recipes into a shareable shopping list to use to buy food in-store & online. No more “oops! I forgot” moments when cooking! Use Whisk to make cooking more efficient and fun!\r\n\r\nHere's What the Media is Saying About Us\r\n“(. . .) all designed to make it easier to meal plan, make and share lists and, finally, shop” - TechCrunch, Sarah Perez\r\n\r\n“Smart food platform Whisk helps you meal prep like a true pro (. . .).” – Women’s Health, Amanda Woerner\r\n\r\n“Not only does this technology allow for a much better experience, but should help reduce food waste” - Forbes, Tom Taulli\r\n\r\nBENEFITS\r\n- Copy recipes from anywhere: Yes, really, any website. Try it out. No need to take screenshots or copy and paste recipes into a notebook anymore. Transfer recipes directly from Food Network, BBC Good Food, food blogs, Pinterest and from all over the internet. Use the web recipe clipper on your PC or easily save recipes from any mobile site. Never forget where you saved that recipe again!\r\n\r\n- Edit recipes that you’ve imported: Add notes and comments about the things that you want to change and remember for next time. Maybe you want to sub in some healthy ingredients on that lasagna that you are cooking, or you want to add one more tablespoon of coconut oil to your new keto recipe….go ahead, replace ingredients and enhance your recipe cookbook.\r\n\r\n- Create your ideal meal plan for the week: an easy pork recipe for lunch on Monday, a healthy salad on Tuesday and a gourmet Italian dish for dinner on Friday.  Simplify your meal planning for the week, save time and avoid leftovers.\r\n\r\n- Remember what inspired you: Can't figure out where you saw that simple and tasty dish from Indian cuisine?  Quickly access your saved recipe collections: vegan dishes, gluten-free baking, paleo diets, low-carb meals - anything you like!\r\n\r\n-  Turn your recipes into shopping lists: Push a button and have your grocery list ready in case you make an unexpected stop at the store. Organize your list by aisle for speedy market visits and save time.\r\n\r\n- Get the groceries delivered to you: Whisk partners with popular online grocers like Walmart, Amazon Fresh, Kroger, Ralphs, Instacart and many more. Enter your zip code, select your preferred store, checkout and get your groceries delivered at your door.\r\n\r\n- Collaborate on and share your lists: Create a shared shopping list with everybody in your house to prevent buying duplicate groceries and to make sure that nothing is forgotten. Take the list to the store and save time as each family member takes a different aisle and - as items are picked - watch your grocery shopping list mark off in front of everyone’s eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd MORE!\r\n- Share recipes: Just made the perfect smoked paprika chicken? Share it with your friends and family.\r\n- Make it yours: customize your dietary preferences: vegetarian, vegan, lacto vegetarian, pescatarian.\r\n- Smarter food decisions: All recipes which have been imported to Whisk include ingredient details, cooking instructions, and Whisk’s health score, with nutritional information.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please email us at support@whisk.com. We want to make sure your Whisk experience is the best it can be!"

If you have an Apple Watch, record your runs as a workout and see your workout in the Health app. Display your tracks and replay your runs on the trail map. Email images to friends, post them to social media, or view them in Google Earth. Store your logs on iCloud and view them on all your devices. Send your logs to a leaderboard and compare vertical and distance with others at the resort.†\n\n• Find up-to-date information about the mountain, including snow conditions, weather, and webcam images.\n\n• Get up-to-the-minute lift status information.\n\n• Quickly find information about lessons and other programs and amenities.\n\n• Easily locate and contact key places at the resort and in the village with the built in directory.\n\n• Learn about events from the events calendar.\n\n• Get the latest news from Sunshine Village via the resort's Twitter feed and Facebook posts.\n\n† Location and Logging services require a GPS-equipped device.

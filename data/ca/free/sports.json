      "label": "CollX (pronounced “collects”) answers the question every collector has: “What’s it worth?” The app lets you scan any baseball, football, basketball, hockey, soccer, or wrestling card and instantly identify it and get the average market value. Once you’ve scanned your cards, add them to your collection and track your portfolio. Best of all, you can follow other users, message them, trade, buy and sell. \n\nCOLLX CARD SCANNER\t\nCollX’s visual search technology instantly recognizes and matches against a database of 17+ million sports cards. After identifying the best match, you’ll immediately get the current average market price for the card. Our deep-learning models were created by a team with 10+ years experience developing image recognition for everyone from The Home Depot to Tommy Hilfiger to SnipSnap. In addition to being able to match most RAW cards, CollX will also identify graded cards with barcodes, as well as parallel and reprint versions of cards. \n\nGET HISTORICAL PRICING \nCollX uses millions of historical auction prices to calculate a card’s average value. As you add cards to your collection, you’ll see your overall portfolio value grow. Set conditions or grades on your cards and get more accurate prices. As your cards rise or fall in value, CollX helps you track both individual card values and your overall portfolio value. \n\nBUILD YOUR COLLECTION\nCreate and keep track of your collection. View your collection as a grid, list, or as sets. You can also filter and sort your cards by a variety of criteria — value, date added, year, team, etc. \n\nSEARCH CARDS\nSearch 17+ million cards in our database. See what cards on CollX are listed for sale right in search results. And if you find a card you own, but don’t have it handy to scan, you can easily add it from any of the records in the CollX database.\n\nCONNECT WITH FRIENDS AND COLLECTORS\nConnect your address book and CollX will show you who you know on the app. Follow other users by searching for them on the app’s universal search function and selecting the Users tab. Invite your friends to join and find out what their cards are worth!"

      "label": "Control your heating products conveniently from your smartphone using the free app. Whether it be heat vests, socks, gloves, vests or soles - with the Lenz heat app, the heat setting of the lithium packs can be regulated quickly and without complications. Additionally, it provides an overview of the current charge level of all the lithium packs. This is perfect if the heating product is under several layers of clothes.\n\nAdvantages of the app:\n\nEACH LITHIUM PACK CAN BE CONTROLLED SEPARATELY\nEach of the connectible lithium packs can be set to a different heat level so you get just as much heat as you need everywhere. \n\nINTERVAL FUNCTION\nHeating and pause times can be set individually with the interval function, which extends the lithium packs’ lifetime. \n\nLED-OFF: \nIf the LEDs glow through a thin item of clothing, they can be deactivated. The heat output remains set as defined in the app.\n\nORDER FOR THE LITHIUM PACKS\nColoured rubber rings are delivered with the lithium packs. These help you to distinguish entire “battery pairs” from each other or to distinguish the batteries that are purposely to be used on the left and on the right. You can assign the colour of the rubber rings to the batteries in the app. \n\nLED SYSTEM:\nThe Lenz LED system 1.0 can also be controlled with the app. Different colours, lighting modes and brightness levels can be set.\n\nSmartphone requirements for running the Lenz heat app:\n- iOS 8.0 or above\n- Bluetooth 4.0 (SMART ready)"

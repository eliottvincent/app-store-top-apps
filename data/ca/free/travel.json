Simply fill out your profile and answer CBP’s questions – then go straight to the “Mobile Passport Control” lane at the airport. \n\nCBP Mobile Passport Control is a voluntary program which can be used by U.S. Citizens and Canadian citizen visitors at any of the supported airport and seaport locations found on our website: https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/mobile-passport-control \n\nCBP Mobile Passport Control can be used in 5 simple steps:\n1.) Eligible traveler(s) download the application and create a profile(s) using biographic information from their passport(s) and take a “selfie”; all eligible members in a family group can create a profile, submit their CBP form (up to 12 eligible members per trip), and store their information completely free to be used for future travel.\n2.) Upon landing, travelers select their method of travel, port of entry and terminal, answer CBP inspection related questions, certify the truthfulness and accuracy of their answers, and submit their profiles and responses to CBP.\n3.) Once submitted, CBP sends an encrypted Quick Response (QR) code back to the traveler’s device.\n4.) Travelers proceed to the MPC designated queue upon arrival and present their QR code to a CBP Officer along with their passport.  Please note: MPC does not replace your passport; your passport will need to be presented to the CBP Officer. \n5.) The CBP Officer will complete their inspection.\n\nMPC provides a more efficient, secure in-person inspection process for the CBP Officer and the traveler, and shortens overall entry wait times."

It is currently available to international air travellers who enter Canada at selected airports.\n\nBy submitting your customs and immigration information in advance, you will spend less time at a primary inspection kiosk (PIK) or eGate when you arrive at the airport. This contributes to shorter line-ups in arrivals halls.\n\nAt the border, you will be prompted to scan your travel document at a primary inspection device and confirm your identity. Once your identity has been confirmed, your Advance CBSA Declaration will be retrieved from ArriveCAN for you to review and certify. If changes are required, you can edit and update your declaration prior to certification.\n\nUse of the Advance CBSA Declaration feature of ArriveCAN is entirely optional.\n\nPlease refer to the accessibility notice for this app: https://www.canada.ca/en/border-services-agency/services/arrivecan.html#accessibility-notice\n\nThis app supports English, French and Spanish (as per your device’s language settings).\n\nFor more information: http://www.canada.ca/ArriveCAN"

The Green P Locator allows you to search for carparks by current location (GPS), location ID, address, or landmark. \n\nLook for the Location ID on the posted hour of operation signs on-street or on the Pay & Display machines, and on Mobile Pay signs throughout Green P carparks to determine its availability.\n\nFeatures List:\n• Pay for your on-street parking and all off-street, non-gated lots \n• Pay using your credit card, Apple Pay or PayPal Account\n• Keep tabs on your time with the parking session timer\n• Get a reminder 10 minutes before your parking session is about to expire\n• Extend your current parking session using your mobile phone\n• Search for carparks by current location (GPS)\n• Receive parking receipts straight to your inbox\n• View your parking transaction history\n\n\nYou can learn more about our exciting mobile parking program at http://mobilepay.greenp.com/ \n\nFor app support, email: mobilepay@greenp.com.

Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMost aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes. This specifically excludes activities that might endanger yourself or the lives of others. Under no circumstances will the developer of this app be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation or its use contrary to this agreement.\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.flightradar24.com/terms-and-conditions"

Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find a regularly updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link:\nhttps://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who travels - it doesn't matter whether you're on a boat, a plane, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries.

With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fiddly hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things simpler for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top-up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees.\n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device.

Problems scanning documents should be a thing of the past!\n\nWe have also expanded the range of benefits Canoo members can access to include sports, concerts, community activities, and exclusive deals from Canada’s leading brands. \n\nOur brand new design takes inspiration from the “trail blaze”: the painted lines that mark your path as you hike through the magnificent beauty of Canada. These lines always tell you where you are, where you’re going, and most importantly, when you have arrived at your destination. We hope that Canoo will be your trail blaze as you explore the country you’ve chosen to call home.\n\n \nCanoo provides newcomers with free VIP access to over 1,400 of our country’s most exciting cultural and outdoor experiences.\n\nFrom the Vancouver Art Gallery and the Nova Scotia Museum of Natural History, to Wood Buffalo National Park and the Royal Ontario Museum, Canoo gives you and up to four children unlimited free admission to the best places in Canada for one full year. This includes hundreds of national and provincial and other nature experiences..\n\nCanoo also gives you and up to four children a one-time discount of 50% off VIA Rail Canada travel anywhere across the country, and a one-time discount of 15% for domestic travel with Air Canada (maximum four tickets).\n \nAnd now Canoo offers you even more, including free and discounted tickets to musical performances, film festivals, classes and sports matches. There are also volunteering opportunities to help you build your networks and so much more!\n \nCanoo is a project of the Institute for Canadian Citizenship, an independent charity that works to unlock Canada for newcomers."

For example, a flight from New York to San Francisco might be $300, but a similar flight from New York to Seattle with a layover in San Francisco might be $200. If you’re going to San Francisco we’ll show you both flights, and if you choose the cheaper one, you get off the plane at the layover (San Francisco) rather than going to the final destination (Seattle).\n\nThis is perfectly legal and the savings can be significant, but if you’ve never traveled like this before, you should read our HIDDEN-CITY FAQ at http://skiplagged.com/faq\n\nWe’ll always show you all the options, so YOU can pick the deal you want!"

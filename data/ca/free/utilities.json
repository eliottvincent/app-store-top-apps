We know feeling safe and secure are foundational for enjoying your time online. Since version 1 in 2004, we’ve taken privacy seriously, because we’ve always been in the business of valuing people first, over everything. When you care more about people than profits, privacy naturally becomes a top priority.\n\nDIFFERENT DEVICES.  SAME TRAIN OF THOUGHT\nNow you can search for things on your laptop, then pick up the exact same search on your phone and vice versa. Your Firefox homepage displays the most recent searches you’ve done on other devices so you can easily get back to what you were doing or thinking about. \n\nLIMITED-EDITION WALLPAPERS\nIntroducing limited-edition wallpapers from independent creators. Stick with one you love or switch it up anytime to make Firefox match your mood. \n\n\nSTREAMLINED HOME SCREEN\nPick up right where you left off. See all your open tabs intuitively grouped and displayed along with your recent bookmarks, top sites and popular articles recommended by Pocket.\n\nPRIVACY CONTROL IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES\nFirefox gives you greater privacy protection while you’re on the web. By default, Firefox blocks trackers and scripts such as social media trackers, cross-site cookie trackers, cryptominers and fingerprinters. In addition to Apple’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention, setting Firefox’s Enhanced Tracking Protection to strict blocks tracking content in all windows. Also, you can easily choose to search in private browsing mode. And when you close private browsing mode, your browsing history and any cookies are automatically erased from your device.\n\nGET FIREFOX ON  ALL YOUR DEVICES\nAdd Firefox across your devices for secure, seamless browsing. In addition to synced tabs and searches, Firefox makes password management easy by remembering your passwords across devices.\n\nFIND IT FAST WITH FIREFOX’S SEARCH BAR\nGet search suggestions in the search bar and quickly access the sites you visit most. Type in your search question and get suggested and previously searched results across your favorite search engines.\n\nORGANIZE YOUR TABS THE WAY YOU LIKE\nCreate as many tabs as you like without losing track. Firefox displays your open tabs as thumbnails and numbered tabs, making it easy to find what you want quickly.\n\nSHARE ANYTHING IN A FEW TAPS\nThe Firefox web browser makes it easy to share links to web pages or specific items on a page with easy, quick access to your most recently used apps.\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT FIREFOX WEB BROWSER:\n- Read about Firefox permissions: http://mzl.la/Permissions\n- Learn more about what’s up at Mozilla: https://blog.mozilla.org\n\nABOUT MOZILLA\nMozilla exists to build the Internet as a public resource accessible to all because we believe open and free is better than closed and controlled. We build products like Firefox to promote choice and transparency and give people more control over their lives online.

      "label": "The DuckDuckGo app provides the most comprehensive online privacy protection with the push of a button. With one download, you get a new everyday browser that offers seamless protection while you search and browse, and even access to tracking protection for emails you receive.\n\nProtecting your privacy online is like protecting your home. Locking the front door won’t stop the most determined folks from getting inside, especially if you’ve left the back door and windows unlocked and an extra key under the doormat. That’s why we offer multiple types of privacy protection, most of which aren’t offered in most popular browsers by default.\n\nFEATURE HIGHLIGHTS\n• Search Privately by Default — DuckDuckGo Private Search comes built-in, so you can easily search the web without being tracked.\n\n• Escape Website Trackers Before They Load  — Automatically stop most hidden trackers (3rd-party scripts) from loading, which prevents companies from collecting and using (e.g. sale, ads, etc.) any data from these trackers. Our cutting-edge tracker blocking technology – called 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection – goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default.\n\n• Automatically Enforce Encryption — force many sites you visit to automatically use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection, which helps shield your data from Wi-Fi snoopers and network onlookers like your Internet provider. \n\n• Enable Built-in Email Protection — Over 85% of emails sent to Duck Addresses contained trackers that can detect when you’ve opened a message, where you were when you opened it, and what device you were using. Email Protection makes it easy to block most email trackers and hide your existing address when signing up for things online, all without switching email providers.\n\n• Escape Fingerprinting — help stop companies from creating a unique identifier for you by blocking their attempts to combine specific information about your browser and device settings.\n\n• Block Tracking Cookies — prevent most 3rd-party cookies from tracking you as you browse from site to site.\n\nWe also have many protections not available on most browsers including protection from link tracking, Google AMP tracking, and more.\n\nEVERYDAY PRIVACY CONTROLS\n• Tap Fire Button, Burn Data — Clear your tabs and browsing data with our Fire Button.\n\n• Signal Your Privacy Preference with Global Privacy Control (GPC) — built-into our app, GPC intends to help you express your opt-out rights automatically by telling websites not to sell or share your personal information. Whether it can be used to enforce your legal rights (for example, current or future CCPA, GDPR requirements) depends on the laws in your jurisdiction.\n\nNote about our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection following DuckDuckGo ad clicks: Our 3rd-Party Tracker Protection goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default, but we’re constantly working to make it more comprehensive. Currently, if an advertiser wants to detect conversions on their own website for our private DuckDuckGo search ads, our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection will not stop bat.bing.com requests from loading on the advertiser’s website following DuckDuckGo ad clicks, but those requests are stopped in all other contexts. This is because DuckDuckGo private search advertising is in partnership with Microsoft. As part of that partnership, viewing ads on DuckDuckGo is anonymous and Microsoft has committed to not profile our users’ ad clicks.\n\nRead more about this and our Tracking Protections at https://help.duckduckgo.com/privacy/web-tracking-protections/\n\nYou don't need to wait to take back your privacy. Join the millions of people using DuckDuckGo and protect many of your everyday online activities with one app. It's privacy, simplified. \n\nPrivacy Policy: https://duckduckgo.com/privacy/"

      "label": "Google Family Link is a parental controls app that helps you keep your family safer online. We know that every family’s relationship with technology is unique, so we designed tools like Family Link that give you the flexibility to choose the right balance for your family, and help them create healthy digital habits. Family Link’s easy to use tools allow you to understand how your child is spending time on their device, see their device location, manage privacy settings, and more.\n\n\nWith Family Link, you can:\n\nEstablish Digital Ground Rules\n• Set screen time limits — Family Link lets you set downtime for your child’s device and time limits for apps, so you can help them find a healthy balance.\n• Guide them to age-appropriate content — Approve or block apps your child wants to download. Family Link also allows you to choose the right YouTube experience for your child: a supervised experience on YouTube, or YouTube Kids.\n\nManage and secure your child’s account \n• Protect their privacy — Permissions management in Family Link allow you to make meaningful choices about your child’s data. View and manage permissions for websites and extensions accessed through Chrome as well as apps downloaded on your child’s device. \n• Secure their account — Family Link gives you access to manage your child's account and data settings. As a parent, you can help change or reset your child’s password if they forget it, edit their personal information or even delete their account if you feel necessary.\n\nStay connected on the go\n• See where they are — It’s helpful to be able to find your family when they’re on the go. With Family Link, you can locate your children on one map, as long as they’re carrying their device.\n• Get notifications and alerts — Family Link delivers critical notifications including when your child arrives or leaves a certain location.  You can also ring devices and view the device’s remaining battery life.\n\n\nImportant Information\n\n• Family Link’s tools vary depending on your child’s device. See a list of compatible devices at https://families.google/familylink/device-compatibility/\n• While Family Link helps you manage your child's purchases and downloads from Google Play, they will not need approval to install app updates (including updates that expand permissions), apps you have previously approved, or apps that have been shared in Family Library. In addition, purchase approvals will apply only when your child makes a purchase through Google Play’s billing system and will not apply to purchases made through alternate billing systems. Parents should regularly review their child’s installed apps and app permissions in Family Link.\n• You should carefully review the apps on your child’s supervised device and disable those you don’t want them to use. Note that you may not be able to disable some pre-installed apps such as Play, Google, etc.\n• To see the location of your child or teen’s device, the device must be powered on, recently active, and connected to the internet through data or wifi.\n• Family Link parental controls are only available for supervised Google accounts. With supervised Google Accounts, children get access to Google products like Search, Chrome, and Gmail, and parents can set up basic digital ground rules to supervise them.\n• While Family Link provides tools to manage your child’s online experience and keep them safer online, it does not make the internet safe. Family Link can not determine the content on the internet, but it can give parents the opportunity to make decisions about how their child spends time on their device, and determine what path to online safety looks best for your family."

      "label": "Burner’s got a new look! Not only that, but the features were improved to make life easier for you (we got you!).\n\nWe’ve rebranded & updated everything from the logo to the app interface, but we’re still the market-leading second phone number app that allows you to have multiple numbers for multiple reasons. \n\nWe arm you with the texting, calling, and organizational tools you need to manage the various aspects of your busy life. We’re a second phone number app, sure, but at our core we’re just trying to help you navigate this wild, weird world in the easiest, safest way possible.\n\nHOW BURNER WORKS\n \nBurner is the only app that provides you with total control over your communications boundaries by providing multiple phone numbers with settings for work, life, play, and more. However, it’s so much more than just a second phone number app for calling & texting. You’re able to do so much more than text now…\n\nBurner allows you to use your phone with unlimited anonymous numbers. This means that you can enjoy multiple phone numbers with unlimited calling, texting, and possibilities while keeping your personal number private.\n\nUse Burner to:\n\nMaintain your privacy & keep your number safe\nOrganize your social circles\nProtect your anonymity\nCommunicate freely with spam blocking & muting\nSet boundaries with do-not-disturb settings\nAttain inbox bliss with enhanced organizational features\nCall and text now with immediate, unlimited calling & texting\n\nPrivacy features abound, but we’ve also enhanced our organizational features so that you’re able to incorporate Burner into your everyday life, whether you’re a solopreneur, love online dating, or simply just need multiple numbers for multiple life passions. With Burner, you can set boundaries with spam call blocking, do-not-disturb settings, and more to ensure that you’re always in control of your communications.\n\nBurner is free to download and free to try. Get a free 7-day trial and a real second line to try with our enhanced privacy, spam-blocking, and communication features. Additional numbers are available through subscription, making it easy to add more lines whenever you need them.\n\nBEST IN CLASS\n\nWe’re not here to brag (okay, maybe a little), but we’ve been featured as a TIME Magazine Top 50 App and we’ve appeared in The New York Times, WIRED, TechCrunch, Engadget, and more. \n\nWhy do they all love us so much? You can download the app to see for yourself, but we’ve been recognized for excellence and innovation (and the fact that we offer real numbers, not fake phone numbers or second lines that only work for a week).\n\nBurner is the most reliable and fully featured virtual phone number app available, boasting premium calling & texting features that include blocking, muting, and do-not-disturb settings plus the ability to easily switch lines when needed. After all, life is complicated enough. Your phone doesn’t have to be.\n\nPLANS & PRICING\n\nBurner is a subscription-based app, offering you two simple ways to enjoy our anonymous phone numbers & all of the privacy, organizational, and spam-blocking features.\n\nANNUAL SUBSCRIPTION: $4.99/month (billed annually at $59.99/yr)\n\nMONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION: $9.99/month\n\nAll new users are able to enjoy a 7-day free trial. Subscribe and don’t love it? We doubt that, but if it happens, you can CANCEL ANYTIME.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION DETAILS\n\nSubscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be managed by the user by going to Account Settings after purchase.\n\nTHE FINE PRINT\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://burnerapp.com/privacy\nTerms of Use: https://burnerapp.com/terms-of-service\n\nIMPORTANT: Phone calls use cell phone minutes.

Only a presentation of the QR code allows the user to communicate their proof of vaccination to a third party.\n\nNo usage analytics are collected by VaxiCode.\n\nVaxiCode requires a weekly update, via the Internet, of the vaccine protection rules. The app asks for user consent before downloading new rules. The only communication with the Internet by VaxiCode takes place when checking the availability of these updates.\n\nVaxiCode requires at least an iPhone, or iPod touch on iOS 11 or newer. Access to the camera is required to read QR codes of proof of vaccination, or access to the phone's photo library to import the image of proof of vaccination."

But the benefit is considerable. No longer tethered to your laptop, you can move around the room while still holding in your hand an image of what’s on the screen behind you. No more of that weird over-the-shoulder karaoke move when checking to see where you are in the presentation.\"\n\nGo to your next PowerPoint presentation IN STYLE with i-Clickr Remote for iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch!\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Complete control of your PowerPoint presentation including animations.\n* Record your presentation (slides and your voice audio) into a movie as you present.\n* Share PDF version of the presentation with audience via E-Mail.\n* View your slides AND slide notes directly on your iOS device during your presentation.\n* Navigate through your slides with finger swipes and taps.\n* Grab your audience's attention with real-time annotations (Windows only).\n* Help you track your presentation time with onboard clock.\n* Set presentation alarm so that your iOS device will alert you with a silent buzz before your time runs out.\n* Pause and resume presentations.\n* Switch between multiple slideshow.\n* Work with both Windows and Mac Office (see below for the Office versions supported), iWork '09 Keynote on Mac, and OpenOffice on Windows.\n* Easy to set up with zero configuration.\n* No additional cost when using with multiple host computers.\n* NEW: Control presentation from your Apple Watch.\n* NEW: Control external laser pointer.\n\nRequirement:\n\n* On Windows, support all versions of Microsoft PowerPoint (the free Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer is not supported).  Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows (version XP or above) is required at the host PC. \n* On Mac OS X, Office Mac 2004 or above, or iWork '09 Keynote is required.\n* WiFi connection between the host computer and your device, or connection using direct ad hoc network and the iOS’s personal hotspot.  \n* Also support the FREE OpenOffice 3.1 on Windows.\n\nTo download software required at your host computer (that is, the PC/Mac that will run your PowerPoint presentation), visit http://www.senstic.com/iPhone/iClickr/Download.aspx\n\n*** If you have problem getting i-Clickr to work, please contact us at support@senstic.com, and we will help you fix the problem."

      "label": "Version 2.0 Available Now!!\nNow more handsomer, faster, and even more feature packed than ever (New Invoice Section*!).\n\nTimecard Pro is a multi-use app to keep track of your hours worked and your work schedule. It's great for freelance workers, employers to track their employees, or for anyone who wants to see a live view of how much money they're earning. The possibilities of utilizing the app are endless.\n\nSimply add your Job(s) or employees, and then clock in and out whenever needed. At the end of your pay period, you can export your timecards and email a report to your boss or client. Need to clock into multiple jobs, and have a different hourly rate for each? Not a problem, Timecard Pro can handle all of this, without breaking a sweat.\n\n----------------------------------------- \n\nWhat our users are saying: \n\n\"I love it...Life is easy now\" \n\n\"Top Notch, Solid, & Reliable...Click & Forget\" \n\n\"Design and Navigation Success!\" \n\n----------------------------------------- \n\n\nUniversal application: Purchase once, use on both your iPhone and iPad.\n\nFeatures: \n- Easy to use, intuitive interface. Simple, single touch \"Clock in/Clock Out\" dial for on-the-go time tracking.\n- Calendar section allows you to add your work shifts, with pop-up push reminders for when you work, as well as the ability to manually add timecards, and view all of the days you worked or have work scheduled. \n- Users:  Add unlimited users within the app, all with their own separate data. Protect each user data with a password lock.\n- Reports page lets you export multiple Pay Periods, regardless of job, all in the same email with Text, CSV, and PDF export options.\n- 2 Data Backup options, including Email Export, and a built-in 'Restore Data' section.\n- Main display shows money earned, clocked-in time, and how many hours you've worked.\n- Use the menu button on the homepage, to quickly select the job/employee you need to clock into.\n- Clock into multiple jobs/employees at the same time.\n- Icon badge indicator shows how many jobs you're currently clocked into without having to open the app.\n- Set up a different hourly rate for each job.\n- Calculate both daily and weekly overtime hours at the same time.\n- Remain clocked in, even if you turn your phone off! No need to keep the app open. \n- Manually add individual days that you’ve missed.\n- Manually edit timecards to change clocked in/out times, add notes, etc... \n- Add notes for each job or day, and include them in your exported timecard (setting turned on by default). \n- Change Currency Symbol for your specific region.\n- Passcode lock: require a passcode to access app.\n- Automatic 24hr mode detected.\n- Manually sync data between multiple devices, using the backup options. \n- 2 themes (Dark or Light). \n- Updated and optimized for iOS 9. \nAnd many MANY more features to come! \n\niPad version:\n- Completely designed for the iPad, in landscape mode.  With a split screen multi-task feature, you can constantly see the home page on the left to clock in/out of jobs as needed, while you navigate the rest of the app on the right side of the screen.\n\n*In-App Purchase:\n- Invoices:  Create invoices from pay periods, and manually add items (expenses, mileage, etc...).  A beautifully designed invoice will be created, in which a PDF version can be emailed, printed, saved to your Dropbox, or shared.\n\n\nNote to Employers: \nEmployers can add Employees under the \"Jobs\" page instead of entering job names. You can then use the menu from the Home Page to select your employee once they arrive at work, just like a 'job'. Each employee can be set up with a different hourly rate, having their own timecards, etc... \n\nWe love to hear your suggestions!! \nWithout your ideas, we can't shape this app into what YOU need. \nPlease email us at: support@eveleighstudios.com \n\n**Before leaving negative feedback, please contact us to see if we can help you with your concerns. Emails are typically responded within 24 hours."

I am self-employed so it was very difficult to track the sudden callouts and things that just come up on a daily basis. This makes it simple and fast. I think the simplicity is what makes it so perfect. - Shane Domo\n\n* Perfect app for tracking hours worked for different customers. Not overly complicated. Most useful app I have. - SeabeeChief\n\n* This app is very simple to use and powerful. Frederic is very quick to reply to any questions about support ... - Brendoniuis\n\n* It becomes second nature the moment you start using it. No need to learn how to use it as it's based on Apple's iOS ... -kgat03\n\niTimeClock is a simple application that will allow you to track the number of hours you work on a project. We built iTimeClock with usability in mind to allow you to quickly and accurately track how much time you invest in a project. \n\nWhether you are a contractor, a permanent employee required to track your time or simply want to track hours for personal projects, this is the application for you.\n\nInspired by Apple apps, iTimeClock's design is natural to use.

It is so easy to use that you can change default values and enter your time in as little as 2 taps! \n\nTrack your time using the today, week, month or history views. You can even filter by project to easily know how much of your time a project has taken in the past weeks. Furthermore, we have given you the ability to assign color tags to different projects to see in a glance which project you worked on in the past week.\n\nHere are the major features: \n\n- Edit, modify and add projects \n- Assign color tags to a project \n- Change the default values for the duration, break, start hour, scroll time interval... \n- Choose the first day of the week\n- Filter the hours worked by project \n- Track the number of hours worked on a project\n- Manage the time worked on a project by creating, editing and deleting tasks (use edit or swipe on a task to delete it) \n- See the total hours worked for the current day \n- See the total hours worked for the current week\n- See the total hours worked in a month view\n- Export data by email\n- Quick week export in a friendly format\n\nAnd we did all this in a simple and quick to use design...\n\nAll comments and reviews are welcome and we will gladly consider your suggestions in upcoming updates.\n\nPlease send your feedback to info.iTimeClock@gmail.com."

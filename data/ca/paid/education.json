      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "Open up the world-famous Peekaboo Barn, perfect for toddlers. \n\nInside the little bouncing barn, friendly farm animals are waiting to pop out and surprise your little one. Try and guess who they are; tap the doors to find out! More animals, animations, and sounds than ever.\n\nWork with your child to learn the names of animals and hear the sounds they make. Younger children will love opening the barn doors to find new animal animations, as they learn about cause and effect and become familiar with animal names and sounds. Older children will enjoy guessing animals by sound, then seeing the animal names, which helps develop early literacy skills.  \n\nMultiple Language Features:\n\nWe started with a child's voice in English. It's her real voice, which some kids really enjoy, but she does say \"wabbit\" and \"wooster.\" If this is a concern for you, you can switch to any of 12 adult voices; our adult narrators say everything clearly and perfectly, just like the teachers they are. You can try many languages from around the world—or record your own language, or grandma's voice. There are tons of ways to explore the languages of Peekaboo Barn!\n\nPress the Language button on the Options screen to try them out.\n\n—Choose from the built-in narrators: child's voice in young English; adult's voice in American English or Spanish.\n—World languages also included: Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, German, French, Australian, and UK English. \n—Record your own voice: We added this feature so parents, children, and visiting relatives and friends can capture their own voices and star in Peekaboo Barn.  Now you can record the animal names in your native language--or grandma's voice, or grandpa's--and, if you're recording a new language, you can save the appropriate written version too, and both will show up the next time you play. (Please note, we can only support the writing systems that are supported by your device.)\n\nFEATURED BY APPLE \nOne of the first apps to be released for toddlers, since 2008 Peekaboo Barn has been downloaded over a million times, and played over 100 million times worldwide.  It has been a top 20 educational game on the iTunes store nearly every day since its launch, and has been featured by Apple often.  It won The Best Toddler App Ever award in 2009, and was named one of the top 50 iPhone apps for kids by Babble.com in 2010 and 2011.  It is recommended by The New York Times, MSNBC, USA Today, Wired, Telegraph UK, Ireland’s The Independent, Parents Magazine, and the Washington Post.\n\nPeekaboo Barn was made for you and your toddler by artists and educators, not marketers, robots, or companies repackaging clip art. Our team has backgrounds in cognitive science and child development, and we’ve worked in educational media everywhere from Penguin USA to the Smithsonian Institution. When you could really use a safe distraction--in airports, restaurants, and waiting rooms--or you'd like to try something new with your little genius, Peekaboo Barn is the educational, artful solution. Enjoy! \n\nIf you are looking for more Peekaboo, check out our awesome cousins: Peekaboo Fridge, Peekaboo Forest, and Peekaboo Wild.\n\nIf your kids are ready for a more complex game with the same great characters, please try Peekaboo Barn Farm Day! Many activities to try: for example, you can milk the cow, shear the sheep and llama, and pet the animals to help them fall sleep.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/nightanddaystudios. \nTwitter: @nightdaystudios \nYour privacy is important to us!

Le joueur passe progressivement aux syllabes, aux rimes, aux mots courts et aux phrases et apprend peu à peu à décoder des mots plus longs. En jouant 15 minutes quotidiennement, l'enfant améliorera sa précision dans le décodage des lettres, des mots, et sa vitesse de lecture. \n\nLa plateforme GraphoGame est développée par une communauté de chercheurs et de développeurs de jeux leader en Finlande, tandis que le contenu francophone de « GraphoGame Français » a été développé par le Laboratoire de Psychologie Cognitive (CNRS) de l'Université d'Aix-Marseille.\n\nPour plus d’informations sur le contenu francophone, n’hésitez pas à vous rendre sur le site http://grapholearn.fr."

You can then see how you fare against your friends and other people around the world.\n\nGames included are as follows; arithmetic test, instrumental comprehension test, SDT tests, multitasking test, spatial awareness test, co-ordination tests, memory tests and a shadowing test.\nAll questions are always computer generated, therefore it is unlikely that the same problem will arise twice.\n\nEvery section comes with an instructions page, which includes a detailed explanation on how to solve each question. Furthermore, at the end of each game you can now review each incorrectly answered question; allowing you to see where you're going wrong.\n\nGood luck in the test!"

      "label": "Tap images. Type words. Speak. Proloquo2Go is an easy to use communication app for people who cannot speak or need help being understood. Featuring natural sounding voices, including real children’s voices, Proloquo2Go is a simple yet powerful AAC (augmentative and alternative communication) tool. The app is fully customizable and can be utilized to build language skills and grow with a person’s communication, supporting both beginning and advanced communicators.\n\nParents, therapists, teachers and users around the world recognize Proloquo2Go as the gold standard in AAC solutions. The app is used by people with autism, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, Angelman syndrome, and others with speech difficulties. The app is available in English, Spanish, French, and Dutch and supports bilingual use, so you can switch languages on the fly.\n\nProloquo2Go in action:\n\nLearn and grow\n\nStudies show that just 200-400 words make up 80% of what we say. Known as core words, they act as the basis of Proloquo2Go’s research-based Crescendo™ vocabulary. Users can grow from single words to full sentences in the same app. Crescendo puts core words in consistent locations for easy access and motor-planning. The vocabulary works with AAC best practices like modeling (where you use an AAC system to talk with the user) to develop language skills. Crescendo offers no limit on language development with a 10,000+ fringe word vocabulary and customizable vocabulary levels. Finally, with Progressive Language, words are gradually revealed step-by-step, helping users learn words and their location as their communication expands.\n\nEasy editing\n\nCustomizing Proloquo2Go is a breeze! Quickly and easily add new words. Use the app’s built-in library of 25,000 symbols or use your own photos by taking pictures within the app or selecting them from your photo library. For users with fine-motor challenges and vision impairments, Proloquo2Go offers options like 23 pre-programmed grid sizes and accessibility settings which support switch scanning and Apple’s VoiceOver screen reader. Everything from appearance to access is customizable so you can make it your own. \n\nType and speak\n\nBesides tapping images, Proloquo2Go also lets you type what you want to say. The app includes a Grid Keyboard arranged alphabetically for people learning to type. For more experienced typists, Proloquo2Go includes a Typing View with a QWERTY keyboard and word prediction that offers suggestions based on what you are typing. \n\nHello! ¡Hola! Bonjour! Hallo!\n\nProloquo2Go lets you select a language and region for the Crescendo vocabulary. Two languages can be used at the same time, allowing seamless bilingual speech. Over 100 included downloadable natural-sounding adult and children’s voices rounds out your choices to use the app your way.\n\nA helping hand\n\nAssistiveWare is here for you every step of the way. Help articles in Proloquo2Go are there whenever you need them. New to AAC? Our website has easy to understand articles in the Learn AAC section, and the AssistiveWare Core Word Classroom includes activities for teaching communication effectively. You can also connect directly with our community of parents, professionals, and users on our Facebook groups. If you have any questions, our support team is available 7 days a week and is always happy to help. All of these online resources can be accessed by going to the AssistiveWare website. \n\nNote: Discounts are available through Apple’s Educational Volume Purchase Program – 50% off on 20 licenses or more. Joan Bruno’s Gateway to Language & Learning© vocabulary is available as an in-app purchase (English only)."

With more than 60 000 sales, the Prep Kit is now the most popular way to prepare for the Learner’s test. The study cards are based on the Driver’s Handbook and have been reviewed by driving experts.  Developed by educational experts, the Prep Kits are based on sound learning theory.  Use the app to learn the rules of the road, and you will be on your way to becoming a safe driver.  \n\nWhy this format is the best way to learn the rules of the road. \n•The information is divided into bite-sized pieces. \n•You can clearly distinguish between what you do know and what you don’t know.  This way, you can focus on what you need to learn. \n•The app is divided into chapters to match the handbook.  \n•The graphics match the graphics in the handbook. \n•Most apps use a multiple choice format designed to test your knowledge; they are not a teaching tool. \n•Clear, driving related definitions make it a great tool for English language learners. \n•Video links provide more in-depth information."

For example:\n•\tPaint the Library\n•\tDecorate a cupcake\n•\tBuild your  own Go Kart\n•\tMake a taco!\n•\t…and more!\n\nPass GO and collect two Monopoly bills each time while you find out how much of the town is still available to buy!\n\nWhen all of the properties in Monopoly Town are owned, you win!

      "label": "Virtual MotivAider® is designed to help users of all ages make desired changes in their own behavior and habits. ​\n\nThis app is intended to replicate much of the functionality of the MotivAider®, an ingeniously simple dedicated electronic device invented by a clinical psychologist. Since 1987, the MotivAider® device has helped thousands of people in over 50 countries make a wide range of desired behavioral changes. \n\nLike the MotivAider® device, Virtual MotivAider® corrects for a largely overlooked glitch in the design of the human mind -- the lack of a dependable mechanism for keeping good intentions \"on the front burner\" of your mind. By repeatedly sending you signals or prompts that remind and urge you to act in accord with any chosen behavioral objective or goal, the app prevents your good intentions from getting lost in the shuffle.  \n\nTo use the app, you first devise a brief personal message – a word, phrase or image -- that serves as a trigger to remind and urge you to take a specific action required to achieve your goal. Next, you simply associate your personal message with the app’s signals or prompts, so that whenever you receive the prompt, you'll automatically think your personal message and be reminded and urged to take the \ndesired action. Then, you set the app to send you prompts – and therefore your personal message – as often as it takes to get the best possible results. \n\nBy design, Virtual MotivAider® is simple and straightforward. It has no bells and whistles to distract you from its singular purpose, which is to keep your attention focused on making whatever change in behavior you decide to make.\n\nVirtual MotivAider® lets you: \n• Choose the type(s) of prompts you’d like to receive – from a simple vibration signal (if your device is capable of vibration) and/or a sound (you can even record your personal message in your own voice) and/or a text notification with your personal message. \n• Get prompts as often as you want – from as often as once every few seconds to as seldom as once a day. \n• Choose whether to get prompts at Regular intervals (for example, once every 5 minutes), at Average intervals (for example, from 15 minutes to one hour apart with an Average of 30 minutes apart), or even at Random intervals (for example, at random intervals that are no less than 10 seconds apart and no more than 10 minutes apart).   \n• Choose how long to have prompting continue before stopping automatically. \n• Pause and resume prompting whenever you want. \n• Create and save multiple behavior change projects. (To achieve the best results, however, we recommend that you work on only one project at a time). \n• Access the same free habit change resources that help users of the dedicated MotivAider® device achieve great results."

      "label": "Bloups permet d’apprendre à lire dans le plaisir… Application entièrement conçue par une orthopédagogue. \n\nDescription du contenu pédagogique de Bloups : (choix de l’accent: français, québécois ou belge) \n\n1) Lecture de syllabes : niveaux de difficulté progressifs \n- syllabes simples (ex. : la, ma, ar, etc.) \n- syllabes comportant des sons simples (ex. : lou, lin, leu, etc.) \n- syllabes comportant des sons complexes (ex. : rouille, rein, gue, etc.) \n- syllabes comportant des confusions visuelles (ex. : bo, do, po) et des confusions auditives (ex. :di, ti) \n\n2) Lecture de mots : \n- mots simples (ex. : rire, tomate, etc.) \n- mots complexes (ex. : combien, explication, etc.) \n- mots irréguliers (ex. : femme, monsieur, etc.) \n\n3) Chronomètre (optionnel) : \n- permet au joueur (qui le souhaite) de toujours améliorer son propre temps en lecture \n\n4) Repère visuel structurant (fiole d’énergie) : \n- indique au joueur le nombre d’items réussis et le nombre d’items restants \n\nParents et pédagogues s’intéressent à cette application éducative, car elle s’adresse aux lecteurs débutants et intermédiaires. Elle est aussi recommandée aux jeunes ayant des difficultés ou des troubles en lecture (ex.: dyslexie d’assemblage, autisme, etc.). \n\nÉtant réalisée par une orthopédagogue, la progression de chaque niveau respecte les étapes d’apprentissage de la lecture syllabique. De ce fait, Bloups représente un défi juste, raisonnable et motivant qui tient compte de la progression propre à chaque enfant. Le focus est porté essentiellement sur la lecture de syllabes; condition essentielle à une bonne rapidité et une bonne justesse en lecture de mots et de phrases. En effet, la lecture de pseudo-mots (ex.: remu, lumiron, bratoir, etc.) oblige l’élève à lire, à décoder correctement chaque syllabe, il ne peut donc pas “deviner” le mot par une lecture globale. Pour être un bon lecteur, il faut, entre autres, maîtriser les deux voix de lecture, c’est-à-dire, la lecture syllabique et la lecture globale. Bloups représente donc une application pour apprendre à lire efficacement. \n\n\nLe contenu pédagogique de cette application favorise essentiellement l’augmentation de la vitesse de lecture, la précision du décodage, l’apprentissage de la fusion phonémique et l’apprentissage de la segmentation de différentes structures syllabiques. Il contribue aussi à l’automatisation de la lecture de sons composés (ex. : ou, on, in, en, an) et de sons complexes (ex. : g, c, aille, ouille, etc). Enfin, la lecture de mots simples, complexes et irréguliers incluse dans Bloups permet au joueur de faire le pont entre la lecture de syllabes et la lecture de mots réels. \n\nBut du jeu : \nLe joueur doit écouter la syllabe, la structure syllabique ou le mot donné oralement pour ensuite repérer la bonne réponse parmi les bulles proposées par les monstres. Après 5 succès, le joueur obtient une page de jeu de 5 secondes et après 20 succès (fiole toute remplie), le joueur est mené vers la découverte d’un nouveau monstre où la complexité de la lecture de syllabes est légèrement plus complexe. Pour l’apprenant, le but est d’amasser le plus de monstres possible et d’améliorer son propre temps s’il reprend un monstre ! Apprendre à bien lire devient alors monstrueusement amusant ! \n\nVariante : \nIl est possible pour l’adulte de déverrouiller préalablement tous les monstres d’une même ligne afin de proposer seulement un monstre précis à l’enfant en fonction de ses besoins particuliers. Par exemple, l’adulte aura déverrouillé les monstres 31 et 32 pour que l’enfant n’ait qu’à faire le monstre 33 travaillant les confusions spatiales et visuelles b, d, p, q."

      "label": "360 Thinking Time Tracker (™Pending)\n\nThe 360 Thinking™ Get Ready*Do*Done Timer is an instructional timer app specifically designed for supporting students’ executive function skill development. It is based on the innovative clinical model of executive functioning skills known as 360 Thinking™.  By using the app, students will have the opportunity to nurture their situational awareness, develop forethought of an end result, and organize resource materials, time and actions to complete a future task. \n\nThe 360 Thinking™ Get Ready*Do*Done Timer is user friendly and works on simple methodology. The app allows its users to create a time marker to get ready for work, a time marker to check in during the work, and a marker when the work is planned to end.  There are tones activated when the time reaches each marker:\n•\tThere is a single tone to indicate time to get ready, \n•\tThere are two tones to indicate that the user is at the midpoint of the work\n•\tThere are three ascending tones to indicate that the user is at the stop point of the work.  \n•\tAs time passes the primary color becomes more luminous to show that time has passed.\n\nThe timer app allows the user to look back and assess the productivity of the time they have spent so far!  In fact, with the help of the app, the users can compare the planned vs. actual use of time. A table displays to the left of the clock interface to show the user the original plan for ready comparison.\n\nTrivia\nThe color indication of the 360 Thinking™ Get Ready*Do*Done Timer app has made the entire user experience easy to manage:\n•\tThe yellow color represents slowing down to get ready to start a task, \n•\tThe green color represents going ahead and doing the steps to complete a task. The split green time marker at the midpoint provides a visual reminder to break and check the status of the work,\n•\tThe red color indicates that it is time to stop the task because it is done."

The animations inside Speech Tutor take the areas of the face that impede the view of tongue placement and positioning and make them transparent.   Now one can literally see inside the mouth as the sounds are being made! \n\nSpeech Tutor offers a “Side View” and a “Front View” of each sound production, both of which can be viewed at 3 different speeds (slow, medium, fast).  The movies can also be paused any given point.   With 132 animations in all, Speech Tutor is sure to offer a helpful view and speed for anyone in need.\n\nSpeech Tutor does not stop there though.  Non SLPs can begin the application by reading an easy to understand “Basics” tutorial which provides the reader with a solid foundation of the basic knowledge needed to know before attempting to improve any/all English consonants.  Also provided is detailed text specific to each sound that further describes how each sound is technically made, tips provided by licensed speech and language pathologists, and milestones for when each sound should be acquired and mastered.  Along with viewing the animations, one can also view a “Palate” diagram to further demonstrate where on the palate the tongue should be placed.\n\nLast but not least, users of the application can choose to record themselves as they practice their target sounds and then choose to play it before and after a correctly modeled production.\n\nAnimations for the following sounds are provided:\nP, B, T, D, K, G, N, M, ING, F, V, S, Z, SH, CH, J, L, R (retroflex and bunched), TH (voiced and voiceless) and 4 new vowel animations - /i/, /u/, /a/ and /æ/"

Test material is expertly organized into categories based on subject matter and includes, questions, answers, correct answers, and detailed explanations. \n\n• STUDY QUESTIONS BY TOPIC • \n\nLearning Mode allows you to create custom review sessions by selecting exactly which categories you want to review. Each session randomly generates the question order, and provides instant feedback based on your answer selection. Each question also provides a detailed description as to why each answer is right or wrong. These explanations were developed by Sporty’s team of Master CFI’s, based on their experience preparing students for the Private Pilot certificate\n\n• REVIEW QUESTION FLASHCARDS •\n\nFlashcard mode tests your knowledge by allowing you to only see the question without the answer choices. After answering the question mentally, you can then select to show the correct answer, and self-grade your progress along the way. This is a great feature that keeps you from being distracted by incorrect answers!\n\n• TAKE PRACTICE TESTS •\n\nTest mode randomly generates a 60-question session from the entire database of published FAA test questions, simulating the real Private Pilot test. After answering all the questions, you’ll be given instant results, and have the option to review either all the questions, or just missed questions. Included in the review session are the same detailed explanations for why each answer is right or wrong.\n\n•PROGRESS REPORTS•\n\nAfter completing each test your results are saved in the app's Progress Report section, where you can review previous scores and and a detailed history of each question and answer selection. You can also pause a partially-completed session, and resume it at a later time here."

      "label": "Little Monkey Apps subitizing provides beginning counters the opportunity to practice and test their subitizing knowledge to quickly recognize small groups of objects without counting.\nWhen you look at a die, you don’t need to count the dots. This immediate response is called subitizing. Young students need repetition and practice to do this, as they do not always ‘trust the count’. \nStudents can then build on this knowledge of standard patterns (die patterns) to look at non-standard patterns, mentally and visually manipulating the position of the objects and subitise the objects present. \n\nSubitizing  provides opportunities for students to ‘trust the count’ which links to early addition and subtraction, counting on and counting back. Subitizing allows students to see and interpret patterns and part-whole relationships such as 2+1+2=5 on a die. \n\nLittle Monkey Apps subitizing is designed to be used with an adult, peer work or for independent learning for short periods of time. The App is presented in sections to provide a variety of experiences. \n\n= Flash card = \nFlash cards with non-standard positioning of images up to twelve. Double click screen to show matching numeral. Swipe to move onto next card.\n\n= Dice =\nFlash cards with standard presentation of die dots. Swipe to move onto next card.\n\n= Doubles Dice =\nFlash cards with standard presentation of dice dots on two dice. This is useful to extend subitizing into addition facts. Swipe to move onto next card.\n\n= Ten frames = \nFlashcards with standard and non-standard presentation of dots in a ten frame. Double click screen to show matching numeral. Swipe to move onto the next card.\n\n= Number Match = \nA simple Game in which you are asked to click the numeral to match the group of images presented.\n\n= Teacher Tool = \nCreate your own subitizing card then use the pencil tool to show groups or move the position of objects.

The best way to learn a new language is through immersion and repetition. This is where Solfeggio was born. After giving the children an easy to learn and fun to play game, their understanding and recognition of the notes grew exponentially. I soon came to realize that this app had the potential to help all budding piano players, young and not so young, to learn to read notes and gain confidence in their playing. \n\nUnlike other music apps, Solfeggio is using a smart algorithm. It keeps count of correct and incorrect answers and as the player progresses, the notes or key signature that are harder for the player to remember repeat more often. Solfeggio helps players to push past their weak points and become proficient in all areas of music reading."

      "label": "Spend less time studying and more time flying! This is the FAA Airline Transport Pilot (ATP Part 121, ATP Part 135, and Helicopter) and Aircraft Dispatcher (ADX) version of GroundSchool, our FAA knowledge (written) test preparation featuring up-to-date questions, free updates, and illustrated explanations written by a professional team of pilot examiners and instructors.\n\nGroundSchool is fully compatible with FAA ACS (Airman Certification Standards) and our editorial team is working to keep it so as ACS continues to evolve.\n\nDon't be fooled by imitators! Competing apps here in the AppStore use only the limited set of questions that the FAA publicly releases via its website - that is not enough to adequately prepare you for your test! Our GroundSchool app, on the other hand, features a much more comprehensive database (typically about 2-4 times the size of the demo FAA public one) of actual and current FAA questions that you likely can and will be asked on the actual test! This along with our detailed, professional explanations and easy to use interface are major reasons why pilots have come to trust GroundSchool. \n\nStudy actual, up-to-date FAA questions and then ACE your FAA ATP written test the easy way with GroundSchool FAA Knowledge Test Preparation software by Dauntless Aviation, the trusted leader in FAA written test preparation.\n\nFeatures:\n\n    * Actual FAA Questions Current and Valid for Right Now.  As soon as you install the software, use the 'update' feature and the software will connect to our servers, grab the latest questions, images, figures, and explanation content, and you'll be good to go.  \n    * Detailed Explanations written by an experienced editorial team of examiner and instructor pilots.\n    * All Charts and Figures Included\n    * Several flexible study modes - fits the way you want to study!\n    * Compatible with all FAA \"ground school\" classroom-based courses\n\nThis ATP/ADX version of GroundSchool will prepare you for any or all of the following tests:\n\n* ATP - Airline Transport Pilot Airplane (Part 121)\n* ATA - Airline Transport Pilot Airplane (135)\n* ATH - Airline Transport Pilot Helicopter (135)\n* ADX - Aircraft Dispatcher\n* ARA - Airline Transport Pilot Airplane (135) (added rating)\n* ARH - Airline Transport Pilot Helicopter (135) (added rating)\n* Canadian Airline Transport Pilot to USA FAA Conversion\n\nWith Dauntless Aviation's GroundSchool, you don't need to worry:\n\n* Our material is UP TO DATE.  No matter what date is listed here in regarding the 'Release date', this date refers to the program itself only.  Once you get the program on your device, use the built-in update feature and it will connect to our servers and download the latest and greatest version of the test prep content and our explanations that we have available.   To learn more about this, please visit our website.\n* We pride ourselves on the quality of our explanations.  This is not some idle boast - our explanations are more detailed and more illustrated than that of ANY other FAA knowledge test provider, period.   \n* Tens of thousands of people have used our products to prepare for their FAA knowledge tests.  Ours is a system that works.\n\nATP 121 or 135?\nSome airplane pilots are not sure whether they should take the Part 121 or the Part 135 tests.  In short, from the FAA's perspective, it doesn't matter - study for the one that is most interesting to you and perhaps the one that you envision as most relevant to your future career.  for a more detailed description of this, please see our website. \n\nRemember, this software allows you to study both 121 and 135 and jump between them (and the other ATP tests) as you'd like with no restrictions.\n\n\nGood luck on your test!"

      "label": "Fact Fluency: Mastering Multiplication is a unique math app for kids in 1st through 4th grade. Through animated tutorials, meaningful visuals and engaging, interactive games, kids will master the multiplication facts, one set at a time. They will learn how multiplication relates to addition, the real world and other multiplication facts.\n____________________________\n\n** Received a 5 Star review from the Educational App Store.com\n https://www.educationalappstore.com/app/fact-fluency\n____________________________\n\nKids begin by working through learning paths for the multiplication facts in an order that makes sense: x2, x10/x5, x4, x3, x6, x9, x7 and then x8.\n\nIn the x2 set, they begin by seeing multiplication as equal groups. They then practice skip counting and repeated addition to see how skills they already know relate to multiplication. They then move on to x10 and x5, since these are typically the easier facts for kids to master. This module helps them to build confidence as they learn multiplication. This module uses place value, dimes and nickels to help kids build on math that is already familiar and build a strong foundation. They will also see how the x5 facts relate to the x10 facts, again, building fact fluency.\n\nSubsequent modules weave in additional skills related to multiplication, while still only focusing on one set of facts at a time. As kids progress through each path, they will learn the commutative property of multiplication, learn how to break apart area models to solve problems, use number lines and hundred chart to solve and use number bonds to visualize fact families and see how multiplication relates to division. \n\nThroughout the modules, kids will also practice finding the missing factor, further strengthening their understanding of multiplication, adding an additional challenge and paving the way to learn and master the multiplication facts.  \n\nAfter successfully completing all 8 multiplication fact modules, they can use the 1- and 2-player review games to review a mixture of all facts. These simple games provide the repetition and practice kids need to solidify the facts using engaging games rather than flash cards or rote memorization.\n\nBy using powerful visuals and meaningful strategies to learn the facts and build comprehension, your kids will be on their way to fact fluency and mastering the multiplication facts from 2-10!\n\nMultiplication strategies\n\n2nd grade math\n\n3rd grade math\n\n4th grade math\n\n5th grade math\n\nMultiplication fact families"

      "label": "Hops are the spice in your beer and shrouded in mystery (described by Pliny and Hildegard von Bingen). In distant times hops were even controlled by monks and kings!\n\nThis application answers many of the hoppy thoughts I have had as a master brewer, and many of the hoppy questions I have received over the last 20 years. \n\nI have divided this application into 7 keys. These keys cover topics for you as a brewer, to consider when dosing hops in whatever form you have decided to use. You can gain information about hops on the web or in brewery books and this application should be used as an addition to this depicting new figures and ideas. I have included a key covering links which I find useful and which you can’t easily discover under time constraints in your busy day. \n\nConsiderations, awareness and attention must be made when using different hop products and hop varieties as well as the time of addition. In order to maintain the quality of bitterness you should not only pay attention to the hop variety, crop year, hop oil content, hop product used, α-acid content but also a new ratio of hard resin to α-acid as well as time of addition. The new hop classification index, the “Eiken Hop Classification Index”, is proposed which I hope you will find intriguing.\n\nPlease be aware that this is not the only factor causing bitterness. Other factors like the grist composition, salt composition (e.g. the Chloride/Sulphate balance), yeast strain, volatiles and usage of processing aids are also very important to take into consideration. \n\nBy choosing a specific hop variety, or a blend of hop varieties, you control the desired aroma of the beer – such as earthiness, pine needles, elderflower, strawberry, passion fruit, garlic or grapefruit – and the desired type of bitterness. By choosing a specific hop variety you also decide how the bitterness is perceived by, and felt, on the tongue. Is it for instance, smooth, harsh, astringent, metallic, rounded, or lingering?  \n\nTake a look at this application and your feedback is welcome on: BrewersHops@gmail.com \n\nEnjoy your day and your hops.\nJens Eiken"

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

The world of science just got a little bit weirder and a lot more fun with Toca Lab: Plants!\n\nJust like with the first app in the Toca Lab Series, Toca Lab: Elements, your curiosity will lead the way. Choose your plant, then visit five different locations in the lab:\n\n● Grow light: Shine the light on your plant and watch what happens! Does your plant bask and happily sigh in the light, or groan and wriggle away? What happens when you turn the light up a notch or two?\n\n● Watering tank: Put your plant in the tank and fill it up with water. Will your plant float? How does your plant behave when it’s soaking wet?\n\n● Nutrition station: What’s the optimal diet for your plant? Try the three different nutrition formulas and discover which ones your plant character likes!\n\n● Cloning machine: Spin the wheel on the cloning machine and before you know it, you’ll have five little versions of your plant. Wonder what the clones can do? Experiment and find out!\n\n● Crossbreeding apparatus: Here you can mix two plants to create something unexpected. Try it and see what happens!\n\nHave fun experimenting at each station to see how the plants evolve. Keep experimenting until you’ve collected all 35 plant characters in the app. Once you’ve collected a plant, keep experimenting to continue to evolve it! Who says kids can’t be scientists? Toca Lab: Plants brings out the budding botanist in everybody!\n\nFEATURES\n- Start with one plant and experiment your way to 35 different plant characters, each with its own unique personality!\n- Continue to evolve existing plants through experimentation!\n- Evolve plants with five lab tools: grow light, watering tank, nutrition station, cloning machine and the crossbreeding apparatus.\n- Discover plants from five groups: green algae, mosses, ferns, trees and flowering plants.\n- Learn the names and Latin names of real-life plants!\n\n--\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

      "label": "Team Shake provides a technological and environmentally friendly way to choose teams for board games, sporting events, tournaments, school projects or anytime groups are required. The newest release brings many new features including full iPad support, balancing teams based on skill or gender, importing users from a file, enabling video output, and sharing teams via facebook or email. \n\nTeam Shake is the premier iOS App for creating teams. Instead of a hat and scraps of paper, the user enters his friends' names in his iPhone and gives it a shake. The screen will then display a random set of color-coded teams. These teams can immediately be used for game play or shared via facebook or email.   The quick and easy selection of random (or balanced) teams eliminates fighting over who will be on which team. Innovative use of the iPhone shake gesture gives users the satisfying feeling of shaking a virtual hat without the trouble of carrying around an actual hat. Conventional buttons can also be used for those who would rather not shake their expensive hardware about.  \n\nThe app is designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind. Names can easily be entered with the onscreen keyboard, chosen from the user's contacts, or imported from a file. The email and facebook functions document the members of each individual team as well as preserving the team number and color assigned by the app. For repeated use of Team Shake, lists of friends can be easily saved and loaded later. The current list is also automatically saved so that if you exit the app, or even reboot the device, changes will not be lost. For teachers and others with large lists of people, Team Shake supports the ability to import teams from text or csv files.\n\nIf you have any problems, feature requests, or comments please send an email to support@rhine-o.com. \n\nFeatures:\n\n* Create 1 to 64 random teams\n* Create completely random or balanced teams\n* Full iPad support\n* Eliminates fighting over choosing teams\n* Share / Save teams via email or Facebook\n* Teams can be chosen by the number of teams or by the size of teams.\n* Save lists of friends for later games\n* Import lists from email or spreadsheet\n* Export lists and options for use on another device\n* Satisfying feeling of shaking a “virtual” hat to create teams\n* Animated shaking hat\n* Entry of names via onscreen keyboard\n* Entry of names via iPhone contacts\n* Temporarily disable people who are absent\n* Set groups of people to always be on the same team\n* Set groups of people to always be on different teams\n* Set user strength to make more even teams (now supports fully balanced teams)\n* 5 users strengths level\n* Pick a single random person from the list of players\n* User strength indicator on the main screen (can be disabled in options)\n* Number of active players and total players is now displayed on the main screen\n* Video Out Support\n* Option to Sort Teams by Name\n* Option to balance male / female team members\n* \"Equal Ability\" option to create teams where all players have the same strength\n* Option to create separate male and female teams\n* Configurable Team Colors\n* Configurable Team Names\n* Print Support\n* Export Teams in CSV or XLS Format\n* Team Shake now supports simultaneously assigning players to multiple subteams and / or oppose teams at the same time.\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now have customized names to make selection easier\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now be enabled or disabled globally so that teams can be made quickly without subteams / oppose teams.  In particular, Balance Teams Strengths will work when separate Male / Female teams are created.\n\nYappler-Tags: Teams, Groups, Random, Hat, Entertainment, Games, Utilities"

Ce jeu aide l’enfant à apprendre les sons des lettres et des groupes de lettres en présentant simultanément les sons (ou mots) correspondant et les groupes de lettres.\n\nLa progression du jeu est basée sur des données scientifiques : le logiciel été développé par des linguistes, des neuropsychologues et des orthophonistes pour aider les enfants - en particulier les lecteurs en difficulté - à renforcer les automatismes fondamentaux de la lecture.\n\n« GraphoGame – Français » accompagne l’enfant à travers différents jeux avec son propre personnage qu’il fait évoluer au cours du jeu. Le joueur passe progressivement aux syllabes, aux rimes, aux mots courts et aux phrases et apprend peu à peu à décoder des mots plus longs. En jouant 15 minutes quotidiennement, l'enfant améliorera sa précision dans le décodage des lettres, des mots, et sa vitesse de lecture. \n\nLa plateforme GraphoGame est développée par une communauté de chercheurs et de développeurs de jeux leader en Finlande, tandis que le contenu francophone de « GraphoGame Français » a été développé par le Laboratoire de Psychologie Cognitive (CNRS) de l'Université d'Aix-Marseille.\n\nPour plus d’informations sur le contenu francophone, n’hésitez pas à vous rendre sur le site http://grapholearn.fr."

(Please set your iPhone to Ring mode to hear the audio playback.)\n・Fun illustrations help users to better retain the words studied. \n・Users can bookmark the words they like. The bookmarked words are compiled in the Bookmark list in \"List.\"\n\n◇ “Check” helps learners to track their mastery.\n・Users check their understanding of the vocabulary studied and sort the words into those mastered and those not yet retained.\n・The words already mastered are taken out of the study set, leaving behind just those that still need to be worked on.\n\n◇ “List” displays a list of all words covered by the app so that users can see their progress and review the vocabulary.\n・The list can be arranged in any of three orderings: lesson order, a-i-u-e-o order, and alphabetical order. The words bookmarked in the Study mode are also listed in the Bookmark list.\n・Checkmarks are automatically placed next to words that have been mastered.\n・The Study view of words can be displayed from the list entries, enabling quick review.\n\n\n○This app is based on the vocabulary from the third edition of GENKI.\n○Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside.

Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

      "label": "Bloups permet d’apprendre à lire dans le plaisir… Application entièrement conçue par une orthopédagogue. \n\nDescription du contenu pédagogique de Bloups : (choix de l’accent: français, québécois ou belge) \n\n1) Lecture de syllabes : niveaux de difficulté progressifs \n- syllabes simples (ex. : la, ma, ar, etc.) \n- syllabes comportant des sons simples (ex. : lou, lin, leu, etc.) \n- syllabes comportant des sons complexes (ex. : rouille, rein, gue, etc.) \n- syllabes comportant des confusions visuelles (ex. : bo, do, po) et des confusions auditives (ex. :di, ti) \n\n2) Lecture de mots : \n- mots simples (ex. : rire, tomate, etc.) \n- mots complexes (ex. : combien, explication, etc.) \n- mots irréguliers (ex. : femme, monsieur, etc.) \n\n3) Chronomètre (optionnel) : \n- permet au joueur (qui le souhaite) de toujours améliorer son propre temps en lecture \n\n4) Repère visuel structurant (fiole d’énergie) : \n- indique au joueur le nombre d’items réussis et le nombre d’items restants \n\nParents et pédagogues s’intéressent à cette application éducative, car elle s’adresse aux lecteurs débutants et intermédiaires. Elle est aussi recommandée aux jeunes ayant des difficultés ou des troubles en lecture (ex.: dyslexie d’assemblage, autisme, etc.). \n\nÉtant réalisée par une orthopédagogue, la progression de chaque niveau respecte les étapes d’apprentissage de la lecture syllabique. De ce fait, Bloups représente un défi juste, raisonnable et motivant qui tient compte de la progression propre à chaque enfant. Le focus est porté essentiellement sur la lecture de syllabes; condition essentielle à une bonne rapidité et une bonne justesse en lecture de mots et de phrases. En effet, la lecture de pseudo-mots (ex.: remu, lumiron, bratoir, etc.) oblige l’élève à lire, à décoder correctement chaque syllabe, il ne peut donc pas “deviner” le mot par une lecture globale. Pour être un bon lecteur, il faut, entre autres, maîtriser les deux voix de lecture, c’est-à-dire, la lecture syllabique et la lecture globale. Bloups représente donc une application pour apprendre à lire efficacement. \n\n\nLe contenu pédagogique de cette application favorise essentiellement l’augmentation de la vitesse de lecture, la précision du décodage, l’apprentissage de la fusion phonémique et l’apprentissage de la segmentation de différentes structures syllabiques. Il contribue aussi à l’automatisation de la lecture de sons composés (ex. : ou, on, in, en, an) et de sons complexes (ex. : g, c, aille, ouille, etc). Enfin, la lecture de mots simples, complexes et irréguliers incluse dans Bloups permet au joueur de faire le pont entre la lecture de syllabes et la lecture de mots réels. \n\nBut du jeu : \nLe joueur doit écouter la syllabe, la structure syllabique ou le mot donné oralement pour ensuite repérer la bonne réponse parmi les bulles proposées par les monstres. Après 5 succès, le joueur obtient une page de jeu de 5 secondes et après 20 succès (fiole toute remplie), le joueur est mené vers la découverte d’un nouveau monstre où la complexité de la lecture de syllabes est légèrement plus complexe. Pour l’apprenant, le but est d’amasser le plus de monstres possible et d’améliorer son propre temps s’il reprend un monstre ! Apprendre à bien lire devient alors monstrueusement amusant ! \n\nVariante : \nIl est possible pour l’adulte de déverrouiller préalablement tous les monstres d’une même ligne afin de proposer seulement un monstre précis à l’enfant en fonction de ses besoins particuliers. Par exemple, l’adulte aura déverrouillé les monstres 31 et 32 pour que l’enfant n’ait qu’à faire le monstre 33 travaillant les confusions spatiales et visuelles b, d, p, q."

      "label": "Даже если ваш ребенок только начинает учиться читать и первый раз видит буквы. Или если ваш ребенок знает буквы и перед вами стоит задача объяснить ему, как их превратить в слова. Или у вас уже почти читающий дошкольник, которому надо подтянуть и закрепить навык. Во всех этих случаях вам подойдет ЧИТАНИЯ.\n\nПотому что это увлекательное путешествие героев по волшебной стране, с приключениями и миссией – спасти ее от злого волшебника. А справится с ним сможет тот, кто умеет читать!Ребенку интересно играть и проживать эту историю. Вместе с вовлекающим сюжетом в приложение встроен весь необходимый для освоения чтения материал. Начиная от букв до чтения фраз – все есть в ЧИТАНИИ.\n \nЗа время игры ребенок увидит, услышит и напишет:\n● более 500 иллюстрированных и озвученных слов \n● прочитает и отгадает 65 загадок\n● прочитает 68 поговорок\n● сыграет в 35 игр, развивающих различные навыки чтения \n● пройдет 30 тематических экранов долины Слов с разными уровнями сложности\n● начертит буквы 330 и более раз (печатный и прописной вариант)\n\nВы уже пробовали учить ребенка читать? Если да, тогда вы знаете, как это трудно. Ребенок путает буквы и звуки. Не может прочитать слово, хотя знает буквы, не может прочитать фразу, не понимает смысла.Теряет интерес...\nДля усвоения нужна тренировка. Именно этим занимается ваш ребенок в ЧИТАНИИ. Каждая из 35 мини-игр доводит нужный навык до автоматизма, а интересный сюжет способствует тому, что ребенок снова и снова возвращается в ЧИТАНИЮ и играет на новых, более сложных уровнях.\n\nВ ЧИТАНИИ 5 локаций – буквы, письмо, склады и «автоматизация чтения» – беглое чтение слов, фраз. Информация подана всеми возможными для восприятия способами – визуальным, аудиальным, игровым. Ребенок запоминает увиденное, развивает внимательность и наблюдательность. Улучшает речь за счет развития фонематического слуха и складового написания слов.\n\nОдна из трудностей у детей, когда они учатся читать – слияние букв в слова. Это объяснено в приложении анимацией и игрой. \n\nВ ЧИТАНИИ используется складовая методика обучения чтению (кубики Зайцева). Ее особенность в том, что ребенок быстро начинает читать, запоминая структурные единицы слов – склады. Чтение по складам отрабатывается в ЧИТАНИИ в локации «город Складов»\n\nПосле того, как ребенок освоил буквы и склады, важно как можно больше читать. Практика важна каждый день. В ЧИТАНИИ ребенок читает постоянно, начиная с простых слов. Постепенно сложность увеличивается, но ребенок прочтет все 500 слов, распределенных по темам и заданиям. Кроме обязательного материала, для прочтения в игре доступно более 3000 слов.\n\nЧИТАНИЯ – игра длительного прохождения. Обычно путь ребенка к вершине чтения и победе над злым волшебником занимает от месяца до года. У каждого ребенка свой путь и время. Не торопите события, лучше понаблюдайте, как он проходит игру. Порадуйтесь его успехам!\n\nУникальный обучающий алгоритм ЧИТАНИИ анализирует успехи ребенка, подбирает подходящий уровень заданий и игр. Поэтому, хотя оптимальный возраст для игры 4-6 лет, многие задания будут по силам даже трехлетнему малышу, который только начинает учиться читать, и заинтересуют семилетнего, кому надо подтянуть чтение перед школой. Для продвинутого уровня в настройках можно открыть сразу все разделы игры.\n \nПриложение без встроенных покупок, рекламы и не требует постоянного подключения к Интернету.\n \n● ЧИТАНИЯ - победитель Всероссийского конкурса «Позитивный контент» 2018 г. в номинации «лучшее мобильное приложение»,\n● По заключению Роскачества, ЧИТАНИЯ — лучшая образовательная игра, которая учит чтению, среди всех исследованных приложений на платформе iOS\n● №1 в обзоре SE7EN «5 лучших приложений из App Store для обучения дошкольника чтению»,\n● вошла в топ лучших iOS приложений, публикуемый журналом Лайфхакер.\n\nПрошла пора, когда ребенка надо было заставлять учиться читать. Когда вы придумывали, как же заинтересовать его. \nЧИТАНИЯ увлечет вашего ребенка сказочным сюжетом и научит его читать так, что он полюбит чтение. Попробуйте!"

      "label": "* Finalist for the BestAppEver Award: Toddler Apps *\n \nThe best-selling reading game for kids has gotten even better! We've added more words, more languages, and phonics. First Words Deluxe provides endless fun for the toddlers in your life, all while giving your child a head start on learning their letters and learning to spell words.\n\nNow with Spanish, French, German, Japanese, plus US and UK English.\n\nFirst Words Deluxe is toddler-tested and approved, with a user-interface designed specifically for the littlest of fingers.  The game includes over 150 words in five kid-friendly categories:\n\n** Animals **\n** Vehicles **\n** Colors **\n** Shapes **\n** Words from around the house **\n\n(Fewer words are shown when the phonics option is selected, because many English words are not spelled phonetically.  A total of 68 phonics words are included.)\n\nA wide range of options let you tune the game to match your child's current skills and abilities.\n\nIf your child is old enough to ask for your phone, they're old enough for First Words Deluxe!\n\nHere's what educators and reviewers have said about our First Words apps: \n\n“First Words is an app that teaches letters and words in fun and interactive way. Very easy to use these apps will help support your little ones learning with great illustrations and bright colors. Each app supports kids learning and encourages kids to explore and discover by revealing, rewarding and teaching.” \n-- Fun Educational Apps \n\n“Excellent - As a teacher, I love this game! Just what technology was meant to do!” \n-- iTunes Review \n\n“This app has great settings that let you control the level of difficulty for the child – either with lots of hints or almost none at all. The letters slide nicely into each word and when completed the child is rewarded by having the pictured animal enlarge and animate briefly.” \n--Carisa Kluver at Digital Stortyime \n\n“First Words Deluxe is a very straightforward word-building game. Words are either said letter by letter as they are dragged into the appropriate gray boxes or, if chosen in the settings, a smaller set of words can be sounded out with phonics. This makes this game a treat for both pre-readers and early spellers.” \n--Common Sense Media \n\n“Looking to guide your toddler towards recognizing letters and how to spell words up to eight letters long? Then First Words Deluxe might be just what you are looking for. This pre-reader and spelling application encourages vocabulary development in a wide range of categories such as: vehicles, animals, at home, colors, and shapes.” \n--Andrea Gardner at Applicable2u \n\n\"First Words is a great app -- as I said at the time, 'Leo loves First Words because it's fun and easy. I love it because he's learning to spell words, and the interface makes that learning error-free.'\" \n---Shannon Des Roches Rosa at Squidalicious \n\n*** We love getting feedback from our users.

The activities are specially designed for kids age 2-6.  New characters, sprite animations, music, and sound effects all add up to a fun and engaging experience for toddlers and preschool-aged children.\n\nDexteria Jr.'s  unique hand and finger activities take full advantage of the iPad's multi-touch interface to help build strength, control, and dexterity. \n\nFor best results the exercises should be done on a regular basis in short sessions. The exercises are designed to be repeatable and engaging.\n\nThe automatic tracking and reporting feature makes it easy for parents, teachers and occupational therapists to identify time on task and progress. You can email the progress reports right from the app itself. \n\nMulti-user tracking is available as an in-app purchase. (Note to Volume Purchase Program customers: Consider buying Dexteria Jr. VPP instead. It includes multi-user tracking and you will pay a lower net cost than if you buy Dexteria Jr. and upgrade each copy via the in-app purchase. Just search \"Dexteria Jr. VPP\" in the app store.) \n\n• Increases coordination and motor control in the hands and fingers \n\n• Easy to use\n\n• Great way to get kids ready for kindergarten\n\n• Fun graphics, music, and sound effects\n\n• \"Quiet time\" mode turns off music and/or sound effects\n\n• Automatically creates performance and usage reports that can be emailed \n\n• Designed in consultation with Occupational Therapists \n\n• Less expensive and more reusable than workbooks\n\n• Multi-user reporting available via in-app purchase (iPad version only)\n\nWe're serious about your privacy. This app does not track or share your personal information with us or anyone else.  Images are not saved unless you manually save them. There is no user id tracking software, and no advertisements.  \n\nATTENTION LICENSED OTs: Thank you for all the great feedback and suggestions!

All the vehicles are charmingly but accurately depicted, with little surprises such as opening doors and horns which sound.\n\nIt is really easy to make vehicles move by touching or tipping the screen. Your child will also be able to do things such as extend the arm of the crane or operate the dumper by simple touches. Each vehicle comes with an involving little mission to complete, such as moving toys around, which will help your child discover what each kind of construction vehicle can do. This exploration will be great for fine motor skills, and success at each stage will be made clear by the award of another gold star.\n\nCharacteristics\n▸ Simple easy-to-understand interface\n▸ Fun to play again and again\n▸ An unusual and interesting way to learn about different vehicles\n▸ Exciting and realistic vehicle sound effects\n▸ Colorful attention-grabbing backgrounds for all episodes\n\nThe list of vehicles:\n▸ Dump truck\n▸ Dumper\n▸ Tractor\n▸ Grader\n▸ Crawler-mounted excavator\n▸ Telescopic handler\n▸ Loader\n▸ Crane\n=========================================\nDon’t miss out more interesting Apps, follow news on www.thematica.info"

It offers specific tools to better understand our self and connect with others. iGrok includes the full NVC model/process of “honesty and empathy” with emphasis on empathy—to be fully present with yourself and the other person in the moment. Empathy affects and influences the quality of connection, invites further dialogue, and prepares us for creative solutions.\n\nEmpathetic listening, using the NVC model, consists of listening for the person’s feelings and needs and what they are requesting to make their life more wonderful. This application includes a scrolling list of 128 feelings words and 118 needs words to support you in making an empathetic connection along with examples demonstrating how to structure sentences when offering empathy, sharing honesty, or practicing self-empathy.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAlso developed by Christine King and Jean Morrison communicateforlife.com\n• GROK (15 games and ways to use 2 card decks of feelings and needs words) \n• Magnetic GROK (180 feelings and needs magnets for metal surfaces)\n• Communication FUNdamentals (Illustrated NVC primer)\n• GROKit!

As the difficulty level increases, one attribute is removed, until they reach Expert mode where they must solve problems based on size only.  Each level can be played as many times as they like, resulting in wide age range appeal and endless fun. Bonus dots provide some fun surprises along the way.\n\nOur favorite comment during kid testing was from an 8 year old who was staring at the game screen, with her finger poised over the play field.  When asked what she was doing, she said “I’m planning my next set of moves.” We could see the wheels turning, and it was very gratifying to see that an app with such simple interactivity could make for engaging cognitive challenges.

      "label": "The latest question pools are always available for download! Finally an offline-enabled mobile app with all of the features from HamStudy.org! Use this app to study for your US Amateur Radio License -- our question pools are always up to date and always have the current question pools because the app can download updates from the website whenever you are connected to the internet.\n\nDesigned and written by hams with volunteer examiner experience and Sponsored by Icom, this is not your typical study app -- most study apps will focus on practice exams, which is somewhat like studying for your math test by throwing darts at your textbook. Though HamStudy is not a full instructional tool our app is focussed on providing you with the tools you need to study the parts of the question pool that you most need to see.\n\nOur intelligent Study Mode tracks your progress as you move through the pool, providing you with full statistics on what you've seen and giving you the visibility into where you need to study. It will automatically repeat questions as needed. When you don't understand something you can tap the \"explain\" button to view an explanation of the question. Practice Exams make it easy to see how close you are to passing and see what areas to focus on in Study Mode.\n\nShare your progress with your friends or instructor and study together!\n\n* Study *all* current US Amateur Radio question pools (Technician, General, Amateur Extra) -- updates can be downloaded for free when they become available. Additional pools, such as the FCC commercial pools and the Canadian pools, are also available for download in the app. \n\n* This app is not a study guide, it is a directed study tool centered around the questions; there are explanations contributed by users for most pools which do help in learning, but some users may want to pair the app with a study manual to get the most out of both.\n\n* HamStudy's revolutionary Study Modes work with you to ensure you learn the questions; they automatically track your progress and adjust the pace to keep you challenged but not frustrated. User-submitted explanations help you avoid the pitfall of just memorizing answers. Synchronize with your online HamStudy.org account to prevent data loss and be able to switch devices easily.\n\n* Share your progress with other HamStudy.org users and help each other keep progressing towards that next license exam!"

However with the geographical spread and the logistics  involved, this teaching practice has evolved to become limited to parents teaching their children or resorting to paper versions of Qaidas. Where both methods are an alternative to guided teaching, the audio talafuz/tajweed is compromised the most. \n\nTo fill that 'void' and using the portability, reach, multimedia capabilities and wide acceptability of the iPad, 'Qaida Noorania' is an 'app' for that!\n\nThis Qaida Noorania application features include:\n\n• Bilingual recitation in Urdu / Arabic (zabar,zeer,pesh / fatheh,kasra,dumah)\n• 17 lessons (basic - advance) indexed\n• 1078 text buttons (individual letters - aggregated words)\n• Bookmark individual button\n• Flick and pinch gestures\n• Tongue Visuals for alphabets in Lesson 1\n• Practice mode for Lesson 1\n• Help screens"

      "label": "Simply the best interactive, most complete, self contained dictionary and translator between English and Ancient Egyptian! \n\nThis app explains what the ancient symbols mean, how they were pronounced and how they formed words and phrases. \n\nThe App contains 2229 hieroglyphic signs and almost 49,000 words, phrases, titles, epithets, and locations used in Ancient Egypt. The dictionary also contains the Horus, Birth, and Throne names of all the known Pharaohs and Queens of Egypt. Our dictionary has more than twice the content of any other smartphone translation apps.\n\nHieroglyphics Pro has several modes: \n    Beginner, Student and Pro. \nBeginner mode uses a minimal set of 200 glyphs and an easy pronunciation guide. \nStudent mode allows choice of over 700 glyphs, organized by shape, and standard transliteration. \nThe Pro mode uses all 1,071 glyphs in Gardiner's classic categories with over 1200 additional New Kingdom and later signs.  \n\nA unique feature of Hieroglyphics Pro is the ability to find glyphs by how often they are used in inscriptions. Adding the common signs to a phrase or word is a snap! Egyptian words and phrases are drawn graphically in groups, in the artistic style of the ancient inscriptions.\n\nThe App now offers 4 ways to enter Hieroglyphs for translation:  \n    •Graphically from Gardiner groupings, or in Beginner Mode, Manley's Groupings\n      - A unique feature allows finding glyphs sorted by their frequency of use!\n    •Direct keyboard text entry of Gardiner codes (i.e., A1, D21, Aa2) and phonetic shortcuts as defined by the MdC (i.e., Htp, nTr,  r, etc.)\n    •By transliteration symbol from the MdC table\n    •Searching for keywords in a glyph's description or determinative words\n\n    Text entries of Gardiner Codes and MdC can now be edited with a cursor and finger swiping, just like other text editing apps!\n\nVery quick and convenient! \n\nHieroglyph Pro is the first and only mobile App to introduce Hieratic glyphs, and how they evolved over the centuries.\n\nHieroglyphics Pro is a modern iOS 16 App, back compatible to iOS 13, Dark Mode and all. It contains help files and links to both on-line references and to printed books for advanced study.\n\nHieroglyphics Pro has been developed and evolved in consultation with professional Egyptologists."

Instructor applicants will find this App an indispensable tool in both planning for what to expect during the airplane checkride, and mastering the subject matter. Instructors rate them as excellent preparation for students, as well as general refresher material.\n\nThis Flight Instructor Checkride app is based on the popular Flight Instructor Oral Exam Guide book by Michael Hayes. It is designed for instructor applicants training for the Certified Flight Instructor (CFI) Certificate. Nearly 600 questions and responses ensure all the subjects a Flight Instructor candidate will be tested on during checkrides and review flights are covered. Topics include: fundamentals of instructing, flight instructor responsibilities, technical subject areas (such as runway incursion avoidance, scanning, navigation, logbook entries and certificate endorsements, etc.),  takeoffs and climbs, fundamentals of flight, slow flight, stalls and spins, basic instrument maneuvers, performance maneuvers, ground reference maneuvers, approaches and landings, emergency operations, and scenario-based training. Answers and explanations were researched using FAA documents (which are identified so pilots know where to go for further study) as well as interviewing FAA examiners. Questions can be marked for further study from any subject to build your own collection of flashcards. An Applicant Practical Test Checklist and Advisory Circular (AC) 61-65H (Certification: Pilots, and Flight and Ground Instructors) are also included.\n\nCompatible with iOS phones and tablets, this app teaches applicants not only what to expect, but also how to exhibit subject mastery and confidence when under the examiner’s scrutiny. It identifies candidates’ strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in their aeronautical knowledge, which increases study efficiency.\nApp features:\n• Nearly 600 questions are included with succinct, ready responses.\n• Questions from any subject can be flagged for further study into a separate group.\n• Includes all the questions and answers from the popular book, Flight Instructor Oral Exam Guide by Michael Hayes.\n• Brought to you by a trusted resource in aviation training and publishing, Aviation Supplies & Academics (ASA)."

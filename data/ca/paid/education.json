      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

The world of science just got a little bit weirder and a lot more fun with Toca Lab: Plants!\n\nJust like with the first app in the Toca Lab Series, Toca Lab: Elements, your curiosity will lead the way. Choose your plant, then visit five different locations in the lab:\n\n● Grow light: Shine the light on your plant and watch what happens! Does your plant bask and happily sigh in the light, or groan and wriggle away? What happens when you turn the light up a notch or two?\n\n● Watering tank: Put your plant in the tank and fill it up with water. Will your plant float? How does your plant behave when it’s soaking wet?\n\n● Nutrition station: What’s the optimal diet for your plant? Try the three different nutrition formulas and discover which ones your plant character likes!\n\n● Cloning machine: Spin the wheel on the cloning machine and before you know it, you’ll have five little versions of your plant. Wonder what the clones can do? Experiment and find out!\n\n● Crossbreeding apparatus: Here you can mix two plants to create something unexpected. Try it and see what happens!\n\nHave fun experimenting at each station to see how the plants evolve. Keep experimenting until you’ve collected all 35 plant characters in the app. Once you’ve collected a plant, keep experimenting to continue to evolve it! Who says kids can’t be scientists? Toca Lab: Plants brings out the budding botanist in everybody!\n\nFEATURES\n- Start with one plant and experiment your way to 35 different plant characters, each with its own unique personality!\n- Continue to evolve existing plants through experimentation!\n- Evolve plants with five lab tools: grow light, watering tank, nutrition station, cloning machine and the crossbreeding apparatus.\n- Discover plants from five groups: green algae, mosses, ferns, trees and flowering plants.\n- Learn the names and Latin names of real-life plants!\n\n--\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

      "label": "\"Fun for the kids and great for learning to read.  Everyone wins.\" - Jen, Kindergarten teacher and mom of three.\n\nI have a confession to make.  My son's favorite game was Fruit Ninja and I was getting increasingly frustrated with having my son waste a lot of time on a fun but mindless game while he was still struggling to learn how to read.\n\nSo I decided to create yet another slicing game with three letter words to help my son learn to read while playing his favorite game.\n\nMy sons skills in recognizing three letter words have dramatically improved since he started playing this game and now I no longer have to feel guilty when I need a five minute break to take care of the laundry or prepare lunch for the kids.  I know that they are having fun and that they are learning at the same time.\n\nWarning: Your child will keep begging for your iPhone or iPad after they try this app.\n\nReading Ninja is an exciting educational game that helps kids rapidly learn to read three letter words by sight, sound, and touch.\n\nThe interface is so easy to use that even a toddler will delight in using this app.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n• Slice your way through all 150 three letter words\n\n• You decide what three letter words to focus on - turn individual categories ON or OFF from the settings page\n\n• Learn by sight, sound, and touch\n\n• Fun game play, sounds, and animations keep kids engaged\n\n• Dynamic game play adjusts difficulty (the number of three letter words) automatically based on player skills to keep kids both challenged and entertained vs. getting bored\n\n• Supports 3 difficulty settings: EASY, MEDIUM, or HARD\n\nEASY MODE:\n- Max 1 three letter word\n- Three letter words move very slowly\n- Great for introducing sight words one at a time\n\nMEDIUM MODE:\n- Starts with 1 three letter word\n- Max of 3 words on screen\n- Three letter words move 30% faster\n\nHARD MODE:\n- Starts with 2 three letter words\n- Max of 5 words on screen\n- Words move even faster\n- Words rotate faster too\n\nAdjust difficulty from settings page.\n\n• Wrong answers do not interfere with gameplay, the child can immediately try again and slice the correct answer (most other games are too slow to keep kids interested by interrupting the gameplay and slowly repeating the desired question)\n\n• Play Reading Ninja from A to Z or in random order (adjustable from settings page)\n\n• Multi-sensory learning tool - combining audio, voice, and touch\n\n• Want to work on just a few three letter words?  No problem… head to the settings page to turn entire categories or individual words on and off\n\n• Want to record your own audios? No problem.  Just click on the category and record your own sound for all three letter words\n\n• Supports three levels of difficulty\n\nHEROIC SUPPORT\n\nHeroic Support is not just what we do.  It's really what makes us, well, us.  It's that drive to make a difference in your life - no matter how big or small.  Really, it's our way of life because we want you to be our customer for a lifetime of fun and learning.\n\nHave questions?  We are here to help.  Email us at support@alligatorapps.com"

      "label": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers.

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

Thinkrolls is an award-winning logic puzzle game that helps young kids develop reasoning and problem solving skills through a delightful and engaging gameplay. Get it now and let your little geniuses amaze you with their mental abilities and logic skills! \n________________________________\n\n** Featured 'Best New App' on the App Store's Home Page in more than 70 countries **\n** Ranked #2 in US App Store, Education category **\n\n• Parents’ Choice Award Winner\n• Named one of the \"10 Top Kids Apps of 2014\" by USA Today!\n• \"Adorable physics platformer creates little problem-solvers.\" - Top Pick by Common Sense Media\n• \"Thinkrolls has actually become a family affair...I enthusiastically recommend it.\" - 148 Apps\n• \"Another smash hit by these ingenious and award winning developers.\" - Teachers With Apps\n• Editors' Choice by Children's Technology Review & Tech With Kids\n________________________________\n\nTHE MISSION\n\nHave a blast navigating your Thinkrolls through a series of obstacles in brightly patterned mazes. The goal is to solve the puzzles and roll through the end of the maze where a new Thinkroll waits to be unlocked and lead the next quest! \n\nHOW TO PLAY\n\nThe app offers 207 clever puzzle levels filled with fun science concepts. Seven playful elements with unique physical properties are gradually introduced. Kids will discover through hands-on manipulation how to use these objects to their advantage and clear a path. \n\n• Cookies • Munch them to clear a path or resist those treats to avoid getting trapped!\n\n• Crates • Push them to fill gaps or stack them to reach higher ground.\n\n• Balloons • Burst them on spikes to get them out of your way.\n\n• Rocks • Get a crash course in Newtonian physics by dropping heavy, dense boulders to break through cracked ground. \n\n• Jelly • Bounce Thinkrolls and objects on springy jellies to launch them up.\n\n• Fire • Use ice blocks to put out the fire and safely pass through. \n\n• Elevators • Timing is added to the mix! Synchronize movements of two different elevators to navigate through the maze.\n\nMASTER THE ART OF THINKING\n\nLittle players will master the art of thinking while using to their advantage force, acceleration, buoyancy, heat, elasticity and gravity to reach the end of the maze. The puzzles gradually build upon successive science lessons to strengthen observation, creative thinking, logic, problem solving, spatial cognition and memory.\n\nThere are unlimited tries and no penalties.

      "label": "• Featured by Apple \"Fun new way to learn math\"\n• Children's Technology Review Editors' Choice Award\n• \"Highly Recommended\" - Teachers with Apps\n\nA fun, unique, and innovative approach to math instruction for children ages 5 to 12! \n\nSANDBOX\nThanks to its Sandbox allowing users to create and interact with mathematical expressions freely, the application helps kids to learn and understand:\n\n • What are addition and subtraction, visually showing them \"how it works\"\n • What do we mean by an equality and an inequality\n • What are math symbols ( +, -, =, >,<)\n • How to manipulate terms of math expressions and equations (like isolating a variable or moving a number)\n\nEXERCISES\nWith hundreds of built-in exercises, children can practice mental arithmetic and learn the rules of algebra. You can even create new exercises yourself!\n\nVIRTUAL MANIPULATIVES\nMathematics education organizations strongly advocate the use of manipulatives. They believe manipulatives allow students to actively construct their own understanding of math. Math Wizard is a new generation of virtual manipulatives which allows kids to explore math concepts.\n\nENGAGING FOR KIDS\nWe took special care to make the app fun and engaging so that children love manipulating the different terms of mathematical expressions!\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE \nMany settings are available to adapt the application to the child's level, including:\n\n • Numbers can be displayed using digits or beads that visually show the amount that numbers represent \n • Voice can be enabled to read numbers and operations aloud\n • Numbers available in the sandbox can be customized (the app handles positive and negative integers - up to 10 billion!)\n • Choose to allow inequality or force equality\n • Animation Speed\n\nYou can add as many users as you want, and view the activity history of each user\n\n-------------\nACTIVITIES\n-------------\n\n  Sandbox \n\nThe sandbox is an open-ended activity that allows users to experiment freely with algebra rules. You can add the numbers you want, and thus create and interact with any expressions or equations you want. \n\nFor parents and educators, it's a tool to show what are addition,  subtraction, equality and inequality. It also shows users how they can manipulate terms. For students, it's a tool to experiment with numbers in order to better understand \"how it works.\"\n\n  Exercises \n\nThe app contains hundreds of built-in exercises (additions, subtraction, equality, inequality, isolate a variable, brain teaser), but you can also create your own exercises!\n\nThe goal of each exercise is to reproduce an expression or equation (e.g., \"3\", \"4=4\", or \"x=3\") starting from another expression or equation (e.g., \"1+2\", \"2+2=3+1\", \"-1+x=2\"). This requires the child to interact with the numbers and operators in order to build their understanding of how algebra works (again, the child can only do what is permitted by algebra)\n\n---------------\n\nFEATURES\n\n  • Positive and negative integer numbers (up to 10 billion!)\n  • \"x\" variable \n  • Expressions with + and - operators\n  • Equality and inequality\n  • Division by 2\n  • Undo/redo operations and manipulations\n  • Unlimited number of users\n  • Record user activities\n  \nMany settings are available to customize the app, so it can fit the needs of both educators and students:\n\n • Number display mode (beads or digits)\n • Voice for numbers and operations\n • Custom numbers (Sandbox)\n • Do operations by dragging numbers on top of each other\n • Authorize inequality\n • Authorize division by 2\n • Animation Speed\n  \nFeel free to send us your feedback and suggestions so we can add them to the next update! support@lescapadou.com\n\nHave fun with algebra!"

      "label": "Team Shake provides a technological and environmentally friendly way to choose teams for board games, sporting events, tournaments, school projects or anytime groups are required. The newest release brings many new features including full iPad support, balancing teams based on skill or gender, importing users from a file, enabling video output, and sharing teams via facebook or email. \n\nTeam Shake is the premier iOS App for creating teams. Instead of a hat and scraps of paper, the user enters his friends' names in his iPhone and gives it a shake. The screen will then display a random set of color-coded teams. These teams can immediately be used for game play or shared via facebook or email.   The quick and easy selection of random (or balanced) teams eliminates fighting over who will be on which team. Innovative use of the iPhone shake gesture gives users the satisfying feeling of shaking a virtual hat without the trouble of carrying around an actual hat. Conventional buttons can also be used for those who would rather not shake their expensive hardware about.  \n\nThe app is designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind. Names can easily be entered with the onscreen keyboard, chosen from the user's contacts, or imported from a file. The email and facebook functions document the members of each individual team as well as preserving the team number and color assigned by the app. For repeated use of Team Shake, lists of friends can be easily saved and loaded later. The current list is also automatically saved so that if you exit the app, or even reboot the device, changes will not be lost. For teachers and others with large lists of people, Team Shake supports the ability to import teams from text or csv files.\n\nIf you have any problems, feature requests, or comments please send an email to support@rhine-o.com. \n\nFeatures:\n\n* Create 1 to 64 random teams\n* Create completely random or balanced teams\n* Full iPad support\n* Eliminates fighting over choosing teams\n* Share / Save teams via email or Facebook\n* Teams can be chosen by the number of teams or by the size of teams.\n* Save lists of friends for later games\n* Import lists from email or spreadsheet\n* Export lists and options for use on another device\n* Satisfying feeling of shaking a “virtual” hat to create teams\n* Animated shaking hat\n* Entry of names via onscreen keyboard\n* Entry of names via iPhone contacts\n* Temporarily disable people who are absent\n* Set groups of people to always be on the same team\n* Set groups of people to always be on different teams\n* Set user strength to make more even teams (now supports fully balanced teams)\n* 5 users strengths level\n* Pick a single random person from the list of players\n* User strength indicator on the main screen (can be disabled in options)\n* Number of active players and total players is now displayed on the main screen\n* Video Out Support\n* Option to Sort Teams by Name\n* Option to balance male / female team members\n* \"Equal Ability\" option to create teams where all players have the same strength\n* Option to create separate male and female teams\n* Configurable Team Colors\n* Configurable Team Names\n* Print Support\n* Export Teams in CSV or XLS Format\n* Team Shake now supports simultaneously assigning players to multiple subteams and / or oppose teams at the same time.\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now have customized names to make selection easier\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now be enabled or disabled globally so that teams can be made quickly without subteams / oppose teams.  In particular, Balance Teams Strengths will work when separate Male / Female teams are created.\n\nYappler-Tags: Teams, Groups, Random, Hat, Entertainment, Games, Utilities"

No additional in-app purchase or subscriptions are required and there are no limits to how many boards or images you can create and share.\n\nIf you subscribe to Choiceworks+, you will get additional time saving data management features and customization options that further enhance your experience.  You will also receive additional premium features as they are released in future updates.  Note: Choiceworks+ features require an Apple ID to function properly.  If you are in a school or business setting, check with your IT administrator for any restrictions before you subscribe.\n\nSchedule Board \nThe Schedule Board makes task completion easier and more fun! The schedule is paired with an ‘all done’ column to check off steps toward a motivating reward. Timers can be added to any task or activity. The schedules are easy to edit and fully customizable. Once you have created a schedule, it will be saved automatically.\n\nWaiting Board \nThe Waiting Board teaches waiting skills like taking turns and not interrupting. The user can begin by reading the companion book, When Do I Have to Wait? Using the waiting board, the top picture indicates the reason why the child is waiting and a timer can be set to show how long the child will wait. The child can then choose an activity to do while waiting. \n\nFeelings Board \nThe Feelings Board provides a tool for helping children understand and express emotions. The user can begin by reading the companion book, When I Get Upset, to provide an example of how the child might recognize an emotion and choose a coping strategy. On the Feelings Board, the user can then help the child indicate how they are feeling from a range of options, select a coping strategy, and then request an activity to help them feel better or re-engage with others. \n\nFeelings Scale\nHelps users identify, manage and cope with feelings across environments throughout the day. By tracking their feelings on the board, users can analyze the data for trends to learn if tasks done at different times of day or in different environments affect outcome. Environments and schedules can then be altered to achieve better results.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.beevisual.com/mobile-app-eula.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.beevisual.com/mobile-app-privacy.html"

После его завершения любой человек легко сможет разговаривать на английском языке.\n\nСписок занятий:\n\n1.   Базовая форма глагола.\n2.   Местоимения. Вопросительные слова.\n3.   Глагол \"to be\". Предлоги места. Like/Want.\n4.   Притяжательные местоимения.\n5.   Профессии. Этикет.\n6.   Степени сравнения прилагательных. Указательные местоимения.\n7.   Слова-параметры. Употребление much и many.\n8.   Предлоги и параметры времени.\n9.   There is / There are.\n10. Предлоги направления и движения.\n11. Модальные глаголы can, must, should.\n12. Continuous \n13.

Фразовые глаголы\n\nКаждое занятие содержит подробное описание грамматики английского языка по данному уроку.\n \nКак это работает?\n\nПрограмма предлагает вам простые выражения на русском языке.\n\nИз слов на экране вам нужно составить английский перевод.\nЕсли вы ответили правильно, программа похвалит вас. Если вдруг ошиблись - подскажет правильный ответ. Правильный ответ озвучивается.\n\nЧтобы перейти к следующему уроку необходимо набрать 4.5 балла в предыдущем уроке. Пока баллы не набраны, уроки остаются заблокированными.\n\nРезультаты синхронизируются через iCloud.\n\nКак рассчитываются баллы?\n\nПрограмма помнит 100 последних ответов, количество ПРАВИЛЬНЫХ ответов делит на 100 и умножает на 5.\nЧтобы набрать 4.5 балла надо ответить правильно на 90 вопросов из 100.\n\nСлишком просто?\n\nТогда включите в настройках повышенный уровень сложности. Программа не будет предлагать вам варианты слов, а попросит ввести предложение с клавиатуры.\n\nЭКЗАМЕН\n\nЭкзамен предназначен для закрепления знаний по пройденным урокам. Также он хорошо подходит, чтобы освежить знания.\n\nПо каждому выбранному уроку составляется 10 заданий. Все задания перемешиваются и предлагаются Вам для выполнения в случайном порядке.\n\nПрограмма запоминает результаты выполнения по каждому из уроков в экзамене. По завершении экзамена выставляется общая оценка и оценка по каждому уроку.\n\nНе надо расстраиваться, если с первого раза Вы не получили максимальную оценку.\n\nЭто просто напоминание, что нужно дополнительно потренироваться в соответствующем уроке. Ведь главная цель данного приложения помочь Вам в изучении английского языка, а не выставление оценки за экзамен.\n\nЕсли вы знаете как улучшить программу, напишите нам !\n\nМы ВКонтакте: http://vk.com/polyglotmobile"

One of the most fundamental human desires is to be understood - help your baby communicate by teaching her baby sign language.\n\nThis app includes approx. 340 signs and over 1 hour of real life video demonstrations! The friendly presenters in the 'Baby Sign Language Dictionary' app will help you to learn to sign with your baby in an engaging and enjoyable way.\n\nThe keyword signs demonstrated in this video dictionary are based on American Sign Language (ASL). All signs have been carefully selected for their ease of use, helpfulness to carers and appropriateness for baby's interests and daily routine.\n\nEach sign has a detailed video tutorial covering information such as: simple instructions on how to perform the sign, clever tips to help you remember the sign and practical suggestions on how to introduce the sign to your baby.\n\nThe signs are also organized into categories such as: action words, animals, daily routines, feelings and emotions, food, manners and behavior, and nature – all of which are arranged alphabetically for quick and easy searching.\n\nTo test your baby signing knowledge, the app also comes with a fun interactive video quiz that will help you learn and remember the signs. You can also mark signs as part of your favorites list.\n\nOther key features:\n     • high quality graphics and videos optimized for viewing on Retina displays.\n     • optional setting to allow continuous play through of all signs in a category.\n     • swipe through the signs in a category without returning to the menu.\n     • optional setting to view a simplified demonstration for a sign rather than the complete tutorial.\n\nThis app makes the perfect parent's companion to the popular 'Baby Sign and Learn' animated apps (also available on the App Store).  Featuring gentle guidance and practical advice, this app has been designed to help make teaching your baby to sign as easy as waving “bye-bye”!\n\nVisit http://www.babysignandlearn.com for more information about baby sign language.\n\nNOTE TO PARENTS ABOUT SAFETY\n• This app contains age-appropriate content for preschoolers.\n• This app contains items that can be purchased for real money. This app contains a parental gate to stop your little ones making unauthorized purchases. You can turn off in-app purchases completely by disabling in-app purchases in your device’s settings.\n• This app contains parental gates to prevent your child following links out of the app to websites or social networks, or other apps without your knowledge."

Math problems are presented at the top of the game screen. Feedback is presented at the bottom of the game screen. Correct solutions to problems answered incorrectly will be displayed. \n\nScoring\nThe score in Math Bingo is determined by the time to complete a game plus a two second penalty for each problem answered incorrectly. \n\nExample:\nTime to complete game 0:45 seconds\nIncorrect answers: 3\nScore: 45+6=51 \n\nPlayer Profiles\nMath Bingo saves player information with custom player profiles. Each player profile consists of a unique name (up to 20 characters) and a fun cartoon avatar. The player profiles display total number of games played, total number of high scores achieved, and total number of Bingo Bugs collected. The guest profile does not store any information and therefore cannot achieve high scores or collect Bingo Bugs. The guest profile is useful for adults who want to play Math Bingo without their scores going into the scoreboard. \n\nSelecting a Game\nThere are five different games in Math Bingo: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Mixed. Players will be prompted to select a game type before game play. Selecting a Level There are three levels of game play in Math Bingo: easy, medium, and hard. Players will be prompted to select a game level before game play. Score Board Math Bingo displays high scores in the Score Board. There are four different Score Boards: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Each Score Board displays the top three scores for each level: easy, medium, and hard. \n\nBingo Bugs \nBingo Bugs are rewards for achieving a high score. A player who earns a high score will collect a Bingo Bug! Players can collect a variety of Bingo Bugs and interact with them by tapping the Bingo Bug button in the player profile or by tapping the My Bingo Bugs button after playing a game. HINT: Tilt your device to make the Bingo Bugs move around, tap on a Bingo Bug to make them giggle and spring! \n\nSettings\nThe settings menu can be accessed by clicking the information button on the lower right hand side the introduction screen. The settings menu will allow you to reset all high scores and to delete player profiles. \n\n-----------------------------\nPRIVACY DISCLOSURE Math BINGO:\n- Does not contain third-party ads. \n- Does not contain in-app purchases.\n- Does not contain integration with social networks. \n- Does not use analytics/data collection tools. \n- Does include links to apps by ABCya.com in the iTunes App Store. \n\nFor more information on our privacy policy please visit: http://www.abcya.com/mobile_app_privacy_policy.htm\n ---------------------------"

The bookmarked words are compiled in the Bookmark list in \"List.\"\r\n\r\n◇ “Check” helps learners to track their mastery.\r\n・Users check their understanding of the kanji words studied and sort them into those mastered and those not yet retained.\r\n・The kanji words already mastered are taken out of the study set, leaving behind just those that still need to be worked on.\r\n\r\n◇ “List” displays various lists of all the words and kanji covered by the app so that users can see their progress and review them.\r\n・In the lists arranged in lesson order, a-i-u-e-o order, or alphabetical order, checkmarks are automatically placed next to words that have been mastered.\r\n・Kanji information on the cards can be displayed from the entries in the On/Kun list.\r\n・Users can search kanji words from their target kanji in the Serial # list.\r\n・The words bookmarked in the Study mode are also listed in the Bookmark list.\r\n・The Study view of kanji words or the target kanji can be displayed from the list entries, enabling quick review.\r\n\r\n○This app is based on the kanji list from the third edition of GENKI.\r\n○Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

Can you help to find him a cure? The bat has broken its wing. Do you know what to do? \n\nWhether a bump on the head, a stomach ache from too much candy, a little wound, or a sunburn, these funny animals need the help of a really good doctor! \n\nFrom Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger, the illustrator and director behind the bestseller Apps „Nighty Night“, „Little Fox Music Box“ and „Nighty Night Circus“ comes a wonderful new 3D-App which your child will love! \n\nThe app is full of humorous animations, amazing 3D illustrations, and funny short movies. In the animal doctor’s office, located in a magical treehouse, the animals are waiting to be cured. Kids are playfully guided through applying treatments that they might have experienced themselves: measuring temperatures, taking medicine, getting a plaster. And of course, eating a snail is probably just good for owls!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n\nHighlights:  \n\n1.There are 7 animals in the App - fox, bat, rabbit, mole, hedgehog, spider and owl, with 21 different injuries, sicknesses, and diseases.                                                                                                      \n2. Your child has many different treatments and medicines to choose from to cure the animals and make them happy again. \n3. Every time your child plays the App the animals have different illnesses, injuries and diseases.                                                                                             \n4.

      "label": "Welcome to Expedition White Shark, the world’s first app designed to track adult white sharks in real time! To make this possible, scientists at the Marine Conservation Science Institute (MCSI) attached custom satellite tags to the dorsal fin of adult Great White Sharks, allowing us to follow their movements from Satellites orbiting the earth. Expedition White Shark allows you to receive near real time Great White Shark tracking data at the same time as the research scientists. Positions for the tagged sharks can only be calculated when a shark is at the surface with its dorsal fin out of the water for several minutes; since sharks are not always finning we receive intermittent position data from our sharks, but each signal beamed to us form space adds to our growing knowledge of the life history of this species. Since you are getting our data in near real time you will notice that the satellites sometimes make mistakes, placing the shark far from its actual location; we correct these errors later, when we analyze the data. The MCSI satellite tagging of Great White Sharks has led to many important new findings regarding white shark biology, and each new day brings promise of a new discovery that you can make with us!\n\nUse the shark filter to select a specific shark or see the last position for all sharks of a specific species, or select current to see shark positions within the last 30 days. If current is selected the last position for a shark that appears on the map as a dorsal fin , while sharks with historical location data on today’s date in previous years are marked with dot. This allows users to look for patterns of where sharks may be found during that time of year.\n\nKeep up with the latest research insights posted by Dr. Michael Domeier and Nicole Nasby-Lucas, by following us on Facebook www.facebook.com/MarineCSI and Instagram @marinecsiorg."

      "label": "Learn and practice Morse code where ever you are.\n\nSome comments from our App store reviews:\n\nBrilliant if you really want to learn morse - Five Stars!\nVery very good... - Five Stars!\nThis is one of the best cw tutor apps available - Five Stars!\nJust what I needed for handy practice anywhere anytime! Highly recommended! - Five Stars!\nThis is the best app I've found for increasing my code accuracy and helping to increase my speed. Five Stars!\n\nHam Morse allows you to practice morse code on your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. It is designed particularly for Ham radio operators and others who wish to achieve or maintain a high level of proficiency in this classic mode of communication.\n\nHam morse has the following features:\n\nThe code is sent using the Farnsworth timing whereby the morse characters are sent at 15 words per minute (WPM) and then extra spacing is added to slow the overall WPM to speeds slower than 15 WPM. The farnsworth speed can be adjusted if you wish to use a speed other than 15WPM. The maximum speed that the morse can be sent at is 50 words per minute. The morse audio waveforms have a 5ms rise time to reduce key clicks and yet provide crisp code to copy.\n\nThe audio frequency can be varied from 220Hz up to 900Hz. A typical value might be around 700Hz but a lower tone can be very useful in some situations.\n\nThe code can be paused just in case you are interrupted or want to take a break, an incoming call on an iPhone pauses the code automatically.\n\nTo help you learn the morse code itself HamMorse allows you to practice a variety of sets of characters from individual random letters all the way to the current news stories from around the world.\n\nKoch - This setting uses the Koch character progression. It starts with just one letter and then you can add a new letter when you have mastered the previous character set. This is one of the most popular methods of learning the morse character set.\n\nLetters - Practice the individual letters, A-Z. Add new letters to your practice set using the settings page.\n\nNumbers - Practice the numbers, 0-9. Which numbers you practice can be controlled on the settings page.\n\nCallsigns - allows you to practice receiving random amateur radio callsigns, a mixture of letters and numbers (eg AA9PW, G1SNT, G5RV) that often prove troublesome when copying code on the air. HamMorse creates a wide variety of international callsigns using the standard ITU prefixes to provide useful practice where ever in the world you may be.\n\nPunctuation - provides a wide variety of punctuation and standard morse code prosigns.\n\nTop 100 and 500 most common words - this is a great way to start to recognize whole words the key to really improving your speed.\n\nNews feeds - these provide the opportunity to copy real sentences and keep up with the news at the same time. Note that the News feeds will only work with an active network connection.\n\nHam QSOs - listen to examples of typical on-air exchanges between ham radio operators - practice coping the callsigns, RST reports, location, rig, antenna and many other pieces of a typical QSO.\n\nAccessibility support - The app also has support for Apple's accessibility tool, Voice Over. When Voice Over is activated each button and field has an audible description available describing the button or slider and its use.\n\nText Delay - As an additional learning aid You can have the text appear a few seconds after the morse code is played so you have time to copy the letter before it appears on screen.\n\nText Filter - Filter out characters from the News feeds or QSOs that you are not yet familiar with so you can start practicing with real text even if you don't yet know the whole morse character set."

Elle aide également à défaire quelques mythes concernant cette modalité de communication qui appuie la parole.\n-Vos signes favoris : Cette option vous permet de regrouper les signes qui sont significatifs pour vous et le nombre qui vous convient.\n-Application sociale : Cette fonction vous permet de partager les signes de votre bébé avec d’autres utilisateurs.  \nVous pouvez également échanger sur votre expérience avec d’autres parents. \n\nC’est quoi / Pourquoi / Pour qui\nIl s’agit d’une application facilitant l’apprentissage d’un répertoire de signes de base pour supporter le développement de la communication en attendant que la parole se développe et soit fonctionnelle… ce qui diminue plusieurs frustrations.  Au cours des dernières années, plusieurs études ont démontré les avantages de l’utilisation des signes ayant ‘défait’ plusieurs mythes et craintes face à leur utilisation sur le développement du langage.  En effet, l’enfant, avant de développer la parole, doit développer les bases d’une communication bidirectionnelle réussie.\nCette application s’adresse donc à tous les parents, familles et intervenants souhaitant intégrer l’utilisation de signes. \nLes signes proviennent des principaux répertoires utilisés au Québec : LSQ, Français Signé, Mains animées.  Alors que la majorité des mots ont un signe identique ou très similaire d’un répertoire à l’autre, d’autres présentent quelques variantes qui vous sont présentées."

      "label": "\"A great way to give parents a break and let your kid have fun and learn at the same time.\" - Jen, Kindergarten teacher and mom of three.\n\nI have a confession to make.  My son's favorite game was Fruit Ninja and I was getting increasingly frustrated with having my son waste a lot of time on a fun but mindless game while he was still struggling to master his letters. \n\nSo I decided to create our very own ABC letters slicing game and to my and my son's delight, he now has a new favorite game where he is having fun and learning at the same time. \n\nMy sons skills in letter recognition have dramatically improved since he started playing this game and now I no longer have to feel guilty when I need a five minute break to take care of the laundry or prepare lunch for the kids.  I know that they are having fun and that they are learning at the same time.\n\nWarning: Your child will keep begging for your iPhone or iPad after they try this app.\n\nABC Ninja is an exciting educational game that helps kids rapidly learn their letters by sight, sound, and touch.  \nThe interface is so easy to use that even a 9 month old baby will delight in using this app. \n\nFEATURES:\n\n• Slice your way through all capital letters by name or phonic sounds\n\n• Slice your way through all lower case letters by name or phonic sounds\n\n• You decide what to focus on - turn individual categories ON or OFF from the settings page\n\n• Learn by sight, sound, and touch\n\n• Fun game play, sounds, and animations keep kids engaged\n\n• Dynamic game play adjusts difficulty (the number of letters) automatically based on player skills to keep kids both challenged and entertained vs. getting bored\n\n• Supports 3 difficulty settings: EASY, MEDIUM, or HARD\n\nEASY MODE:\n- Max 1 Letter\n- Letters move very slowly\n- Great for introducing letters\n\nMEDIUM MODE:\n- Starts with 1 letter\n- Max of 3 letters on screen\n- Letters move 30% faster\n\nHARD MODE:\n- Starts with 2 letters\n- Max of 5 letters on screen\n- Letters move even faster\n- Letters rotate faster too\n\nAdjust difficulty from settings page. \n \n• Wrong answers do not interfere with gameplay, the child can immediately try again and slice the correct answer (most other games are too slow to keep kids interested by interrupting the gameplay and slowly repeating the desired question)\n\n• Play letters from A to Z or in random order (adjustable from settings page)\n\n• Multi-sensory learning tool - combining audio, voice, and touch\n\n• Want to work on just a few letters?  No problem… head to the settings page to turn entire categories or individual letters on and off\n\n• Want to record your own audios? No problem.  Just click on the category and record your own letter sounds \n\n• Supports three levels of difficulty \n\nHEROIC SUPPORT\n\nHeroic Support is not just what we do.  It's really what makes us, well, us.  It's that drive to make a difference in your life - no matter how big or small.  Really, it's our way of life because we want you to be our customer for a lifetime of fun and learning.\n\nHave questions?  We are here to help.  Email us at support@alligatorapps.com"

The award-winning Jump Numbers is a flexible and fun skip counting game to excite and engage mathematicians of all ages and ability.  \n\nThe Snortles lived happily in their favorite volcano until the day it popped! Now they’re scattered and floating in the sea. Jump from one number to the next in a sequence, saving Snortles and earning beach balls as you go. Squish numbers together to make the next number on your path.\n\nWatch out for Stompers and fuses or they'll send your Snortles flying!\n\n• Practice skip counting and mental math as you squish numbers together\n• Apply multiplication knowledge to figure out the next number in your path\n• Game difficulty adapts to your own skills, so you will be challenged, but not overwhelmed\n• Customizable skills let you target specific math practice\n• Hints are always available\n• Option to turn off Stompers and fuses (time pressure) for a more relaxing math journey \n• Unlimited user accounts\n________________________________\n\nCUSTOMIZE FOR SPECIFIC CONCEPTS AND ABILITY:\n\nThe default mode of play in Jump is adaptive difficulty. This means the game will automatically adjust the difficulty for each player. The game starts out easy, counting by 1s and 2s, but before you know it, you may find yourself counting by 7s, 8s or 9s and things can add up quickly! The more Snortles you save and the more math you do, the more challenging the game will become. \n\nIf you want more fine-grained control for targeted math practice, you can customize skills from the options menu:\n\n- Choose the specific “Count by” numbers a player is presented with, or play the original adaptive game.\n- You can also choose a random “Start at” number for a much tougher challenge.\n ________________________________\n\nUNLIMITED USER ACCOUNTS:\n\nAdd as many custom profiles as you like. Individual game settings and progress are saved in each player profile. Create different profiles, each tailored for specific practice and abilities.\n\nThanks for playing Jump Numbers!\n________________________________\n\nMADE BY EDUCATIONAL GAME DESIGNERS\n\nWe're a small team of educational game designers who care deeply about crafting fun learning experiences for kids. We include kids, parents and teachers in our game development and testing to make sure our apps are exceptional tools that kids want to use again and again.\n________________________________\n\nWebsite: www.artgigapps.com\nFollow us: twitter.com/artgigapps\nLike us: Facebook.com/artgigapps\n\nPlease reach out: hello@artgigapps.com\n_______________________________\n\nPRIVACY\n\nWe hold your privacy and the privacy of your child in the highest regard and we do not collect or share any personal information.

The children we have used the app with were more willing to complete the oral motor exercise routine when using the app versus just following the Speech Therapist's instructions.\" Bridging Apps.com\n\nOral motor skills refer to the skills needed for basic functions such as eating and speaking. The muscles in the mouth, jaw, lips and tongue are responsible for smiling, facial expressions, and even swallowing. We know that in order to practice these skills effectively, children need to follow basic directions involving movements of the muscles in their mouths.\nChildren with Apraxia of Speech, Down syndrome or craniofacial anomalies many times experience difficulties with their oral motor skills.\n\nSmart Oral Motor is a fun and engaging application for children who need a little more entertaining when practicing their oral motor skills. Clever, the duck, provides auditory and visual cues for practicing several oral motor exercises such as:\n-Puckering lips\n-Making an “o” with the mouth\n-Sending a kiss\n-Moving tongue to sides\n-Puffing cheeks\n-Touching cheeks using the tongue\n-Moving the tongue up and down\n\nThis application includes a total of 15 oral motor exercises, auditory information and fun animations. Parents and therapists have the ability to adjust the number of repetitions per movement as they please. \n\nThis application does not replace the need for a full evaluation by a licensed professional such as an occupational therapist or a speech therapist. Therapists will evaluate and provide full guidance on how to best use this application. If parents are working with their therapists in trying to develop a home program for their child, this can be one very user friendly and engaging resource."

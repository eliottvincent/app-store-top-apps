      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "Tap images. Type words. Speak. Proloquo2Go is an easy to use communication app for people who cannot speak or need help being understood. Featuring natural sounding voices, including real children’s voices, Proloquo2Go is a simple yet powerful AAC (augmentative and alternative communication) tool. The app is fully customizable and can be utilized to build language skills and grow with a person’s communication, supporting both beginning and advanced communicators.\n\nParents, therapists, teachers and users around the world recognize Proloquo2Go as the gold standard in AAC solutions. The app is used by people with autism, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, Angelman syndrome, and others with speech difficulties. The app is available in English, Spanish, French, and Dutch and supports bilingual use, so you can switch languages on the fly.\n\nProloquo2Go in action:\n\nLearn and grow\n\nStudies show that just 200-400 words make up 80% of what we say. Known as core words, they act as the basis of Proloquo2Go’s research-based Crescendo™ vocabulary. Users can grow from single words to full sentences in the same app. Crescendo puts core words in consistent locations for easy access and motor-planning. The vocabulary works with AAC best practices like modeling (where you use an AAC system to talk with the user) to develop language skills. Crescendo offers no limit on language development with a 10,000+ fringe word vocabulary and customizable vocabulary levels. Finally, with Progressive Language, words are gradually revealed step-by-step, helping users learn words and their location as their communication expands.\n\nEasy editing\n\nCustomizing Proloquo2Go is a breeze! Quickly and easily add new words. Use the app’s built-in library of 25,000 symbols or use your own photos by taking pictures within the app or selecting them from your photo library. For users with fine-motor challenges and vision impairments, Proloquo2Go offers options like 23 pre-programmed grid sizes and accessibility settings which support switch scanning and Apple’s VoiceOver screen reader. Everything from appearance to access is customizable so you can make it your own. \n\nType and speak\n\nBesides tapping images, Proloquo2Go also lets you type what you want to say. The app includes a Grid Keyboard arranged alphabetically for people learning to type. For more experienced typists, Proloquo2Go includes a Typing View with a QWERTY keyboard and word prediction that offers suggestions based on what you are typing. \n\nHello! ¡Hola! Bonjour! Hallo!\n\nProloquo2Go lets you select a language and region for the Crescendo vocabulary. Two languages can be used at the same time, allowing seamless bilingual speech. Over 100 included downloadable natural-sounding adult and children’s voices rounds out your choices to use the app your way.\n\nA helping hand\n\nAssistiveWare is here for you every step of the way. Help articles in Proloquo2Go are there whenever you need them. New to AAC? Our website has easy to understand articles in the Learn AAC section, and the AssistiveWare Core Word Classroom includes activities for teaching communication effectively.

If you have any questions, our support team is available 7 days a week and is always happy to help. All of these online resources can be accessed by going to the AssistiveWare website. \n\nNote: Discounts are available through Apple’s Educational Volume Purchase Program – 50% off on 20 licenses or more.

      "label": "Spend less time studying and more time flying! This is the FAA Airline Transport Pilot (ATP Part 121, ATP Part 135, and Helicopter) and Aircraft Dispatcher (ADX) version of GroundSchool, our FAA knowledge (written) test preparation featuring up-to-date questions, free updates, and illustrated explanations written by a professional team of pilot examiners and instructors.\n\nGroundSchool is fully compatible with FAA ACS (Airman Certification Standards) and our editorial team is working to keep it so as ACS continues to evolve.\n\nDon't be fooled by imitators! Competing apps here in the AppStore use only the limited set of questions that the FAA publicly releases via its website - that is not enough to adequately prepare you for your test! Our GroundSchool app, on the other hand, features a much more comprehensive database (typically about 2-4 times the size of the demo FAA public one) of actual and current FAA questions that you likely can and will be asked on the actual test! This along with our detailed, professional explanations and easy to use interface are major reasons why pilots have come to trust GroundSchool. \n\nStudy actual, up-to-date FAA questions and then ACE your FAA ATP written test the easy way with GroundSchool FAA Knowledge Test Preparation software by Dauntless Aviation, the trusted leader in FAA written test preparation.\n\nFeatures:\n\n    * Actual FAA Questions Current and Valid for Right Now.  As soon as you install the software, use the 'update' feature and the software will connect to our servers, grab the latest questions, images, figures, and explanation content, and you'll be good to go.  \n    * Detailed Explanations written by an experienced editorial team of examiner and instructor pilots.\n    * All Charts and Figures Included\n    * Several flexible study modes - fits the way you want to study!\n    * Compatible with all FAA \"ground school\" classroom-based courses\n\nThis ATP/ADX version of GroundSchool will prepare you for any or all of the following tests:\n\n* ATP - Airline Transport Pilot Airplane (Part 121)\n* ATA - Airline Transport Pilot Airplane (135)\n* ATH - Airline Transport Pilot Helicopter (135)\n* ADX - Aircraft Dispatcher\n* ARA - Airline Transport Pilot Airplane (135) (added rating)\n* ARH - Airline Transport Pilot Helicopter (135) (added rating)\n* Canadian Airline Transport Pilot to USA FAA Conversion\n\nWith Dauntless Aviation's GroundSchool, you don't need to worry:\n\n* Our material is UP TO DATE.  No matter what date is listed here in regarding the 'Release date', this date refers to the program itself only.  Once you get the program on your device, use the built-in update feature and it will connect to our servers and download the latest and greatest version of the test prep content and our explanations that we have available.   To learn more about this, please visit our website.\n* We pride ourselves on the quality of our explanations.  This is not some idle boast - our explanations are more detailed and more illustrated than that of ANY other FAA knowledge test provider, period.   \n* Tens of thousands of people have used our products to prepare for their FAA knowledge tests.  Ours is a system that works.\n\nATP 121 or 135?\nSome airplane pilots are not sure whether they should take the Part 121 or the Part 135 tests.  In short, from the FAA's perspective, it doesn't matter - study for the one that is most interesting to you and perhaps the one that you envision as most relevant to your future career.  for a more detailed description of this, please see our website. \n\nRemember, this software allows you to study both 121 and 135 and jump between them (and the other ATP tests) as you'd like with no restrictions.\n\n\nGood luck on your test!"

      "label": "Hops are the spice in your beer and shrouded in mystery (described by Pliny and Hildegard von Bingen). In distant times hops were even controlled by monks and kings!\n\nThis application answers many of the hoppy thoughts I have had as a master brewer, and many of the hoppy questions I have received over the last 20 years. \n\nI have divided this application into 7 keys. These keys cover topics for you as a brewer, to consider when dosing hops in whatever form you have decided to use. You can gain information about hops on the web or in brewery books and this application should be used as an addition to this depicting new figures and ideas. I have included a key covering links which I find useful and which you can’t easily discover under time constraints in your busy day. \n\nConsiderations, awareness and attention must be made when using different hop products and hop varieties as well as the time of addition. In order to maintain the quality of bitterness you should not only pay attention to the hop variety, crop year, hop oil content, hop product used, α-acid content but also a new ratio of hard resin to α-acid as well as time of addition. The new hop classification index, the “Eiken Hop Classification Index”, is proposed which I hope you will find intriguing.\n\nPlease be aware that this is not the only factor causing bitterness. Other factors like the grist composition, salt composition (e.g. the Chloride/Sulphate balance), yeast strain, volatiles and usage of processing aids are also very important to take into consideration. \n\nBy choosing a specific hop variety, or a blend of hop varieties, you control the desired aroma of the beer – such as earthiness, pine needles, elderflower, strawberry, passion fruit, garlic or grapefruit – and the desired type of bitterness. By choosing a specific hop variety you also decide how the bitterness is perceived by, and felt, on the tongue. Is it for instance, smooth, harsh, astringent, metallic, rounded, or lingering?  \n\nTake a look at this application and your feedback is welcome on: BrewersHops@gmail.com \n\nEnjoy your day and your hops.\nJens Eiken"

The world of science just got a little bit weirder and a lot more fun with Toca Lab: Plants!\n\nJust like with the first app in the Toca Lab Series, Toca Lab: Elements, your curiosity will lead the way. Choose your plant, then visit five different locations in the lab:\n\n● Grow light: Shine the light on your plant and watch what happens! Does your plant bask and happily sigh in the light, or groan and wriggle away? What happens when you turn the light up a notch or two?\n\n● Watering tank: Put your plant in the tank and fill it up with water. Will your plant float? How does your plant behave when it’s soaking wet?\n\n● Nutrition station: What’s the optimal diet for your plant? Try the three different nutrition formulas and discover which ones your plant character likes!\n\n● Cloning machine: Spin the wheel on the cloning machine and before you know it, you’ll have five little versions of your plant. Wonder what the clones can do? Experiment and find out!\n\n● Crossbreeding apparatus: Here you can mix two plants to create something unexpected. Try it and see what happens!\n\nHave fun experimenting at each station to see how the plants evolve. Keep experimenting until you’ve collected all 35 plant characters in the app. Once you’ve collected a plant, keep experimenting to continue to evolve it! Who says kids can’t be scientists? Toca Lab: Plants brings out the budding botanist in everybody!\n\nFEATURES\n- Start with one plant and experiment your way to 35 different plant characters, each with its own unique personality!\n- Continue to evolve existing plants through experimentation!\n- Evolve plants with five lab tools: grow light, watering tank, nutrition station, cloning machine and the crossbreeding apparatus.\n- Discover plants from five groups: green algae, mosses, ferns, trees and flowering plants.\n- Learn the names and Latin names of real-life plants!\n\n--\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

      "label": "Team Shake provides a technological and environmentally friendly way to choose teams for board games, sporting events, tournaments, school projects or anytime groups are required. The newest release brings many new features including full iPad support, balancing teams based on skill or gender, importing users from a file, enabling video output, and sharing teams via facebook or email. \n\nTeam Shake is the premier iOS App for creating teams. Instead of a hat and scraps of paper, the user enters his friends' names in his iPhone and gives it a shake. The screen will then display a random set of color-coded teams. These teams can immediately be used for game play or shared via facebook or email.   The quick and easy selection of random (or balanced) teams eliminates fighting over who will be on which team. Innovative use of the iPhone shake gesture gives users the satisfying feeling of shaking a virtual hat without the trouble of carrying around an actual hat. Conventional buttons can also be used for those who would rather not shake their expensive hardware about.  \n\nThe app is designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind. Names can easily be entered with the onscreen keyboard, chosen from the user's contacts, or imported from a file. The email and facebook functions document the members of each individual team as well as preserving the team number and color assigned by the app. For repeated use of Team Shake, lists of friends can be easily saved and loaded later. The current list is also automatically saved so that if you exit the app, or even reboot the device, changes will not be lost. For teachers and others with large lists of people, Team Shake supports the ability to import teams from text or csv files.\n\nIf you have any problems, feature requests, or comments please send an email to support@rhine-o.com. \n\nFeatures:\n\n* Create 1 to 64 random teams\n* Create completely random or balanced teams\n* Full iPad support\n* Eliminates fighting over choosing teams\n* Share / Save teams via email or Facebook\n* Teams can be chosen by the number of teams or by the size of teams.\n* Save lists of friends for later games\n* Import lists from email or spreadsheet\n* Export lists and options for use on another device\n* Satisfying feeling of shaking a “virtual” hat to create teams\n* Animated shaking hat\n* Entry of names via onscreen keyboard\n* Entry of names via iPhone contacts\n* Temporarily disable people who are absent\n* Set groups of people to always be on the same team\n* Set groups of people to always be on different teams\n* Set user strength to make more even teams (now supports fully balanced teams)\n* 5 users strengths level\n* Pick a single random person from the list of players\n* User strength indicator on the main screen (can be disabled in options)\n* Number of active players and total players is now displayed on the main screen\n* Video Out Support\n* Option to Sort Teams by Name\n* Option to balance male / female team members\n* \"Equal Ability\" option to create teams where all players have the same strength\n* Option to create separate male and female teams\n* Configurable Team Colors\n* Configurable Team Names\n* Print Support\n* Export Teams in CSV or XLS Format\n* Team Shake now supports simultaneously assigning players to multiple subteams and / or oppose teams at the same time.\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now have customized names to make selection easier\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now be enabled or disabled globally so that teams can be made quickly without subteams / oppose teams.  In particular, Balance Teams Strengths will work when separate Male / Female teams are created.\n\nYappler-Tags: Teams, Groups, Random, Hat, Entertainment, Games, Utilities"

      "label": "We received the \"Editor´s Choice\" award by Apple for \"Little Fox Animal Doctor\" And in addition our app was awarded the \"Tech with Kids' Best Pick Award\" for exceptional design of a children's app. \n\nLittle Fox has caught a cold. Can you help to find him a cure? The bat has broken its wing. Do you know what to do? \n\nWhether a bump on the head, a stomach ache from too much candy, a little wound, or a sunburn, these funny animals need the help of a really good doctor! \n\nFrom Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger, the illustrator and director behind the bestseller Apps „Nighty Night“, „Little Fox Music Box“ and „Nighty Night Circus“ comes a wonderful new 3D-App which your child will love! \n\nThe app is full of humorous animations, amazing 3D illustrations, and funny short movies. In the animal doctor’s office, located in a magical treehouse, the animals are waiting to be cured. Kids are playfully guided through applying treatments that they might have experienced themselves: measuring temperatures, taking medicine, getting a plaster. And of course, eating a snail is probably just good for owls!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n\nHighlights:  \n\n1.There are 7 animals in the App - fox, bat, rabbit, mole, hedgehog, spider and owl, with 21 different injuries, sicknesses, and diseases.                                                                                                      \n2. Your child has many different treatments and medicines to choose from to cure the animals and make them happy again. \n3. Every time your child plays the App the animals have different illnesses, injuries and diseases.                                                                                             \n4. Little Fox Animal Doctor is the first 3D-App by Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger. She is also the creative genius behind Nighty Night, Little Fox Music Box and Nighty Night Circus. Her Apps have been downloaded over 5 million times worldwide.                                                                                                                                  \n\nThe App will make your children’s dreams of being an Animal Doctor come true!\n\nAbout Fox & Sheep:\nWe are a Studio in Berlin and develop high quality apps for kids at the age of 2-8 years. We are parents ourselves and work passionately and with a lot of commitment on our products. We work with the best illustrators and animators around the world to create and present the best apps possible – to enrich the lives of our and your kids."

      "label": "Flashnote Derby is a fun way for kids to learn and practice reading music notes. \n\nEach race is a timed test in which the student identifies different notes in order to urge their horse on towards the finish line. Answering quickly and correctly will cause their horse to gain ground, while incorrect answers will cause it to fall behind. At the end of each race, students can review the notes they missed and see the correct answers. \n\nPlayers can respond to flashcards by simply playing the note on their acoustic or MIDI instrument. They can also choose to answer by tapping letter buttons or playing a key on an on-screen piano.\n\nThe game is fully customizable to allow for any desired notes in the treble, bass, alto, or tenor clefs to be included. You can select ranges of notes, or several individual notes to focus on specific areas that need work. Notes can be shown with sharps and flats and key signatures can even be added to increase the challenge for more advanced students. The amount of time the player is given for each flashcard can be increased or decreased depending upon their age and level of experience.\n\nDrills can start out simply, with only a handful of notes, and gradually be made more challenging until the full staff is mastered (up to five and a half ledger lines above or below the staff.) The more difficult the settings, the more points are awarded. The 'high score' is tracked so that players always have a goal to shoot for.\n\nAs a bonus, over a dozen instructional video lessons are easily accessible from right inside the app!

Your goal is to quiet your mind and become aware of that picture.\n\nYou select one of the two choices by pressing the answer which best matches your awareness of that image. When you do that, a second question\nwill appear. You then repeat the process. The Property Matches indicator at the bottom shows the number of correct answers to 24 questions.\n\nFour pictures will then appear. Tap the picture that best matches your mental image. The correct picture will fill the screen. After 12 pictures you may begin a new game.\n\nThis program offers feedback and reinforcement to meets the requirements for learning this skill. The Stargate ESP Trainer presents meaningful and emotional images to your subconscious mind. This ability is often called clairvoyance, and can enhance your life in many surprising ways."

GraphoGame Helps Kindergarten and Elementary School Kids Learn to Read and Spell Letters, Syllables and Words with American English Phonics.  \n\nFEATURES: \n\n• NO ADS OR IN-APP PURCHASES   \n• Rated for Kids 4 to 9 Years Old \n• Play Without Internet   \n• Levels Adapt to Player Ability \n• In-App Progress Reports and Literacy Analytics   \n• Earn Rewards and Use Them to Customize Your Avatar!   \n• Two Game Modes: Stars (school use) and Map (at home use)   \n• New 3D Map Immerses Kids in an Engaging Learning Adventure \n• GDPR, CCPA and COPPA-compliant; plus, We Do Not Collect Personal Data  \n• Proven Efficacy in Children with Dyslexia and Autism \n• Full Content Forever. Never Pay More for New Content or Features!   \n\nGraphoGame was created by pedagogical experts, linguists and neuroscientists from Yale and Cambridge Universities to achieve basic literacy in children - from kindergarten onwards.  Research trials show that by playing just 15 minutes, 3 times per week, kids can improve their letter knowledge, phonics awareness, reading speed and overall confidence in literacy.  Literacy outcomes are equivalent with 1-to-1 teacher support as shown by a randomized controlled trial conducted by the Centre for Neuroscience in Education, University of Cambridge.  Witness kids learning their first letters, syllables and words at home or in school with GraphoGame!   \n\nKids learn to read with American English phonics and a variety of engaging 3D levels – all with their own unique avatar.  Players gradually move from graphemes and phonemes, through vowels, consonants, syllables and rhymes, to eventually learn how to blend what they have mastered into complete words.  Play at home or in school! \n\nThis version of GraphoGame is the result of work done by Haskins Laboratories, an independent, not-for-profit research institute founded in 1935, investigating the biological basis of speech, language and reading, and their related disabilities. GraphoGame is based on decades of research in dyslexia, autism, neurolinguistics and phonics by the University of Jyväskylä in Finland and was adapted to English by the University of Cambridge Centre for Neuroscience in Education and Yale’s Haskins Laboratories.  Kindergarten to grade 3 students - including those with dyslexia or autism - have shown the most literacy improvement playing GraphoGame American English. \n\nVisit www.graphogame.com to learn more.   \n\n  \n\nGame icon © Grapho Group Oy, Ville Mönkkönen & Mika Halttunen"

You can then see how you fare against your friends and other people around the world.\n\nGames included are as follows; arithmetic test, instrumental comprehension test, SDT tests, multitasking test, spatial awareness test, co-ordination tests, memory tests and a shadowing test.\nAll questions are always computer generated, therefore it is unlikely that the same problem will arise twice.\n\nEvery section comes with an instructions page, which includes a detailed explanation on how to solve each question. Furthermore, at the end of each game you can now review each incorrectly answered question; allowing you to see where you're going wrong.\n\nGood luck in the test!"

      "label": "*** WINNER for Best Elementary Student App at BestAppEver.com\n*** Readers' Choice Top 10 at SmartAppsForKids.com\n\nTeachMe: 1st Grade is the third installment in the popular TeachMe series of educational apps. TeachMe: 1st Grade teaches four age-appropriate subjects to first grade children: sight words, addition, subtraction and spelling. Learning subjects align with common core standards to help your child get prepared for 1st Grade. Parents can review performance history for each subject to check how their child is doing. \n\nTeachMe: 1st Grade keeps children engaged with a unique reward system where children earn coins by playing learning games at the school. They can move around the rest of TeachTown to spend their coins on fun rewards. Children can collect stretchable shapes at the Shape Store, visit their virtual aquarium at the Fish Store, and decorate different scenes at the art store. The simple and intuitive user interface is designed to be child friendly, which allows children to play without help from an adult. An animated teacher (Mimi Mouse) gives verbal instructions and feedback to encourage the child to learn and succeed! In addition, the learning screens are colorful, fun and rotate between four different subjects so children don't get bored.\n\nChildren write their answers for math and spelling questions and TeachMe: 1st Grade reads them. If your child needs help, TeachMe: 1st grade will show them how to write the correct answer including the proper stroke order.  TeachMe also includes a virtual keyboard input option.\n\nEach child has an achievements screen which motivates and encourages learning by showing progress and levels for each topic. Parents can use this screen to quickly see progress of their child. Parents can select which subjects they want, set different difficulty levels, and even choose specific questions. Parents can also review performance history for each subject to check how their child is doing.\n\nFEATURES:\n• Uses writing recognition, or virtual keyboard input\n• Achievement screen show progress and levels for each topic\n• Explore TeachTown to spend coins on fun rewards\n• Collectable stretchable shapes reward found at the Shape Store\n• Virtual Aquarium reward (7 types of fish and 50+ items)\n• 7 different sticker reward scenes:  space, playground, beach, underwater reef, pirate cove, city, farm\n• Over 170 different stickers for adding to scenes\n• Classroom friendly personalized learning for 40 students\n• Select which subjects are displayed for each child\n• Turn on/off specific questions within a subject\n• Change the number of correct questions to earn a reward\n• Change the number of questions in a row to mark a question learned\n• Tracks performance for each subject item (last five)\n• Export sticker rewards scenes to Photos, for emailing or using as wallpaper\n\nLEARNING SUBJECTS:\n• Sight Words: Dolch First Grade\n• Addition: up to a total of 20 with additional advanced questions\n• Subtraction: from 20 down with additional advanced questions\n• Math questions are shown both horizontally and vertically\n• Spelling: 170+ 1st grade level words\n\nCOMMON CORE:\nFor alignment info see https://www.24x7digital.com/firstgradecc\n\nEmail us at support@24x7digital for help & suggestions."

It has LESS FEATURES than the iPad app. (it has NO LATERAL computations, no graphical MCP and Max Continuous Power computations and a simple version load manifest) For use on iPad with professional load manifest, exact lateral and MCP performance computations, please choose the Tim Tucker - iPad version.  *********\n\n\nA great new tool for students, instructors and professional pilots. Weight & Balance calculations have never been easier and faster. \n\n\nWith the Gyronimo Performance Pad you can calculate weight & balance, performance and navigation data in just a few seconds!  It is designed specifically for the Robinson R44 Raven and Raven II, and contains all necessary flight and performance data. \n\nThe weight and balance calculations can also be used for the Robinson R44 Astro.\n\nQuickly change all important values using sliders! Compare Raven and  Raven II OGE and IGE performance! \nCalculate and compare Manifold Pressure and Never Exceed Speed Limits.\nThis enables students and flight instructors to experiment with the values and create \"what if\" scenarios in no time.\n\nThe Performance Pad has four main pages\n\n1. Weight and Balance Page\nSet person and baggage values in seconds using the convenient sliders. Select doors on/off with switch-buttons. The CG position is calculated and displayed simultaneously.\n\nBased on fuel flow and fuel available the flight time and fuel reserve are computed. Control all values via sliders and receive a warning if the fuel reserve is less than 20 minutes.\n\n\n2. Performance Page\nUsing the data from your Weight & Balance page the pad calculates:\n- Out of Ground Effect (OGE) ceiling\n- In Ground Effect (IGE) ceiling\nand converts the pressure altitude to feet MSL.\n\nThe pad also calculates \n\n- Density Altitude\n- Maximum Continuous Power (MCP) \n- 5 minute take off power \n- Never Exceed Speed (V ne) \n\nusing the internal data derived from the original helicopter operating handbook.\n\nYou can also experiment with the all values and find the corresponding maximum helicopter weight for the particular environment.\n\n3. Flight Time Page\nThis page is a complete E6B flight computer with a new and revolutionary graphical user interface.

Its going tibia ok, the Skelly app is just what you need! With the Skelly app you can literally pull the inspiration you need right out of your pocket anywhere, anytime!\n\nSkelly is a fully poseable, anatomically correct reference skeleton for artists. A simplified version of the skeleton is also included, named “Robo-Skelly”. These figures were created to make the study of anatomy easier and more enjoyable for students and professionals without leaving your wallets bone dry. They can also be used to inspire poses for drawing, painting, sculpting, illustration, animation, comics, manga, storyboarding, twerking, and to fully understand the anatomy of the human skeleton. No need for super gluteus, Skelly comes pre-assembled and ready to pose as soon as you launch the app! \n\nLearning the structure of the human body is the skeleton key to drawing the figure in an anatomically correct manner without having to clear your browser history to avoid awkward conversations with your loved ones. Whether you want to make works like Michelangelo or Miyazaki, Skelly will help you focus on your art and let you personalize his poses, rather than searching for reference material and hiring models. Learn to draw the skeleton from any angle without the inconvenient and morally questionable need to go grave robbing.\n\nFEATURES:\n \nAnatomically correct skeleton\nSimplified “Robo Skelly”\nProportions based on the teachings of Dr. Paul Richer\nSkull fits perfectly into a “Loomis Head” as taught by Andrew Loomis\nPoseable joints\nPose Library - choose from pre made poses and save your own\nMovable camera\nAdjustable light source\nChoose light or dark background\nReset to neutral “Anatomical Pose”\n\nPEOPLE LOVE IT:\n\nJames Gurney, author of ‘Color and Light’ and ‘Imaginative Realism’ Says:\n\n\"Bend him, twist him, contort him! The Skelly app lets you put a virtual human skeleton into any pose, and to see him from any angle, and in any lighting. It’s a great tool for art students or professionals wondering what the skeleton is really doing beneath a life pose, or for anyone wanting to visualize a pose from scratch. The interface is intuitive to learn and easy to use, without sacrificing any of the nuances of the human body’s complex range of movement. Skelly is a big improvement over the old wooden mannikin.\"\n\n- Chris Oatley, Director Of The Oatley Academy Of Visual Storytelling Says:\n\n\"Skelly is the fastest, most fluid anatomical reference I have ever seen. I was shocked at how easy it is to pose the figure and direct the light source. Finally! It’s the app visual artists have been waiting for.\"\n\nHave any questions? CONTACT US:\n\nskelly@proko.com"

      "label": "\"Fun for the kids and great for learning to read.  Everyone wins.\" - Jen, Kindergarten teacher and mom of three.\n\nI have a confession to make.  My son's favorite game was Fruit Ninja and I was getting increasingly frustrated with having my son waste a lot of time on a fun but mindless game while he was still struggling to learn how to read.\n\nSo I decided to create yet another slicing game with three letter words to help my son learn to read while playing his favorite game.\n\nMy sons skills in recognizing three letter words have dramatically improved since he started playing this game and now I no longer have to feel guilty when I need a five minute break to take care of the laundry or prepare lunch for the kids.  I know that they are having fun and that they are learning at the same time.\n\nWarning: Your child will keep begging for your iPhone or iPad after they try this app.\n\nReading Ninja is an exciting educational game that helps kids rapidly learn to read three letter words by sight, sound, and touch.\n\nThe interface is so easy to use that even a toddler will delight in using this app.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n• Slice your way through all 150 three letter words\n\n• You decide what three letter words to focus on - turn individual categories ON or OFF from the settings page\n\n• Learn by sight, sound, and touch\n\n• Fun game play, sounds, and animations keep kids engaged\n\n• Dynamic game play adjusts difficulty (the number of three letter words) automatically based on player skills to keep kids both challenged and entertained vs. getting bored\n\n• Supports 3 difficulty settings: EASY, MEDIUM, or HARD\n\nEASY MODE:\n- Max 1 three letter word\n- Three letter words move very slowly\n- Great for introducing sight words one at a time\n\nMEDIUM MODE:\n- Starts with 1 three letter word\n- Max of 3 words on screen\n- Three letter words move 30% faster\n\nHARD MODE:\n- Starts with 2 three letter words\n- Max of 5 words on screen\n- Words move even faster\n- Words rotate faster too\n\nAdjust difficulty from settings page.\n\n• Wrong answers do not interfere with gameplay, the child can immediately try again and slice the correct answer (most other games are too slow to keep kids interested by interrupting the gameplay and slowly repeating the desired question)\n\n• Play Reading Ninja from A to Z or in random order (adjustable from settings page)\n\n• Multi-sensory learning tool - combining audio, voice, and touch\n\n• Want to work on just a few three letter words?  No problem… head to the settings page to turn entire categories or individual words on and off\n\n• Want to record your own audios? No problem.  Just click on the category and record your own sound for all three letter words\n\n• Supports three levels of difficulty\n\nHEROIC SUPPORT\n\nHeroic Support is not just what we do.  It's really what makes us, well, us.  It's that drive to make a difference in your life - no matter how big or small.  Really, it's our way of life because we want you to be our customer for a lifetime of fun and learning.\n\nHave questions?  We are here to help.  Email us at support@alligatorapps.com"

      "label": "Every family needs this app!\nRecommended for parents with children ages 5 to 12.\n\nMom, Dad, Where do babies come from?\nAnswer this and other important questions with this first interactive sexual education app for children that want to know how things really work? Beautiful illustrations, fun characters, and playful animation make this an engaging learning tool.\n\nABOUT THE STORY\n6-year-old Clementine has an outsized curiosity about the world around her. As she wrestles with the idea of having a new little brother, she shares her concerns about no longer being an only child, and wonders where is this baby coming from.\n\nClementine’s journey leads her through different milestones in the creation of life, from identifying love around her, through understanding the differences between men and women, to pregnancy and birth.\n\nWherever she goes, her talking camera, Zoom-Zoom, accompanies Clementine as a teacher and friend. By using Zoom-Zoom’s “super features” - Zoom, Speed, Flash, and Wonder Vision™ - children can experience special environments, interact with elements, and learn about them in a fun and engaging way. \n\nAt the end of her journey, Clementine accepts the wonderful new addition to her family and shows newfound responsibility as she helps take care of the newborn... with the reader’s help, of course.\n______________________________\n\nANSWERS TO BIG QUESTIONS\n• What are the differences between a man and a woman?\n• What is sex?\n• How did the baby get into its mom?\n• What does the baby look like and what is it doing?\n• Where will the baby come out from?\n• After the baby is born, will mom and dad still love me just as much?\n______________________________\n\nWHY KIDS LOVE THIS APP?\n• Original art by award-winning illustrator John Skewes\n• Engaging story and characters children can relate to\n• Playful animation and sounds\n• Fun activities and interactions\n• Kid-friendly interface allows guided or independent exploration\n• Kids enjoy collecting 5 unique badges for their achievements\n• Play both on your iPad and iPhone\n______________________________\n\nWHY IS THIS APP IMPORTANT?\nYoung children are like little engineers. They want to know, “Exactly how does it work?”\nThe app has just the right mixture of storytelling and scientific facts to provide fun answers to “How did the baby get in there?” and “How will it get out?” It provides factual information for adults and for children. It opens the door to truth-telling and answering questions that will encourage lifelong discussions in families.\n\nEducated children feel more confident, are more willing to talk and ask questions in a more mature manner. They are also much better protected from sexual abuse and exploitation. Some parents believe that innocence protects childhood. In fact, factual, honest education protects it while abuse destroys it. Children who know the facts are much more likely to speak to their parents and disclose problems if they happen.\n\nThe app also dedicates a special chapter to various types of families as Clementine introduces some of her friends who joined their parents through adoption, donor insemination or surrogacy. This helps children better understand and accept diverse families and relationships in our society. \n______________________________\n\nA WORD FROM OUR CONTENT SPECIALIST\n“I like the humour, the honesty and the portrayal of sexual activity as normal. As someone who has taught sexual health to audiences ranging from preschoolers to grandparents for close to 40 years, I am sure that you and your child will enjoy Where Do Babies Come From? as a starter learning tool.”\n\nMeg Hickling, C.M.,O.B.C., Ll.D.\n\n______________________________\n\nFor your child’s privacy, this app does not collect any personal information.\n\nThe app is supported by:\nThe British Columbia Arts Council and BC Creative"

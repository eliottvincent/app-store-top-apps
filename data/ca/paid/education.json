      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "Flashnote Derby is a fun way for kids to learn and practice reading music notes. \n\nEach race is a timed test in which the student identifies different notes in order to urge their horse on towards the finish line. Answering quickly and correctly will cause their horse to gain ground, while incorrect answers will cause it to fall behind. At the end of each race, students can review the notes they missed and see the correct answers. \n\nPlayers can respond to flashcards by simply playing the note on their acoustic or MIDI instrument. They can also choose to answer by tapping letter buttons or playing a key on an on-screen piano.\n\nThe game is fully customizable to allow for any desired notes in the treble, bass, alto, or tenor clefs to be included. You can select ranges of notes, or several individual notes to focus on specific areas that need work. Notes can be shown with sharps and flats and key signatures can even be added to increase the challenge for more advanced students. The amount of time the player is given for each flashcard can be increased or decreased depending upon their age and level of experience.\n\nDrills can start out simply, with only a handful of notes, and gradually be made more challenging until the full staff is mastered (up to five and a half ledger lines above or below the staff.) The more difficult the settings, the more points are awarded. The 'high score' is tracked so that players always have a goal to shoot for.\n\nAs a bonus, over a dozen instructional video lessons are easily accessible from right inside the app! Even children with no prior music instruction can start using Flashnote Derby right away to begin learning about the music alphabet, the staff, and how to identify different notes.\n\nBecause it can be set up so quickly, Flashnote Derby provides a perfect motivational tool for music teachers to use with students, even for just a minute or two of each lesson. Teachers have the ability to email homework assignments to their students for them to play on their own devices at home. Each player's performance is recorded so that their progress can be tracked. You can easily see which notes are most in need of review.  \n\nWhen students give up on their music lessons, it's usually because they find it too difficult. Learning basic skills early is key to laying the groundwork for future success. Flashnote Derby makes this process more enjoyable and helps students stay motivated in their music learning.\n\nSometimes it takes only a little extra effort to make the difference between success and failure. Download Flashnote Derby and get on the road to music reading mastery today!"

Say the word in the conjugated form indicated.\n(2) Tap the sound icon to check whether you said the conjugated form correctly.\n(3) Tap the ＊ icon to check the conjugated form in writing.\n(4) Study the use of the conjugated form by referring to the example sentence and illustration on the back side of the card.\n(5) Tap the Rule icon to see the conjugation rule.\n\nCheck: Test your retention of each conjugated form by typing in your answers.*\n(1) Type in the conjugated form as instructed.\n(2) If you entered the correct form, the card will be removed from MyDeck. Cards answered incorrectly or skipped will remain in the deck for further practice.\n*To study with the Check method, you will need to add a Japanese keyboard to your iPhone settings before starting.\n\nHandy features\n•Menu\nThe study selections are grouped together in a single menu to allow you to practice more efficiently. \n\n•List\nAll conjugation forms of each word are listed in this feature, with the words arranged in a-i-u-e-o order.

      "label": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

It uses multiple timed stations to assess applicants' non-academic traits such as empathy, interpersonal skills, communication, and self-assessment. \n\nFor many applicants, having limited time to come up with an organized answer to a question prompt can be stressful and is not something that comes naturally. With practice, the process can become significantly less intimidating.

      "label": "Virtual MotivAider® is designed to help users of all ages make desired changes in their own behavior and habits. ​\n\nThis app is intended to replicate much of the functionality of the MotivAider®, an ingeniously simple dedicated electronic device invented by a clinical psychologist. Since 1987, the MotivAider® device has helped thousands of people in over 50 countries make a wide range of desired behavioral changes. \n\nLike the MotivAider® device, Virtual MotivAider® corrects for a largely overlooked glitch in the design of the human mind -- the lack of a dependable mechanism for keeping good intentions \"on the front burner\" of your mind. By repeatedly sending you signals or prompts that remind and urge you to act in accord with any chosen behavioral objective or goal, the app prevents your good intentions from getting lost in the shuffle.  \n\nTo use the app, you first devise a brief personal message – a word, phrase or image -- that serves as a trigger to remind and urge you to take a specific action required to achieve your goal. Next, you simply associate your personal message with the app’s signals or prompts, so that whenever you receive the prompt, you'll automatically think your personal message and be reminded and urged to take the \ndesired action. Then, you set the app to send you prompts – and therefore your personal message – as often as it takes to get the best possible results. \n\nBy design, Virtual MotivAider® is simple and straightforward. It has no bells and whistles to distract you from its singular purpose, which is to keep your attention focused on making whatever change in behavior you decide to make.\n\nVirtual MotivAider® lets you: \n• Choose the type(s) of prompts you’d like to receive – from a simple vibration signal (if your device is capable of vibration) and/or a sound (you can even record your personal message in your own voice) and/or a text notification with your personal message. \n• Get prompts as often as you want – from as often as once every few seconds to as seldom as once a day. \n• Choose whether to get prompts at Regular intervals (for example, once every 5 minutes), at Average intervals (for example, from 15 minutes to one hour apart with an Average of 30 minutes apart), or even at Random intervals (for example, at random intervals that are no less than 10 seconds apart and no more than 10 minutes apart).   \n• Choose how long to have prompting continue before stopping automatically. \n• Pause and resume prompting whenever you want. \n• Create and save multiple behavior change projects. (To achieve the best results, however, we recommend that you work on only one project at a time). \n• Access the same free habit change resources that help users of the dedicated MotivAider® device achieve great results."

      "label": "Bloups permet d’apprendre à lire dans le plaisir… Application entièrement conçue par une orthopédagogue. \n\nDescription du contenu pédagogique de Bloups : (choix de l’accent: français, québécois ou belge) \n\n1) Lecture de syllabes : niveaux de difficulté progressifs \n- syllabes simples (ex. : la, ma, ar, etc.) \n- syllabes comportant des sons simples (ex. : lou, lin, leu, etc.) \n- syllabes comportant des sons complexes (ex. : rouille, rein, gue, etc.) \n- syllabes comportant des confusions visuelles (ex. : bo, do, po) et des confusions auditives (ex. :di, ti) \n\n2) Lecture de mots : \n- mots simples (ex. : rire, tomate, etc.) \n- mots complexes (ex. : combien, explication, etc.) \n- mots irréguliers (ex. : femme, monsieur, etc.) \n\n3) Chronomètre (optionnel) : \n- permet au joueur (qui le souhaite) de toujours améliorer son propre temps en lecture \n\n4) Repère visuel structurant (fiole d’énergie) : \n- indique au joueur le nombre d’items réussis et le nombre d’items restants \n\nParents et pédagogues s’intéressent à cette application éducative, car elle s’adresse aux lecteurs débutants et intermédiaires. Elle est aussi recommandée aux jeunes ayant des difficultés ou des troubles en lecture (ex.: dyslexie d’assemblage, autisme, etc.). \n\nÉtant réalisée par une orthopédagogue, la progression de chaque niveau respecte les étapes d’apprentissage de la lecture syllabique. De ce fait, Bloups représente un défi juste, raisonnable et motivant qui tient compte de la progression propre à chaque enfant. Le focus est porté essentiellement sur la lecture de syllabes; condition essentielle à une bonne rapidité et une bonne justesse en lecture de mots et de phrases. En effet, la lecture de pseudo-mots (ex.: remu, lumiron, bratoir, etc.) oblige l’élève à lire, à décoder correctement chaque syllabe, il ne peut donc pas “deviner” le mot par une lecture globale. Pour être un bon lecteur, il faut, entre autres, maîtriser les deux voix de lecture, c’est-à-dire, la lecture syllabique et la lecture globale. Bloups représente donc une application pour apprendre à lire efficacement. \n\n\nLe contenu pédagogique de cette application favorise essentiellement l’augmentation de la vitesse de lecture, la précision du décodage, l’apprentissage de la fusion phonémique et l’apprentissage de la segmentation de différentes structures syllabiques. Il contribue aussi à l’automatisation de la lecture de sons composés (ex. : ou, on, in, en, an) et de sons complexes (ex. : g, c, aille, ouille, etc). Enfin, la lecture de mots simples, complexes et irréguliers incluse dans Bloups permet au joueur de faire le pont entre la lecture de syllabes et la lecture de mots réels. \n\nBut du jeu : \nLe joueur doit écouter la syllabe, la structure syllabique ou le mot donné oralement pour ensuite repérer la bonne réponse parmi les bulles proposées par les monstres. Après 5 succès, le joueur obtient une page de jeu de 5 secondes et après 20 succès (fiole toute remplie), le joueur est mené vers la découverte d’un nouveau monstre où la complexité de la lecture de syllabes est légèrement plus complexe. Pour l’apprenant, le but est d’amasser le plus de monstres possible et d’améliorer son propre temps s’il reprend un monstre ! Apprendre à bien lire devient alors monstrueusement amusant ! \n\nVariante : \nIl est possible pour l’adulte de déverrouiller préalablement tous les monstres d’une même ligne afin de proposer seulement un monstre précis à l’enfant en fonction de ses besoins particuliers. Par exemple, l’adulte aura déverrouillé les monstres 31 et 32 pour que l’enfant n’ait qu’à faire le monstre 33 travaillant les confusions spatiales et visuelles b, d, p, q."

If you want to know if a particular subject is covered, I'd recommend going to http://www.knittinghelp.com. \n\nOver 170 Knitting Videos in 15 Categories::\n\n* Getting Started \n* Cast-On  \n* Knit\n* Purl\n* Fixing Mistakes \n* Stitch Patterns\n* Bind Off\n* Increases  \n* Decreases\n* Joining Yarn \n* Knitting in the Round\n* Color Knitting\n* Advanced Techniques\n* Finishing/Seaming \n* Miscellaneous \n\nThis app does not include the premium videos from the website or the the 45 minute \"How to Knit: A Complete Introduction.\" beginner series. But all the other free videos from the website are included in this app for quick access. \n\nAlso Amy Finlay has included an introduction section to help new knitters get up to speed. The introduction covers topics such as choosing a first project, selecting yarn and needles, casting on, knit and purl stitches, gauge, and more.\n\nNOTE: Just like on the website, some of the smaller videos do not have sound and are meant to be followed visually. These are typically simpler videos such as increases and decreases and are very easy to discern by watching."

      "label": "Give your child the gift of perfect pitch.\n\nPerfect pitch is impossible to learn as an adult but studies have shown that you can teach it to a child while he or she is still in their language learning stage of development. If you've got a child under 5 then don't miss out on your chance to give them the superpower of perfect pitch.\n\nNever heard of Perfect Pitch?\nSometimes known as absolute pitch, perfect pitch is the ability to hear a note and recognise exactly what note it is. Some people will do interval training as an adult, which is learning to count the tones between notes but a person with perfect pitch could hear a melody, walk over to a piano and repeat the exact thing on their first try. \n\nHow does it work? \nPerfect Pitch Toddler is a collection of games, created to appeal to small children. Each game, as well as being fun to play, teaches children to listen to notes on a piano and identify them. It does this by showing animals that represent the notes on a keyboard; the Ant is the note of A, the Bee is the note of B, and so on. This makes it easy for children to form a strong relationship between the sound and a familiar image, rather than presenting them with the complexities of a traditional keyboard. \n\nThe Games\nThere are currently 8 Games to choose from:\n\nWho's in the Crate?\nGuess what animal's in the crate by listening to the notes as the crate disassembles.\n\nListen and Learn\nThis one's just for little tiny babies. There's no interaction in this game. Just hear the note and see the corresponding animal.\n\nPlay Along\nPlay a nursery rhyme as the notes move along across a stave. Including: Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Row Row Row Your Boat, and Incy Wincy Spider.\n\nUp or Down\nListen to a group of three notes and answer whether the progression is going up or down.\n\nWhack a Note\nHear the note to indicate what animal is about to appear out of a hole. Try to tap it in time.\n\nWhich Floor?\nListen to what octave the note is played at to tell what floor in the house the animal is on.\n\nMatch Two\nTurn the cards and find the matching notes.\n\nSilhouettes\nAnswer what animal is the silhouette.\n\nPerfect Pitch Toddler is completely ad-free and in-app purchase free."

      "label": "Bidule : Une collection de livres pour lecteurs débutants.\r\nCette collection graduée, maintenant offerte en version numérique, a déjà fait ses preuves auprès de milliers d’enfants. Elle permet au jeune lecteur de développer son goût pour la lecture et de devenir rapidement autonome.\r\n\r\nProcurez-les 40 livres de la collection à très petit prix!\r\n\r\nLa collection Bidule a été conçue par une enseignante. Comment transformer l’apprentissage de la lecture en une expérience valorisante et amusante ? Comment amener l’enfant à se sentir bon et capable d’apprendre à lire ? Comment fournir à l’enfant un outil adapté à son rythme d’apprentissage ? Ce sont toutes des questions qui ont amené l’auteure à créer cette collection.\r\nLa collection se divise en trois niveaux :\r\n\r\nLe niveau A : 1 phrase par page; 3 à 8 mots par phrase; structure de phrase simple et répétitive; vocabulaire simple.\r\n\r\n•Les livres 1 à 10 utilisent des verbes simples. Seul le pronom « je » est utilisé comme sujet (ex. : Je joue au ballon). Un verbe par livre.\r\n•Les livres 11 à 15 utilisent les pronoms personnels « il », « elle », « ils » et « elles » (ex. : Bidule met un sac froid sur sa tête. Il mange les cubes de glace.).\r\n•Les livres 16 à 20 permettent de découvrir les notions mathématiques et spatiales simples telles que « à droite/à gauche », « en avant/en arrière », etc. (ex. : Elliot est à droite du mouton.). Un livre porte aussi sur les chiffres 1 à 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nLe niveau B : 1 ou 2 phrases par page; 4 à 9 mots par phrase; structure de phrase simple et légèrement répétitive; courte histoire.\r\n\r\n•Les livres 1 à 10 travaillent un son en particulier et toutes les phrases se terminent par ce même son. On travaille ici la notion de rimes. Les livres 1 à 5 portent sur des sons simples tels que « an/in/on/ou/eau » alors que les livres 6 à 10 portent sur des sons complexes tels que « ette/ille/elle/ouille/eu ».\r\n\r\nLe niveau C : 2 ou 3 phrases par page; 4 à 10 mots par phrase; structure de phrase plus complexe; histoire un peu plus longue.\r\n\r\n•Les livres 1 à 5 travaillent les sons « f/ph », « s/z », « ch », « c doux et c dur »,« g doux et g dur », placés au début, au milieu ou à la fin d’un mot.\r\n•Les livres 6 à 10 initient le lecteur au texte informatif par de courtes histoires sur des thèmes amusants."

      "label": "An educational game for children ages 2-4 from the series \"Kids Learn Words\".\n\nTogether with your child, look at bright, colorful flashcards from the \"human world\" accompanied by sounds, learn the names of these man-made objects, and listen to the sounds they make!\n\nAfter the child has looked through all the flashcards, he or she can take a fun quiz to see how many of the words he or she has learned. Regardless of the number of correct answers given, and of stars earned, the child’s developing skills will be fostered by enthusiastic applause and floating balloons!\n\nThe educational flashcards for kids are divided into the following categories: “Cars and Transport”, “Professions”, “Buildings”, “Musical Instruments”, “Tools”, “Furniture”, “Kitchen Tools” and “Clothing and shoes”. \n\nOne important distinction makes this educational app stand out from the rest: instead of drawings, which are not always easy to identify as a real object, the child will see bright, beautiful and fun-spirited photographs. This will allow the child to “see” each object as it actually appears in the real world, while allowing the parent to tell the child more about this object.\n\nDoes the youngster have an older brother or sister in grade school? They can also use this educational game! In addition to English, this app also supports the Spanish, German and many other languages. \n\nWhile playing with the educational flashcards in a foreign language, a school-age child can effortlessly learn many new words with which to surprise their teachers and classmates. An A+ is guaranteed!\n\nThe youngster does not need to be able to read in order to use this educational app. The simple interface and spoken clues allow even the youngest of children to play and learn independently. \n\nExperience has shown that children love to look through a series of colorful pictures with sounds, and they will ask to see them again and again. According to Glenn Doman, an American physical therapist and the founder of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, participating in these kinds of educational activities (for 5-10 minutes a day) stimulates the development of various regions in the brain. As a result, the child's photographic memory takes shape, the child develops much faster than his or her peers, and, beginning at infancy, the child gains access to a world of encyclopedic knowledge. \n\nThe main point, in which Doman is undoubtedly correct, is that the younger a child, the more easily he or she can absorb new knowledge. It's important to make use of this ability while it's available!\n\nThe app can be used as a supplementary teaching aid in foreign language instruction. Supported languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian."

      "label": "Self-monitoring is an amazingly effective tool for behavior change. \n\nDuring self-monitoring, a student checks their own behavior at specific time intervals. \n\nFor example, a student may check every minute, “Am I on task?”  If the answer is no, the student brings their focus back to the task.  \n\nBy regularly completing self-checking sessions, the student’s on-task time will increase.\n\nThe Happy Frog Self-Monitoring app allows you to set up self-monitoring tasks for your students to access independently.\n\nYou specify the self-check question, how often to check, and how long a session should run.  As the desired behavior increases, you can increase the time between check-ins and eventually fade the app.\n\nYou can set the app to use sound reminders, vibration reminders (iPhone only) or only visual reminders, so the app can be used in classrooms without disturbing other students. \n\nUp to 9 students can be accommodated within the app, with up to 5 tasks per student.\n\nYou can enter mastery criteria for each task. The app identifies which goals have been mastered.  Use this feature to provide additional rewards for students who would benefit from additional motivation.\n\nThe self-monitoring app is the easiest way to make progress on difficult -to-change behaviors such as:\n- staying on task\n- responding positively to peers\n- complying with teacher requests\n- staying in assigned location\n- taking body breaks on schedule\n- checking for comprehension while reading\n- calling out\n\nTeachers can also use the self-monitoring app to remind themselves to look for positive behaviors, call on quieter students, etc.\n\nStudents love the self-monitoring app because of the independence and privacy it provides. \n\nDoes your learner have a challenging behavior that requires constant check-in?  The self-monitoring app could change everything for your student!\n\nOur self-monitoring app is based on the extensive research on the effectiveness of self-monitoring. Self-monitoring works for kids with Autism, ADHD and any other challenges.  Give your kids the power to change!\n\n*** Please note ***\nThe app must remain open for the alerts to occur.  Closing the app will pause the monitoring.\n\nWe take customer service very seriously. If you ever have a problem or find that you’ve missed something, contact us at our website and we’ll fix the problem ASAP!\n\nHappy Frog Apps adheres to COPPA Children’s Privacy Act.

      "label": "Prepare for the USMLE with a focus on clinically oriented material. Our app features several tools aimed at teaching you the fundamentals of medicine in short bursts. Install the app today and gain complete access to everything USMLE clinic has to offer.\n\n-        All features are available offline\n\n-        All future updates and new features are included with your original purchase\n\n-        No locked features, micro transactions, or subscriptions\n\n \nChest X-rays\nAccurate interpretation of conventional thoracic radiography is essential in clinical practice. Medical students and interns are expected to thoroughly evaluate a chest x-ray and then concisely report their findings in detail. However, obtaining the necessary skills to do to so with confidence can be frustrating. Introductory books can be expensive and still leave a lot to be desired. Studying from too many sources can be tiresome and confusing. Sometimes it can be surprisingly difficult to simply identify an abnormality. Have you ever read a description of an X-ray and wondered what it is exactly that you should be looking for? At other times it can be easy to locate the pathology but finding the appropriate terminology to articulate the morphologic details proves cumbersome. The aim of this learning tool is to enable you to recognize common and life-threatening conditions and provide an objective analysis. We have created a unique overlay for each X-ray image in this app to clearly highlight the relevant findings. The USMLE Clinic app currently provides over 30 AP chest X-rays with overlays and descriptions, but with many more on the way soon. \n \nECGs\nLearning electrocardiography is like learning a new language. The skill is a beautiful art that demystifies patterns and opens the door to communication with the heart. The waves and lines are the cardiac pen strokes, writing a letter to tell you of its current disposition. Although the task may initially seem daunting, the experience is worthwhile, and the ability is a must. The ECG images in this app come with colorful overlays, illustrations, and comprehensive, yet succinct descriptions. We hope that this visually oriented tool will help you develop the clinical acumen to feel like a fluent speaker of electrocardiography.\n \nFlashcards\nHere you will find lectures with pages of information on a single flashcard -albeit a rather dynamic one. The goal of these lectures is to help you avoid pitfalls and to prepare you for the inconspicuous complexity of common conditions. Because sometimes, even the most well-defined illnesses can yield tricky questions that require in-depth knowledge of contemporary algorithms. The field of medicine is extremely vast, and it is simply impossible to learn all of it. Thus, it helps to keep focus on material that will simplify your life in a clinical setting. That's why this app places an emphasis on the clinical manifestation of disease, targeted patient evaluation, and evidence-based management strategies.\n \nInfographics\nIf our flashcards are macaroni, then our infographics are the cheese! They provide a visual review of similar conditions, algorithms, clinical scores, and more. Check them out and let us know what you think.\n \nFundoscopy/Otoscopy\nHere we provide brief descriptions of several important images of the retina and the middle ear. Recognition of common conditions (e.g., otitis media, papilledema) is crucial, but we also included a few “zebras” just for good measure.\n \nThat's pretty much the gist of it for now. We hope that you will find our app to be a useful supplement to your studies and that it will help to alleviate some of the stress of becoming a doctor!"

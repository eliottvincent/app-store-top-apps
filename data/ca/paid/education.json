      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "From the charity behind the award-winning Teach Your Monster To Read comes Teach Your Monster: Adventurous Eating, a brand new learning game that helps kids get excited about fruit and vegetables.  \n \nAdventurous Eating is a game for kids developed with child feeding specialist Dr Lucy Cooke inspired by The SAPERE method. This scientific learning technique encourages children to learn new things about food using all five senses; sight, touch, smell, hearing and taste.\n \nWhy Adventurous Eating?\n\nThis game is packed full of fun mini-games that encourage 3 to 6 year olds to explore foods with all five of their senses and help build a better relationship with food. We know that children respond well to feeding or caring for a character, so the game encourages kids to try fruit and veg by using all of their senses, as research shows this is an effective way of making new food less intimidating.\n \nHow does Adventurous Eating work?\n\nThe game starts with your child making their monster who goes to Bub’s Food Party at Tasty Towers. Guided by Bub, they play a fun mini-game at each of the five tables at the party, one for each sense. Watch their monster explore over 40 different fruit and vegetables with all five senses and see the ‘wow moment’ as they start to see food in a new way! Just like in real life, different monsters like different foods, so the monsters won't always like the food they try, and that's OK—next time, they might.\n\nThe idea of the game is to become an adventurous eater by earning stars every time their monster uses one of their senses with a new fruit or vegetable. These stars give the monster access to the exclusive disco party, where they will hear a unique, catchy song for every fruit and vegetable they try. After the disco, the party ends, and everyone goes home with a sticker for their sticker book showing the food they’ve explored that day. Monsters can collect a sticker for each food they’ve tried and customise it with a silly face and body parts to make it even more fun. Then it’s off to bed, where the monster dreams about what food they have tried that day! \n\nHow can Adventurous Eating help my child?\n\nThe early results of the game are impressive, having been played over 1.3 million times by 350,000 children worldwide. After playing the game, the children try new fruits and vegetables and ask when they can play again to ensure their monster goes to the disco party! In addition, over half of the parents said their children would have a healthier relationship with food after playing Teach Your Monster: Adventurous Eating. So why not start your little one on their food adventure too? \n\n \nAbout Us\n \nWe are Teach Your Monster - a non-profit that creates magical, fun-filled learning games for kids. \n\nWith the help of friendly monsters, playful design, and magnificent storytelling, we work with leading academics to create beautifully crafted games kids love to play. Trusted by teachers, parents, and home educators, our innovative products aim to engage even the most reluctant learners.\n \nTeach Your Monster works with The Usborne Foundation — a charity set up by Peter Usborne CBE of Usborne Publishing, to support early years learning. We believe every child should have the opportunity to reach their full potential in their early years and beyond.\n\nFollow us on social media for the latest news:\nFacebook:  @TeachYourMonster\nInstagram: @teachyourmonster\nYouTube:  @teachyourmonster\nTwitter:  @teachmonsters\n\nWhat food shall we try today?\n\n© Teach Your Monster Limited, 2022"

      "label": "Bloups permet d’apprendre à lire dans le plaisir… Application entièrement conçue par une orthopédagogue. \n\nDescription du contenu pédagogique de Bloups : (choix de l’accent: français, québécois ou belge) \n\n1) Lecture de syllabes : niveaux de difficulté progressifs \n- syllabes simples (ex. : la, ma, ar, etc.) \n- syllabes comportant des sons simples (ex. : lou, lin, leu, etc.) \n- syllabes comportant des sons complexes (ex. : rouille, rein, gue, etc.) \n- syllabes comportant des confusions visuelles (ex. : bo, do, po) et des confusions auditives (ex. :di, ti) \n\n2) Lecture de mots : \n- mots simples (ex. : rire, tomate, etc.) \n- mots complexes (ex. : combien, explication, etc.) \n- mots irréguliers (ex. : femme, monsieur, etc.) \n\n3) Chronomètre (optionnel) : \n- permet au joueur (qui le souhaite) de toujours améliorer son propre temps en lecture \n\n4) Repère visuel structurant (fiole d’énergie) : \n- indique au joueur le nombre d’items réussis et le nombre d’items restants \n\nParents et pédagogues s’intéressent à cette application éducative, car elle s’adresse aux lecteurs débutants et intermédiaires. Elle est aussi recommandée aux jeunes ayant des difficultés ou des troubles en lecture (ex.: dyslexie d’assemblage, autisme, etc.). \n\nÉtant réalisée par une orthopédagogue, la progression de chaque niveau respecte les étapes d’apprentissage de la lecture syllabique. De ce fait, Bloups représente un défi juste, raisonnable et motivant qui tient compte de la progression propre à chaque enfant. Le focus est porté essentiellement sur la lecture de syllabes; condition essentielle à une bonne rapidité et une bonne justesse en lecture de mots et de phrases. En effet, la lecture de pseudo-mots (ex.: remu, lumiron, bratoir, etc.) oblige l’élève à lire, à décoder correctement chaque syllabe, il ne peut donc pas “deviner” le mot par une lecture globale. Pour être un bon lecteur, il faut, entre autres, maîtriser les deux voix de lecture, c’est-à-dire, la lecture syllabique et la lecture globale. Bloups représente donc une application pour apprendre à lire efficacement. \n\n\nLe contenu pédagogique de cette application favorise essentiellement l’augmentation de la vitesse de lecture, la précision du décodage, l’apprentissage de la fusion phonémique et l’apprentissage de la segmentation de différentes structures syllabiques. Il contribue aussi à l’automatisation de la lecture de sons composés (ex. : ou, on, in, en, an) et de sons complexes (ex. : g, c, aille, ouille, etc). Enfin, la lecture de mots simples, complexes et irréguliers incluse dans Bloups permet au joueur de faire le pont entre la lecture de syllabes et la lecture de mots réels. \n\nBut du jeu : \nLe joueur doit écouter la syllabe, la structure syllabique ou le mot donné oralement pour ensuite repérer la bonne réponse parmi les bulles proposées par les monstres. Après 5 succès, le joueur obtient une page de jeu de 5 secondes et après 20 succès (fiole toute remplie), le joueur est mené vers la découverte d’un nouveau monstre où la complexité de la lecture de syllabes est légèrement plus complexe. Pour l’apprenant, le but est d’amasser le plus de monstres possible et d’améliorer son propre temps s’il reprend un monstre ! Apprendre à bien lire devient alors monstrueusement amusant ! \n\nVariante : \nIl est possible pour l’adulte de déverrouiller préalablement tous les monstres d’une même ligne afin de proposer seulement un monstre précis à l’enfant en fonction de ses besoins particuliers. Par exemple, l’adulte aura déverrouillé les monstres 31 et 32 pour que l’enfant n’ait qu’à faire le monstre 33 travaillant les confusions spatiales et visuelles b, d, p, q."

      "label": "The latest question pools are always available for download! Finally an offline-enabled mobile app with all of the features from HamStudy.org! Use this app to study for your US Amateur Radio License -- our question pools are always up to date and always have the current question pools because the app can download updates from the website whenever you are connected to the internet.\n\nDesigned and written by hams with volunteer examiner experience and Sponsored by Icom, this is not your typical study app -- most study apps will focus on practice exams, which is somewhat like studying for your math test by throwing darts at your textbook. Though HamStudy is not a full instructional tool our app is focussed on providing you with the tools you need to study the parts of the question pool that you most need to see.\n\nOur intelligent Study Mode tracks your progress as you move through the pool, providing you with full statistics on what you've seen and giving you the visibility into where you need to study. It will automatically repeat questions as needed. When you don't understand something you can tap the \"explain\" button to view an explanation of the question. Practice Exams make it easy to see how close you are to passing and see what areas to focus on in Study Mode.\n\nShare your progress with your friends or instructor and study together!\n\n* Study *all* current US Amateur Radio question pools (Technician, General, Amateur Extra) -- updates can be downloaded for free when they become available. Additional pools, such as the FCC commercial pools and the Canadian pools, are also available for download in the app. \n\n* This app is not a study guide, it is a directed study tool centered around the questions; there are explanations contributed by users for most pools which do help in learning, but some users may want to pair the app with a study manual to get the most out of both.\n\n* HamStudy's revolutionary Study Modes work with you to ensure you learn the questions; they automatically track your progress and adjust the pace to keep you challenged but not frustrated. User-submitted explanations help you avoid the pitfall of just memorizing answers. Synchronize with your online HamStudy.org account to prevent data loss and be able to switch devices easily.\n\n* Share your progress with other HamStudy.org users and help each other keep progressing towards that next license exam!"

      "label": "\"A great way to give parents a break and let your kid have fun and learn to read at the same time.\" - Jen, Kindergarten teacher and mom of three.\r\n\r\nI have a confession to make.  My son's favorite game was Fruit Ninja and I was getting increasingly frustrated with having my son waste a lot of time on a fun but mindless game while he was still struggling to master his sight words and learning to read. \r\n\r\nSo I decided to create our very own Sight Words slicing game and to my and my son's delight, he now has a new favorite game where he is having fun and learning at the same time. \r\n\r\nMy sons skills in recognizing Sight Words have dramatically improved since he started playing this game and now I no longer have to feel guilty when I need a five minute break to take care of the laundry or prepare lunch for the kids.  I know that they are having fun and that they are learning at the same time.\r\n\r\nWarning: Your child will keep begging for your iPhone or iPad after they try this app.\r\n\r\nSight Words Ninja is an exciting educational game that helps kids rapidly learn sight words by sight, sound, and touch.  \r\n\r\nThe interface is so easy to use that even a 9 month old baby will delight in using this app. \r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n\r\n• Slice your way through all sights words from preschool to grade 3\r\n\r\n• You decide what to focus on - turn individual categories ON or OFF from the settings page\r\n\r\n• Learn by sight, sound, and touch\r\n\r\n• Fun game play, sounds, and animations keep kids engaged\r\n\r\n• Dynamic game play adjusts difficulty (the number of sight words) automatically based on player skills to keep kids both challenged and entertained vs. getting bored\r\n\r\n• Supports 3 difficulty settings: EASY, MEDIUM, or HARD\r\n\r\nEASY MODE:\r\n- Max 1 sight word\r\n- Sight words move very slowly\r\n- Great for introducing sight words one at a time\r\n\r\nMEDIUM MODE:\r\n- Starts with 1 sight word\r\n- Max of 3 sight words on screen\r\n- Sight words move 30% faster\r\n\r\nHARD MODE:\r\n- Starts with 2 sight words\r\n- Max of 5 sight words on screen\r\n- Sight words move even faster\r\n- Sight words rotate faster too\r\n\r\nAdjust difficulty from settings page. \r\n \r\n• Wrong answers do not interfere with gameplay, the child can immediately try again and slice the correct answer (most other games are too slow to keep kids interested by interrupting the gameplay and slowly repeating the desired question)\r\n\r\n• Play Sight Words from A to Z or in random order (adjustable from settings page)\r\n\r\n• Multi-sensory learning tool - combining audio, voice, and touch\r\n\r\n• Want to work on just a few Sight Words?  No problem… head to the settings page to turn entire categories or individual Sight Words on and off\r\n\r\n• Want to record your own audios? No problem.  Just click on the category and record your own Sight Words sounds \r\n\r\n• Supports three levels of difficulty \r\n\r\nHEROIC SUPPORT\r\n\r\nHeroic Support is not just what we do.  It's really what makes us, well, us.  It's that drive to make a difference in your life - no matter how big or small.  Really, it's our way of life because we want you to be our customer for a lifetime of fun and learning.\r\n\r\n\r\nHave questions?  We are here to help.  Email us at support@grasshopperapps.com"

      "label": "Hit the Button Math is an app designed to help develop mental math and calculation skills.\n\nThe app is aimed at 5-11 year olds. There are 166 different game modes of varying difficulty so it is useful throughout grades K-5. Answer as many questions as possible in minute-long games, or you can now practice without the pressure of a countdown timer - a feature which is new for 2019. Questions are randomly generated which means it is very replayable. The game has been carefully designed for children, with large, widely spaced buttons. We recommend that young children play on a tablet.\n\nSix main topics are covered: \n\n* Times tables - up to 10 or 12 \n* Division - up to 10 or 12\n* Square numbers\n* Number bonds\n* Doubling \n* Halving\n\nBetween these topics, the four standard arithmetic operations are covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nYou can create up to 30 player profiles per device to track an individual's high scores (increased from 15 in 2019). If you prefer there's also the option to play as a guest. All data is stored locally on your device so you don't have to worry about privacy issues. We've also made it very easy for children to quickly switch between profiles after playing a game, if they're sharing a device.\n\nAfter each game, the score achieved is displayed along with the child's high score. Bronze, silver or gold stars and trophies are awarded depending on the score achieved in each game."

A scenario consists of one or more vessels representing the rule being illustrated as well as all of the lights and shapes corresponding to the Regulations’ requirements. The corresponding rules are displayed with each scenario.\r\n\r\nThe camera can be moved to allow users to view the scenes from various angles: zoom in, zoom out and rotate around the vessel(s) shown, making the navigation lights’ visibility arcs easy to see. \r\n\r\nThe ambient lighting can be adjusted to view scenes at both day time and night time.\r\n\r\nThe application features two types of representation: “realistic” and “coloured dots”. “Realistic” representation is used to view a scene as closely to reality as possible. “Coloured dots” are used exclusively for teaching purposes and simply show where the different lights are positioned so that users can better differentiate them. \r\n\r\nThe application currently supports two display languages (French and English)."

      "label": "Open up the world-famous Peekaboo Barn, perfect for toddlers. \n\nInside the little bouncing barn, friendly farm animals are waiting to pop out and surprise your little one. Try and guess who they are; tap the doors to find out! More animals, animations, and sounds than ever.\n\nWork with your child to learn the names of animals and hear the sounds they make. Younger children will love opening the barn doors to find new animal animations, as they learn about cause and effect and become familiar with animal names and sounds. Older children will enjoy guessing animals by sound, then seeing the animal names, which helps develop early literacy skills.  \n\nMultiple Language Features:\n\nWe started with a child's voice in English. It's her real voice, which some kids really enjoy, but she does say \"wabbit\" and \"wooster.\" If this is a concern for you, you can switch to any of 12 adult voices; our adult narrators say everything clearly and perfectly, just like the teachers they are. You can try many languages from around the world—or record your own language, or grandma's voice. There are tons of ways to explore the languages of Peekaboo Barn!\n\nPress the Language button on the Options screen to try them out.\n\n—Choose from the built-in narrators: child's voice in young English; adult's voice in American English or Spanish.\n—World languages also included: Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, German, French, Australian, and UK English. \n—Record your own voice: We added this feature so parents, children, and visiting relatives and friends can capture their own voices and star in Peekaboo Barn.  Now you can record the animal names in your native language--or grandma's voice, or grandpa's--and, if you're recording a new language, you can save the appropriate written version too, and both will show up the next time you play. (Please note, we can only support the writing systems that are supported by your device.)\n\nFEATURED BY APPLE \nOne of the first apps to be released for toddlers, since 2008 Peekaboo Barn has been downloaded over a million times, and played over 100 million times worldwide.  It has been a top 20 educational game on the iTunes store nearly every day since its launch, and has been featured by Apple often.  It won The Best Toddler App Ever award in 2009, and was named one of the top 50 iPhone apps for kids by Babble.com in 2010 and 2011.  It is recommended by The New York Times, MSNBC, USA Today, Wired, Telegraph UK, Ireland’s The Independent, Parents Magazine, and the Washington Post.\n\nPeekaboo Barn was made for you and your toddler by artists and educators, not marketers, robots, or companies repackaging clip art. Our team has backgrounds in cognitive science and child development, and we’ve worked in educational media everywhere from Penguin USA to the Smithsonian Institution. When you could really use a safe distraction--in airports, restaurants, and waiting rooms--or you'd like to try something new with your little genius, Peekaboo Barn is the educational, artful solution. Enjoy! \n\nIf you are looking for more Peekaboo, check out our awesome cousins: Peekaboo Fridge, Peekaboo Forest, and Peekaboo Wild.\n\nIf your kids are ready for a more complex game with the same great characters, please try Peekaboo Barn Farm Day! Many activities to try: for example, you can milk the cow, shear the sheep and llama, and pet the animals to help them fall sleep.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/nightanddaystudios. \nTwitter: @nightdaystudios \nYour privacy is important to us!

It is not intended for screen-sharing/mirroring to other devices, due to built-in IP technology. For PARENTS & KIDS. it's the perfect way to \"learn & play\" with the Secrets to support reading & writing at home!\n\nThis app doesn't just “practice” phonics skills, it TEACHES them with trademarked, brain-based stories that explain the sounds letters make when they get together and pictures to help kids remember for reading & writing. Perfect for beginning and struggling readers of any age, Secret Stories® provides logical explanations for letter sound behavior that learners' brains crave!\n\nPHONICS WITH THE BRAIN IN MIND\nSecret Stories Better Alphabet™ Song is the fastest and easiest way to learn individual letters & sounds—using muscle memory to fast-track mastery in as little as 2 weeks! At the same time, kids are also learning the ‘grown-up’ reading & writing \"Secrets,\" which help them make sense of the sounds letters make when they get together in words.\n\nFor example, did you know that AU/AW are in love, and they get so embarrassed when they stand together, they always say, “Awww” (ex. saw, August); or that T&H don’t get along, and always stick their tongues out at each other and say, “Thhh!” (ex. the, this); or that ER/IR/UR are terrible, awful, horrible drivers that always slam on the brakes, “Errr!” (ex. her, bird, turn)? There are even sneaky letters, like Y, who stole the sounds of /E/ & /I/, but won’t use them unless he’s at the END of a word and thinks that no one will see him! (ex. yes, by, mommy)\n\nNO MORE telling kids, “It just is...It just does...You just have to remember!” when trying to explain all the crazy sounds that letters make. Now you can just tell them the Secrets! \n\nAPP FEATURES\n\nFast-Track the ABCs!\n • Better Alphabet™ Song for fast mastery of individual letters & sounds\n • Highlighted letter-tracking to reinforce sound-symbol connections\n • Targeted practice & random play\n\nFast-Track Phonics Skills!\n • Secret Stories® Sound Pictures to reference for reading & writing\n • Play the “secret” stories that explain each phonics sound\n • Play the sound/s that correspond with each Secret Story phonics pattern\n • Targeted practice & random play for reinforcement of sounds (for reading) & phonics patterns (for writing/spelling)\n\nPARENT FEEDBACK\n“One week in and I’ve already seen a difference in my son! He’s sounding out word after word. A month ago, he crawled under his bed crying and calling himself stupid, and today, he is looking for words to sound out!\"\n\n“No matter how long we worked, the letters & sounds weren’t sticking. Then we found the Better Alphabet and in 2 weeks, he knew them ALL!”\n\n“My son is THRIVING! He’s not the same reader he was 5 months ago. We’re even reconsidering his dyslexic label, as his improvement has been so drastic. He used to avoid reading at all costs and now he loves finding Secrets in words and trying to decode them. He’s finally fallen in love with reading!\"\n\n“There’s nothing else like it! The phonics stories take no effort for kids to remember. They just see it and get it! If they can’t read or spell a word, all they have to do is look at the Secrets to find the sound or spelling pattern. I can’t say enough about the difference they’ve made!”\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK\n“I added the Better Alphabet to my routine and am amazed what my kids picked up in the past 2 weeks! They’ve learned more letters & sounds this month than all of last year!”\n\n“The Secrets are my ‘secret weapon‘ for teaching tricky phonics skills! We use them for everything, from sounding out new words in reading lessons, to spelling words in writing lessons. The best part is, they work with anything!”\n\n\"Secret Stories is my most prized resource. It helps kids instantly identify phonics sounds in words. I recommend it to all my parents because I know the difference it makes!\""

Its going tibia ok, the Skelly app is just what you need! With the Skelly app you can literally pull the inspiration you need right out of your pocket anywhere, anytime!\n\nSkelly is a fully poseable, anatomically correct reference skeleton for artists. A simplified version of the skeleton is also included, named “Robo-Skelly”. These figures were created to make the study of anatomy easier and more enjoyable for students and professionals without leaving your wallets bone dry. They can also be used to inspire poses for drawing, painting, sculpting, illustration, animation, comics, manga, storyboarding, twerking, and to fully understand the anatomy of the human skeleton. No need for super gluteus, Skelly comes pre-assembled and ready to pose as soon as you launch the app! \n\nLearning the structure of the human body is the skeleton key to drawing the figure in an anatomically correct manner without having to clear your browser history to avoid awkward conversations with your loved ones. Whether you want to make works like Michelangelo or Miyazaki, Skelly will help you focus on your art and let you personalize his poses, rather than searching for reference material and hiring models. Learn to draw the skeleton from any angle without the inconvenient and morally questionable need to go grave robbing.\n\nFEATURES:\n \nAnatomically correct skeleton\nSimplified “Robo Skelly”\nProportions based on the teachings of Dr. Paul Richer\nSkull fits perfectly into a “Loomis Head” as taught by Andrew Loomis\nPoseable joints\nPose Library - choose from pre made poses and save your own\nMovable camera\nAdjustable light source\nChoose light or dark background\nReset to neutral “Anatomical Pose”\n\nPEOPLE LOVE IT:\n\nJames Gurney, author of ‘Color and Light’ and ‘Imaginative Realism’ Says:\n\n\"Bend him, twist him, contort him! The Skelly app lets you put a virtual human skeleton into any pose, and to see him from any angle, and in any lighting. It’s a great tool for art students or professionals wondering what the skeleton is really doing beneath a life pose, or for anyone wanting to visualize a pose from scratch. The interface is intuitive to learn and easy to use, without sacrificing any of the nuances of the human body’s complex range of movement. Skelly is a big improvement over the old wooden mannikin.\"\n\n- Chris Oatley, Director Of The Oatley Academy Of Visual Storytelling Says:\n\n\"Skelly is the fastest, most fluid anatomical reference I have ever seen. I was shocked at how easy it is to pose the figure and direct the light source. Finally! It’s the app visual artists have been waiting for.\"\n\nHave any questions? CONTACT US:\n\nskelly@proko.com"

      "label": "Welcome aboard your rocket ship to the next level of Japanese.\n\nHuman Japanese Intermediate is packed with content and features that will take your Japanese language skills to the next level. If you liked the first HJ, you'll love Intermediate. (And if you're new to Human Japanese, welcome aboard! Find a full list of content by chapter at www.humanjapanese.com/intermediate.)\n\nIn Human Japanese Intermediate, you'll find:\n\n- More than 40 illuminating chapters\n- Over 2600 example sentences and dialogs with crystal-clear recordings of male and female speech\n- Kanji animations, tips, illustrations, and more\n- Photos and cultural notes to keep you engaged and energized\n- Intelligent quizzes that track your history and help you focus on trouble spots\n- INGREDIENTS™ example sentence breakdowns for total clarity in every example\n\nLike its predecessor, Human Japanese Intermediate is built on the idea that the best way to learn and truly comprehend Japanese is to have it explained by someone who speaks your language. Core concepts are explained in a friendly, down-to-earth tone, with frequent comparisons to similar aspects of English. With humor and warmth, it demystifies and illuminates the real nuts-and-bolts of the language--not just vocabulary and canned phrases like many other products.\n\nExplanations come alive with deeply interwoven interactive example sentences--more than 2600 in total--so that you can immediately see and hear exactly what you're learning.\n\nStay on track with an exciting new patent-pending feature called INGREDIENTS™ example sentence breakdowns. Next to every sentence is an icon that provides an instantaneous, simultaneous lookup of every word in the sentence, even conjugated forms! That means you'll never lose your flow in the middle of an interesting discussion just because you've momentarily forgotten the meaning of a word.\n\nKANJI\nHuman Japanese Intermediate also gets into kanji in a big way. At the end of most chapters, a new batch of kanji is introduced, with animations of each character, plus example sentences, illustrations, writing tips, and more. Our goal is not to simply throw a bag of characters in your lap, but to carefully explain how everything works.\n\nTo this end, Human Japanese Intermediate keeps track of which kanji you've learned at what point in the text and automatically adjusts the \"spelling\" of words in example sentences as appropriate to your current knowledge. So early on, you might encounter the following sentence:\n\nそのひとの　なまえを　しらない。\n\nBut later, after you've met several of kanji used in these words, the version you would see is:\n\nその人の　名前を　知らない。\n\nThis approach removes the most overwhelming aspect of learning kanji--the fact that most sentences contain many characters you don't yet know--and that helps you to stay focused and energized.\n\nQUIZZES\nStay sharp with five different kinds of quizzes: chapter reviews, vocab, conjugation, kanji stroke order, and kanji flashcard.\n\nQuizzes keep track of which questions you get right and wrong, to help you concentrate on your trouble spots.\n\nAnd when you get a question wrong, it's not simply \"Try again.\" Wherever possible, the quiz provides a hint that is specific to that question, to help you remember and learn.\n\nPHOTOS AND CULTURAL NOTES\nWe've packed Human Japanese with hundreds of photos, illustrations, and cultural asides to keep you interested and energized. You'll find tours of hotels, train stations, convenience stores, supermarkets, kissaten (coffee shops), temples, and more.\n\nLEARN JAPANESE WITH US\nWe care deeply about helping you to grow in your understanding of Japanese. Whether you've worked through the original Human Japanese app or have come from a different background, it will be our pleasure and privilege to be your guide on the next stage of your journey. Hajimemashou!"

      "label": "Take the guess work out of parenting and discover the joy of knowing what your baby has to say before she can talk! One of the most fundamental human desires is to be understood - help your baby communicate by teaching her baby sign language.\n\nThis app includes approx. 340 signs and over 1 hour of real life video demonstrations! The friendly presenters in the 'Baby Sign Language Dictionary' app will help you to learn to sign with your baby in an engaging and enjoyable way.\n\nThe keyword signs demonstrated in this video dictionary are based on American Sign Language (ASL). All signs have been carefully selected for their ease of use, helpfulness to carers and appropriateness for baby's interests and daily routine.\n\nEach sign has a detailed video tutorial covering information such as: simple instructions on how to perform the sign, clever tips to help you remember the sign and practical suggestions on how to introduce the sign to your baby.\n\nThe signs are also organized into categories such as: action words, animals, daily routines, feelings and emotions, food, manners and behavior, and nature – all of which are arranged alphabetically for quick and easy searching.\n\nTo test your baby signing knowledge, the app also comes with a fun interactive video quiz that will help you learn and remember the signs. You can also mark signs as part of your favorites list.\n\nOther key features:\n     • high quality graphics and videos optimized for viewing on Retina displays.\n     • optional setting to allow continuous play through of all signs in a category.\n     • swipe through the signs in a category without returning to the menu.\n     • optional setting to view a simplified demonstration for a sign rather than the complete tutorial.\n\nThis app makes the perfect parent's companion to the popular 'Baby Sign and Learn' animated apps (also available on the App Store).  Featuring gentle guidance and practical advice, this app has been designed to help make teaching your baby to sign as easy as waving “bye-bye”!\n\nVisit http://www.babysignandlearn.com for more information about baby sign language.\n\nNOTE TO PARENTS ABOUT SAFETY\n• This app contains age-appropriate content for preschoolers.\n• This app contains items that can be purchased for real money. This app contains a parental gate to stop your little ones making unauthorized purchases. You can turn off in-app purchases completely by disabling in-app purchases in your device’s settings.\n• This app contains parental gates to prevent your child following links out of the app to websites or social networks, or other apps without your knowledge."

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

The milestones covered in the app start at age 18 months and now go up to age 5! \n\n\r\nThese milestones are the notorious “stages” or “phases” that children go through. These are those times when children “act up,” but it’s because new skills are emerging. This work documents both what the irritating behavior is and what the new skills are. Simply enter your child’s due date into the app, and a calendar is generated with their expected developmental milestones. Simply click on any colored date and get instant information about your child! Add as many children as you want. \r\n\nThe app currently offers the milestones, whereas the Observant Mom website and book series, Misbehavior is Growth, offers parenting tips and tricks for the milestones. Current work for older milestones (age 5+) can also be found at the website, The Observant Mom. \n\n\nAbout the App:\n\n\nØ  Click on any colored date and instantly find out what developmental milestone your child is (or will be) in!\n\n\nØ  The milestones in the app currently go from eighteen months through age four, ending at four.\n\n\nØ  Older milestones will be added to the app as they are finalized.\n\n\nØ  Older milestones can still be found on the website.\n\n\nØ  You may add as many children as you want!\n\n\nCountless have said that this work helps them stay patient as a parent or caregiver. Be sure to share this information with family and friends. It’s not misbehavior: it’s growth!"

Gain an understanding of what the \"vortex of creation\" means and how you can use meditation to enter the vortex in order to allow the Law of Attraction to work for you. Also gain valuable insights about what happens to your affirmations and manifestation efforts when you are out of the vortex.  Five guided meditation audio sessions with music are included in this app.  \n\nListeners will be led by Abraham through four guided meditation sessions on these topics: General Well-Being, Financial Abundance, Physical Well-Being and Relationships.   Each guided meditation experience is 15 minutes long.   \n\nThis Vortex of Attraction Guided Meditation iPhone App is an exact duplicate of the physical product and includes the complete written text, and the complete audio recording along with an extra bonus track of guided meditation music which was not included with the original product.\n\nMany people exert manifestation and Law of Attraction efforts outside of the Vortex, and then conclude that the Law of Attraction \"doesn't work.\" Find out how to stop efforting and start allowing the Vortex of Creation to align you with the life you desire.  These are the first guided meditation recordings ever produced containing the Teachings of Abraham."

Colorful heroes boldly roll where no Thinkroll has rolled before, in over 200 mazes set across seven unique planets.\n\nA cast of oddball aliens will make you grin from ear to ear. But you’ll need brains and nimble fingers to reach your goal—and catch the waiting UFO that will beam your Thinkroll to the next fun-filled planet.\n\nCLOSE ENCOUNTERS\n\nThinkrolls and Thinkrolls 2 introduced our revolving heroes. Thinkrolls: Kings & Queens added exciting new concepts—and dragons. Now Thinkrolls Space blasts the award-winning series into outer space.\n\nYou’ll meet goo monsters, bleeping robots, spring-like soprano aliens, and cheese monsters who love munching moon cheese. You’ll face vanishing rainbow bridges, plasma fields, teleporters—and more. \n\nEach of these can help or hinder.

      "label": "Pinyin, short for Hanyu Pinyin, means \"phonetic notation\" or \"phonetic symbols\". Pin means \"spelling\" and Yin means \"sound(s)\". Pinyin is a system of romanization (phonemic notation and transcription to Roman script) for Standard Mandarin. There are 21 initials/consonants and 35 finals/vowels in Mandarin.\n\nPronunciation of Mandarin comes with two aspects: syllables and tones. Each can be practised separately, but when it comes to speaking, learners must pronounce words with proper tones. \n\nA Mandarin syllable consists of three components: an initial, a final and a tone. The initial and final sounds make a total of 56 basic sounds. Combinations of initials and finals, and the special cases result in more than 400 mono-syllabic sounds. By applying the four tones to the sounds, Standard Mandarin makes a total of around 1,600 unique syllables.  \n\nInitials and Finals\nThe pronunciation of Chinese Pinyin is generally given in terms of initials and finals, which represent the segmental phonemic portion of the language, rather than letter by letter. Initials are initial consonants, while finals are all possible combinations of semivowels coming before the vowel, the nucleus vowel, and final vowel or consonant.  \n\nA semivowel is a sound that is phonetically similar to a vowel sound but functions as the syllable boundary rather than as the nucleus of a syllable.\n\nTones\nMandarin Chinese is a tonal language. Each Chinese character/syllable has a tone. The same syllable can have 5 possible ways to pronounce by varying the tone (pitch). There are four main tones and a neutral tone (轻声qīngshēng) in Mandarin. One syllable, pronounced in different tones will usually mean different things. This fact makes the tone training a fundamentally important part of Mandarin learners. So, even if you can pronounce the pinyin of a Chinese character correctly but if you do not master tones, Chinese speakers will not understand you.\n\nIf you have suggestions on how we can improve this application, please send us your feedback.

This app is designed to help you remember the words you learn, improve your active vocabulary (the vocabulary you use in speaking and writing), and increase your reading speed.  \n\nStart by picking one of 25 topics, all related to the IELTS test.  The first time you complete a topic, you must do the exercises in order – you can’t skip ahead!  This is because you build your active vocabulary through repetition - it’s like having an IELTS teacher in your pocket.\n\nYou will complete 10 different exercises to improve: speed reading, spelling, listening, and accurate use in a sentence. \n\nOnce you have completed and unlocked all of the exercises in a topic, you can review them in any order, at any time.

With more than 60 000 sales, the Prep Kit is now the most popular way to prepare for the Learner’s test. The study cards are based on the Driver’s Handbook and have been reviewed by driving experts.

Use the app to learn the rules of the road, and you will be on your way to becoming a safe driver.  \n\nWhy this format is the best way to learn the rules of the road. \n•The information is divided into bite-sized pieces. \n•You can clearly distinguish between what you do know and what you don’t know.  This way, you can focus on what you need to learn. \n•The app is divided into chapters to match the handbook.  \n•The graphics match the graphics in the handbook. \n•Most apps use a multiple choice format designed to test your knowledge; they are not a teaching tool. \n•Clear, driving related definitions make it a great tool for English language learners. \n•Video links provide more in-depth information."

Each player profile consists of a unique name (up to 20 characters) and a fun cartoon avatar. The player profiles display total number of games played, total number of high scores achieved, and total number of Bingo Bugs collected. The guest profile does not store any information and therefore cannot achieve high scores or collect Bingo Bugs. The guest profile is useful for adults who want to play Math Bingo without their scores going into the scoreboard. \n\nSelecting a Game\nThere are five different games in Math Bingo: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Mixed. Players will be prompted to select a game type before game play. Selecting a Level There are three levels of game play in Math Bingo: easy, medium, and hard. Players will be prompted to select a game level before game play. Score Board Math Bingo displays high scores in the Score Board. There are four different Score Boards: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Each Score Board displays the top three scores for each level: easy, medium, and hard. \n\nBingo Bugs \nBingo Bugs are rewards for achieving a high score. A player who earns a high score will collect a Bingo Bug! Players can collect a variety of Bingo Bugs and interact with them by tapping the Bingo Bug button in the player profile or by tapping the My Bingo Bugs button after playing a game. HINT: Tilt your device to make the Bingo Bugs move around, tap on a Bingo Bug to make them giggle and spring! \n\nSettings\nThe settings menu can be accessed by clicking the information button on the lower right hand side the introduction screen. The settings menu will allow you to reset all high scores and to delete player profiles. \n\n-----------------------------\nPRIVACY DISCLOSURE Math BINGO:\n- Does not contain third-party ads. \n- Does not contain in-app purchases.\n- Does not contain integration with social networks. \n- Does not use analytics/data collection tools. \n- Does include links to apps by ABCya.com in the iTunes App Store. \n\nFor more information on our privacy policy please visit: http://www.abcya.com/mobile_app_privacy_policy.htm\n ---------------------------"

      "label": "Letter Quiz is the best way to learn the English Alphabet with over 10,000 copies being purchased by schools. Four different games for every stage of learning; flashcards, identification, matching and handwriting. Designed for kids but great for all ages.\n\n- What People Are Saying:\n\"I think this Letter Quiz is an awesome app.  I downloaded the free version and my son was begging for the full version. That's when you know its a good one.  So I downloaded the full version and he worked on his letters for an hour.  As a parent, I am so happy that he loves it and he is learning.\"\n\n\"My 2 year old daughter loves this app. Initially the app had only recognizing the alphabets now it also features writing. My daughter didn't have any interest to write alphabets on paper but when she saw the app, she learned to write in a few days. On the whole excellent app recommend the full version to all parents with little children.\"\n\n\nFour great games to develop your skills:\n\n- ABC Flashcards to get started recognizing letters\nThe uppercase and lowercase versions of each letter is shown on a card. Tapping on the card flips it over to reveal an object starting with the letter while a voice announces the letter and the objects. Use app settings to play in random order for a change of pace.\n\n- Letter Identification to test knowledge\nMultiple letters are shown on the screen and a voice requests you to touch a specific letter. If you touch the right letter, an object is shown starting with that letter, then it moves to the next letter. Get through all 26 letters and you win! Use app settings to play in random order or hide the hints to make the game more difficult.\n\n- Matching uppercase and lowercase letters\nThe top shows letters in uppercase. The bottom shows letters in lowercase. Draw a line between the two letters matching uppercase and lowercase to get to the next level. Enable random order in app settings for even more challenge.\n\n- Alphabet Tracing to practice handwriting\nEach letter is presented full screen with dotted lines shown to guide you through writing the letter. As you trace with your finger, fun sounds play along the line. After each letter is finished they are combined on a blackboard with your full alphabet. You can choose between uppercase and lowercase letters or play in random order by enabling them in the app settings. Complete all 26 letters to unlock the fireworks celebration with exploding letters and music! \n\nSpecial Features:\n- Universal app plays natively on iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch\n- Kid protected section for adjusting settings, no external links without a parent\n- Includes both Uppercase and Lowercase letters, enabled in settings\n- Localized for US and non US pronunciation for the letter Z (\"zed\" vs \"zee\")\n- Teacher mode allows parents to pick individual letters to trace, enabled in settings\n- Disable swiping to advance Flashcards for younger players\n\nConnect with us for feature suggestions or bug reports:\nOn the web: http://TantrumApps.com/contact\nOn Facebook: http://facebook.com/TantrumApps\nOn Twitter: http://twitter.com/TantrumApps"

      "label": "Stick and Split is a deceptively simple, addictive game.  But what makes it so special is while they are playing it, children learn and practise their times tables, perhaps without even realising it.\r\n\nResearch shows the more you think about something, the more likely you are to remember it. \n\nMost times tables games try to get children to answer simple questions like ‘what is 3 x 6?’ many, many times. The problem with this approach is it aims to get children to answer with the minimum of thought. So it’s no wonder children have to answer them thousands of times before they remember the answers. Many get bored and switch off before the memory sticks. Some children get anxious when they don’t know the answers, and research also shows feeling anxious is not a great way to make memories.\r\n\nStick and Split has been carefully designed to encourage children to think much more about multiplication and division facts. There are no right or wrong answers, so it won’t induce anxiety. Instead they need to be constantly thinking what they need to do. The more they think, the more they remember.\r\nReasons you’ll love Stick and Split:\r\n\n- Incredibly simple game play – you’ll learn how to play it in a minute\n\n\n- But with over 300 different levels, you’ll find there is so much to it\r\n\n- Covers up to 12x tables and division\r\n\n- Encourages children to think about what multiplication and division really mean, so they’re not just blindly “learning their times tables “\r\n\n- Up to four children can have an account on the one device\r\n\n- Comes with advice for grown-ups supporting a child using the game\n\n\n- Stats show how much each child has played\r\n\n- An overview of all the levels shows you precisely what each child has done and enables them to jump to a level that’s suitable for them\r\n\n- A solid mathematical basis underpins the game\r\n\n- You won’t find a more cost-effective way to keep children occupied, thinking about numbers for hours"

For each word, your kids can touch the empty rectangles where letters must be dragged to complete the word, and hear the sound the corresponding letter produces.\n\n• Secondly, the app helps kids memorize the phonics associated with letters by providing a phonics-enabled alphabet where kids can touch each letter and hear the associated phonic.\n\n____\n\nMontessori Crosswords allows you to select words according to their difficulty or sound categories:\n\n•  Level 1 displays a three-letter word with no difficulty for beginning readers (CVC words)\n•  Levels 2, 3 & 4 offer more complex words that contain more complex phonics (as long vowels sounds or blends), and also offer the option to automatically create multi-word crosswords in tens of thousands of different combinations\n•  Alternately, you can choose from 44 sound categories (i.e. choose words that contain a specific sound (for example, long a, “k” sound, and so on).\n• You can also create custom word lists based on letter clusters\n__\n\nTo create an enjoyable experience, the app also includes sounds, animations, and interactive visual effects that are displayed after a word is completed. \n__\n\nMore Features:\n\n• Digraph Support : \"oo\", \"th\",... are displayed as a whole unit\n• R-Controlled vowels support (\"car\",\"horn\",...)\n• Capital, lower-case, or cursive letter display \n• Setting to show only letters are in the word to spell (great for beginners!)\n• Setting to force spelling from left to right\n__\n\nUsers & Reports \n\n•  Create any number of users\n•  Check and export activity for each user in the Reports section\n__\n\nCommon Core State Standard (CCSS):\nCCSS.ELA-Literacy.RF.K.1b Recognize that spoken words are represented in written language by specific sequences of letters.\nCCSS.ELA-Literacy.RF.K.2 & CCSS.ELA-Literacy.RF.1.2  Demonstrate understanding of spoken words, syllables, and sounds (phonemes).\nCCSS.ELA-Literacy.RF.K.3 Know and apply grade-level phonics and word analysis skills in decoding words.\n__\n\nMore reviews:\n\n• Wired's GeekDad - \"5 Favorite Apps for Elementary School iPads\" - \"An excellent tool for learning spelling and early literacy (...)

Are you up to an adventure? I am Abby the Monkey, the friend you know from a highly-successful application series by 22learn, and I have prepared one for you! If you want to EXPLORE a strange animal island and LEARN PHONETIC LETTER SOUNDS, you shouldn’t wait a minute, and come with me!!! \n\nBut first let me tell you a story…. \n****************************************** \nOnce upon a time, there was an island, an island of indescribable beauty and magnificence. There found a shelter the animals small and large, slimy and furry, savage and tame—all protected from evil hunters and curious eyes, supplied with food from the bountiful earth. Each year, a special event was held, when one, and only one, person from the whole humankind was selected and transported to the island (blinded, to preserve the island’s secrecy) to appreciate its beauty and spread the word about it, so that the island would never be forgotten. \n\nThe legend has it, that deep inside the rocky hill on the island, a treasure is kept. Yet, no one knows its secret anymore because the last humankind representative had enraged the animals on the island, and since then, the animals decided never to invite anyone again, and the island got lost in time and space. \n\nAll that remains from our knowledge is that through the whole island, a very special train goes. The train has a mind of its own and likes it when the passengers’ names start from certain sounds! It is said, that if someone was ever capable to fulfill all the train’s wishes, the train would transport the lucky being deep inside the rocks and reveal the island’s precious treasure! \n****************************************** \n\nBut, you are asking, what does all this have to do with me, monkey Abby? Well, imagine what happened to me just recently! I was flying around with my plane when, out of the blue, the storm hit and my plane got lost! \n\nAnd now, I am on this weird island that looks exactly like the legendary Phonics Island I told you about! Wohoo, how exciting! But I need someone to help me with all the strange tasks the train asks me to do! Do you want to be the one who will help me, and discover the island’s treasure together with me? \n\nThank you for your purchase!"

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

You can even create new exercises yourself!\n\nVIRTUAL MANIPULATIVES\nMathematics education organizations strongly advocate the use of manipulatives. They believe manipulatives allow students to actively construct their own understanding of math. Math Wizard is a new generation of virtual manipulatives which allows kids to explore math concepts.\n\nENGAGING FOR KIDS\nWe took special care to make the app fun and engaging so that children love manipulating the different terms of mathematical expressions!\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE \nMany settings are available to adapt the application to the child's level, including:\n\n • Numbers can be displayed using digits or beads that visually show the amount that numbers represent \n • Voice can be enabled to read numbers and operations aloud\n • Numbers available in the sandbox can be customized (the app handles positive and negative integers - up to 10 billion!)\n • Choose to allow inequality or force equality\n • Animation Speed\n\nYou can add as many users as you want, and view the activity history of each user\n\n-------------\nACTIVITIES\n-------------\n\n  Sandbox \n\nThe sandbox is an open-ended activity that allows users to experiment freely with algebra rules. You can add the numbers you want, and thus create and interact with any expressions or equations you want. \n\nFor parents and educators, it's a tool to show what are addition,  subtraction, equality and inequality. It also shows users how they can manipulate terms. For students, it's a tool to experiment with numbers in order to better understand \"how it works.\"\n\n  Exercises \n\nThe app contains hundreds of built-in exercises (additions, subtraction, equality, inequality, isolate a variable, brain teaser), but you can also create your own exercises!\n\nThe goal of each exercise is to reproduce an expression or equation (e.g., \"3\", \"4=4\", or \"x=3\") starting from another expression or equation (e.g., \"1+2\", \"2+2=3+1\", \"-1+x=2\"). This requires the child to interact with the numbers and operators in order to build their understanding of how algebra works (again, the child can only do what is permitted by algebra)\n\n---------------\n\nFEATURES\n\n  • Positive and negative integer numbers (up to 10 billion!)\n  • \"x\" variable \n  • Expressions with + and - operators\n  • Equality and inequality\n  • Division by 2\n  • Undo/redo operations and manipulations\n  • Unlimited number of users\n  • Record user activities\n  \nMany settings are available to customize the app, so it can fit the needs of both educators and students:\n\n • Number display mode (beads or digits)\n • Voice for numbers and operations\n • Custom numbers (Sandbox)\n • Do operations by dragging numbers on top of each other\n • Authorize inequality\n • Authorize division by 2\n • Animation Speed\n  \nFeel free to send us your feedback and suggestions so we can add them to the next update! support@lescapadou.com\n\nHave fun with algebra!"

      "label": "Take the guess work out of parenting and discover the joy of knowing what your baby has to say before she can talk! One of the most fundamental human desires is to be understood - help your baby communicate by teaching her baby sign language.\n\nThis app includes approx. 340 signs and over 1 hour of real life video demonstrations! The friendly presenters in the 'Baby Sign Language Dictionary' app will help you to learn to sign with your baby in an engaging and enjoyable way.\n\nThe keyword signs demonstrated in this video dictionary are based on American Sign Language (ASL). All signs have been carefully selected for their ease of use, helpfulness to carers and appropriateness for baby's interests and daily routine.\n\nEach sign has a detailed video tutorial covering information such as: simple instructions on how to perform the sign, clever tips to help you remember the sign and practical suggestions on how to introduce the sign to your baby.\n\nThe signs are also organized into categories such as: action words, animals, daily routines, feelings and emotions, food, manners and behavior, and nature – all of which are arranged alphabetically for quick and easy searching.\n\nTo test your baby signing knowledge, the app also comes with a fun interactive video quiz that will help you learn and remember the signs. You can also mark signs as part of your favorites list.\n\nOther key features:\n     • high quality graphics and videos optimized for viewing on Retina displays.\n     • optional setting to allow continuous play through of all signs in a category.\n     • swipe through the signs in a category without returning to the menu.\n     • optional setting to view a simplified demonstration for a sign rather than the complete tutorial.\n\nThis app makes the perfect parent's companion to the popular 'Baby Sign and Learn' animated apps (also available on the App Store).  Featuring gentle guidance and practical advice, this app has been designed to help make teaching your baby to sign as easy as waving “bye-bye”!\n\nVisit http://www.babysignandlearn.com for more information about baby sign language.\n\nNOTE TO PARENTS ABOUT SAFETY\n• This app contains age-appropriate content for preschoolers.\n• This app contains items that can be purchased for real money. This app contains a parental gate to stop your little ones making unauthorized purchases. You can turn off in-app purchases completely by disabling in-app purchases in your device’s settings.\n• This app contains parental gates to prevent your child following links out of the app to websites or social networks, or other apps without your knowledge."

The world of science just got a little bit weirder and a lot more fun with Toca Lab: Plants!\n\nJust like with the first app in the Toca Lab Series, Toca Lab: Elements, your curiosity will lead the way. Choose your plant, then visit five different locations in the lab:\n\n● Grow light: Shine the light on your plant and watch what happens! Does your plant bask and happily sigh in the light, or groan and wriggle away? What happens when you turn the light up a notch or two?\n\n● Watering tank: Put your plant in the tank and fill it up with water. Will your plant float? How does your plant behave when it’s soaking wet?\n\n● Nutrition station: What’s the optimal diet for your plant? Try the three different nutrition formulas and discover which ones your plant character likes!\n\n● Cloning machine: Spin the wheel on the cloning machine and before you know it, you’ll have five little versions of your plant. Wonder what the clones can do? Experiment and find out!\n\n● Crossbreeding apparatus: Here you can mix two plants to create something unexpected. Try it and see what happens!\n\nHave fun experimenting at each station to see how the plants evolve. Keep experimenting until you’ve collected all 35 plant characters in the app. Once you’ve collected a plant, keep experimenting to continue to evolve it! Who says kids can’t be scientists? Toca Lab: Plants brings out the budding botanist in everybody!\n\nFEATURES\n- Start with one plant and experiment your way to 35 different plant characters, each with its own unique personality!\n- Continue to evolve existing plants through experimentation!\n- Evolve plants with five lab tools: grow light, watering tank, nutrition station, cloning machine and the crossbreeding apparatus.\n- Discover plants from five groups: green algae, mosses, ferns, trees and flowering plants.\n- Learn the names and Latin names of real-life plants!\n\n--\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

      "label": "Are you in search of an innovative way to sharpen your child’s reasoning skills and awaken their intelligence?  Then you’ll love Busy Shapes designed for children from 2 years old!\n\n*** Featured in App Store Best of 2014 ***\n*** Featured worldwide by App Store as a Best New App ***\n*** Featured in the USA Today ***\n*** Recommended by The Good App Guide ***\n*** Common Sense Media Editors' Pick 2014 ***\n*** Parents‘ Choice Awards 2014 ***\n*** Children's Technology Review Awards 2014 ***\n\n> Inspired by the pioneering works of famed Swiss scientist and intelligence expert Jean Piaget (1896-1980)\n> Helps children improve their ability to handle simple objects through a series of engaging puzzles\n> Real-time dashboard to monitor progress\n> Includes an array of kid-friendly features, such as “passing” swipe control & more!\n\nABOUT BUSY SHAPES\nBusy Shapes helps children improve their ability to handle simple objects through a series of puzzles, in which they must change simple shapes and place them in proper holes. Along the way, the app responds to each child’s actions with positive guidance and motivation. Plus, the app’s digital exploratory playground regularly refreshes with different objects, which keeps children interested and engaged.\n\nINSPIRED BY JEAN PIAGET\nBusy Shapes is inspired by the pioneering works of famed Swiss scientist and intelligence expert Jean Piaget (1896-1980), who believed that “children are little scientists”, and that a child's thoughts are built through experiences that encourage him or her to engage in the reasoning process.\n\nINNOVATIVE, SCALEABLE PLATFORM\nBusy Shapes’ innovative scaleable platform for evolving experimentation lets children take advantage of the time they spend on touch screens -- so they aren’t just having fun, but learning every second of the way.\n\nKID-FRIENDLY DESIGN\nBusy Shapes features a special “kid-friendly” design that compensates for the fact that when young children hold an iPad or iPhone, they often have a finger touching the screen.\n\n“PASSING” SWIPE CONTROL\nBusy Shapes features “passing” swipe control that is essential for young children's quick hands (i.e. even if a child's finger reaches an object after he or she was already touching the screen, the object is still grasped as intended).\n\nPOWERFUL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)\nBusy Shapes’ powerful AI supports each child’s unique learning journey. For example, the AI tracks the time it takes each child to complete a level, and increases or decreases difficulty accordingly.\n\nGUIDED ACCESS\nTo prevent children from exiting the app by pressing the “home” button, Busy Shapes features a customizable Guided Access. This feature also disables selected parts of the screen for safety and protection.\n\nSEAMLESS INTERACTION\nBusy Shapes’ seamless interactive game area never blocks or limits children, and lets them freely access shapes. The menu is also neatly hidden away.\n\nAUTOMATIC MEMORY\nSometimes the best learning is a combination of cognitive exercise and physical play. Busy Shapes’ automatic memory saves a child’s place in any particular game, which makes the app an ideal complement to physical play and for shorter games.\n\nMULTIPLE LANGUAGE SUPPORT\nThe app is now available in: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Greek, Dutch, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Turkish, Russian, Korean, Indonesian, Malay, Vietnamese, Thai, Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese\n\nCONNECT WITH US!\nIf you have any support request, please write at support@edokiacademy.com or visit the Edoki Academy Online Community at edokiacademy.com."

This app contains all the topics required to become a successful AI Expert like Python, Deep Learning, Data Science and much more. It also covers many other artificial intelligence libraries. Our AI tutorial is prepared from an elementary level so you can easily understand the complete tutorial from basic concepts to high-level concepts.\n\nWhat is Artificial Intelligence?\nIn today's world, technology is growing very fast, and we are getting in touch with different new technologies day by day. Artificial Intelligence is now all around us. It is currently working with a variety of subfields, ranging from general to specific, such as self-driving cars, playing chess, playing music, painting, etc.\n\nLearn Machine Learning\nMachine Learning is a field of computer science with the help of which computer systems can provide sense to data in much the same way as human beings do. In simple words, ML is a type of artificial intelligence that extracts patterns out of raw data by using an algorithm or method.\n\nLearn Deep Learning:\nDeep Learning essentially means training an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with a huge amount of data. In deep learning, the network learns by itself and thus requires humongous data for learning.\n\nLearn Data Science:\nData is the new Oil. This statement shows how every modern IT system is driven by capturing, storing, and analyzing data for various needs. Be it about making decisions for the business, forecasting weather, studying protein structures in biology, or designing a marketing campaign. Python shines bright as one such language as it has numerous libraries and built-in features which makes it easy to tackle the needs of Data Science.\n\nLearn Python:\nPython is great for backend web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing. Many developers have also used Python to build productivity tools, games, and desktop apps, so there are plenty of resources to help you learn how to do those as well.\n\n\nWhy Learn Artificial Intelligence?\nBefore Learning about Artificial Intelligence, we should know that what is the importance of AI and why should we learn it. Below are some reasons to learn AI:\n\n1- With the help of AI, you can create software or devices which can solve real-world problems very easily and with accuracy such as health issues, marketing, traffic issues, etc.\n\n3- With the help of AI, you can build Robots that can work in an environment where the survival of humans can be at risk.\n\n4- AI opens a path for other new technologies, new devices, and new opportunities."

To help you not to get lost in the maze of legal and safety questions, not to be dazzled by unknown terms during theory and to get the hang of what real CRFSC and CFSC exams are, we have created this quiz app. Few hours of practice with this app - and you will confidently pass actual theory tests at your exam.\n\nThe application contains 250+ questions, which help you to master your knowledge by practicing offline (you don't need an Internet connection) and, thus, utilizing your time better.\n\nFeatures:\n- 250+ questions based on CRFSC/CFSC preparation materials\n- Randomly generated quizzes\n- Quiz capacity is optimized for fastest tuition\n- Reviewing included comments for the most complicated/tricky questions\n- Practical advice and weapon handling techniques from the best firearms instructors\n\nSome recommendations for your exam:\n1. Start preparing 2 to 1 week before your exam (on one hand you don't want to forget anything, but on the other hand you want to avoid an information overload);\n2. Found unknown term - find out what it is. Otherwise you may face it on your exam;\n3. If you theory is on Friday evening and practice and exams are on Saturday, make sure you don't have to cook your dinner on Friday (you will get home quite late);\n4. Good sleep is important!\n5. The cornerstone of the exam is ACTS and PROVE. Learn its meaning by heart, and practice. If you can't practice with real arms at home, at least watch videos and visualize the process. At practical exam you need to ACTS and PROVE you gun all the time. For example, instructor says: \"Put the gun on the table!\" - you ACTS and PROVE it and only then place on the table. And so on.\n\nGood luck with your PAL/RPAL test!"

I’ve also talked to kids who say the entire kitchen is covered in slime. Even my best friend, who never believes anything, told me the house is alive!\n\nI had to see for myself\n\nI did, I swear. I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside. I could really use a partner, though. Seriously, will you come with me?\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nPrivacy is an issue that we take very seriously.

      "label": "Tap images. Type words. Speak. Proloquo2Go is an easy to use communication app for people who cannot speak or need help being understood. Featuring natural sounding voices, including real children’s voices, Proloquo2Go is a simple yet powerful AAC (augmentative and alternative communication) tool. The app is fully customizable and can be utilized to build language skills and grow with a person’s communication, supporting both beginning and advanced communicators.\n\nParents, therapists, teachers and users around the world recognize Proloquo2Go as the gold standard in AAC solutions. The app is used by people with autism, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, Angelman syndrome, and others with speech difficulties. The app is available in English, Spanish, French, and Dutch and supports bilingual use, so you can switch languages on the fly.\n\nProloquo2Go in action:\n\nLearn and grow\n\nStudies show that just 200-400 words make up 80% of what we say. Known as core words, they act as the basis of Proloquo2Go’s research-based Crescendo™ vocabulary. Users can grow from single words to full sentences in the same app. Crescendo puts core words in consistent locations for easy access and motor-planning. The vocabulary works with AAC best practices like modeling (where you use an AAC system to talk with the user) to develop language skills. Crescendo offers no limit on language development with a 10,000+ fringe word vocabulary and customizable vocabulary levels. Finally, with Progressive Language, words are gradually revealed step-by-step, helping users learn words and their location as their communication expands.\n\nEasy editing\n\nCustomizing Proloquo2Go is a breeze! Quickly and easily add new words. Use the app’s built-in library of 25,000 symbols or use your own photos by taking pictures within the app or selecting them from your photo library. For users with fine-motor challenges and vision impairments, Proloquo2Go offers options like 23 pre-programmed grid sizes and accessibility settings which support switch scanning and Apple’s VoiceOver screen reader. Everything from appearance to access is customizable so you can make it your own. \n\nType and speak\n\nBesides tapping images, Proloquo2Go also lets you type what you want to say. The app includes a Grid Keyboard arranged alphabetically for people learning to type. For more experienced typists, Proloquo2Go includes a Typing View with a QWERTY keyboard and word prediction that offers suggestions based on what you are typing. \n\nHello! ¡Hola! Bonjour! Hallo!\n\nProloquo2Go lets you select a language and region for the Crescendo vocabulary. Two languages can be used at the same time, allowing seamless bilingual speech. Over 100 included downloadable natural-sounding adult and children’s voices rounds out your choices to use the app your way.\n\nA helping hand\n\nAssistiveWare is here for you every step of the way. Help articles in Proloquo2Go are there whenever you need them. New to AAC? Our website has easy to understand articles in the Learn AAC section, and the AssistiveWare Core Word Classroom includes activities for teaching communication effectively.

      "label": "Flashnote Derby is a fun way for kids to learn and practice reading music notes. \n\nEach race is a timed test in which the student identifies different notes in order to urge their horse on towards the finish line. Answering quickly and correctly will cause their horse to gain ground, while incorrect answers will cause it to fall behind. At the end of each race, students can review the notes they missed and see the correct answers. \n\nPlayers can respond to flashcards by simply playing the note on their acoustic or MIDI instrument. They can also choose to answer by tapping letter buttons or playing a key on an on-screen piano.\n\nThe game is fully customizable to allow for any desired notes in the treble, bass, alto, or tenor clefs to be included. You can select ranges of notes, or several individual notes to focus on specific areas that need work. Notes can be shown with sharps and flats and key signatures can even be added to increase the challenge for more advanced students. The amount of time the player is given for each flashcard can be increased or decreased depending upon their age and level of experience.\n\nDrills can start out simply, with only a handful of notes, and gradually be made more challenging until the full staff is mastered (up to five and a half ledger lines above or below the staff.) The more difficult the settings, the more points are awarded. The 'high score' is tracked so that players always have a goal to shoot for.\n\nAs a bonus, over a dozen instructional video lessons are easily accessible from right inside the app! Even children with no prior music instruction can start using Flashnote Derby right away to begin learning about the music alphabet, the staff, and how to identify different notes.\n\nBecause it can be set up so quickly, Flashnote Derby provides a perfect motivational tool for music teachers to use with students, even for just a minute or two of each lesson. Teachers have the ability to email homework assignments to their students for them to play on their own devices at home. Each player's performance is recorded so that their progress can be tracked. You can easily see which notes are most in need of review.  \n\nWhen students give up on their music lessons, it's usually because they find it too difficult. Learning basic skills early is key to laying the groundwork for future success. Flashnote Derby makes this process more enjoyable and helps students stay motivated in their music learning.\n\nSometimes it takes only a little extra effort to make the difference between success and failure. Download Flashnote Derby and get on the road to music reading mastery today!"

Mexico offers a lot of extreme variety.\n\nUSA\nChildren can ride a Ferris wheel in the colourful theme park and re-enact the moon landing or Jurassic Park in the film studio. They play with Kong the giant ape, visit the school and the record shop and when they are hungry they visit the burger shop or eat something at the hot dog stand. Then they can go to work at the harbour, play with the crane and unload ships.\n\nFRANCE\nIn venerable France, for example, children can sit in the evening in a chic café on the Seine under the Eiffel Tower, or they can play robber and gendarme with the police. Of course there is also a police helicopter, a police boat and a police car.\n\nINDIA\nIn densely populated India, the children can harvest tropical fruits and squeeze juices, change tires in the Auto Werkstadt, ride an elephant or work on the latest robot technology. What is particularly exciting here are the clear contrasts between tradition and technology.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS OF THE APP\n- Discover a huge world\n- Switch between day and night mode\n- Go on a treasure hunt, sail the pirate ship\n- Ride an elephant, dinosaur \n- Play with a robot or with a huge skeleton\n- Fell trees and use the wood to make a fire\n- Disguise yourself\n- plant flowers and vegetables\n- Change the wheels of all cars\n- Bake a cake\n- Fly a helicopter, a jet, a historic aircraft, a hot air balloon or a U.F.O.\n- have a picnic on the beach - deliver packages\n- Send postcards around the world\n- Discover souvenirs from all over the world in Fiete's room\n\nIMPROVE CHILDREN\n- Fantasy role playing games\n- Telling your own stories\n- Experiment\n- Interaction with others\n- Understanding the world\n- Open-mindedness\n\nABOUT US\nWe are Ahoiii, a small app development studio from Cologne.

Now there’s a version of First Words specifically for educators and speech language pathologists. Of course, it's great for kids at home, too!\n \nFirst Words Professional has the same child-friendly design and uncluttered interface that made First Words one of the all-time best selling lines of educational apps for iOS.  The new additional features make it the ideal choice for individual, institutional and professional use:\n\n* More Words --- Over 350 words in 12 categories, including shapes, numbers, food, feelings, clothes, animals, and more.\n* Six Languages --- Options include American English, British English, Spanish, French, German, and Japanese.\n* Phonics -- English word lists includes options for spelling with phonics or letter names.\n* Category Management --- Choose which categories of words are shown to students.  Hide word lists that you don't want them to see.\n* Word Management --- Choose which words to include in each category.  Focus on shorter words, longer words, or words with particular letter combinations. Hide words that your child finds particularly distracting.\n\nFirst Words Professional uses the same intuitive interface that is so easy for preschoolers, kindergartners, and kids with special needs to use. They'll giggle with delight at the beautifully drawn pictures and entertaining sounds, all the while learning how letters correspond to sounds and how letters sounds form words.\n\nFirst Words Professional helps kids develop:\n \n* Fine Motor Control\n* Letter Recognition\n* Phonemic Awareness\n* Word Recognition\n \nFirst Words Professional includes a large number options:\n \n* Phonics or Letter Names\n* Uppercase, Lowercase, or Capitalized Words\n* Spell Words Slowly or Quickly\n* Serif or Sans-Serif font\n \nHere's what educators and reviewers have said about earlier versions First Words:\n \n“First Words is an app that teaches letters and words in fun and interactive way.  Very easy to use these apps will help support your little ones learning with great illustrations and bright colors. Each app supports kids learning and encourages kids to explore and discover by revealing, rewarding and teaching.”\n-- Fun Educational Apps\n\n“Excellent - As a teacher, I love this game! Just what technology was meant to do!”\n-- iTunes Review\n \n“This app has great settings that let you control the level of difficulty for the child – either with lots of hints or almost none at all. The letters slide nicely into each word and when completed the child is rewarded by having the pictured animal enlarge and animate briefly.”\n--Carisa Kluver at Digital Stortyime\n \n“First Words Deluxe is a very straightforward word-building game. Words are either said letter by letter as they are dragged into the appropriate gray boxes or, if chosen in the settings, a smaller set of words can be sounded out with phonics. This makes this game a treat for both pre-readers and early spellers.”\n--Common Sense Media\n \n“Looking to guide your toddler towards recognizing letters and how to spell words up to eight letters long?  Then First Words Deluxe might be just what you are looking for. This pre-reader and spelling application encourages vocabulary development in a wide range of categories such as: vehicles, animals, at home, colors, and shapes.”\n--Andrea Gardner at Applicable2u\n \n\"First Words is a great app -- as I said at the time, 'Leo loves First Words because it's fun and easy. I love it because he's learning to spell words, and the interface makes that learning error-free.'\"\n---Shannon Des Roches Rosa at Squidalicious"

      "label": "The Choiceworks Calendar is a powerful picture-based learning tool that helps children learn what is happening day-to-day, week-to-week, and month-to-month throughout each year. Choiceworks Calendar teaches the abstract concept of time in a structured visual format which helps children organize their lives as well as understand sequence and time. Choiceworks Calendar is the first app of its kind to provide a full-featured calendar designed with both the child and caregiver in mind.\n\nKey Features \n\n■ Easily create a visual calendar of upcoming events in a few minutes (examples: holidays, when visitors are coming, doctor appointments, vacations, sleepovers, parent returning from a trip or military duty)\n■ Image Library preloaded with over 275 images and audio\n■ Attach video to any image\n■ Add your own images using your photo library, camera or use the preloaded image library to record your own audio, video and edit captions for limitless customizability \n■ Create multiple personalized calendars for use with multiple children or in a classroom setting\n■ Count Days Until: animated counter for the number of days until an upcoming event (example: How many days until my birthday?)\n■ Speaks the daily schedule with child or adult voice \n■ Built-in visual timer\n■ Automatically adds holidays\n■ Easily add reoccurring events\n■ Notifications and alarms with visual and audio alerts\n■ Search and auto-save features\n■ Share boards by Email, AirDrop, Files app or iTunes with other Choiceworks Calendar app users \n■ Ability to print month, week or day for offline viewing or save as PDF\n\nMethodology\n\nVisual supports are highly effective, proven tools for improving communication between children and caregivers.  Calendars are challenging for children to grasp initially due to the abstract concept of time, months, weeks and days.  They are also time consuming for caregivers to setup and maintain.  Choiceworks Calendar addresses all of these challenges.  For caregivers, it provides a streamlined interface for creating, customizing, sharing and maintaining a calendar of upcoming events.  For the child, it provides visual, audio and video supports that make using the calendar an enjoyable learning experience.\n\nChildren gain independence and personal responsibility by seeing helpful information such as which days are school days and which days are not.  They also benefit by being informed of upcoming events such as a doctor’s appointment or celebrating a birthday. This clear, simple support provided ahead of time can help a child predict what is going to happen, thereby reducing anxiety.  It helps children understand when there is a change in the routine so they can learn to adapt, become more flexible and better behaved. The information is always visible on the calendar and the child can refer to it as often as needed. \n\nHelpful Tips\n\nSimple:  When first implementing Choiceworks Calendar, the calendar should be kept simple and be geared toward the child. By reviewing the calendar each day, the child will learn the days of the week, rote counting, number identification and components of the daily, weekly, and monthly schedule.\nVisuals:  Put images or videos on the calendar that describe the most important activities of the day. Again, keep it simple. Only include what is important for the child on the calendar.  Start small and gradually increase the amount of information presented as the child begins to understand the passage of time.\nAdvance: As success with Choiceworks Calendar increases, visually plan out big projects and indicate deadlines for science projects, writing assignments, etc.  Chunk larger projects into smaller, manageable steps that the child can complete each day.  This will focus attention to the current task and lessen anxiety and distraction to other portions of project. \nHave your own tips or ideas?  Visit our Facebook page and share with the Choiceworks community: https://www.facebook.com/ChoiceworksAndChoiceworksCalendarApps/"

A scenario consists of one or more vessels representing the rule being illustrated as well as all of the lights and shapes corresponding to the Regulations’ requirements. The corresponding rules are displayed with each scenario.\r\n\r\nThe camera can be moved to allow users to view the scenes from various angles: zoom in, zoom out and rotate around the vessel(s) shown, making the navigation lights’ visibility arcs easy to see. \r\n\r\nThe ambient lighting can be adjusted to view scenes at both day time and night time.\r\n\r\nThe application features two types of representation: “realistic” and “coloured dots”. “Realistic” representation is used to view a scene as closely to reality as possible. “Coloured dots” are used exclusively for teaching purposes and simply show where the different lights are positioned so that users can better differentiate them. \r\n\r\nThe application currently supports two display languages (French and English)."

Your goal is to quiet your mind and become aware of that picture.\n\nYou select one of the two choices by pressing the answer which best matches your awareness of that image. When you do that, a second question\nwill appear. You then repeat the process. The Property Matches indicator at the bottom shows the number of correct answers to 24 questions.\n\nFour pictures will then appear. Tap the picture that best matches your mental image. The correct picture will fill the screen. After 12 pictures you may begin a new game.\n\nThis program offers feedback and reinforcement to meets the requirements for learning this skill. The Stargate ESP Trainer presents meaningful and emotional images to your subconscious mind. This ability is often called clairvoyance, and can enhance your life in many surprising ways."

And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

      "label": "* Finalist for the BestAppEver Award: Toddler Apps *\n \nThe best-selling reading game for kids has gotten even better! We've added more words, more languages, and phonics. First Words Deluxe provides endless fun for the toddlers in your life, all while giving your child a head start on learning their letters and learning to spell words.\n\nNow with Spanish, French, German, Japanese, plus US and UK English.\n\nFirst Words Deluxe is toddler-tested and approved, with a user-interface designed specifically for the littlest of fingers.  The game includes over 150 words in five kid-friendly categories:\n\n** Animals **\n** Vehicles **\n** Colors **\n** Shapes **\n** Words from around the house **\n\n(Fewer words are shown when the phonics option is selected, because many English words are not spelled phonetically.  A total of 68 phonics words are included.)\n\nA wide range of options let you tune the game to match your child's current skills and abilities.\n\nIf your child is old enough to ask for your phone, they're old enough for First Words Deluxe!\n\nHere's what educators and reviewers have said about our First Words apps: \n\n“First Words is an app that teaches letters and words in fun and interactive way. Very easy to use these apps will help support your little ones learning with great illustrations and bright colors. Each app supports kids learning and encourages kids to explore and discover by revealing, rewarding and teaching.” \n-- Fun Educational Apps \n\n“Excellent - As a teacher, I love this game! Just what technology was meant to do!” \n-- iTunes Review \n\n“This app has great settings that let you control the level of difficulty for the child – either with lots of hints or almost none at all. The letters slide nicely into each word and when completed the child is rewarded by having the pictured animal enlarge and animate briefly.” \n--Carisa Kluver at Digital Stortyime \n\n“First Words Deluxe is a very straightforward word-building game. Words are either said letter by letter as they are dragged into the appropriate gray boxes or, if chosen in the settings, a smaller set of words can be sounded out with phonics. This makes this game a treat for both pre-readers and early spellers.” \n--Common Sense Media \n\n“Looking to guide your toddler towards recognizing letters and how to spell words up to eight letters long? Then First Words Deluxe might be just what you are looking for. This pre-reader and spelling application encourages vocabulary development in a wide range of categories such as: vehicles, animals, at home, colors, and shapes.” \n--Andrea Gardner at Applicable2u \n\n\"First Words is a great app -- as I said at the time, 'Leo loves First Words because it's fun and easy. I love it because he's learning to spell words, and the interface makes that learning error-free.'\" \n---Shannon Des Roches Rosa at Squidalicious \n\n*** We love getting feedback from our users.

If you want to EXPLORE a strange animal island and LEARN PHONETIC LETTER SOUNDS, you shouldn’t wait a minute, and come with me!!! \n\nBut first let me tell you a story…. \n****************************************** \nOnce upon a time, there was an island, an island of indescribable beauty and magnificence. There found a shelter the animals small and large, slimy and furry, savage and tame—all protected from evil hunters and curious eyes, supplied with food from the bountiful earth. Each year, a special event was held, when one, and only one, person from the whole humankind was selected and transported to the island (blinded, to preserve the island’s secrecy) to appreciate its beauty and spread the word about it, so that the island would never be forgotten. \n\nThe legend has it, that deep inside the rocky hill on the island, a treasure is kept. Yet, no one knows its secret anymore because the last humankind representative had enraged the animals on the island, and since then, the animals decided never to invite anyone again, and the island got lost in time and space. \n\nAll that remains from our knowledge is that through the whole island, a very special train goes. The train has a mind of its own and likes it when the passengers’ names start from certain sounds! It is said, that if someone was ever capable to fulfill all the train’s wishes, the train would transport the lucky being deep inside the rocks and reveal the island’s precious treasure! \n****************************************** \n\nBut, you are asking, what does all this have to do with me, monkey Abby? Well, imagine what happened to me just recently! I was flying around with my plane when, out of the blue, the storm hit and my plane got lost! \n\nAnd now, I am on this weird island that looks exactly like the legendary Phonics Island I told you about! Wohoo, how exciting! But I need someone to help me with all the strange tasks the train asks me to do! Do you want to be the one who will help me, and discover the island’s treasure together with me? \n\nThank you for your purchase!"

We can further dissect and observe the complex structure of its various organ systems right on our iOS devices using an Apple pencil or your finger. \nThus we get best of both worlds as we get to successfully observe and learn about the structure of a frog and yet cause no harm to life. A fun quiz in the end helps in absorbing the knowledge gained through this innovative app called Froggipedia.\n\nFroggipedia has been awarded \"iPad App of the Year\" 2018 and is now available in the following languages: Japanese, Chinese Traditional, Chinese Simplified, Korean, Russian, Brazilian Portuguese, Latin Spanish."

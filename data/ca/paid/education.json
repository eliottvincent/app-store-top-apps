      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "Stick and Split is a deceptively simple, addictive game.  But what makes it so special is while they are playing it, children learn and practise their times tables, perhaps without even realising it.\r\n\nResearch shows the more you think about something, the more likely you are to remember it. \n\nMost times tables games try to get children to answer simple questions like ‘what is 3 x 6?’ many, many times. The problem with this approach is it aims to get children to answer with the minimum of thought. So it’s no wonder children have to answer them thousands of times before they remember the answers. Many get bored and switch off before the memory sticks. Some children get anxious when they don’t know the answers, and research also shows feeling anxious is not a great way to make memories.\r\n\nStick and Split has been carefully designed to encourage children to think much more about multiplication and division facts. There are no right or wrong answers, so it won’t induce anxiety. Instead they need to be constantly thinking what they need to do. The more they think, the more they remember.\r\nReasons you’ll love Stick and Split:\r\n\n- Incredibly simple game play – you’ll learn how to play it in a minute\n\n\n- But with over 300 different levels, you’ll find there is so much to it\r\n\n- Covers up to 12x tables and division\r\n\n- Encourages children to think about what multiplication and division really mean, so they’re not just blindly “learning their times tables “\r\n\n- Up to four children can have an account on the one device\r\n\n- Comes with advice for grown-ups supporting a child using the game\n\n\n- Stats show how much each child has played\r\n\n- An overview of all the levels shows you precisely what each child has done and enables them to jump to a level that’s suitable for them\r\n\n- A solid mathematical basis underpins the game\r\n\n- You won’t find a more cost-effective way to keep children occupied, thinking about numbers for hours"

Ce jeu aide l’enfant à apprendre les sons des lettres et des groupes de lettres en présentant simultanément les sons (ou mots) correspondant et les groupes de lettres.\n\nLa progression du jeu est basée sur des données scientifiques : le logiciel été développé par des linguistes, des neuropsychologues et des orthophonistes pour aider les enfants - en particulier les lecteurs en difficulté - à renforcer les automatismes fondamentaux de la lecture.\n\n« GraphoGame – Français » accompagne l’enfant à travers différents jeux avec son propre personnage qu’il fait évoluer au cours du jeu. Le joueur passe progressivement aux syllabes, aux rimes, aux mots courts et aux phrases et apprend peu à peu à décoder des mots plus longs. En jouant 15 minutes quotidiennement, l'enfant améliorera sa précision dans le décodage des lettres, des mots, et sa vitesse de lecture. \n\nLa plateforme GraphoGame est développée par une communauté de chercheurs et de développeurs de jeux leader en Finlande, tandis que le contenu francophone de « GraphoGame Français » a été développé par le Laboratoire de Psychologie Cognitive (CNRS) de l'Université d'Aix-Marseille.\n\nPour plus d’informations sur le contenu francophone, n’hésitez pas à vous rendre sur le site http://grapholearn.fr."

Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

      "label": "Experiment with plant characters, evolve them into new species and discover their unique personalities. Keep collecting plants until you’ve collected them all! The world of science just got a little bit weirder and a lot more fun with Toca Lab: Plants!\n\nJust like with the first app in the Toca Lab Series, Toca Lab: Elements, your curiosity will lead the way. Choose your plant, then visit five different locations in the lab:\n\n● Grow light: Shine the light on your plant and watch what happens! Does your plant bask and happily sigh in the light, or groan and wriggle away? What happens when you turn the light up a notch or two?\n\n● Watering tank: Put your plant in the tank and fill it up with water. Will your plant float? How does your plant behave when it’s soaking wet?\n\n● Nutrition station: What’s the optimal diet for your plant? Try the three different nutrition formulas and discover which ones your plant character likes!\n\n● Cloning machine: Spin the wheel on the cloning machine and before you know it, you’ll have five little versions of your plant. Wonder what the clones can do? Experiment and find out!\n\n● Crossbreeding apparatus: Here you can mix two plants to create something unexpected. Try it and see what happens!\n\nHave fun experimenting at each station to see how the plants evolve. Keep experimenting until you’ve collected all 35 plant characters in the app. Once you’ve collected a plant, keep experimenting to continue to evolve it! Who says kids can’t be scientists? Toca Lab: Plants brings out the budding botanist in everybody!\n\nFEATURES\n- Start with one plant and experiment your way to 35 different plant characters, each with its own unique personality!\n- Continue to evolve existing plants through experimentation!\n- Evolve plants with five lab tools: grow light, watering tank, nutrition station, cloning machine and the crossbreeding apparatus.\n- Discover plants from five groups: green algae, mosses, ferns, trees and flowering plants.\n- Learn the names and Latin names of real-life plants!\n\n--\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

      "label": "For TEACHERS, this app puts all of the Secrets at your fingertips for quick & easy reference/use in online lessons—it will even tell the stories for you! It is not intended for screen-sharing/mirroring to other devices, due to built-in IP technology. For PARENTS & KIDS. it's the perfect way to \"learn & play\" with the Secrets to support reading & writing at home!\n\nThis app doesn't just “practice” phonics skills, it TEACHES them with trademarked, brain-based stories that explain the sounds letters make when they get together and pictures to help kids remember for reading & writing. Perfect for beginning and struggling readers of any age, Secret Stories® provides logical explanations for letter sound behavior that learners' brains crave!\n\nPHONICS WITH THE BRAIN IN MIND\nSecret Stories Better Alphabet™ Song is the fastest and easiest way to learn individual letters & sounds—using muscle memory to fast-track mastery in as little as 2 weeks! At the same time, kids are also learning the ‘grown-up’ reading & writing \"Secrets,\" which help them make sense of the sounds letters make when they get together in words.\n\nFor example, did you know that AU/AW are in love, and they get so embarrassed when they stand together, they always say, “Awww” (ex. saw, August); or that T&H don’t get along, and always stick their tongues out at each other and say, “Thhh!” (ex. the, this); or that ER/IR/UR are terrible, awful, horrible drivers that always slam on the brakes, “Errr!” (ex. her, bird, turn)? There are even sneaky letters, like Y, who stole the sounds of /E/ & /I/, but won’t use them unless he’s at the END of a word and thinks that no one will see him! (ex. yes, by, mommy)\n\nNO MORE telling kids, “It just is...It just does...You just have to remember!” when trying to explain all the crazy sounds that letters make. Now you can just tell them the Secrets! \n\nAPP FEATURES\n\nFast-Track the ABCs!\n • Better Alphabet™ Song for fast mastery of individual letters & sounds\n • Highlighted letter-tracking to reinforce sound-symbol connections\n • Targeted practice & random play\n\nFast-Track Phonics Skills!\n • Secret Stories® Sound Pictures to reference for reading & writing\n • Play the “secret” stories that explain each phonics sound\n • Play the sound/s that correspond with each Secret Story phonics pattern\n • Targeted practice & random play for reinforcement of sounds (for reading) & phonics patterns (for writing/spelling)\n\nPARENT FEEDBACK\n“One week in and I’ve already seen a difference in my son! He’s sounding out word after word. A month ago, he crawled under his bed crying and calling himself stupid, and today, he is looking for words to sound out!\"\n\n“No matter how long we worked, the letters & sounds weren’t sticking. Then we found the Better Alphabet and in 2 weeks, he knew them ALL!”\n\n“My son is THRIVING! He’s not the same reader he was 5 months ago. We’re even reconsidering his dyslexic label, as his improvement has been so drastic. He used to avoid reading at all costs and now he loves finding Secrets in words and trying to decode them. He’s finally fallen in love with reading!\"\n\n“There’s nothing else like it! The phonics stories take no effort for kids to remember. They just see it and get it! If they can’t read or spell a word, all they have to do is look at the Secrets to find the sound or spelling pattern. I can’t say enough about the difference they’ve made!”\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK\n“I added the Better Alphabet to my routine and am amazed what my kids picked up in the past 2 weeks! They’ve learned more letters & sounds this month than all of last year!”\n\n“The Secrets are my ‘secret weapon‘ for teaching tricky phonics skills! We use them for everything, from sounding out new words in reading lessons, to spelling words in writing lessons. The best part is, they work with anything!”\n\n\"Secret Stories is my most prized resource. It helps kids instantly identify phonics sounds in words. I recommend it to all my parents because I know the difference it makes!\""

To help you not to get lost in the maze of legal and safety questions, not to be dazzled by unknown terms during theory and to get the hang of what real CRFSC and CFSC exams are, we have created this quiz app. Few hours of practice with this app - and you will confidently pass actual theory tests at your exam.\n\nThe application contains 250+ questions, which help you to master your knowledge by practicing offline (you don't need an Internet connection) and, thus, utilizing your time better.\n\nFeatures:\n- 250+ questions based on CRFSC/CFSC preparation materials\n- Randomly generated quizzes\n- Quiz capacity is optimized for fastest tuition\n- Reviewing included comments for the most complicated/tricky questions\n- Practical advice and weapon handling techniques from the best firearms instructors\n\nSome recommendations for your exam:\n1. Start preparing 2 to 1 week before your exam (on one hand you don't want to forget anything, but on the other hand you want to avoid an information overload);\n2. Found unknown term - find out what it is. Otherwise you may face it on your exam;\n3. If you theory is on Friday evening and practice and exams are on Saturday, make sure you don't have to cook your dinner on Friday (you will get home quite late);\n4. Good sleep is important!\n5. The cornerstone of the exam is ACTS and PROVE. Learn its meaning by heart, and practice. If you can't practice with real arms at home, at least watch videos and visualize the process. At practical exam you need to ACTS and PROVE you gun all the time. For example, instructor says: \"Put the gun on the table!\" - you ACTS and PROVE it and only then place on the table. And so on.\n\nGood luck with your PAL/RPAL test!"

Burst the bubble to set the Numberjack free.\nNote: In reply to the comment, the blue arrow to move on to the next number only appears if you make the correct total.\n\nTree Rescue:\nTwo people are stuck in a tree. Match the first person’s number of stepping stones to rescue them both. See how the stepping stones show the addition and listen to Numberjack 3 say the sum.\n\nGym Ball:\nChoose the Numberjack that is the total of the first two Numberjacks to catch the ball that the Numberjacks are heading. What number do you need when the second Numberjack is the missing one?\n\nNumbertaker Challenge :\nHow well do you know your addition facts? The Numbertaker takes numbers from the addition sums and it’s your job to put them back as quickly as you can. How many sums can you put right before the time runs out?\n\nChildren build up Brain Gain as they play the games and are rewarded with images and songs from the Numberjacks television programmes, their own Brain Gain Zapper and a Boing Ball game to play with."

В этом ему помогут яркие анимированные иллюстрации и озвученное диктором стихотворение. Рисунки «оживают» при нажатии на них. \n\nВторой блок состоит из упражнений на закрепление полученных знаний. Например, малыш открывает пару из буквы и изображения, начинающегося на эту букву. В следующих заданиях представлены картинки и буквы, из которых надо подумать и найти верную. Также есть задания на составление слов из изученных букв.\n\nВ третий блок добавлены умные раскраски со знакомыми персонажами. Каждую картинку нужно раскрашивать, используя буквы русского алфавита. У ребенка развивается наглядно-образное мышление, внимание, тонкая моторика.\n\nВсе уровни озвучены диктором, а задания проходят в форме интересной игры.\n\nМы любим детей, поэтому сами пишем добрые стихи и рисуем смешные картинки. \nУ нас самый профессиональный диктор! \nМы благодарны Вам за выбор нашей игры! \n\nСпасибо за добрые отзывы!\n\nЕсли вдруг у Вас появились замечания, то напишите нам на почту support@catdonut.com, и мы обязательно Вам ответим!\n\nИгра на русском языке. \n\nМы открыты для всех Ваших пожеланий!

Create and edit up to five (5) simulations stored in the program, or enter your enterprise license to capture more simulations, and in the future, sync your sims across all SimsUshare platforms.\n\nThis tool is for emergency responders, safety instructors, and disaster-response/business-continuity planners who want an effective way to incorporate simulations based on local hazards and situations. One can exchange the simulations with colleagues who also have SimsUshare for other platforms.\n\nAs our slogan goes, now you can 'set your world on fire', but obviously in a safe and responsible manner."

Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

There are over 1400 questions that cover the bones and their prominences as well as the muscles and all of their most commonly tested criteria. Each question on the muscles and bones are accompanied by a custom illustration. These illustrations are constructed in a unique way that exaggerates and simplifies their attachment points, placement, and functions making future recall easier for the user.\n\nThe bones are covered thoroughly in our tap/touch based questions. This includes the location and name each part/prominence of the bone as well as identifying the prominences that specific muscles attach to.\n\nEach muscle is covered in a highly detailed and accurate way. The criteria each muscle is tested on includes the most commonly tested questions in anatomy education: Fibre orientation(s), origin, insertion, cross-section, action, nerve innervation, and blood supply.\n\nThis app is perfect for quick review before a test by specific anatomic region or you can customize a test in our “Custom Random” mode. For causal review on the go or for summative tests (multiple regions and criteria) use our “Full Random Testing” mode to be rapidly quizzed on the entire Simple Lines Anatomy content at random.\n\nUse in-game statistics to monitor your accuracy and progress in each body region and testing type. Select “Weak Areas Occur More Frequently” to have questions you previously answered incorrectly show more often to strengthen your knowledge in that region."

Its going tibia ok, the Skelly app is just what you need! With the Skelly app you can literally pull the inspiration you need right out of your pocket anywhere, anytime!\n\nSkelly is a fully poseable, anatomically correct reference skeleton for artists. A simplified version of the skeleton is also included, named “Robo-Skelly”. These figures were created to make the study of anatomy easier and more enjoyable for students and professionals without leaving your wallets bone dry. They can also be used to inspire poses for drawing, painting, sculpting, illustration, animation, comics, manga, storyboarding, twerking, and to fully understand the anatomy of the human skeleton. No need for super gluteus, Skelly comes pre-assembled and ready to pose as soon as you launch the app! \n\nLearning the structure of the human body is the skeleton key to drawing the figure in an anatomically correct manner without having to clear your browser history to avoid awkward conversations with your loved ones. Whether you want to make works like Michelangelo or Miyazaki, Skelly will help you focus on your art and let you personalize his poses, rather than searching for reference material and hiring models. Learn to draw the skeleton from any angle without the inconvenient and morally questionable need to go grave robbing.\n\nFEATURES:\n \nAnatomically correct skeleton\nSimplified “Robo Skelly”\nProportions based on the teachings of Dr. Paul Richer\nSkull fits perfectly into a “Loomis Head” as taught by Andrew Loomis\nPoseable joints\nPose Library - choose from pre made poses and save your own\nMovable camera\nAdjustable light source\nChoose light or dark background\nReset to neutral “Anatomical Pose”\n\nPEOPLE LOVE IT:\n\nJames Gurney, author of ‘Color and Light’ and ‘Imaginative Realism’ Says:\n\n\"Bend him, twist him, contort him! The Skelly app lets you put a virtual human skeleton into any pose, and to see him from any angle, and in any lighting. It’s a great tool for art students or professionals wondering what the skeleton is really doing beneath a life pose, or for anyone wanting to visualize a pose from scratch. The interface is intuitive to learn and easy to use, without sacrificing any of the nuances of the human body’s complex range of movement. Skelly is a big improvement over the old wooden mannikin.\"\n\n- Chris Oatley, Director Of The Oatley Academy Of Visual Storytelling Says:\n\n\"Skelly is the fastest, most fluid anatomical reference I have ever seen. I was shocked at how easy it is to pose the figure and direct the light source. Finally! It’s the app visual artists have been waiting for.\"\n\nHave any questions? CONTACT US:\n\nskelly@proko.com"

      "label": "We designed iTrace over 5 years ago to teach children to write block and cursive letters and numbers.  Our mission back then — and today — remains to make early childhood education productive and relaxed, natural at the same time. \n\nWhile creating the app, we found out that children learn best when they repeat every exercise at least 3 times. In iTrace, a child traces each letter 3 times on every level out of 30 for each letter. Of course, every child learns at a different pace, so an app adjusts the number of levels to meet the needs of their individual student.\n\nThe app is ideal for homeschooling as well as classroom setting at Preschool, Pre-K, Kindergarten, and K1-K2 levels.\n\niTrace Key Features: \n- Uppercase and lowercase letters \n- Cursive and block letters\n- Numbers 0 through 9\n- Words: child's name, 350 preloaded words from the iTrace library and unlimited words that can be added by you\n- Support of 3 different letter fonts: Zaner-Blosser, HWT (Handwriting Without Tears) and D'Nealian (with customized letters for each font!)\n- Full support for both Left and Right handwriting orientation.\n- 5 animated scenes that gather relevant words together to make learning fun with 50 animated objects (iPad only)\n- History of each child's progress\n- Unlimited children accounts \n- Available at a reduced price with Volume Purchase Program for educational institutions\n\n\nWe created iTrace for kids: \n- The app tracks and adjusts to your child's individual progress to keep their interest and to encourage progress\n- To support how children learn writing skills, iTrace will replay exercises several times gradually increasing complexity and difficulty level (just like a game!) \n- The app will reward progress with over 600 varying prizes for every completed exercise\n- iTrace leverages context and animation to teach writing by encouraging children to select animated scenes composed of meaningfully combined objects\n\nWe created iTrace to help parents and teachers: \n- The app tracks your child's progress on each individual letter and number to help them master handwriting and for adults to measure improvement\n- iTrace supports easily switching to the Left-handed mode and to cursive letters. \n- For offline practice, iTrace supports customization and printing of PDF worksheets on the paper.\n\nWe built iTrace to guard children’s privacy: \n- No ads inside the app.  We do not interrupt the learning process with anything unhelpful or irrelevant. \n- No collection of personal data. We do not ask for any contact details except the first name of your student to personalize their experience. \n- Purchases can only be made by adults from a part of the app that children cannot access.\n------------\n\niTrace is appreciated by parents, schools, and media:\n\n\"With an engaging, kid-friendly interface and many options to customize and track children's progress, iTrace is a valuable app for parents, teachers and occupational therapists.\",\nLibby Curran, People Magazine's Teacher of the Year\n\nFeatured in the App Store's \"Education\" category under Best New Apps!\n\n— TUAW: \"The app is brightly illustrated and well designed, certain to appeal to young students. Meant for the core 3-7 age group, kids can learn to trace uppercase and lower-case letters, as well as numbers.\"\n\n\n— Teachers With Apps: \"This app is what every parent/teacher should have their children use to help learn proper letter formation. As a teacher, it helps fit handwriting into the school day so much easier!\"\n\n— 2Wired 2Tired: \"…kids LOVE everything electronic. iTrace will make learning how to write letters, numbers, and words, both fun and interesting for your children.\n\n— Mommy's Busy: \"If you're looking for a fun, interactive way for your child to learn [...] you should consider trying iTrace.\"\n---------------\n\nIf you have any ideas or feedback that you would like to share, please contact us at iTrace@devpocket.com.  We are sincerely interested in knowing more about your experience with iTrace."

You can add images, lists, and use text formatting to structure your content.\n\n- Write cards on your iPhone/iPad\n\n- Add images\n\n- Group cards into topics\n\n- Text formatting & lists\n\n- Find and study only difficult cards\n\n- iCloud Drive support (syncs with the Mac app, which is a separate purchase)\n\n\nStudy Options:\n\n- Memorizing cards by covering the answer\n\n- Multiple Choice tests with randomly picked or predefined answers\n\n- Supports studying with the Spaced Repetition System (Leitner Box System)\n\n\nFor Teachers and Educators:\n\n- Compatible with the Remote Control feature of the Mac app. You can use the iOS app as a remote to control the study mode on the Mac while you are projecting on a big screen.\n\n\n\nPeople use the Flashcard Hero Mac & iOS apps to study many different subjects.

That’s because Flashcard Hero is designed specifically to go beyond language learning, offering more room on each card for facts, lists, and images. You can also organize cards into topics (to match chapters of a text book, for example).\n\nNote: This app is a single, one-time purchase. No subscriptions, no in-app purchases, no ads.

It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside.

      "label": "It's never too late to expand your horizons, challenge yourself, and bridge the gap to another culture with Arabic Alphabet!\n\nArabic Alphabet teaches you the foundations of Arabic in a fun and unique way. For each letter you will be able to:\n\n• See it in great detail.\n• Hear the proper pronunciation of its phonemes.\n• Hear the proper pronunciation of its name.\n• See and hear a common Arabic word which begins with that letter.\n\nArabic Alphabet is not only fun, but it's also accurate because it was developed by a native Arabic speaker, and all audio samples were recorded by a college professor of Arabic.\n\n\"I was born and raised in Morocco with Arabic as my language of origin. When I moved to America, I wanted to be sure that I didn't lose my identity and my culture. After my first son was born, this became even more important to me as I want him to understand the importance of his heritage. I developed Arabic Alphabet so that adults and children alike could have a fun way to accurately learn the foundations of the language. I hope you enjoy it!\" —from the developer\n\nWe have finally added two in-app upgrades, so that you can expand your learning:\n\n• The Write feature which allows you to “finger-write” on the screen so that you can memorize and perfect the strokes for each character.\n• The Quiz feature which will help you put everything you’ve learned to the test.    With a little practice, you’ll learn to recognize and write the Arabic Alphabet in no time!"

Crazy Gears is a new-aged digital puzzle game, designed with a real mechanical engine and with children's critical thinking skills in mind! Hours of fun guaranteed for everyone who is up for the challenge, yes, even you Mom & Dad!\n\n*** Children's Technology Review Awards 2015 ***\n*** Parent's Choice Gold Winner Fall 2015***\n*** App of the week by Fun2Tap ***\n*** Best of the Best by Best Apps For Kids ***\n*** Featured worldwide by App Store as a Best New App ***\n\n\nABOUT CRAZY GEARS\nExplore a captivating digital playground in this tantalizing puzzle game! Children manipulate gears, chains, rods, and pulleys, to pull themselves through each level, which teaches them how different mechanisms affect one another when constructing a machine. Each reasoning challenge was carefully designed to adhere to the theories of educational technology pioneer, mathematician, computer scientist, and designer of the first programming language for children, Seymour Papert.\n\n“The best use of games is to leverage their tendency to enhance learning”- Papert\nRecommended Ages 5-9 \n\nAs a child, Papert fell in love with gears. Their movement fascinated him in every way and inspired his career. Crazy Gears was conceived not only as a tribute to him, but with the hope of providing a child with the inspiration to discover and understand the physical properties of mechanisms found in their everyday lives. Such complex notions include tension, motion, and gravity. We achieve this by encouraging the child to manipulate the objects in each level to determine how they work together to accomplish a goal.  Interactions with technology give kids the power to construct their understanding of STEM/STEAM subjects in meaningful ways. Here we engage them in play that does just that!\n\n\nFEATURES\n• No rules\n• No explicit instructions \n• Kid-Friendly​ Design\n• Powerful Artificial Intelligence\n• Seamless Interaction\n• Multiple Language Support\n• Crash Resistant Design\n• Bold, bright colors\n• Automatic Memory\n• Special mode for children with CVI\n\nSTEM/STEAM TOPICS EXPLORED\n• Gears \n• Mechanical Systems (simple and complex) \n• Action and Reaction \n• Motion (circular, rotary, and reciprocating) \n• Ratios\n• Tension\n• Torque and Speed\n• Mechanical Advantage \n\nABOUT US\nEdoki Academy’s mission is to provide children with enjoyable early-learning activities using the latest technologies. Our team members, many of whom are young parents or teachers, strive to produce tools that motivate and inspire children to learn, play, and progress. \n\nPRIVACY\nWe take your child’s privacy very seriously, for this reason, we are proud to offer a product that is certified COPPA compliant by PRIVO. \n\nCONNECT WITH US!\nIf you have any support requests, comments, or questions do not hesitate to contact us at support@edokiacademy.com.

      "label": "\"A great way to give parents a break and let your kid have fun and learn to read at the same time.\" - Jen, Kindergarten teacher and mom of three.\r\n\r\nI have a confession to make.  My son's favorite game was Fruit Ninja and I was getting increasingly frustrated with having my son waste a lot of time on a fun but mindless game while he was still struggling to master his sight words and learning to read. \r\n\r\nSo I decided to create our very own Sight Words slicing game and to my and my son's delight, he now has a new favorite game where he is having fun and learning at the same time. \r\n\r\nMy sons skills in recognizing Sight Words have dramatically improved since he started playing this game and now I no longer have to feel guilty when I need a five minute break to take care of the laundry or prepare lunch for the kids.  I know that they are having fun and that they are learning at the same time.\r\n\r\nWarning: Your child will keep begging for your iPhone or iPad after they try this app.\r\n\r\nSight Words Ninja is an exciting educational game that helps kids rapidly learn sight words by sight, sound, and touch.  \r\n\r\nThe interface is so easy to use that even a 9 month old baby will delight in using this app. \r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n\r\n• Slice your way through all sights words from preschool to grade 3\r\n\r\n• You decide what to focus on - turn individual categories ON or OFF from the settings page\r\n\r\n• Learn by sight, sound, and touch\r\n\r\n• Fun game play, sounds, and animations keep kids engaged\r\n\r\n• Dynamic game play adjusts difficulty (the number of sight words) automatically based on player skills to keep kids both challenged and entertained vs. getting bored\r\n\r\n• Supports 3 difficulty settings: EASY, MEDIUM, or HARD\r\n\r\nEASY MODE:\r\n- Max 1 sight word\r\n- Sight words move very slowly\r\n- Great for introducing sight words one at a time\r\n\r\nMEDIUM MODE:\r\n- Starts with 1 sight word\r\n- Max of 3 sight words on screen\r\n- Sight words move 30% faster\r\n\r\nHARD MODE:\r\n- Starts with 2 sight words\r\n- Max of 5 sight words on screen\r\n- Sight words move even faster\r\n- Sight words rotate faster too\r\n\r\nAdjust difficulty from settings page. \r\n \r\n• Wrong answers do not interfere with gameplay, the child can immediately try again and slice the correct answer (most other games are too slow to keep kids interested by interrupting the gameplay and slowly repeating the desired question)\r\n\r\n• Play Sight Words from A to Z or in random order (adjustable from settings page)\r\n\r\n• Multi-sensory learning tool - combining audio, voice, and touch\r\n\r\n• Want to work on just a few Sight Words?  No problem… head to the settings page to turn entire categories or individual Sight Words on and off\r\n\r\n• Want to record your own audios? No problem.  Just click on the category and record your own Sight Words sounds \r\n\r\n• Supports three levels of difficulty \r\n\r\nHEROIC SUPPORT\r\n\r\nHeroic Support is not just what we do.  It's really what makes us, well, us.  It's that drive to make a difference in your life - no matter how big or small.  Really, it's our way of life because we want you to be our customer for a lifetime of fun and learning.\r\n\r\n\r\nHave questions?  We are here to help.  Email us at support@grasshopperapps.com"

Your child will then apply these concepts with counting activities and songs! Starfall Numbers includes interactive introductions for numbers 0-20, 25, 50, and 100. Counting activities introduce coins, math symbols, and simple expressions while building counting skills from 0 to 100 in entertaining and practical ways. Your child will also enjoy singing along with 15 Starfall math songs. Counting song favorites and calendar concepts are animated playfully, with a closed caption option to display song lyrics. Each activity and song reinforces simple language and basic vocabulary, making this app an excellent choice for pre-readers, emerging readers, and English language learners alike."

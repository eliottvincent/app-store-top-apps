      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "GraphoGame Français » est un logiciel d’entraînement au décodage qui aide les enfants d'âge préscolaire et primaire et les enfants en difficultés à renforcer leurs premières compétences en lecture. Ce jeu aide l’enfant à apprendre les sons des lettres et des groupes de lettres en présentant simultanément les sons (ou mots) correspondant et les groupes de lettres.\n\nLa progression du jeu est basée sur des données scientifiques : le logiciel été développé par des linguistes, des neuropsychologues et des orthophonistes pour aider les enfants - en particulier les lecteurs en difficulté - à renforcer les automatismes fondamentaux de la lecture.\n\n« GraphoGame – Français » accompagne l’enfant à travers différents jeux avec son propre personnage qu’il fait évoluer au cours du jeu. Le joueur passe progressivement aux syllabes, aux rimes, aux mots courts et aux phrases et apprend peu à peu à décoder des mots plus longs. En jouant 15 minutes quotidiennement, l'enfant améliorera sa précision dans le décodage des lettres, des mots, et sa vitesse de lecture. \n\nLa plateforme GraphoGame est développée par une communauté de chercheurs et de développeurs de jeux leader en Finlande, tandis que le contenu francophone de « GraphoGame Français » a été développé par le Laboratoire de Psychologie Cognitive (CNRS) de l'Université d'Aix-Marseille.\n\nPour plus d’informations sur le contenu francophone, n’hésitez pas à vous rendre sur le site http://grapholearn.fr."

      "label": "Team Shake provides a technological and environmentally friendly way to choose teams for board games, sporting events, tournaments, school projects or anytime groups are required. The newest release brings many new features including full iPad support, balancing teams based on skill or gender, importing users from a file, enabling video output, and sharing teams via facebook or email. \n\nTeam Shake is the premier iOS App for creating teams. Instead of a hat and scraps of paper, the user enters his friends' names in his iPhone and gives it a shake. The screen will then display a random set of color-coded teams. These teams can immediately be used for game play or shared via facebook or email.   The quick and easy selection of random (or balanced) teams eliminates fighting over who will be on which team. Innovative use of the iPhone shake gesture gives users the satisfying feeling of shaking a virtual hat without the trouble of carrying around an actual hat. Conventional buttons can also be used for those who would rather not shake their expensive hardware about.  \n\nThe app is designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind. Names can easily be entered with the onscreen keyboard, chosen from the user's contacts, or imported from a file. The email and facebook functions document the members of each individual team as well as preserving the team number and color assigned by the app. For repeated use of Team Shake, lists of friends can be easily saved and loaded later. The current list is also automatically saved so that if you exit the app, or even reboot the device, changes will not be lost. For teachers and others with large lists of people, Team Shake supports the ability to import teams from text or csv files.\n\nIf you have any problems, feature requests, or comments please send an email to support@rhine-o.com. \n\nFeatures:\n\n* Create 1 to 64 random teams\n* Create completely random or balanced teams\n* Full iPad support\n* Eliminates fighting over choosing teams\n* Share / Save teams via email or Facebook\n* Teams can be chosen by the number of teams or by the size of teams.\n* Save lists of friends for later games\n* Import lists from email or spreadsheet\n* Export lists and options for use on another device\n* Satisfying feeling of shaking a “virtual” hat to create teams\n* Animated shaking hat\n* Entry of names via onscreen keyboard\n* Entry of names via iPhone contacts\n* Temporarily disable people who are absent\n* Set groups of people to always be on the same team\n* Set groups of people to always be on different teams\n* Set user strength to make more even teams (now supports fully balanced teams)\n* 5 users strengths level\n* Pick a single random person from the list of players\n* User strength indicator on the main screen (can be disabled in options)\n* Number of active players and total players is now displayed on the main screen\n* Video Out Support\n* Option to Sort Teams by Name\n* Option to balance male / female team members\n* \"Equal Ability\" option to create teams where all players have the same strength\n* Option to create separate male and female teams\n* Configurable Team Colors\n* Configurable Team Names\n* Print Support\n* Export Teams in CSV or XLS Format\n* Team Shake now supports simultaneously assigning players to multiple subteams and / or oppose teams at the same time.\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now have customized names to make selection easier\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now be enabled or disabled globally so that teams can be made quickly without subteams / oppose teams.  In particular, Balance Teams Strengths will work when separate Male / Female teams are created.\n\nYappler-Tags: Teams, Groups, Random, Hat, Entertainment, Games, Utilities"

(Please set your iPhone to Ring mode to hear the audio playback.)\n・Fun illustrations help users to better retain the words studied. \n・Users can bookmark the words they like. The bookmarked words are compiled in the Bookmark list in \"List.\"\n\n◇ “Check” helps learners to track their mastery.\n・Users check their understanding of the vocabulary studied and sort the words into those mastered and those not yet retained.\n・The words already mastered are taken out of the study set, leaving behind just those that still need to be worked on.\n\n◇ “List” displays a list of all words covered by the app so that users can see their progress and review the vocabulary.\n・The list can be arranged in any of three orderings: lesson order, a-i-u-e-o order, and alphabetical order. The words bookmarked in the Study mode are also listed in the Bookmark list.\n・Checkmarks are automatically placed next to words that have been mastered.\n・The Study view of words can be displayed from the list entries, enabling quick review.\n\n\n○This app is based on the vocabulary from the third edition of GENKI.\n○Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

Its going tibia ok, the Skelly app is just what you need! With the Skelly app you can literally pull the inspiration you need right out of your pocket anywhere, anytime!\n\nSkelly is a fully poseable, anatomically correct reference skeleton for artists. A simplified version of the skeleton is also included, named “Robo-Skelly”. These figures were created to make the study of anatomy easier and more enjoyable for students and professionals without leaving your wallets bone dry. They can also be used to inspire poses for drawing, painting, sculpting, illustration, animation, comics, manga, storyboarding, twerking, and to fully understand the anatomy of the human skeleton. No need for super gluteus, Skelly comes pre-assembled and ready to pose as soon as you launch the app! \n\nLearning the structure of the human body is the skeleton key to drawing the figure in an anatomically correct manner without having to clear your browser history to avoid awkward conversations with your loved ones. Whether you want to make works like Michelangelo or Miyazaki, Skelly will help you focus on your art and let you personalize his poses, rather than searching for reference material and hiring models. Learn to draw the skeleton from any angle without the inconvenient and morally questionable need to go grave robbing.\n\nFEATURES:\n \nAnatomically correct skeleton\nSimplified “Robo Skelly”\nProportions based on the teachings of Dr. Paul Richer\nSkull fits perfectly into a “Loomis Head” as taught by Andrew Loomis\nPoseable joints\nPose Library - choose from pre made poses and save your own\nMovable camera\nAdjustable light source\nChoose light or dark background\nReset to neutral “Anatomical Pose”\n\nPEOPLE LOVE IT:\n\nJames Gurney, author of ‘Color and Light’ and ‘Imaginative Realism’ Says:\n\n\"Bend him, twist him, contort him! The Skelly app lets you put a virtual human skeleton into any pose, and to see him from any angle, and in any lighting. It’s a great tool for art students or professionals wondering what the skeleton is really doing beneath a life pose, or for anyone wanting to visualize a pose from scratch. The interface is intuitive to learn and easy to use, without sacrificing any of the nuances of the human body’s complex range of movement. Skelly is a big improvement over the old wooden mannikin.\"\n\n- Chris Oatley, Director Of The Oatley Academy Of Visual Storytelling Says:\n\n\"Skelly is the fastest, most fluid anatomical reference I have ever seen. I was shocked at how easy it is to pose the figure and direct the light source. Finally! It’s the app visual artists have been waiting for.\"\n\nHave any questions? CONTACT US:\n\nskelly@proko.com"

      "label": "The EduCalc Classic app, rewritten from the ground up:\n\n-- All screens have portrait and landscape\n-- Polynomial solver up to 10th degree\n-- Wide range of settings for font sizes and graph line widths\n-- Updates to this version will be more frequent, going forward\n-- Matrix calculator more intuitive and is integrated with main calculator screen\n-- Table has an \"ask\" mode where you enter input values and it gives you the outputs.\n-- Please report bugs to the email address inside the app\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n1)  Scientific Calculator.  A lot of thought has gone into the design of the keyboard, which gives you everything you need while keeping the keys as large as possible.  Available functions include the following:\n\n• the usual arithmetic functions and exponentiation.\n• square root, cube root, nth root, natural log, log base 10, log of arbitrary base, absolute value, factorial, permutations (nPr), combinations (nCr), modulus, random integer, bell curve, cumulative normal distribution.\n• Define and name your own constants\n• Summations\n• Complex numbers!\n• Sig figs (enable under settings)\n• Programmable keys (enable under settings)\n\n2)  Graphing.  Capabilities:\n• Graph up to nine equations at once.\n• Graphs are labeled.\n• You can drag the graph or pinch to zoom in or out.\n• Calculator can find roots and intersections.\n• Can graph in polar coordinates.\n• Can graph parametric equations.\n• Can graph parametric equations.\n• Can graph implicit functions, such as x^2+y^2-4=0.  Most calculator apps can't do this!\n\n3)  Vector and Matrix calculator.  Vector dot and cross products.  Multiply and add matrices.  Determinant, transpose, Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors.  \n\n4)  It can make a table of the values of any function you care to enter.  You can choose the starting x value of the table, as well as how much x increases for each successive row.\n\n5) Triangle solver.  Enter three sides, two sides and an angle, or two angles and a side, and the solver calculates the rest.\n\n6) Polynomial solvers.  Find the roots of a polynomial, up to 10th degree.\n\n7)  System of linear equations solver.\n\n8)  The  reference hits the high points of the following subjects:\nalgebra, calculus, geometry, trigonometry, vectors, vector calculus, and classical mechanics.  So if you need a reminder of a trig identity . . . or the quadratic formula . . . or the chain rule from calculus . . . and so on, it's right there for you.\n\n9)  A unit converter.  Your data are in meters, and you need an answer in feet?  No problem!  With a tap, you can enter the result of your conversion into the calculator.  Currently converts different units of the following: acceleration, angle, area, density, distance, energy, force, mass, power, pressure, speed, temperature, time, and volume.  Great for physics problem sets!  You can also define your own units.\n\n10)  Constants for scientific calculations -- speed of light, strength of gravity at Earth's surface, etc. etc. etc.  Tapping on a constant will insert it into your calculation -- i.e, you don't have to key in the value.  Again, great for physics problem sets!\n\n11)  Statistics mode, including options for scatter plots and for regression lines.\n\n12)  Works on both iPhone and iPad.\n\n13)  Derivatives! (Answer simplification is limited.)\n\n\nI'd love to learn about your comments or suggestions.  You can write me at the email address on the settings screen of the app. Thanks!"

      "label": "The app educators choose for classroom use, and the only app that records a child's letter strokes for parents and educators to review.\n\nLearn to Write is a fun way for children to learn how to write their letters and numbers, and with the improved playback feature in version 4.1, it's easy for the teacher to make sure they do it correctly.  This unique playback function, found in Learn to Write,  saves the child's writing so you can play it back in real time to see how the child is forming letters and numbers. Children learn the proper strokes with the help of an adjustable-speed-animated ball that they can follow and write along with.  With each selection of a letter or number, an audio file says the letter to aid in memorizing the alphabet.  Over a dozen unique pen styles are available for tracing.\n\nParents enjoy the educational value and entertainment this mess-free learning tool provides (after all, who needs crayon, marker, or pencil stains on the carpet, table, or wall?). Also great for long car trips, doctor's offices, and other waiting times. Write letters and numbers, or draw on the screen, and push the play-back button to see it all in real-time.\n\nNot only is this a great app for teaching children at home, educators are also choosing this app for classroom instruction.  You won't find silly cartoon characters and frustrating feedback that tells children they formed letters incorrectly when they failed to trace exactly as outlined.  You help children Learn to Write, and then you can review the strokes of every letter formed for further one-on-one instruction. \n\nRecommended for children 2 years and up.\n\n---------\n\nNo in-app purchases.\nNo advertisements, popups, or storing of personal data.\n\n---------\n\nThe strokes used in Learn To Write resemble the Zaner-Bloser style, which is also used in Romalda Spalding's The Writing Road to Reading, with the exception that O’s and Q’s are started at the top 12 o’clock position instead of the suggested 2 o’clock position.  Not all teachers agree on the proper strokes for some letters.  For example, some teachers prefer that the pen or stylus never leave the paper except to cross a t, or dot an i.  A person's handwriting often adapts with time to be as efficient as possible, while still maintaining proper form. This application is meant as a guide to children and parents, but your individual curriculum may differ slightly.\n\n\nInstructions for use:\n\n-Select numbers, or letters in lowercase, uppercase, or mixed case using the segmented control on the settings screen.\n\n-When a letter is selected and the child writes upon the screen, the writing is saved in memory.  Pushing the triangle-shaped play button at the bottom of the writing screen plays back the last recorded strokes for each letter. A toolbar button allows the user to erase all of the saved strokes in memory.\n\n-Red number icons on the settings screen give the total number of letter or number recordings.\n\n-The brush button displays a pulldown menu full of usable brush styles.  Just touch the brush-style to select it.\n\n-Letter buttons display the letter on the screen and turn orange when there are saved strokes for the letter. At any time the user can draw using one's finger, just like a real pen and erase the drawing with the erase button on the toolbar.\n\n-The toolbar button with a letter and ball activates the animated red ball, which demonstrates proper letter or number formation.\n\n- Adjust the speed of the ball and volume using the sliders on the settings screen.\n\n-Press the home and power button at the same time to take a snapshot of the screen and save it in the photo archive of the device ."

      "label": "360 Thinking Time Tracker (™Pending)\n\nThe 360 Thinking™ Get Ready*Do*Done Timer is an instructional timer app specifically designed for supporting students’ executive function skill development. It is based on the innovative clinical model of executive functioning skills known as 360 Thinking™.  By using the app, students will have the opportunity to nurture their situational awareness, develop forethought of an end result, and organize resource materials, time and actions to complete a future task. \n\nThe 360 Thinking™ Get Ready*Do*Done Timer is user friendly and works on simple methodology. The app allows its users to create a time marker to get ready for work, a time marker to check in during the work, and a marker when the work is planned to end.  There are tones activated when the time reaches each marker:\n•\tThere is a single tone to indicate time to get ready, \n•\tThere are two tones to indicate that the user is at the midpoint of the work\n•\tThere are three ascending tones to indicate that the user is at the stop point of the work.  \n•\tAs time passes the primary color becomes more luminous to show that time has passed.\n\nThe timer app allows the user to look back and assess the productivity of the time they have spent so far!  In fact, with the help of the app, the users can compare the planned vs. actual use of time. A table displays to the left of the clock interface to show the user the original plan for ready comparison.\n\nTrivia\nThe color indication of the 360 Thinking™ Get Ready*Do*Done Timer app has made the entire user experience easy to manage:\n•\tThe yellow color represents slowing down to get ready to start a task, \n•\tThe green color represents going ahead and doing the steps to complete a task. The split green time marker at the midpoint provides a visual reminder to break and check the status of the work,\n•\tThe red color indicates that it is time to stop the task because it is done."

I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside.

The flash cards include definitions, clear graphics and video links to enhance learning and understanding. \n\nThe app is based on the popular Learner’s Licence Prep Kit.  With more than 60 000 sales, the Prep Kit is now the most popular way to prepare for the Learner’s test. The study cards are based on the Driver’s Handbook and have been reviewed by driving experts.  Developed by educational experts, the Prep Kits are based on sound learning theory.  Use the app to learn the rules of the road, and you will be on your way to becoming a safe driver.  \n\nWhy this format is the best way to learn the rules of the road. \n•The information is divided into bite-sized pieces. \n•You can clearly distinguish between what you do know and what you don’t know.  This way, you can focus on what you need to learn. \n•The app is divided into chapters to match the handbook.  \n•The graphics match the graphics in the handbook. \n•Most apps use a multiple choice format designed to test your knowledge; they are not a teaching tool. \n•Clear, driving related definitions make it a great tool for English language learners. \n•Video links provide more in-depth information."

Then you’ll love Busy Shapes designed for children from 2 years old!\n\n*** Featured in App Store Best of 2014 ***\n*** Featured worldwide by App Store as a Best New App ***\n*** Featured in the USA Today ***\n*** Recommended by The Good App Guide ***\n*** Common Sense Media Editors' Pick 2014 ***\n*** Parents‘ Choice Awards 2014 ***\n*** Children's Technology Review Awards 2014 ***\n\n> Inspired by the pioneering works of famed Swiss scientist and intelligence expert Jean Piaget (1896-1980)\n> Helps children improve their ability to handle simple objects through a series of engaging puzzles\n> Real-time dashboard to monitor progress\n> Includes an array of kid-friendly features, such as “passing” swipe control & more!\n\nABOUT BUSY SHAPES\nBusy Shapes helps children improve their ability to handle simple objects through a series of puzzles, in which they must change simple shapes and place them in proper holes. Along the way, the app responds to each child’s actions with positive guidance and motivation. Plus, the app’s digital exploratory playground regularly refreshes with different objects, which keeps children interested and engaged.\n\nINSPIRED BY JEAN PIAGET\nBusy Shapes is inspired by the pioneering works of famed Swiss scientist and intelligence expert Jean Piaget (1896-1980), who believed that “children are little scientists”, and that a child's thoughts are built through experiences that encourage him or her to engage in the reasoning process.\n\nINNOVATIVE, SCALEABLE PLATFORM\nBusy Shapes’ innovative scaleable platform for evolving experimentation lets children take advantage of the time they spend on touch screens -- so they aren’t just having fun, but learning every second of the way.\n\nKID-FRIENDLY DESIGN\nBusy Shapes features a special “kid-friendly” design that compensates for the fact that when young children hold an iPad or iPhone, they often have a finger touching the screen.\n\n“PASSING” SWIPE CONTROL\nBusy Shapes features “passing” swipe control that is essential for young children's quick hands (i.e. even if a child's finger reaches an object after he or she was already touching the screen, the object is still grasped as intended).\n\nPOWERFUL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)\nBusy Shapes’ powerful AI supports each child’s unique learning journey. For example, the AI tracks the time it takes each child to complete a level, and increases or decreases difficulty accordingly.\n\nGUIDED ACCESS\nTo prevent children from exiting the app by pressing the “home” button, Busy Shapes features a customizable Guided Access. This feature also disables selected parts of the screen for safety and protection.\n\nSEAMLESS INTERACTION\nBusy Shapes’ seamless interactive game area never blocks or limits children, and lets them freely access shapes. The menu is also neatly hidden away.\n\nAUTOMATIC MEMORY\nSometimes the best learning is a combination of cognitive exercise and physical play. Busy Shapes’ automatic memory saves a child’s place in any particular game, which makes the app an ideal complement to physical play and for shorter games.\n\nMULTIPLE LANGUAGE SUPPORT\nThe app is now available in: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Greek, Dutch, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Turkish, Russian, Korean, Indonesian, Malay, Vietnamese, Thai, Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese\n\nCONNECT WITH US!\nIf you have any support request, please write at support@edokiacademy.com or visit the Edoki Academy Online Community at edokiacademy.com."

      "label": "*Rated 1 of the 15 best psychology apps by CareersInPsychology.org!*\n\nPass the EPPP with confidence! With these flash cards, containing information similar to that found in other much more expensive study materials, you will be well on your way to joining the others who have passed the EPPP the very first time using our app! \n\nOffering the most comprehensive mobile psychology study materials on the app store since 2010, StudyPsych’s EPPP Flash Cards consist of over 2,500 flash cards delineated by all of the content areas covered on the EPPP:\n\n01. Ethics and Professional Issues\n02. Diagnosis & Psychopathology (Abnormal)\n03. Clinical Psychology\n04. Learning Theory and Behaviorism\n05. Industrial/Organizational Psychology\n06. Lifespan Developmental Psychology\n07. Neuropsychology & Psychopharmacology \n08. Research Design and Statistics\n09. Test Construction and Interpretation\n10. Social Psychology\n11. Intellectual Assessment\n12. Community Psychology\nPlus 1,000 Practice Test Questions\n\nThe StudyPsych flash cards were designed by a licensed psychologist who has helped many pass the EPPP, comprehensive exams, and other psychology tests the first time. Users of these flash cards are provided with multiple study options, including:\n\n- The ability to receive more information pertaining to a topic on a specific flash card by linking to the web from directly within the app. This is easily one of the most helpful aspects of our study system.\n\n- Two smart study modes that automatically focus more on the cards you miss: “Leitner (Short-term Goal)” and a more advanced “Spaced Repetition” mode\n\n- Built in searchable \"dictionary\" of your cards that allows you to easily look up terminology while you are studying\n\n- 3 response levels: I Don’t Know, I Know, I Know Well (compared to the standard “right/wrong”)\n\n- FREE access to single-sided and double-sided printable PDF files of all of the flash cards, for those who would prefer that study modality\n\n- Easy navigation – swipe or tap to answer (customizable)\n\n- Incredible support! I make it a point to respond to all questions and feedback as soon as possible, whether it is about the flash cards, examinations, or psychology in general. Email me anytime for support.\n\nThis app does not require a network connection, so you can study whenever you want from wherever you are at!\n\nContact Info: StudyPsychEPPP@gmail.com\n\n\n**FAQ**\n\nQUESTION 1: If I purchase the app on my iPhone, can I use it on other iOS devices? \nANSWER 1: YES! Purchase the app a single time and use it on your iPhone, iPad, and iPod devices.\n\nQUESTION 2: Is the app content updated annually? \nANSWER 2: We actually update the app’s content more than annually. However, it would be difficult to notice any significant changes, primarily because not much is added each year. In fact, all the “big guys” only say they update their material annually as a sales gimmick. Don’t take my word for it? Compare older study books (usually free at your school library) to the most recent books and you’ll notice the information is nearly an exact match. \n\nQUESTION 3: Why does this app cost more than other EPPP apps?\nANSWER 3: A lot of time and effort was put into making this app, from condensing the most “need-to-know” information to linking the cards to websites. Also, ours is the most comprehensive mobile EPPP app, addressing every content area covered on the actual exam. The amount, quality, and presentation of the content in the others apps pale in comparison.\n\nQUESTION 4: Is this app all I need to pass the EPPP the first time?\nANSWER 4: While we are uncomfortable making such assertions, many users who passed the exam have contacted us to tell us our app is all they used to study. With the option to retrieve more information about a particular topic provided on most cards, there really is no need to purchase other study materials! Rather, we recommend concerned users get their hands on an old (free) set of study books and use them alongside our app."

      "label": "See Me Go Potty \nThe unique, distinctively useful, and exceptionally fun potty trainer. \n\nHow it works\n1. Use a simple menu to create a cartoon avatar that physically resembles your child/children.\n2. Let your child repeatedly play the Go Potty narrative showing him/herself successfully complete the whole process of using the potty step by step.\n3. Show your child the Accident Scene narrative to teach what an “accident” is. \n\nYou’ll be hearing “I did it!” in no time. \n\nImportant features\nFifteen actionable potty training tips included: The app includes concrete advice about preparation, behavioral reinforcement, behavioral shaping, when to continue vs. take a break, and more.   \nTeaching with positive reinforcement and fun: The Go Potty scene ends with your child’s avatar happily celebrating a successful “I did it!” potty experience.  In contrast, the Accident Scene ends with your child’s avatar being disappointed by the “uh-oh”.\nPersonalization and connection to kinesthetic learning: Children immediately joyfully recognize their cartoon selves, closing the gap between watching someone else do something and visualizing oneself doing something.  The supplemental motor area (SMA) of the brain is responsible for learning and planning motor behaviors (actions). Quite amazingly, neuroscientists have shown that imagining oneself doing something involves similar activity patterns in the SMA as actually doing it.  \nVisual learning is powerful: This app is a great teaching tool for typically developing children as well as children with developmental delays and communication disabilities. The layout is intentionally simple and free of distractions.  Your child’s attention will be focused on him/herself using the potty. Parents who have a “neuro-diverse” family know that the teaching techniques we rely on to teach our children with developmental delays also work like a charm with our typical kids.  Many kids on the autism spectrum, in particular, are very visual learners, but the power of visual learning is certainly not restricted to them. \nAuditory learning and read(/write) learning via simple narrative accompaniment: The animations are accompanied by a simple step-by-step script that your child can readily adopt and transfer to real life. Most children of potty training age cannot read yet; they will simply hear and then mimic the verbal labels for each step.  However, many children on the autism spectrum, who are relatively late to potty train, may be able to recognize sight words surprisingly early. A 3–5 year-old child may be able to “read along”, further reinforcing the behavioral sequence. \n \nBackground\nThe See Me Go Potty app came about based on the developers’ experience potty training their three children and is grounded in Ann’s (mom’s) expertise in neuroscience (she holds a PhD in the neurobiology of learning and memory from UC Irvine). They overcame potty training difficulties with a child who has a communication/autism spectrum disorder by creating a step-by-step animated slide show narrative of her going to the bathroom. She readily transferred the process and the vocabulary to real-life toileting and was finally fully and successfully potty trained within a few weeks. When the Smiths’ youngest (typically developing) daughter was ready to potty train, they were preparing to adapt the narrative to look like her, and thought how nice it would have been to have done this for their eldest (typically developing) son, who had been outright defiant to the process. Moreover, they realized how all potty training parents and preschool teachers could appreciate this teaching tool and commenced development of this app."

      "label": "Designed by an Occupational Therapist.\nFirst & Then is a very simple app that uses a board with photos to show that one activity must happen before the next can occur. A fantastic tool for visual learners! \n\nThe idea behind a First & Then board is to encourage a child to complete an activity that they don’t particularly enjoy. The board motivates the child to engage in a less preferred activity, knowing that a preferred activity (or a reward) will follow. For example, the ‘first’ activity may be something such as handwriting, homework, eating vegetables, using the toilet or visiting the dentist. The ‘then’ activity may be playing outside, computer time or a chocolate treat. \n\nThe App is extremely simple to use, the board is set up from one page, with clear prompts to help along the way. \n\nThe app allows the user to quickly and simply insert photos from the device’s camera or photo library, meaning that ‘First & Then’ boards can be made on-the-go and with little fuss.  Photos taken are saved within the App to use again and again.\n\nThe app includes a coloured visual timer, that the user can choose to use, to show the child how long they need to spend on an activity. As well as a digital display, the time is also represented by a coloured pie chart. When the pie is green, the child needs to keep going. When the pie turns amber, the child needs to get ready to finish. The pie turns red when it is time to stop the activity.\n\nThe app also includes a ‘Finished box’. The child can drag the photo into this box when the activity is completed. \n\nThe App is complete with the option to use exciting tones to reward the child for completing the activity."

      "label": "For TEACHERS, this app puts all of the Secrets at your fingertips for quick & easy reference/use in online lessons—it will even tell the stories for you! It is not intended for screen-sharing/mirroring to other devices, due to built-in IP technology. For PARENTS & KIDS. it's the perfect way to \"learn & play\" with the Secrets to support reading & writing at home!\n\nThis app doesn't just “practice” phonics skills, it TEACHES them with trademarked, brain-based stories that explain the sounds letters make when they get together and pictures to help kids remember for reading & writing. Perfect for beginning and struggling readers of any age, Secret Stories® provides logical explanations for letter sound behavior that learners' brains crave!\n\nPHONICS WITH THE BRAIN IN MIND\nSecret Stories Better Alphabet™ Song is the fastest and easiest way to learn individual letters & sounds—using muscle memory to fast-track mastery in as little as 2 weeks! At the same time, kids are also learning the ‘grown-up’ reading & writing \"Secrets,\" which help them make sense of the sounds letters make when they get together in words.\n\nFor example, did you know that AU/AW are in love, and they get so embarrassed when they stand together, they always say, “Awww” (ex. saw, August); or that T&H don’t get along, and always stick their tongues out at each other and say, “Thhh!” (ex. the, this); or that ER/IR/UR are terrible, awful, horrible drivers that always slam on the brakes, “Errr!” (ex. her, bird, turn)? There are even sneaky letters, like Y, who stole the sounds of /E/ & /I/, but won’t use them unless he’s at the END of a word and thinks that no one will see him! (ex. yes, by, mommy)\n\nNO MORE telling kids, “It just is...It just does...You just have to remember!” when trying to explain all the crazy sounds that letters make. Now you can just tell them the Secrets! \n\nAPP FEATURES\n\nFast-Track the ABCs!\n • Better Alphabet™ Song for fast mastery of individual letters & sounds\n • Highlighted letter-tracking to reinforce sound-symbol connections\n • Targeted practice & random play\n\nFast-Track Phonics Skills!\n • Secret Stories® Sound Pictures to reference for reading & writing\n • Play the “secret” stories that explain each phonics sound\n • Play the sound/s that correspond with each Secret Story phonics pattern\n • Targeted practice & random play for reinforcement of sounds (for reading) & phonics patterns (for writing/spelling)\n\nPARENT FEEDBACK\n“One week in and I’ve already seen a difference in my son! He’s sounding out word after word. A month ago, he crawled under his bed crying and calling himself stupid, and today, he is looking for words to sound out!\"\n\n“No matter how long we worked, the letters & sounds weren’t sticking. Then we found the Better Alphabet and in 2 weeks, he knew them ALL!”\n\n“My son is THRIVING! He’s not the same reader he was 5 months ago. We’re even reconsidering his dyslexic label, as his improvement has been so drastic. He used to avoid reading at all costs and now he loves finding Secrets in words and trying to decode them. He’s finally fallen in love with reading!\"\n\n“There’s nothing else like it! The phonics stories take no effort for kids to remember. They just see it and get it! If they can’t read or spell a word, all they have to do is look at the Secrets to find the sound or spelling pattern. I can’t say enough about the difference they’ve made!”\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK\n“I added the Better Alphabet to my routine and am amazed what my kids picked up in the past 2 weeks! They’ve learned more letters & sounds this month than all of last year!”\n\n“The Secrets are my ‘secret weapon‘ for teaching tricky phonics skills! We use them for everything, from sounding out new words in reading lessons, to spelling words in writing lessons. The best part is, they work with anything!”\n\n\"Secret Stories is my most prized resource. It helps kids instantly identify phonics sounds in words. I recommend it to all my parents because I know the difference it makes!\""

      "label": "TeachMe: Math Facts is designed to help grade school students memorize math facts in addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Being able to recall simple math facts quickly is essential when doing more complex math. TeachMe: Math Facts is the sixth installment in the popular TeachMe series of educational apps for the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad. \n\nTeachMe: Math Facts helps teach math facts by giving quizzes by fact group (for example multiplication by 5’s). If a student earns a gold trophy in a fact group quiz, they graduate to the next fact group. If a student does not get a gold trophy on a quiz, the app will give extra practice on incorrectly answered questions, as well as on questions that they took a long time to answer. This extra practice is done by reviewing single questions and also timed questions 3 at a time. Once the student has reviewed problematic questions, they are given the chance to retake the quiz in that fact group.\n\nTeachMe: Math Facts keeps children engaged with a unique reward system in which children earn coins by playing learning games at the school. They can move around the rest of TeachTown to spend their coins on fun rewards. Children can build their dream home in the TeachTown Neighborhood, make creative photos at the Photobooth, collect stretchable shapes at the Shape Store, visit their virtual aquarium at the Fish Store, and decorate different scenes at the Art Store. The simple and intuitive user interface is child friendly, allowing children to play without help from an adult. Mimi Mouse, the animated teacher, gives verbal instructions and feedback in a positive way to encourage the student to learn and succeed!\n\nQuiz content, options and rewards can all be customized for each student. Parents choose the topic to start with, the range of fact groups in that topic, and the order of the operands. Parents can also change the quiz options: the number of questions, the time limit (if desired), the input mode (keyboard or writing) and more. Parents can also set the reward criteria for how a student earns each trophy and how many coins they can earn.\n\nEach child has an achievements screen which motivates and encourages learning by showing progress and trophies for each fact group. Parents can use this screen to quickly see progress of their child.\n\nFEATURES:\n• Achievement screen shows progress in each fact group\n• Earn trophies and coins for quizzes in each fact group\n• Dynamic practice where needed before re-quizzing\n• Quiz content, duration and rewards can be customized\n• Grading for quizzes can be customized\n• Choose between Keyboard input or TeachTech writing recognition\n• Explore TeachTown to spend coins on fun rewards\n• Design a dream house with the House Builder reward\n• Turn ordinary photos into zany pictures at the Photobooth\n• Collect stretchable shape rewards at the Shape Store\n• Tend to a Virtual Aquarium with 10 types of fish and 45+ items\n• 8 different sticker reward scenes: sky, space, playground, beach, underwater reef, pirate cove, city, farm\n• Over 175 different stickers for adding to scenes\n• Manual quiz mode\n• Classroom friendly personalized learning for up to 40 students\n• Tracks performance for questions (last three answers)\n• Export Sticker Scenes, Photobooth images, and Aquarium snapshots to Photos app, for emailing or to use as wallpaper\n\nLEARNING TOPICS:\n• Addition +0 through +12\n• Subtraction -0 through -12\n• Multiplication x0 through x12\n• Division ÷1 through ÷12\n\nPlease email us at support@24x7digital for help & suggestions.\n\nTry the other apps in the TeachMe series: TeachMe: 3rd Grade, TeachMe: 2nd Grade, TeachMe: 1st Grade, TeachMe: Kindergarten and TeachMe: Preschool / Toddler."

Your goal is to help Munchy catch each note as quickly as possible. \n\nThe game combines learning and fun into a single gratifying experience. The app is both educational and entertaining, with an intuitive and visually appealing interface. \n\nNoteWorks was created for: \n• iPhone, iPod touch and iPad users.\n• Players of all ages. \n• Beginners to advanced music students. \n• Families with multiple players. \n• Music teachers with multiple students. \n\nGame design features include: \n• A funny animated character. \n• User-friendly menus. \n• Superb graphics. \n• Engaging sound effects. \n\nNote reading options: \n• On-screen piano keyboard input.\n• On-screen guitar fretboard input.\n• MIDI keyboard input.  \n• \"A, B, C\" note naming:\n. . . CDEFGAB\n. . . CDEFGAH\n. . . ABCDEFG\n. . . AHCDEFG \n• \"Do, Re, Mi\" (Fixed Do) note naming. \n• Treble clef. \n• Bass clef. \n• Tenor clef. \n• Alto clef. \n• Custom note range in all four clefs.\n\nEducational features: \n• Students learn by playing and having fun. \n• Multiple game settings allow players to stay in control. \n• Students can choose to play with hints. \n• Students play without hints to earn points and stars. \n• Players learn to recognize notes instantly, on sight. \n• For beginners, the game starts by teaching a limited range of notes. \n• Note range can be easily customized as students advance. \n• After mastering accidentals, students learn key signatures. \n• Game speed is controlled to increase or decrease difficulty, or students may choose to play without any time limit.\n• Sharing of game progress: ability to share game results with teachers.\n\nWhile music teachers persistently stress the importance of sight reading, most teachers prefer not to spend valuable lesson time on basic note recognition skills. Thus, NoteWorks helps music teachers concentrate on more interesting aspects of their art, such as technique and musicality. \n\nSerious music students can take advantage of the game to learn clefs outside of their own instruments, as well as prepare for music theory exams. In addition, non-musicians could use NoteWorks as an interesting memory game, to help keep their minds sharp and quick. \n\nNoteWorks was created for people who like to learn by playing and having fun. It was designed with the objective of neither being too easy nor too hard, and never boring. We hope you'll find NoteWorks both useful and entertaining, and we would greatly appreciate it if you could share your thoughts and opinions about the game by rating it."

      "label": "Hit the Button Math is an app designed to help develop mental math and calculation skills.\n\nThe app is aimed at 5-11 year olds. There are 166 different game modes of varying difficulty so it is useful throughout grades K-5. Answer as many questions as possible in minute-long games, or you can now practice without the pressure of a countdown timer - a feature which is new for 2019. Questions are randomly generated which means it is very replayable. The game has been carefully designed for children, with large, widely spaced buttons. We recommend that young children play on a tablet.\n\nSix main topics are covered: \n\n* Times tables - up to 10 or 12 \n* Division - up to 10 or 12\n* Square numbers\n* Number bonds\n* Doubling \n* Halving\n\nBetween these topics, the four standard arithmetic operations are covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nYou can create up to 30 player profiles per device to track an individual's high scores (increased from 15 in 2019). If you prefer there's also the option to play as a guest. All data is stored locally on your device so you don't have to worry about privacy issues. We've also made it very easy for children to quickly switch between profiles after playing a game, if they're sharing a device.\n\nAfter each game, the score achieved is displayed along with the child's high score. Bronze, silver or gold stars and trophies are awarded depending on the score achieved in each game."

      "label": "TouchChat is a full-featured communication solution for individuals who have difficulty using their natural voice. TouchChat is designed for individuals with Autism, Down Syndrome, ALS, apraxia, stroke, or other conditions that affect a person's ability to use natural speech.\n\nThis version of TouchChat is bundled with the WordPower™ series of AAC vocabularies designed by Nancy Inman. WordPower is a word-based vocabulary that allows for easy and intuitive communication, while WordPower with Phrases incorporates phrases for easier language generation.\n\nTouchChat HD with WordPower includes both English and Spanish options in a universal app supporting iPhone®, iPod touch® and iPad®.  Additional languages such as Canadian French, Hebrew and Arabic can be purchased in the Upgrade Store.\n\nTouchChat fits into the category of assistive technology known as Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC).. Words, phrases and messages are spoken with a built-in voice synthesizer or by playing a recorded message. Various synthesized and custom voice options are available, allowing the user to choose a voice that fits their own personality. \nTouchChat also has a unique feature whereby one can simply tilt the device to make the message expand to fill the screen in large letters. This feature allows a person to communicate silently or in a noisy environment. \nTouchChat gives an individual the ability to navigate through page sets and speak messages. Page sets are linked pages, each of which is divided into a number of buttons. The buttons are programmed to have specific actions, such as speaking a message, navigating to a different page, changing the volume or clearing the display. \nVarious page sets are included with TouchChat: VocabPC, MultiChat15, Spelling, and Communication Journey: Aphasia are available in both English and Spanish options, myQuickChat©, MyCore, and 4 Basic are available in English, while Sintaxis and Sin Sintaxis files are available in Spanish. Each page set targets individuals with different communication needs. Additional English page sets including Gateway©, Pixon™60 and Talk About AAC are available as in-app purchases.\n\nText generated with TouchChat pages can be shared on social media or via iMessage® and email using a wireless connection. Generate a message, push on the text window and choose a service.  Additionally, text can be copied to/from TouchChat and other applications so it can be spoken out loud. \n\nThe pages, grid layout, buttons, messages, and symbols are fully customizable. Buttons can be copied and pasted into a different location or rearranged by simply dragging them to the desired new location. The styling of a button (colors, borders, fonts) can also be copied and pasted into another button.\n\nProvided page sets can be modified to create new custom page sets. Select from over 45 button actions and nearly 40,000 Symbolstix® symbols* when creating new buttons. You can also choose to use an existing image or take a photo with the built-in camera. Additionally, gestures can be used to navigate to new pages, speak messages, etc.\n\n*Please note: PCS© symbols can only be used in TouchChat after an in-app purchase is completed.\n\nButton activation timing can be adjusted to meet the needs and capabilities of the user. Adjustments include button dwell time and button release time. Buttons can also be configured to activate on release.\n\nUsers can program buttons to play audio files such as music from the media library or videos from the device or a YouTube™ link.\n\nOnce programming is complete, be sure to protect custom files. Vocabulary files can be imported and exported to a computer through iTunes® file sharing, DropBox™ or Google Drive™.  TouchChat also enables users to subscribe to iShare and store custom files for safe keeping (not available to customers residing in the European Union).\n\niPhone, iPod touch and iPad are trademarks of Apple Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries."

The milestones covered in the app start at age 18 months and now go up to age 5! \n\n\r\nThese milestones are the notorious “stages” or “phases” that children go through. These are those times when children “act up,” but it’s because new skills are emerging. This work documents both what the irritating behavior is and what the new skills are. Simply enter your child’s due date into the app, and a calendar is generated with their expected developmental milestones. Simply click on any colored date and get instant information about your child! Add as many children as you want. \r\n\nThe app currently offers the milestones, whereas the Observant Mom website and book series, Misbehavior is Growth, offers parenting tips and tricks for the milestones. Current work for older milestones (age 5+) can also be found at the website, The Observant Mom. \n\n\nAbout the App:\n\n\nØ  Click on any colored date and instantly find out what developmental milestone your child is (or will be) in!\n\n\nØ  The milestones in the app currently go from eighteen months through age four, ending at four.\n\n\nØ  Older milestones will be added to the app as they are finalized.\n\n\nØ  Older milestones can still be found on the website.\n\n\nØ  You may add as many children as you want!\n\n\nCountless have said that this work helps them stay patient as a parent or caregiver. Be sure to share this information with family and friends. It’s not misbehavior: it’s growth!"

      "label": "English grammar game app / Available on the iPhone and iPad\n\nSenGram is an iPhone and iPad language game which presents pre-prepared sentence diagram puzzles and solutions to those puzzles, for players to solve.\n\n(Please note: this is an educational sentence-diagramming puzzle game, it is NOT a tool which will solve your homework for you...). \n\nThis puzzle game tests and improves your ability to take sentences apart, identify the underlying grammatical structure, and reflect that structure on a diagram. \n\nThis game will be of interest to students of language (including ESL students), lovers of language and grammar, those sitting standardised tests with a grammar component (e.g. SAT, GMAT, NAPLAN) as well as those who are familiar with sentence diagrams and enjoy completing them as puzzles. The game might be especially useful to those students who are are currently studying a course in which sentence diagramming is used as a teaching tool.\n\n---------------------------\n\nSome reviews (US region):\n\nGreat App\nby Beezer88 - Version 1.00 - Aug 11, 2012. This is great for teaching how to diagram a sentence. Keep developing!!! :)\n\nSpectacular!\nby Viskid - Version 1.00 - Aug 11, 2012\nThis application has been used to great effect in my classroom. Used as part of the daily warmup, my kids are becoming so efficient at this oft forgotten skill. 5 stars and a hip-hip-hooray for this app.\n\nWorthwhile\nby GhostGame123 - Version 1.00 - Aug 9, 2012. I teach Latin and a major difficulty is getting the students to see the structure of sentences. The problem, at least in part, is that they don't (or can't) see structure even in English--no one teaches diagramming any more. I'm going to try to incorporate this into this year's classes. Thanks; I'd certainly buy more elaborate versions or buy upgrades in app.\n\nLove it!\nby Louwege - Version 1.00 - Jul 19, 2012\nPlease continue to develop. Great aid to learning. Thank you.\n\n--------------------\n\nYour objective when playing the game will be to place each word in the 'puzzle sentence' in its correct place on the 'sentence diagram'.\n         \nAt present the app includes over 100 sentence puzzles, including:\n\n(1) Subject and verb: 20 sentences.\n(2) Article, adjective, adverb, possessive: 21 sentences.\n(3) Prepositional phrase, adverbial noun: 20 sentences.\n(4) Object - direct, indirect: 20 sentences.\n(5) Linking verb: 20 sentences.\n(6) Co-ordinating conjunction: 12 sentences.\n(7) Challenge puzzles: 10 sentences.\n\nIn addition, there are further puzzles for purchase within the app in the 'SenGram Store'.\n\nThe style of diagram adopted in this app is known as the 'Reed Kellogg' style, and there are many websites and books devoted to it. In our view this style of diagramming offers one of the more enjoyable ways to test and improve your knowledge of grammar, especially if you have a visual mind.\n\nBest of luck! We hope you enjoy the puzzles!"

      "label": "• Featured by Apple \"Fun new way to learn math\"\n• Children's Technology Review Editors' Choice Award\n• \"Highly Recommended\" - Teachers with Apps\n\nA fun, unique, and innovative approach to math instruction for children ages 5 to 12! \n\nSANDBOX\nThanks to its Sandbox allowing users to create and interact with mathematical expressions freely, the application helps kids to learn and understand:\n\n • What are addition and subtraction, visually showing them \"how it works\"\n • What do we mean by an equality and an inequality\n • What are math symbols ( +, -, =, >,<)\n • How to manipulate terms of math expressions and equations (like isolating a variable or moving a number)\n\nEXERCISES\nWith hundreds of built-in exercises, children can practice mental arithmetic and learn the rules of algebra. You can even create new exercises yourself!\n\nVIRTUAL MANIPULATIVES\nMathematics education organizations strongly advocate the use of manipulatives. They believe manipulatives allow students to actively construct their own understanding of math. Math Wizard is a new generation of virtual manipulatives which allows kids to explore math concepts.\n\nENGAGING FOR KIDS\nWe took special care to make the app fun and engaging so that children love manipulating the different terms of mathematical expressions!\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE \nMany settings are available to adapt the application to the child's level, including:\n\n • Numbers can be displayed using digits or beads that visually show the amount that numbers represent \n • Voice can be enabled to read numbers and operations aloud\n • Numbers available in the sandbox can be customized (the app handles positive and negative integers - up to 10 billion!)\n • Choose to allow inequality or force equality\n • Animation Speed\n\nYou can add as many users as you want, and view the activity history of each user\n\n-------------\nACTIVITIES\n-------------\n\n  Sandbox \n\nThe sandbox is an open-ended activity that allows users to experiment freely with algebra rules. You can add the numbers you want, and thus create and interact with any expressions or equations you want. \n\nFor parents and educators, it's a tool to show what are addition,  subtraction, equality and inequality. It also shows users how they can manipulate terms. For students, it's a tool to experiment with numbers in order to better understand \"how it works.\"\n\n  Exercises \n\nThe app contains hundreds of built-in exercises (additions, subtraction, equality, inequality, isolate a variable, brain teaser), but you can also create your own exercises!\n\nThe goal of each exercise is to reproduce an expression or equation (e.g., \"3\", \"4=4\", or \"x=3\") starting from another expression or equation (e.g., \"1+2\", \"2+2=3+1\", \"-1+x=2\"). This requires the child to interact with the numbers and operators in order to build their understanding of how algebra works (again, the child can only do what is permitted by algebra)\n\n---------------\n\nFEATURES\n\n  • Positive and negative integer numbers (up to 10 billion!)\n  • \"x\" variable \n  • Expressions with + and - operators\n  • Equality and inequality\n  • Division by 2\n  • Undo/redo operations and manipulations\n  • Unlimited number of users\n  • Record user activities\n  \nMany settings are available to customize the app, so it can fit the needs of both educators and students:\n\n • Number display mode (beads or digits)\n • Voice for numbers and operations\n • Custom numbers (Sandbox)\n • Do operations by dragging numbers on top of each other\n • Authorize inequality\n • Authorize division by 2\n • Animation Speed\n  \nFeel free to send us your feedback and suggestions so we can add them to the next update! support@lescapadou.com\n\nHave fun with algebra!"

The application will help you identify instruments visually and by the name.\n\nUsing Pinch to Zoom will allow you to see more detail of said instrument.  This will allow for better identification.\n\nTo make finding the instrument quick utilize the search function at the top of the application. Search by instrument \"Type\", \"Name\", and \"Keyword\".\n\nSince there are so many instruments available that have multiple uses, we have now made it to where you can sort them into their main categories of uses.\nJust select the \"Specialty\" tab and type one of the following:\n\nAccessories\nCardiothoracic\nDermal & Podiatry\nEnt, Sinus & Plastic\nGeneral\nLaparascopic\nNeuro & Ortho\nOB & GYN\nOpthalmology\nUrology & Rectal\n \nSurgical Instrumentation features a great section that explains the process on how instruments are processed the moment they enter the decontamination room of a hospital or similar facility.\n\nWhen you are done take some time to test your knowledge with four (Instrument Match, Multiple Choice, Right, Wrong and more) included quiz games which could help you with the CRCST or CIS exams.\n\nNow try and guess the correct name with no time limit with the \"Flash Card\" mode.\n\nHelp boost your memory with the The Surgical Instrumentation matching game, which lets you pick the correct name with the shown instrument. \n\n**There are no \"In-App Purchases\", so all Instruments and quizzes are fully available.**\nOptimized for iPhone, iPad compatible.\n\n*****We are cramming as much value as possible into this app.  Thank You all for your support!*****"

      "label": "From SmartAppsforKids.com: \"In my opinion, the full version is a must-have for parents of children working on increasing expressive vocabulary, as well as the therapists and teachers who support their learning. First Phrases is creative, utilizes the iPad’s features in effective ways, and is engaging for young children. Highly recommended.\"\n\nThis interactive, beautifully illustrated and animated app for the iPHONE is perfect for the toddler or speech-delayed child who is learning how to put two or three words together or any child who is learning basic English phrases. It provides many opportunities to both hear (receptive), see, and say/record (expressive) 72 different verb + noun combinations, such as: eat the carrot, blow the bubble, ride the bike, throw the ball, sleep on the bed, put away the toys, and more. Check out our YouTube video for a demonstration of this app (iPad version) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXw4WPlrmwg\n\nWith  different characters performing them, there are 456 possible animations so your child will never be bored! \n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: THIS IS A HUGE APP DUE TO THE MANY ANIMATIONS, PICTURES AND VOICE RECORDINGS CONTAINED IN IT. IT SHOULD BE DOWNLOADED THROUGH A DIRECT OR WI-FI CONNECTION. DOWNLOADING IT VIA A PHONE CONNECTION MAY RESULT IN AN INCOMPLETE INSTALLATION, WHICH MEANS IT WILL NOT WORK RIGHT. \n\nThere are 17 simple verbs such as drink, eat, wash, and 12 verb + preposition forms such as jump on, take off or turn on. Each verb form is paired with various nouns to make a logical phrase. It is also a great way to teach the article “the” in a meaningful phrase context. In addition, it includes user settings for up to 15 children, making it an excellent choice for professional use by a speech-language pathologist or special needs classroom at a fraction of the cost of traditional educational software, with no additional “professional” version fees.\n\nHow you play: Tell the cute animals what to do! By touching the illustrated parts of the phrases in order (verb+ object forms: “eat the carrot”) the child hears the pre-recorded spoken phrase modeled. The user has the option to repeat this action once, twice or three times in the settings for maximum auditory input.\n\nThe child then watches the animal of their choice (bear, mouse or cat) perform the command to help associate the words with their meaning. Now it’s the child’s turn to say it and tell the animal what to do! Touch the microphone and record, listen again, and watch the animal follow your direction. Use the optional visual support to help your child remember what to say!\n\nThis format is especially powerful for children with speech delays and autism spectrum disorders who need strong visual support with as little background clutter as possible, and for use in speech therapy sessions. The format also is a terrific way to support early literacy for left to right orientation, reading (with text on feature) and word boundaries. Options include text on/text off, recording feature on/off, girl or boy voice models, presentation of the phrase in 3 segments (verb + the + object) or 2 segments (verb + the object).\n\nPRIVACY POLICY: We do NOT collect personal data from our users and have no ads! Personal data regarding user performance on the tasks on this app are self-contained and not transmitted in any way. This app does include an in-app purchase.\n\nDeveloped by noted speech-language pathologist and author of Childhood Speech, Language & Listening Problems: What Every Parent Should Know, Patti Hamaguchi, M.A., CCC-SLP.\n\nTo find out more about this app and our other upcoming projects, visit our website: www.hamaguchiapps.com"

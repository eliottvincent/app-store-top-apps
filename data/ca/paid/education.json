      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

      "label": "Bloups permet d’apprendre à lire dans le plaisir… Application entièrement conçue par une orthopédagogue. \n\nDescription du contenu pédagogique de Bloups : (choix de l’accent: français, québécois ou belge) \n\n1) Lecture de syllabes : niveaux de difficulté progressifs \n- syllabes simples (ex. : la, ma, ar, etc.) \n- syllabes comportant des sons simples (ex. : lou, lin, leu, etc.) \n- syllabes comportant des sons complexes (ex. : rouille, rein, gue, etc.) \n- syllabes comportant des confusions visuelles (ex. : bo, do, po) et des confusions auditives (ex. :di, ti) \n\n2) Lecture de mots : \n- mots simples (ex. : rire, tomate, etc.) \n- mots complexes (ex. : combien, explication, etc.) \n- mots irréguliers (ex. : femme, monsieur, etc.) \n\n3) Chronomètre (optionnel) : \n- permet au joueur (qui le souhaite) de toujours améliorer son propre temps en lecture \n\n4) Repère visuel structurant (fiole d’énergie) : \n- indique au joueur le nombre d’items réussis et le nombre d’items restants \n\nParents et pédagogues s’intéressent à cette application éducative, car elle s’adresse aux lecteurs débutants et intermédiaires. Elle est aussi recommandée aux jeunes ayant des difficultés ou des troubles en lecture (ex.: dyslexie d’assemblage, autisme, etc.). \n\nÉtant réalisée par une orthopédagogue, la progression de chaque niveau respecte les étapes d’apprentissage de la lecture syllabique. De ce fait, Bloups représente un défi juste, raisonnable et motivant qui tient compte de la progression propre à chaque enfant. Le focus est porté essentiellement sur la lecture de syllabes; condition essentielle à une bonne rapidité et une bonne justesse en lecture de mots et de phrases. En effet, la lecture de pseudo-mots (ex.: remu, lumiron, bratoir, etc.) oblige l’élève à lire, à décoder correctement chaque syllabe, il ne peut donc pas “deviner” le mot par une lecture globale. Pour être un bon lecteur, il faut, entre autres, maîtriser les deux voix de lecture, c’est-à-dire, la lecture syllabique et la lecture globale. Bloups représente donc une application pour apprendre à lire efficacement. \n\n\nLe contenu pédagogique de cette application favorise essentiellement l’augmentation de la vitesse de lecture, la précision du décodage, l’apprentissage de la fusion phonémique et l’apprentissage de la segmentation de différentes structures syllabiques. Il contribue aussi à l’automatisation de la lecture de sons composés (ex. : ou, on, in, en, an) et de sons complexes (ex. : g, c, aille, ouille, etc). Enfin, la lecture de mots simples, complexes et irréguliers incluse dans Bloups permet au joueur de faire le pont entre la lecture de syllabes et la lecture de mots réels. \n\nBut du jeu : \nLe joueur doit écouter la syllabe, la structure syllabique ou le mot donné oralement pour ensuite repérer la bonne réponse parmi les bulles proposées par les monstres. Après 5 succès, le joueur obtient une page de jeu de 5 secondes et après 20 succès (fiole toute remplie), le joueur est mené vers la découverte d’un nouveau monstre où la complexité de la lecture de syllabes est légèrement plus complexe. Pour l’apprenant, le but est d’amasser le plus de monstres possible et d’améliorer son propre temps s’il reprend un monstre ! Apprendre à bien lire devient alors monstrueusement amusant ! \n\nVariante : \nIl est possible pour l’adulte de déverrouiller préalablement tous les monstres d’une même ligne afin de proposer seulement un monstre précis à l’enfant en fonction de ses besoins particuliers. Par exemple, l’adulte aura déverrouillé les monstres 31 et 32 pour que l’enfant n’ait qu’à faire le monstre 33 travaillant les confusions spatiales et visuelles b, d, p, q."

      "label": "GraphoGame Français » est un logiciel d’entraînement au décodage qui aide les enfants d'âge préscolaire et primaire et les enfants en difficultés à renforcer leurs premières compétences en lecture. Ce jeu aide l’enfant à apprendre les sons des lettres et des groupes de lettres en présentant simultanément les sons (ou mots) correspondant et les groupes de lettres.\n\nLa progression du jeu est basée sur des données scientifiques : le logiciel été développé par des linguistes, des neuropsychologues et des orthophonistes pour aider les enfants - en particulier les lecteurs en difficulté - à renforcer les automatismes fondamentaux de la lecture.\n\n« GraphoGame – Français » accompagne l’enfant à travers différents jeux avec son propre personnage qu’il fait évoluer au cours du jeu. Le joueur passe progressivement aux syllabes, aux rimes, aux mots courts et aux phrases et apprend peu à peu à décoder des mots plus longs. En jouant 15 minutes quotidiennement, l'enfant améliorera sa précision dans le décodage des lettres, des mots, et sa vitesse de lecture. \n\nLa plateforme GraphoGame est développée par une communauté de chercheurs et de développeurs de jeux leader en Finlande, tandis que le contenu francophone de « GraphoGame Français » a été développé par le Laboratoire de Psychologie Cognitive (CNRS) de l'Université d'Aix-Marseille.\n\nPour plus d’informations sur le contenu francophone, n’hésitez pas à vous rendre sur le site http://grapholearn.fr."

To know how to count, read, write, represent and compare numbers rests on knowledge impossible to circumvent, since preliminary to the control of more complex concepts in mathematics.\n \nFor this reason Blips! was elaborate.\n\nThis application is addressed all to the children between 3 and 10 years. It is also especially recommended to the young people having difficulties or disorders of training (dyscalculia,dyslexia, TSA, etc.)\n\nGoal of the game:\nThe player must listen to the number given orally for then locating the good answer among the bubbles proposed by the robots. After 20 successes, the player is carried out towards the discovery of a new robot whose complexity gradually micro is graduated. For learning, the goal is to pile up the most robots possible and to improve its own time if it plays again a robot later on unlocked!\n \nAlternative:\nBlips! can be personalized to meet definite needs. Thus, the adult can unlock before hand all the robots of the same line or proposing only one precise robot with the child according to his special needs."

This includes the location and name each part/prominence of the bone as well as identifying the prominences that specific muscles attach to.\n\nEach muscle is covered in a highly detailed and accurate way. The criteria each muscle is tested on includes the most commonly tested questions in anatomy education: Fibre orientation(s), origin, insertion, cross-section, action, nerve innervation, and blood supply.\n\nThis app is perfect for quick review before a test by specific anatomic region or you can customize a test in our “Custom Random” mode. For causal review on the go or for summative tests (multiple regions and criteria) use our “Full Random Testing” mode to be rapidly quizzed on the entire Simple Lines Anatomy content at random.\n\nUse in-game statistics to monitor your accuracy and progress in each body region and testing type. Select “Weak Areas Occur More Frequently” to have questions you previously answered incorrectly show more often to strengthen your knowledge in that region."

Unfortunately, most simulation systems are large, immobile, expensive, and complicated to use. This app is for health care providers interested in using medical simulation for teaching. \n\nThis app creates a remotely controlled bedside patient monitor to facilitate medical simulations. To be effective, the app requires 2 devices (e.g. phone + tablet). It functions in 2 modes: monitor (display) and administrator (control the display). In monitor mode, the app displays customizable vital signs (including heart rate, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, blood pressure, end-tidal CO2, temperature) with options for cardiac rhythms (sinus, SVT, V fib) and associated waveforms/tracings. In administrator mode, a control panel offers the ability to immediately activate/inactivate and adjust each of the data fields. \nHealth educators can use the app with a simple resuscitation dummy (or even a child’s baby doll) and a user-provided case to lead an effective medical simulation anywhere from bedside to roadside."

The letters are thick at the bottom, which helps to avoid confusion and better follow the line to be read.\n\nThis font is often used in schools to compensate for reading problems for dyslexic, dysorthographic and dyspraxic people.\n\nYou will be able to write or reformat documents to adapt them to these pathologies.\n\nTip: Besides using these fonts, I also advise airing out the text by increasing the font size, and the spacing between letters/words and lines. This will further improve the readability of the text.\n\nWith this application, you will be able to:\n\n● Install OpenDyslexic fonts and use them in other applications to write documents\n● Send emails with OpenDyslexic font\n● Write messages and send them by generating an image with the font\n\nHere are the known compatible applications:\n\n● Office 365, Word, Excel, Keynote\n● Pages, Numbers, Keynote\n● Cricut Design Space\n\n\nFonts installed by the app:\n\n- OpenDyslexic3-Bold\n- OpenDyslexic3-Regular\n- OpenDyslexicMono-Regular\n- OpenDyslexic-Bold\n- OpenDyslexic-BoldItalic\n- OpenDyslexic-Italic\n- OpenDyslexic-Regular\n- OpenDyslexicAlta-Bold\n- OpenDyslexicAlta-BoldItalic\n- OpenDyslexicAlta-Italic\n- OpenDyslexicAlta-Regular"

      "label": "Bible Vocab+ is a simple and fun way to learn vocabulary from the Greek New Testament and the Hebrew Old Testament. Watch our online tutorial here: https://youtu.be/W63jhYWNNv0\n\nProfessor Robert Plummer (co-author of Going Deeper with New Testament Greek) said about the app: 'Who could imagine that a Greek New Testament vocabulary app with this much power and flexibility even existed? I'm amazed at the intuitive design and ability to customize vocabulary acquisition to particular sections of text. I'm confident that this vocabulary app will help thousands of pastors and students read the Greek New Testament with greater fluency, confidence, and understanding. I enthusiastically endorse it.'\n\n* Vocab Lists *\nYou can choose vocab lists from any passage in the Bible or from the following leading Greek and Hebrew textbooks:\n* Fuller & Choi, Invitation to Biblical Hebrew\n* Garrett & DeRouchie, A Modern Grammar for Biblical Hebrew\n* Hackett, A Basic Introduction to Biblical Hebrew\n* Pratico & Van Pelt. Basics of Biblical Hebrew (eds. 2 & 3)\n* Ross, Introducing Biblical Hebrew, Baker Academic\n* Seow, A Grammar for Biblical Hebrew\n* Baugh, A New Testament Greek Primer\n* Decker, Reading Koine Greek, Baker Academic\n* Duff, The Elements of New Testament Greek\n* Kostenberger, Merkle, & Plummer. Going Deeper with New Testament Greek\n* Merkle & Plummer, Beginning with New Testament Greek\n* Mounce, Basics of Biblical Greek\n* Rollinson, Online Greek Textbook\n\nNB. The vocab items may occasionally be in a different form to how they appear in the textbook.\n\n* Spaced Repetition *\nThe smarter way to learn vocab. This allows you to test yourself on items at set intervals which increase the more times that record that know it correctly. Just tap on the spaced repetition button (the arrow button in the right corner) and it will tell you the words you need to study next.\n\n* Reading Mode *\nUse the power of spaced repetition to get better at reading whole verses in the Bible. If you've learned enough vocab in Spaced Repetition mode to cover whole verses, Reading Mode will introduce these verses to you, first with the parsing, dictionary form and glosses and thereafter you will need to read it just the original language. These verses will be shown to you at intervals which increase the more familiar you are with each verse.\n\n* Slideshow Modes *\nVocab Mode: where you see the words in their dictionary form \nParsing Mode: where you see the words in the way they appear in the text and you are tested on their grammatical form.\nVerses Mode: see whole verses as well as parsing, dictionary forms, and glosses.\n\n* Greek Audio *\nDr. George Athas from Moore College in Sydney has recorded the audio for all the words in the Greek New Testament using a restored koine pronunciation system. You can try the audio for the 100 most frequently occurring used words for free and if you like it you can pay to download more.\n\n* Data Sources * \nYou can choose between four Greek Testament texts: SBL, Westcott-Hort, Tischendorf, and Byzantine. The OT text is based on the Westminster Leningrad Codex, as provided by Open Scriptures. The Greek Lexicons are:\n* Dodson (2010) - greeklexicon.org\n* Mounce Concise Greek-English Lexicon (© 1993. William Mounce. All Rights Reserved - billmounce.com/greek-dictionary)\nThe Hebrew/Aramaic Lexicon is derived chiefly from the Brown-Driver-Briggs, as provided by Open Scriptures.\nYou can also use the glosses from the available textbooks.\n\n* Try for Free! *\n'Bible Vocab+' is the full paid version of the app which will not need to be unlocked. If you would like to try it for free, you can download the 'Bible Vocab' app here: \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bible-vocab/id518563673?ls=1&mt=8\nThat app can be unlocked to the full features of 'Bible Vocab+' as an In-App Purchase.\n\nFor more information, check out our website: \nhttp://www.bible-vocab.com\nCheck out our Facebook page for recent updates and tips:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/BibleVocabApp"

      "label": "Team Shake provides a technological and environmentally friendly way to choose teams for board games, sporting events, tournaments, school projects or anytime groups are required. The newest release brings many new features including full iPad support, balancing teams based on skill or gender, importing users from a file, enabling video output, and sharing teams via facebook or email. \n\nTeam Shake is the premier iOS App for creating teams. Instead of a hat and scraps of paper, the user enters his friends' names in his iPhone and gives it a shake. The screen will then display a random set of color-coded teams. These teams can immediately be used for game play or shared via facebook or email.   The quick and easy selection of random (or balanced) teams eliminates fighting over who will be on which team. Innovative use of the iPhone shake gesture gives users the satisfying feeling of shaking a virtual hat without the trouble of carrying around an actual hat. Conventional buttons can also be used for those who would rather not shake their expensive hardware about.  \n\nThe app is designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind. Names can easily be entered with the onscreen keyboard, chosen from the user's contacts, or imported from a file. The email and facebook functions document the members of each individual team as well as preserving the team number and color assigned by the app. For repeated use of Team Shake, lists of friends can be easily saved and loaded later. The current list is also automatically saved so that if you exit the app, or even reboot the device, changes will not be lost. For teachers and others with large lists of people, Team Shake supports the ability to import teams from text or csv files.\n\nIf you have any problems, feature requests, or comments please send an email to support@rhine-o.com. \n\nFeatures:\n\n* Create 1 to 64 random teams\n* Create completely random or balanced teams\n* Full iPad support\n* Eliminates fighting over choosing teams\n* Share / Save teams via email or Facebook\n* Teams can be chosen by the number of teams or by the size of teams.\n* Save lists of friends for later games\n* Import lists from email or spreadsheet\n* Export lists and options for use on another device\n* Satisfying feeling of shaking a “virtual” hat to create teams\n* Animated shaking hat\n* Entry of names via onscreen keyboard\n* Entry of names via iPhone contacts\n* Temporarily disable people who are absent\n* Set groups of people to always be on the same team\n* Set groups of people to always be on different teams\n* Set user strength to make more even teams (now supports fully balanced teams)\n* 5 users strengths level\n* Pick a single random person from the list of players\n* User strength indicator on the main screen (can be disabled in options)\n* Number of active players and total players is now displayed on the main screen\n* Video Out Support\n* Option to Sort Teams by Name\n* Option to balance male / female team members\n* \"Equal Ability\" option to create teams where all players have the same strength\n* Option to create separate male and female teams\n* Configurable Team Colors\n* Configurable Team Names\n* Print Support\n* Export Teams in CSV or XLS Format\n* Team Shake now supports simultaneously assigning players to multiple subteams and / or oppose teams at the same time.\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now have customized names to make selection easier\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now be enabled or disabled globally so that teams can be made quickly without subteams / oppose teams.  In particular, Balance Teams Strengths will work when separate Male / Female teams are created.\n\nYappler-Tags: Teams, Groups, Random, Hat, Entertainment, Games, Utilities"

      "label": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

      "label": "*Rated 1 of the 15 best psychology apps by CareersInPsychology.org!*\n\nPass the EPPP with confidence! With these flash cards, containing information similar to that found in other much more expensive study materials, you will be well on your way to joining the others who have passed the EPPP the very first time using our app! \n\nOffering the most comprehensive mobile psychology study materials on the app store since 2010, StudyPsych’s EPPP Flash Cards consist of over 2,500 flash cards delineated by all of the content areas covered on the EPPP:\n\n01. Ethics and Professional Issues\n02. Diagnosis & Psychopathology (Abnormal)\n03. Clinical Psychology\n04. Learning Theory and Behaviorism\n05. Industrial/Organizational Psychology\n06. Lifespan Developmental Psychology\n07. Neuropsychology & Psychopharmacology \n08. Research Design and Statistics\n09. Test Construction and Interpretation\n10. Social Psychology\n11. Intellectual Assessment\n12. Community Psychology\nPlus 1,000 Practice Test Questions\n\nThe StudyPsych flash cards were designed by a licensed psychologist who has helped many pass the EPPP, comprehensive exams, and other psychology tests the first time. Users of these flash cards are provided with multiple study options, including:\n\n- The ability to receive more information pertaining to a topic on a specific flash card by linking to the web from directly within the app. This is easily one of the most helpful aspects of our study system.\n\n- Two smart study modes that automatically focus more on the cards you miss: “Leitner (Short-term Goal)” and a more advanced “Spaced Repetition” mode\n\n- Built in searchable \"dictionary\" of your cards that allows you to easily look up terminology while you are studying\n\n- 3 response levels: I Don’t Know, I Know, I Know Well (compared to the standard “right/wrong”)\n\n- FREE access to single-sided and double-sided printable PDF files of all of the flash cards, for those who would prefer that study modality\n\n- Easy navigation – swipe or tap to answer (customizable)\n\n- Incredible support! I make it a point to respond to all questions and feedback as soon as possible, whether it is about the flash cards, examinations, or psychology in general. Email me anytime for support.\n\nThis app does not require a network connection, so you can study whenever you want from wherever you are at!\n\nContact Info: StudyPsychEPPP@gmail.com\n\n\n**FAQ**\n\nQUESTION 1: If I purchase the app on my iPhone, can I use it on other iOS devices? \nANSWER 1: YES! Purchase the app a single time and use it on your iPhone, iPad, and iPod devices.\n\nQUESTION 2: Is the app content updated annually? \nANSWER 2: We actually update the app’s content more than annually. However, it would be difficult to notice any significant changes, primarily because not much is added each year. In fact, all the “big guys” only say they update their material annually as a sales gimmick. Don’t take my word for it? Compare older study books (usually free at your school library) to the most recent books and you’ll notice the information is nearly an exact match. \n\nQUESTION 3: Why does this app cost more than other EPPP apps?\nANSWER 3: A lot of time and effort was put into making this app, from condensing the most “need-to-know” information to linking the cards to websites. Also, ours is the most comprehensive mobile EPPP app, addressing every content area covered on the actual exam. The amount, quality, and presentation of the content in the others apps pale in comparison.\n\nQUESTION 4: Is this app all I need to pass the EPPP the first time?\nANSWER 4: While we are uncomfortable making such assertions, many users who passed the exam have contacted us to tell us our app is all they used to study. With the option to retrieve more information about a particular topic provided on most cards, there really is no need to purchase other study materials! Rather, we recommend concerned users get their hands on an old (free) set of study books and use them alongside our app."

The Elements is a rich and engaging love story, told in words and pictures - allowing you to experience the beauty and fascination of the building blocks of our universe in a way you've never seen before.\n\nStart off on a living periodic table where every element is shown with a smoothly rotating sample. To read about gold, tap the gold nugget. Immediately you see the sample filling the screen, photographed to razor sharpness and rotating around a complete circle in front of your eyes. Enjoy the extensive array of facts and figures. Next find a fascinating story about the element, surrounded by carefully photographed objects representing it. Every one of these objects, well over 500 in total, is a freely rotatable, live object that you can examine from all sides and pinch zoom to see in unprecedented detail.\n\nTouch the element name at the top of the page and you can see that element’s name in over a dozen different languages. Choose one and you’ll find that the entire book, stories, captions and all, switches to that language: The Elements includes both the full English original text and over a dozen full translations.\n\nPinch-zoom or tap any object to bring it up full screen, where you can split into a pair of stereo 3D images, allowing you to see all 500 objects pop off the screen in 3D, and you can spin the objects, in 3D, with the touch of a finger.\n\nThis book will show everyone there’s a lot more to the periodic table than a bunch of numbers and letters.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n• Beautifully composed pages for every Element in the periodic table\n• Fun stories and fascinating facts \n• All objects pinch-zoom with amazing detail and rotate in 3D\n• Engaging introduction explaining the structure of the periodic table\n• Engaging introduction explaining the structure of the periodic table\n• Fully translated into English, Catalan, Croatian, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish\n\n------------\nReviews:\n\n“The iPad’s splendor and power may be best shown by The Elements... it’s not like any ebook you’ve seen.

Math problems are presented at the top of the game screen. Feedback is presented at the bottom of the game screen. Correct solutions to problems answered incorrectly will be displayed. \n\nScoring\nThe score in Math Bingo is determined by the time to complete a game plus a two second penalty for each problem answered incorrectly. \n\nExample:\nTime to complete game 0:45 seconds\nIncorrect answers: 3\nScore: 45+6=51 \n\nPlayer Profiles\nMath Bingo saves player information with custom player profiles. Each player profile consists of a unique name (up to 20 characters) and a fun cartoon avatar. The player profiles display total number of games played, total number of high scores achieved, and total number of Bingo Bugs collected. The guest profile does not store any information and therefore cannot achieve high scores or collect Bingo Bugs. The guest profile is useful for adults who want to play Math Bingo without their scores going into the scoreboard. \n\nSelecting a Game\nThere are five different games in Math Bingo: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Mixed. Players will be prompted to select a game type before game play. Selecting a Level There are three levels of game play in Math Bingo: easy, medium, and hard.

Gain an understanding of what the \"vortex of creation\" means and how you can use meditation to enter the vortex in order to allow the Law of Attraction to work for you. Also gain valuable insights about what happens to your affirmations and manifestation efforts when you are out of the vortex.  Five guided meditation audio sessions with music are included in this app.  \n\nListeners will be led by Abraham through four guided meditation sessions on these topics: General Well-Being, Financial Abundance, Physical Well-Being and Relationships.   Each guided meditation experience is 15 minutes long.   \n\nThis Vortex of Attraction Guided Meditation iPhone App is an exact duplicate of the physical product and includes the complete written text, and the complete audio recording along with an extra bonus track of guided meditation music which was not included with the original product.\n\nMany people exert manifestation and Law of Attraction efforts outside of the Vortex, and then conclude that the Law of Attraction \"doesn't work.\" Find out how to stop efforting and start allowing the Vortex of Creation to align you with the life you desire.  These are the first guided meditation recordings ever produced containing the Teachings of Abraham."

The flash cards include definitions, clear graphics and video links to enhance learning and understanding. \n\nThe app is based on the popular Learner’s Licence Prep Kit.  With more than 60 000 sales, the Prep Kit is now the most popular way to prepare for the Learner’s test. The study cards are based on the Driver’s Handbook and have been reviewed by driving experts.  Developed by educational experts, the Prep Kits are based on sound learning theory.  Use the app to learn the rules of the road, and you will be on your way to becoming a safe driver.  \n\nWhy this format is the best way to learn the rules of the road. \n•The information is divided into bite-sized pieces. \n•You can clearly distinguish between what you do know and what you don’t know.  This way, you can focus on what you need to learn. \n•The app is divided into chapters to match the handbook.  \n•The graphics match the graphics in the handbook. \n•Most apps use a multiple choice format designed to test your knowledge; they are not a teaching tool. \n•Clear, driving related definitions make it a great tool for English language learners. \n•Video links provide more in-depth information."

The child can then choose an activity to do while waiting. \n\nFeelings Board \nThe Feelings Board provides a tool for helping children understand and express emotions. The user can begin by reading the companion book, When I Get Upset, to provide an example of how the child might recognize an emotion and choose a coping strategy. On the Feelings Board, the user can then help the child indicate how they are feeling from a range of options, select a coping strategy, and then request an activity to help them feel better or re-engage with others. \n\nFeelings Scale\nHelps users identify, manage and cope with feelings across environments throughout the day. By tracking their feelings on the board, users can analyze the data for trends to learn if tasks done at different times of day or in different environments affect outcome. Environments and schedules can then be altered to achieve better results.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.beevisual.com/mobile-app-eula.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.beevisual.com/mobile-app-privacy.html"

      "label": "Thinking of acquiring your PAL license?\n\nIn Canada, to get your gun license you need to pass 2 theoretical tests as well as practical exams. To help you not to get lost in the maze of legal and safety questions, not to be dazzled by unknown terms during theory and to get the hang of what real CRFSC and CFSC exams are, we have created this quiz app. Few hours of practice with this app - and you will confidently pass actual theory tests at your exam.\n\nThe application contains 250+ questions, which help you to master your knowledge by practicing offline (you don't need an Internet connection) and, thus, utilizing your time better.\n\nFeatures:\n- 250+ questions based on CRFSC/CFSC preparation materials\n- Randomly generated quizzes\n- Quiz capacity is optimized for fastest tuition\n- Reviewing included comments for the most complicated/tricky questions\n- Practical advice and weapon handling techniques from the best firearms instructors\n\nSome recommendations for your exam:\n1. Start preparing 2 to 1 week before your exam (on one hand you don't want to forget anything, but on the other hand you want to avoid an information overload);\n2. Found unknown term - find out what it is. Otherwise you may face it on your exam;\n3. If you theory is on Friday evening and practice and exams are on Saturday, make sure you don't have to cook your dinner on Friday (you will get home quite late);\n4. Good sleep is important!\n5. The cornerstone of the exam is ACTS and PROVE. Learn its meaning by heart, and practice. If you can't practice with real arms at home, at least watch videos and visualize the process. At practical exam you need to ACTS and PROVE you gun all the time. For example, instructor says: \"Put the gun on the table!\" - you ACTS and PROVE it and only then place on the table. And so on.\n\nGood luck with your PAL/RPAL test!"

      "label": "See why this app immediately hit the #1 spot for Paid Educational Apps on the App Store! Filled with valuable program content, it was originally designed to sell for $59.99. Due to the overwhelming response, the authors have kept it at its low introductory price.\n\nAs powerful as it is fun, this uniquely engaging teaching tool is changing lives one letter at a time! Lively Letters – Phonemic Awareness and Phonics simultaneously trains critical skills for reading, spelling, and pronunciation of English language sounds. Unlike most phonics apps, this one is actually teaching, as opposed to just drilling. With proven strategies such as memory tricks, mouth and hand cues, humorous stories (English and Spanish), colorful pictures of characters embedded into letters, and songs, this multisensory, structured approach has been shown to help students of all ages and abilities, including the most resistant learners and those learning English as a second language. Targeting phonemic (sound) awareness, phonics, and speech production, the three unique teaching activities are based on the key techniques of the world-renowned, research-based program, Lively Letters, created by speech language pathologist, Nancy Telian, MS, CCC-SLP, and published by Reading with TLC. Used by over 15 million students and 75 thousand teachers globally since 1990, the Lively Letters program has been shown to quickly boost skills.\n\nThis long-awaited app, created by Penny Castagnozzi and Nancy Telian, can be used successfully on its own or as a supplement to the Lively Letters program materials. It can also be implemented by those with no Lively Letters experience. Although many aspects of this app can be performed independently by students, best gains will be made with some instructor/parent involvement.  Some adults and older students can use it independently. The app includes progress monitoring and three  activities: Flashing, Tracking, and Matching. Choose which letters and what types of letters to use (i.e., Lively Letters pictures versus plain letters and lowercase versus uppercase letters). Record and play back the students’ voices.\n\nFlashing: This activity introduces, drills, and tests the letter sound associations for the 44 English speech sounds, using the multisensory cueing methods that Lively Letters is so famous for. As the chosen letters flash in, students can hear the associated sound, the song, and the story (narrated in English by Marianne Nice, MS, CCC-SLP, or in Spanish by Angela Livingston, MS,CCC-SLP, TSSLD, BE). They can also see photos of the hand and mouth cues can practice printing.\n\nTracking: In this activity, students engage in the powerful Lively Letters manipulative word play, (tracking) activities. Here you simultaneously train phonemic awareness and phonics, while further practicing letter sounds and speech production. Students have fun building the critical phonemic awareness skills of sound blending, segmenting, and manipulation while learning how to sound out words of increasing length and difficulty for reading and spelling. In response to prompts from the instructor or parent, the student reads and spells new words, based on letter or sound changes made by the instructor. Students can enjoy the Lively Letters “Human - Alien” game where they choose whether each word was a real or nonsense word. Some alternate uses of the Tracking Activity include receptive drilling, printing of the letters, spelling to dictation, marking letter patterns, and dividing multisyllable words.\n\nMatching: Here’s a playful way to practice letter sound associations and speech production skills. This activity also offers opportunities to associate uppercase to lowercase letters and to transition from Lively Letters pictures to plain letters. Students have fun playing the classic Match Game, now using the letters and letter types chosen.\n\nLet the fun begin!\n\nLearn more about Lively Letters by visiting www.readingwithtlc.com."

      "label": "NoteWorks is a musical game, designed to teach note recognition and improve sight reading skills. Hungry Munchy is eager to swallow elusive blue notes. Your goal is to help Munchy catch each note as quickly as possible. \n\nThe game combines learning and fun into a single gratifying experience. The app is both educational and entertaining, with an intuitive and visually appealing interface. \n\nNoteWorks was created for: \n• iPhone, iPod touch and iPad users.\n• Players of all ages. \n• Beginners to advanced music students. \n• Families with multiple players. \n• Music teachers with multiple students. \n\nGame design features include: \n• A funny animated character. \n• User-friendly menus. \n• Superb graphics. \n• Engaging sound effects. \n\nNote reading options: \n• On-screen piano keyboard input.\n• On-screen guitar fretboard input.\n• MIDI keyboard input.  \n• \"A, B, C\" note naming:\n. . . CDEFGAB\n. . . CDEFGAH\n. . . ABCDEFG\n. . . AHCDEFG \n• \"Do, Re, Mi\" (Fixed Do) note naming. \n• Treble clef. \n• Bass clef. \n• Tenor clef. \n• Alto clef. \n• Custom note range in all four clefs.\n\nEducational features: \n• Students learn by playing and having fun. \n• Multiple game settings allow players to stay in control. \n• Students can choose to play with hints. \n• Students play without hints to earn points and stars. \n• Players learn to recognize notes instantly, on sight. \n• For beginners, the game starts by teaching a limited range of notes. \n• Note range can be easily customized as students advance. \n• After mastering accidentals, students learn key signatures. \n• Game speed is controlled to increase or decrease difficulty, or students may choose to play without any time limit.\n• Sharing of game progress: ability to share game results with teachers.\n\nWhile music teachers persistently stress the importance of sight reading, most teachers prefer not to spend valuable lesson time on basic note recognition skills. Thus, NoteWorks helps music teachers concentrate on more interesting aspects of their art, such as technique and musicality. \n\nSerious music students can take advantage of the game to learn clefs outside of their own instruments, as well as prepare for music theory exams. In addition, non-musicians could use NoteWorks as an interesting memory game, to help keep their minds sharp and quick. \n\nNoteWorks was created for people who like to learn by playing and having fun. It was designed with the objective of neither being too easy nor too hard, and never boring. We hope you'll find NoteWorks both useful and entertaining, and we would greatly appreciate it if you could share your thoughts and opinions about the game by rating it."

Most people are scared of it, but I want to sneak inside.\n\nThere are so many rumors, I don’t know what to believe\n\nSome kids say the top floor glows at night and that crazy aliens live up there. Some say that strange experiments are going on in the living room. One kid I know absolutely swears they heard weird music coming from the basement. Can a house sing? I’ve also talked to kids who say the entire kitchen is covered in slime. Even my best friend, who never believes anything, told me the house is alive!\n\nI had to see for myself\n\nI did, I swear. I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside. I could really use a partner, though. Seriously, will you come with me?\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nPrivacy is an issue that we take very seriously.

High frequency words or sight words are the building blocks for children learning to read. This application includes 100 of the most common words found in reading materials for kindergarten age children. \n\nLevel 1 and 2 contain 8 high frequency words with 5 activities to introduce and reinforce the words. In levels 3-15 each level includes the words from all previous levels and introduces 5 to 7 new words. All words are pronounced clearly by a native English speaker.\n\nSupport for multiple users is now included.  Users can be added or deleted by selecting 'manage users' in the Settings screen.  Progress is maintained separately for each user.  Students can easily switch to their profile by selecting the 'user' button on the main menu.  For more information on managing users please visit our website.  Up to 24 users can be added.\n\nActivities in each level include:\n\nWord Wheel - A quick introduction to each word then quiz to reinforce word recognition.  Hints that reinforce knowledge because the first exposure might not make it stick.\n\nSpace Spelling - Jumbled letters need rearranged to spell the words. This activity has context-sensitive help so that even beginners will be able to learn spellings.  Correctly spelled words are rewarded with rainbow rockets.\n\nJungle Bingo - Word bingo game includes context sensitive help and animated text to reinforce learning.\n\nOceans of Word Search - Underwater themed word search with context-sensitive help and interactive sea creatures as rewards for found words.\n\nMemory Menagerie -  Animals flip to reveal the words.

We are increasingly dependent on a global ecosystem of digital signals. We use them for so many things, yet we cannot see them. We can see the roads we use to travel, the buildings we live in, but not the infrastructure that is changing the world. How can we understand this world without understanding how it works? \nThe purpose of this app is to make the invisible visible so we can look at it, think about it and discuss it.\n\nWhy Should I not use this app?\n\nThis app is not a measurement tool. It’s purpose is to inspire, to see the world through a different lens. The app is based on real world data and gives you a pretty good idea of the density of digital signals around you, but it won’t tell you where to move the couch to get a better WIFI signal.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is a data visualization, based on global open datasets of cell tower, Wi-Fi and satellite locations. Based on your GPS location the app shows a 360 degree visualization of signals around you. The dataset includes almost 7 million cell towers, 19 million Wi-Fi routers and hundreds of satellites.\n\nIs this really what radio signals look like?\n\nWe can’t see radio with our eyes. The waves that we use for our cell phones and Wi-Fi are way outside the spectrum of visible light. In order to “see” radio, it has to be interpreted or translated into an image that we can see. There are many ways to do that but it will always be an interpretation.\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is an impression of the infosphere, a way of seeing it."

      "label": "The maker of the number 1 smash hit Math BINGO presents Word BINGO!\n\nPractice reading and spelling over 300 Dolch sight words by playing 4 fun games.\n\nWhat are Sight Words?\n\nSight Words are words that are recognized immediately (on sight) without phonetically decoding or sounding out parts.\n\nWhat is the Dolch Word List?\n\nThe Dolch Word List is a list of English sight words by Edward William Dolch, PhD.  The list is comprised of 220 words grouped by level, and includes pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions and verbs.  There are also 95 nouns on a separate list.\n\nSight Word BINGO includes four different games!\n\nWord BINGO \n\nListen to the word the BINGO Bug speaks and tap on the corresponding word on the screen.  Get four words correct vertically, horizontally or diagonally to get BINGO and win!  The quicker you get BINGO the better your score.  Your score is based on time and the lower the score, the better.  Earn a BINGO Bug when you beat your best score.\n\nSpelling Practice\n \nTap and drag the letters to spell the word the BINGO bug speaks.  Spell ten words to play a bonus game!  You can choose to show or hide the spelling of each word in game settings.\n\nWord Fling \n\nYou have one hundred seconds to find as many BINGO Bugs as possible and fling them into the warp zone!  To find the bug, tap the word the BINGO bug speaks.  If you tap the correct word, a BINGO Bug and a bungee cord will appear.  Pull downward and left or right to aim the BINGO Bug toward the warp zone hole.  Let go to fling the BINGO Bug! Bounce the bug off of the wall before going into the warp zone for more points. The game will end once you incorrectly recognize three words.\n\nWord It Up \n\nStop the word blocks from stacking up to the top of the screen!  Tap on the word the BINGO bug speaks to get rid of the block.  Tilt the device to change where the block lands.  Try not to click on the wrong word or you’ll lose points and the block will stay forever.\n\n---------------------\n\nWord BINGO features:\n\nUniversal App - Only $.99 for iPad, iPod & iPhone\n\n4 Games in 1: Word BINGO  |  Spelling Practice  |  Word It Up  |  Fling it\n\n5 player profiles & guest profile\n\nCreate your own character\n\nOver 300 Dolch Sight Words\n\nSelect a word list: Pre-Primer, Primer, First Grade, Second Grade, Third Grade, Nouns or All Words\n\nScore Board: the three best scores are displayed by word list and player displays top three best scores by word list and by player.\n\nEasily track and view what words that you got wrong by using the “My Report” Card feature.\n\nMy Report Card: A powerful feature that displays word accuracy and best scores by player profile.  Word accuracy feature displays the percentage of sight words correctly identified by word list or individual words.  Best score feature will show the top scores in all three games.\n\n-----------------------------\nPRIVACY DISCLOSURE\nWord BINGO:\n\n- Does not contain third-party ads.\n- Does not contain in-app purchases.\n- Does not contain integration with social networks.\n- Does not use analytics/data collection tools.\n- Does include links to apps by ABCya.com in the iTunes App Store.\n\nFor more information on our privacy policy please visit:\n\nhttp://www.abcya.com/mobile_app_privacy_policy.htm\n---------------------------"

      "label": "We designed iTrace over 5 years ago to teach children to write block and cursive letters and numbers.  Our mission back then — and today — remains to make early childhood education productive and relaxed, natural at the same time. \n\nWhile creating the app, we found out that children learn best when they repeat every exercise at least 3 times. In iTrace, a child traces each letter 3 times on every level out of 30 for each letter. Of course, every child learns at a different pace, so an app adjusts the number of levels to meet the needs of their individual student.\n\nThe app is ideal for homeschooling as well as classroom setting at Preschool, Pre-K, Kindergarten, and K1-K2 levels.\n\niTrace Key Features: \n- Uppercase and lowercase letters \n- Cursive and block letters\n- Numbers 0 through 9\n- Words: child's name, 350 preloaded words from the iTrace library and unlimited words that can be added by you\n- Support of 3 different letter fonts: Zaner-Blosser, HWT (Handwriting Without Tears) and D'Nealian (with customized letters for each font!)\n- Full support for both Left and Right handwriting orientation.\n- 5 animated scenes that gather relevant words together to make learning fun with 50 animated objects (iPad only)\n- History of each child's progress\n- Unlimited children accounts \n- Available at a reduced price with Volume Purchase Program for educational institutions\n\n\nWe created iTrace for kids: \n- The app tracks and adjusts to your child's individual progress to keep their interest and to encourage progress\n- To support how children learn writing skills, iTrace will replay exercises several times gradually increasing complexity and difficulty level (just like a game!) \n- The app will reward progress with over 600 varying prizes for every completed exercise\n- iTrace leverages context and animation to teach writing by encouraging children to select animated scenes composed of meaningfully combined objects\n\nWe created iTrace to help parents and teachers: \n- The app tracks your child's progress on each individual letter and number to help them master handwriting and for adults to measure improvement\n- iTrace supports easily switching to the Left-handed mode and to cursive letters. \n- For offline practice, iTrace supports customization and printing of PDF worksheets on the paper.\n\nWe built iTrace to guard children’s privacy: \n- No ads inside the app.  We do not interrupt the learning process with anything unhelpful or irrelevant. \n- No collection of personal data. We do not ask for any contact details except the first name of your student to personalize their experience. \n- Purchases can only be made by adults from a part of the app that children cannot access.\n------------\n\niTrace is appreciated by parents, schools, and media:\n\n\"With an engaging, kid-friendly interface and many options to customize and track children's progress, iTrace is a valuable app for parents, teachers and occupational therapists.\",\nLibby Curran, People Magazine's Teacher of the Year\n\nFeatured in the App Store's \"Education\" category under Best New Apps!\n\n— TUAW: \"The app is brightly illustrated and well designed, certain to appeal to young students. Meant for the core 3-7 age group, kids can learn to trace uppercase and lower-case letters, as well as numbers.\"\n\n\n— Teachers With Apps: \"This app is what every parent/teacher should have their children use to help learn proper letter formation. As a teacher, it helps fit handwriting into the school day so much easier!\"\n\n— 2Wired 2Tired: \"…kids LOVE everything electronic. iTrace will make learning how to write letters, numbers, and words, both fun and interesting for your children.\n\n— Mommy's Busy: \"If you're looking for a fun, interactive way for your child to learn [...] you should consider trying iTrace.\"\n---------------\n\nIf you have any ideas or feedback that you would like to share, please contact us at iTrace@devpocket.com.  We are sincerely interested in knowing more about your experience with iTrace."

Can you tell the difference between excitement and fear, or between aggression and the need to play?\r\n\r\nDog language can be confusing, but with the help of Dog Decoder, you’ll understand your dog’s signals like a pro.\r\n\r\nDog Decoder will teach you everything you need to know about how your dog communicates, so you can not only avoid bites, but share in a more satisfying, healthy, and loving relationship.\r\n\r\n=== MEET “DIAMOND” === \r\n\r\nDiamond is your tour guide and trainer. He will show you how he looks when he’s afraid, when he’s stressed, when he’s just about to bite, and when he wants to play. \r\n\r\n=== DOG POSTURES ===\r\n\r\nThere are about SIXTY different poses on display in Dog Decoder. Each pose is beautifully and expressively illustrated by one of the world’s top dog artists.\r\n\r\nEach pose comes with a diagram, pointing out where on Diamond’s body he’s indicating how he’s feeling. For example, in the poses for “fear,” the diagram will point out Diamond’s tucked tail, his ears pulled back, etc. We won’t just show you a picture of a scared dog — we’ll teach you what to look for, the signs of fear.\r\n\r\nEach pose also comes with a helpful description of the context. This is where you will learn about some common misconceptions, or what kinds of situations will cause your dog to assume each posture.\r\n\r\n=== TEST YOURSELF! ===\r\n\r\nThe best way to see how much you’ve learned is to take the quiz! Some of the quiz questions are pretty challenging. Diamond wants to make sure you don’t get fooled next time he’s hiding under the coffee table or drooling – will you recognize the early warning signs of stress? Will you be able to warn your children when your dog is clearly done playing?"

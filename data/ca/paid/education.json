      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "This math app can be used to teach and study the grid multiplication method. The app is easy to use and it has an intuitive interactive interface with customizable colors and other settings. \n\nThe grid multiplication app is the latest app in the set of 17 math apps that was reviewed by Wired.com: “A Set of Excellent iPhone Math Apps for the Older Child”.\n\nEndorsed by teachers \n\nR. Zeni, Ecole Sandy Hill Elementary, Abbotsford, BC, Canada: \n\"The math apps by Esa Helttula allow students to practice and reinforce the specific computation strategies taught in class, with as much or as little scaffolding as necessary. \n\nThey also provide individualized feedback to each student, with an immediacy that is not always possible through pencil and paper practice. Being able to adjust the level of difficulty to suit their needs is also very motivating for the students. I am so glad to have come across this great educational tool!\" \n\nZ. R. Prowell, Highlands Elementary, Edina, Minnesota, USA: \n\n\"In my class I have used them to assist students with seeing the steps to properly completing multiplication operations such as partial products and partial quotients. There are students who see my examples who still need some guidance, and after using your app have said, \"Now I get it.\" The feature of selecting possible solutions in each step helps some of my students who are still building their multiplication facts. They can gain experience in using these new concepts but not be left behind. \n\nHelping student understanding are the animations. They are smooth and really illustrate a step-by-step understanding of how to complete new styles of multiplication.” \n\nThe Grid Multiplication Method \n\nThe grid multiplication method is a two-step process. In the example 39 x 24 the numbers are first broken up into 30 + 9 and 20 + 4, and written on a grid. Multiplying the row and column headers then solves each cell of the grid. Eventually the partial products 600, 180, 120, and 36 are added together. \n\nThe App is Easy to Use \n\nThe numbers are aligned automatically so that the user can concentrate on solving the operations for each column. \n\nAfter you solve the operation for each partial product the correct answer will fly to the right place. If you press the wrong button the answer will appear above the keyboard but it will not move. \n\nSettings: \n\n- Each number can have from 2 to 3 digits. \n- Random and custom problems.\n- The current operation can be hidden. \n- The operands of the current operation can be highlighted. \n -Colors of the interface can be changed. \n- The speed of the animations can be set. \n\nOther iDevBooks math apps \n\niDevBooks math apps have been reviewed and endorsed by Wired.com, IEAR.org, Edudemic.com, Teachers with Apps, and other respected sites and organizations. \n\nSome of the other 40 iDevBooks math apps are Column Addition, Long Multiplication, Long Division, Column Subtraction, Visual Multiplication Table, Partial Differences Subtraction, Partial Products Multiplication, Partial Sums Addition, Decimal Rounding, etc. \n\nFeedback and requests for new features \n\nNew ideas to make this app better are welcome. Please visit idevbooks.com to give feedback. \n\nPrivacy \n\nThis app has no ads or in-app purchases and it does not transmit any data during the operation of the app. This app also does not contain any links to other apps or the web."

The world of science just got a little bit weirder and a lot more fun with Toca Lab: Plants!\n\nJust like with the first app in the Toca Lab Series, Toca Lab: Elements, your curiosity will lead the way. Choose your plant, then visit five different locations in the lab:\n\n● Grow light: Shine the light on your plant and watch what happens! Does your plant bask and happily sigh in the light, or groan and wriggle away? What happens when you turn the light up a notch or two?\n\n● Watering tank: Put your plant in the tank and fill it up with water. Will your plant float? How does your plant behave when it’s soaking wet?\n\n● Nutrition station: What’s the optimal diet for your plant? Try the three different nutrition formulas and discover which ones your plant character likes!\n\n● Cloning machine: Spin the wheel on the cloning machine and before you know it, you’ll have five little versions of your plant. Wonder what the clones can do? Experiment and find out!\n\n● Crossbreeding apparatus: Here you can mix two plants to create something unexpected. Try it and see what happens!\n\nHave fun experimenting at each station to see how the plants evolve. Keep experimenting until you’ve collected all 35 plant characters in the app. Once you’ve collected a plant, keep experimenting to continue to evolve it! Who says kids can’t be scientists? Toca Lab: Plants brings out the budding botanist in everybody!\n\nFEATURES\n- Start with one plant and experiment your way to 35 different plant characters, each with its own unique personality!\n- Continue to evolve existing plants through experimentation!\n- Evolve plants with five lab tools: grow light, watering tank, nutrition station, cloning machine and the crossbreeding apparatus.\n- Discover plants from five groups: green algae, mosses, ferns, trees and flowering plants.\n- Learn the names and Latin names of real-life plants!\n\n--\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

      "label": "Team Shake provides a technological and environmentally friendly way to choose teams for board games, sporting events, tournaments, school projects or anytime groups are required. The newest release brings many new features including full iPad support, balancing teams based on skill or gender, importing users from a file, enabling video output, and sharing teams via facebook or email. \n\nTeam Shake is the premier iOS App for creating teams. Instead of a hat and scraps of paper, the user enters his friends' names in his iPhone and gives it a shake. The screen will then display a random set of color-coded teams. These teams can immediately be used for game play or shared via facebook or email.   The quick and easy selection of random (or balanced) teams eliminates fighting over who will be on which team. Innovative use of the iPhone shake gesture gives users the satisfying feeling of shaking a virtual hat without the trouble of carrying around an actual hat. Conventional buttons can also be used for those who would rather not shake their expensive hardware about.  \n\nThe app is designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind. Names can easily be entered with the onscreen keyboard, chosen from the user's contacts, or imported from a file. The email and facebook functions document the members of each individual team as well as preserving the team number and color assigned by the app. For repeated use of Team Shake, lists of friends can be easily saved and loaded later. The current list is also automatically saved so that if you exit the app, or even reboot the device, changes will not be lost. For teachers and others with large lists of people, Team Shake supports the ability to import teams from text or csv files.\n\nIf you have any problems, feature requests, or comments please send an email to support@rhine-o.com. \n\nFeatures:\n\n* Create 1 to 64 random teams\n* Create completely random or balanced teams\n* Full iPad support\n* Eliminates fighting over choosing teams\n* Share / Save teams via email or Facebook\n* Teams can be chosen by the number of teams or by the size of teams.\n* Save lists of friends for later games\n* Import lists from email or spreadsheet\n* Export lists and options for use on another device\n* Satisfying feeling of shaking a “virtual” hat to create teams\n* Animated shaking hat\n* Entry of names via onscreen keyboard\n* Entry of names via iPhone contacts\n* Temporarily disable people who are absent\n* Set groups of people to always be on the same team\n* Set groups of people to always be on different teams\n* Set user strength to make more even teams (now supports fully balanced teams)\n* 5 users strengths level\n* Pick a single random person from the list of players\n* User strength indicator on the main screen (can be disabled in options)\n* Number of active players and total players is now displayed on the main screen\n* Video Out Support\n* Option to Sort Teams by Name\n* Option to balance male / female team members\n* \"Equal Ability\" option to create teams where all players have the same strength\n* Option to create separate male and female teams\n* Configurable Team Colors\n* Configurable Team Names\n* Print Support\n* Export Teams in CSV or XLS Format\n* Team Shake now supports simultaneously assigning players to multiple subteams and / or oppose teams at the same time.\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now have customized names to make selection easier\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now be enabled or disabled globally so that teams can be made quickly without subteams / oppose teams.  In particular, Balance Teams Strengths will work when separate Male / Female teams are created.\n\nYappler-Tags: Teams, Groups, Random, Hat, Entertainment, Games, Utilities"

(Please set your iPhone to Ring mode to hear the audio playback.)\n・Fun illustrations help users to better retain the words studied. \n・Users can bookmark the words they like. The bookmarked words are compiled in the Bookmark list in \"List.\"\n\n◇ “Check” helps learners to track their mastery.\n・Users check their understanding of the vocabulary studied and sort the words into those mastered and those not yet retained.\n・The words already mastered are taken out of the study set, leaving behind just those that still need to be worked on.\n\n◇ “List” displays a list of all words covered by the app so that users can see their progress and review the vocabulary.\n・The list can be arranged in any of three orderings: lesson order, a-i-u-e-o order, and alphabetical order. The words bookmarked in the Study mode are also listed in the Bookmark list.\n・Checkmarks are automatically placed next to words that have been mastered.\n・The Study view of words can be displayed from the list entries, enabling quick review.\n\n\n○This app is based on the vocabulary from the third edition of GENKI.\n○Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

      "label": "Virtual MotivAider® is designed to help users of all ages make desired changes in their own behavior and habits. ​\n\nThis app is intended to replicate much of the functionality of the MotivAider®, an ingeniously simple dedicated electronic device invented by a clinical psychologist. Since 1987, the MotivAider® device has helped thousands of people in over 50 countries make a wide range of desired behavioral changes. \n\nLike the MotivAider® device, Virtual MotivAider® corrects for a largely overlooked glitch in the design of the human mind -- the lack of a dependable mechanism for keeping good intentions \"on the front burner\" of your mind. By repeatedly sending you signals or prompts that remind and urge you to act in accord with any chosen behavioral objective or goal, the app prevents your good intentions from getting lost in the shuffle.  \n\nTo use the app, you first devise a brief personal message – a word, phrase or image -- that serves as a trigger to remind and urge you to take a specific action required to achieve your goal. Next, you simply associate your personal message with the app’s signals or prompts, so that whenever you receive the prompt, you'll automatically think your personal message and be reminded and urged to take the \ndesired action. Then, you set the app to send you prompts – and therefore your personal message – as often as it takes to get the best possible results. \n\nBy design, Virtual MotivAider® is simple and straightforward. It has no bells and whistles to distract you from its singular purpose, which is to keep your attention focused on making whatever change in behavior you decide to make.\n\nVirtual MotivAider® lets you: \n• Choose the type(s) of prompts you’d like to receive – from a simple vibration signal (if your device is capable of vibration) and/or a sound (you can even record your personal message in your own voice) and/or a text notification with your personal message. \n• Get prompts as often as you want – from as often as once every few seconds to as seldom as once a day. \n• Choose whether to get prompts at Regular intervals (for example, once every 5 minutes), at Average intervals (for example, from 15 minutes to one hour apart with an Average of 30 minutes apart), or even at Random intervals (for example, at random intervals that are no less than 10 seconds apart and no more than 10 minutes apart).   \n• Choose how long to have prompting continue before stopping automatically. \n• Pause and resume prompting whenever you want. \n• Create and save multiple behavior change projects. (To achieve the best results, however, we recommend that you work on only one project at a time). \n• Access the same free habit change resources that help users of the dedicated MotivAider® device achieve great results."

      "label": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training. It is yet another beautifully designed and easy-to-use app for kids“ by lilmagoolie.com"

This app is perfect for anyone wanting to have a little extra fun while role playing with their Reborn Baby dolls. While Babysitme is running a schedule, it tells the user to Feed, Burp, Rock and all other necessary actions when really taking care of an infant. These actions are designed to be acted out in role play with the user’s Reborn Baby Doll.\n\nWhen using the app you will be able to choose between Easy, Medium, Hard or Play mode simulations. The Easy, Medium & Hard simulations run on a 24-hour schedule. The Play mode is designed for people that are just wanting a fast-paced version of the app. It is a shortened version of the simulation modes where the care events are very close together and don’t last very long. \nRoutine is categorized in age groups designed to allow you to follow along with your babies routine, There are new care events and even tells you when baby is asleep or awake! \n\n- Name your baby. \n- Realistic 24-hour care schedule, Just like a real baby!\n- Easy for all ages to use (Recommended ages 7+). \n- Bond with your Reborn baby through your baby needing your care and attention.\n- Play schedules for younger children with a shorter attention span. \n- You wont know when your baby will cry for the next care event, making it as realistic as a real baby. \n- Unpredictable care events meaning it isn’t the same old boring Routine every day.\n\n\nThe idea of the app is you place your device next to your Baby Doll and wait for the app to send through a notification sound (cries).  You will need to check the device for what the baby would like, then give the baby doll the correct care\nFor example:\n- Feed baby \n- Burp baby \n- Nappy change \n- Rock baby\n- cuddle baby\n    (Etc…)\n\nWhen the babies care is finished the App will sound again letting you know the care event is finished. Place the device back next to baby and wait for the device to make another sound for the next care event.\nWhen you are finished you simply turn the app off.\n\nThis app has been designed for fun, as a form of entertainment."

      "label": "Welcome to Expedition White Shark, the world’s first app designed to track adult white sharks in real time! To make this possible, scientists at the Marine Conservation Science Institute (MCSI) attached custom satellite tags to the dorsal fin of adult Great White Sharks, allowing us to follow their movements from Satellites orbiting the earth. Expedition White Shark allows you to receive near real time Great White Shark tracking data at the same time as the research scientists. Positions for the tagged sharks can only be calculated when a shark is at the surface with its dorsal fin out of the water for several minutes; since sharks are not always finning we receive intermittent position data from our sharks, but each signal beamed to us form space adds to our growing knowledge of the life history of this species. Since you are getting our data in near real time you will notice that the satellites sometimes make mistakes, placing the shark far from its actual location; we correct these errors later, when we analyze the data. The MCSI satellite tagging of Great White Sharks has led to many important new findings regarding white shark biology, and each new day brings promise of a new discovery that you can make with us!\n\nUse the shark filter to select a specific shark or see the last position for all sharks of a specific species, or select current to see shark positions within the last 30 days. If current is selected the last position for a shark that appears on the map as a dorsal fin , while sharks with historical location data on today’s date in previous years are marked with dot. This allows users to look for patterns of where sharks may be found during that time of year.\n\nKeep up with the latest research insights posted by Dr. Michael Domeier and Nicole Nasby-Lucas, by following us on Facebook www.facebook.com/MarineCSI and Instagram @marinecsiorg."

Отображается в правом верхнем углу. Означает количество баллов по текущему слову.\n• Процент изученности. Означает процент изученности слов в словаре.\n\nКАК НАЧИСЛЯЮТСЯ БАЛЛЫ\n\nЗа правильный ответ начисляется 1 балл, за неправильный - снимается 2 балла, при просмотре карточки балл не засчитывается.\n\nПервые три балла начисляются при изучении слова, их можно набрать сразу. После этого слово переходит на повтор и баллы по нему не начисляются пока не настанет время повтора.\n\nЧетвертый балл дается при повторе через 1 день.\nПятый балл дается при повторе  ещё через 3 дня.\n\nИтого, слово может стать выученным на пятый день, если вы набрали 5 баллов.\n\nКАК ЭТО РАБОТАЕТ.\n\nПрограмма предлагает вам на русском языке слово и предложение с этим словом. Вам необходимо ответить, как данное слово в текущем контексте должно быть переведено на английский язык.\n\nЕсли вы ответили правильно, программа похвалит вас. Если вдруг ошиблись - подскажет правильный ответ и покажет карточку слова.\nВ любом случае вам будет показан английский вариант предложения.\n\nРазные формы слов учатся и учитываются в статистике независимо. Например, по словам I и me, see и saw подсчёт ведётся отдельно.\n\nКарточку слова можно посмотреть выбрав соответствующий пункт меню.\nПроцесс изучения слов начинается с того, что программа набирает из своего словаря 15 слов и начинает их показывать в случайном порядке.\n\nПосле того, как слово переходит в группу \"повторяемые\" из словаря извлекается следующее слово.\n\nПовтор производится через 1, 2 дня. Время, когда будет показан повтор всегда исчисляется от времени предыдущего ответа.\n\nЕсли вы отвечаете правильно на все повторы, то слово переходит в группу \"выученные\" и больше не будет предлагаться.\nЕсли вы посмотрели карточку, то баллы не начисляются.\n\nСЛОВАРЬ\nНа текущий момент словарь программы содержит около 1500 наиболее употребляемых английских слов, а также слов используемых в программе \"Полиглот\".\nНеправильные глаголы представлены в первой и второй формах. Подсчет баллов по каждой форме идет независимо. Слова в словаре расположены в порядке изучения.\n\nОЗВУЧКА\nДоступно произношение английского предложения."

Elemental interactions in the game serve as a foundation to enhance player understanding of the physical world.\n\nSome of the many reinforced concepts include:\n- Functions\n     . Relationships between elements\n     . Inputs and outputs for elementary reactions\n     . Input/output machines\n- Chemistry experiments\n     . States of matter: steam, water, ice\n     . Water pollution: acid + water\n- Elemental reactions: climate change, pollution\n- Automated factories and clever contraptions with conveyor belts, lasers with many effects, pipes to move liquids, and led indicators.\n- Art projects\n     . Pixel Art using 11 types of colored gems\n     . Music using 5 different instruments: Piano, Guitar, Drums, Trumpet, Bass\n     . Amazing light shows: with leds, metal and electrons, bright and bulbs, sensors that pulsate, and gamewall that changes colors.\n- Functional electronics projects with wireworld compliant rules (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireworld)\n     . Gates: and, or, xor, not, and more\n     . More complex circuits: diodes, counters and memory\n- Probability/Random machines\n- Batteries — and battery chargers\n- Oil Lamps & Refineries\n- Operational Ecosystems: predator/prey relationships, habitats\n- Natural Phenomena: the water cycle, the weather system, erosion\n- Natural Disasters: volcanoes, earthquakes, tornados, tsunamis\n- Heat exchange: heating and cooling elements\n\n\n-= CRAFT, LEARN, PLAY AND SHARE! =-\nThe open-ended nature of the game is reflected in the title. By enabling almost anyone to casually play and experiment with often advanced Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM) concepts, it is a learning simulator as much as it is a world-building game, rewarding critical thinking, problem-solving, and risk-taking self-direction on the part of the player.\n\nThe Sandbox EDU is a game that allows your kid to directly interact with STEAM concepts by solving problems, responding to scenarios, constructing or deconstructing environments, creating art, designing machines, tinkering with the elements, creating condensation & evaporation, and anything else you can image a digital sandbox of elements and tools would you let you do.\n\n\n-- PRIVACY POLICY --\nPrivacy is an issue that we take very seriously. This is why we are making sure The Sandbox EDU is COPPA compliant to protect the privacy of you and your children.\n\n-- FOLLOW US -- \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/thesandboxgame \nFacebook: http://facebook.com/thesandboxgame"

      "label": "Objective of the app\nThe main objective of the app is to motivate individuals to cherish a tender devotion towards Jesus Christ in His Passion. The app will help to engage individuals to ponder/reflect on each aspect of the Passion, no matter where they are or what they are doing, to pause and cast a glance at our Lord and permit this awesome, life-changing reality to illumine, to set free, to save & bear fruit. This app allows time & eternity to intersect resulting in the transforming power of Christ Crucified to flow into our daily lives.\n\n\nFeatures of the app\nBelievers are able to move from one Passion step to the next by selecting the default 24 hour mode, or by selecting one of the custom modes (8 hour, 1hour or 30mins) or manually by swiping forward/backward.\n\nUsers can also jump to a particular Passion step by touching the screen and using the slider.\n\nToggle on the image to resize.\nListen to the content (Passion 24/7 and Passion Meditations) that is now available in natural voice.\nSelect the font size or scroll speed within 'Settings'.\n\nUsers can also set a daily reminder time for each of the following:\nWay of the Cross, Daily Prayer to Jesus Crucified, Passion Prayers and Passion Meditations.\n\nAbout the app\nThe events are put in sequence as found in Scripture and Sacred Tradition. The content is primarily taken from the collective writings of Saint Alphonsus de Ligouri (except Way of the Cross-Through Mary's Eyes). While it is very appropriate to practice this devotion during Lent, the Saints urge us to make this a daily & life-long devotion.\n\nThis passion timeline enfolds over a 24 hour period and is adapted to make it available to believers worldwide on a 24/7 basis, as a means of honoring and accompanying Jesus the last twenty-four hours of His life on earth. The passion of Jesus beckons them throughout the day at frequent intervals to cast a glance, to acknowledge Him, to draw grace & strength.\n\nEach meditation presents the user (based on user’s local time) with the respective passion image. Each image has a corresponding reflection, response and suggested prayer intentions. While the user is encouraged to pray for their own personal intentions, some common intentions are recommended as a sign of our unity, for the body of Christ worldwide.\n\nThe 24 hour schedule is the default passion mode. For user’s convenience & flexibility, the passion timeline is also made available in 3 other modes i.e., 8 hours, 1 hour and 30 minutes. For these 3 modes, the user may choose to customize the start time based on their availability. Once the customized mode has completed a cycle, the app will default back to the 24 hour mode.\n\nFor example, if a user has 30 minutes and they’d like to utilize that time to prayerfully reflect on our Lord’s passion, they can set the mode to 30 minutes & select the start time. The entire passion would then complete in approximately 30 minutes.\n\nIncluded in the passion are the Stations of the Cross as well as several favourite Passion prayers, Lenten/Easter Festival Reflections, Daily Prayer to Jesus crucified and Daily Passion Meditations."

      "label": "TouchChat HD is a full-featured communication solution for individuals who have difficulty using their natural voice. TouchChat is designed for individuals with Autism, Down Syndrome, ALS, apraxia, stroke, or other conditions that affect a person's ability to use natural speech.\n\nTouchChat provides both English and Spanish options in one universal app supporting iPhone®, iPod touch® and iPad®. Additional languages such as Canadian French, Hebrew and Arabic can be purchased in the Upgrade Store.\n\nTouchChat fits into the category of assistive technology known as Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) and includes features that were previously only available in much more expensive dedicated devices. Words, phrases and messages are spoken with a built-in voice synthesizer or by playing a recorded message. Various synthesized and custom voice options are available, allowing the user to choose a voice that fits their own personality. \nTouchChat also has a unique feature whereby one can simply tilt the device to make the message expand to fill the screen in large letters. This feature allows a person to communicate silently or in a noisy environment. \nTouchChat gives an individual the ability to navigate through page sets and speak messages. Page sets are linked pages, each of which is divided into a number of buttons. The buttons are programmed to have specific actions, such as speaking a message, navigating to a different page, changing the volume or clearing the display. \nVarious page sets are included with TouchChat: VocabPC, MultiChat15, Spelling, and Communication Journey: Aphasia are available in both English and Spanish options, myQuickChat©, MyCore, and 4 Basic are available in English, while Sintaxis and Sin Sintaxis files are available in Spanish. Each page set targets individuals with different communication needs.. Additional page sets, including WordPower™, Gateway© and Pixon™60 are available as in-app purchases.\n\nText generated with TouchChat pages can be shared on social media or via iMessage® and email using a wireless connection. Generate a message, push on the text window and choose a service.  Additionally, text can be copied to/from TouchChat and other applications so it can be spoken out loud.\n\nThe pages, grid layout, buttons, messages, and symbols are fully customizable. Buttons can be copied and pasted into a different location or rearranged by simply dragging them to the desired new location. The styling of a button (colors, borders, fonts) can also be copied and pasted into another button.\n\nProvided page sets can be modified to create new custom page sets. Select from over 45 button actions and nearly 40,000 Symbolstix® symbols* when creating new buttons. You can also choose to use an existing image or take a photo with the built-in camera. Additionally, gestures can be used to navigate to new pages, speak messages, etc.\n*Please note: PCS© symbols can only be used in TouchChat after an in-app purchase is completed.\n\nButton activation timing can be adjusted to meet the needs and capabilities of the user. Adjustments include button dwell time and button release time. Buttons can also be configured to activate on release.\n\nUsers can program buttons to play audio files such as music from the media library or videos from the device or a YouTube™ link.\n\nOnce programming is complete, be sure to protect custom files. Vocabulary files can be imported and exported to a computer through iTunes® file sharing, DropBox™ or Google Drive™.  TouchChat also enables users to subscribe to iShare and store custom files for safe keeping (not available to customers residing in the European Union).\n\niPhone, iPod touch and iPad are trademarks of Apple Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries."

Stop wasting your time googling trying to find that elusive \"free\" CDL prep - the sites that claim to offer this are mostly in the business of showing you ads, thus trying to get you to visit their sites and spend a lot of time frustratedly clicking without accomplishing much useful studying. Our CDLPass software, on the other hand, just works. It's inexpensive because it's popular (cheaper even than books!), has a ton of study and learning modes, and is actually designed to get you on the road quickly.\n\nCDLPass is the ONLY app that features UP TO DATE, TRULY REPRESENTATIVE questions.  Our team of editors are actual CDL School instructors and examiners.   Our questions feature detailed, often illustrated explanations to really HELP YOU LEARN and be ready for regional and state question variations that you may encounter.   Don't be fooled by lesser apps based on out of date question sets.   CDLPass features FREE lifetime updates so you can get new questions as our editors add them to our databases based on state and USDOT changes.\n\n\"I purchased your CDL study app just over a week ago, then studied hard over several days. I just wanted you know that I passed the three tests I needed for the class B (bus driver) with flying colors today. Could have not done it without your help and exacting question simulations. All but three of the questions presented actually appeared on your simulations- you guys ROCK! Thank you folks so much for your help- keep up the good work!\" - CT, Trinity, FL\n\n\"I recieved a General Knowledge score of 97 on my actual test. I believe the score was the result of the Dauntless study software. The CDLPass app mirrored the actual test questions, and the format is easy to use and helped me to retain what I learned. The software is a great value and I would tell anyone thinking about getting a CDL to get this app.\" – GP, Manasha, WI\n\n\"I would like to say thanks CDLPASS because your app helped me to pass the written test. I'll certainly be referring friends to you. because your program really does work!\" – TB, Poughkeepsie, NY\n\nThis app will prepare you for ANY or ALL of the following tests: \n\n* General Knowledge\n* Air Brakes\n* Combination Vehicles\n* Doubles and Triples\n* Hazardous Materials\n* Tank Vehicles\n* Transporting Passengers \n\nThis app has helped many people get on the road and into that job quickly and easily.  The app features MULTIPLE STUDY AND LEARNING MODES and works in native size for both phone and tablet type devices.\n\nGood luck and happy studying! \n\nThe CDLPass Team"

Ce jeu aide l’enfant à apprendre les sons des lettres et des groupes de lettres en présentant simultanément les sons (ou mots) correspondant et les groupes de lettres.\n\nLa progression du jeu est basée sur des données scientifiques : le logiciel été développé par des linguistes, des neuropsychologues et des orthophonistes pour aider les enfants - en particulier les lecteurs en difficulté - à renforcer les automatismes fondamentaux de la lecture.\n\n« GraphoGame – Français » accompagne l’enfant à travers différents jeux avec son propre personnage qu’il fait évoluer au cours du jeu. Le joueur passe progressivement aux syllabes, aux rimes, aux mots courts et aux phrases et apprend peu à peu à décoder des mots plus longs. En jouant 15 minutes quotidiennement, l'enfant améliorera sa précision dans le décodage des lettres, des mots, et sa vitesse de lecture. \n\nLa plateforme GraphoGame est développée par une communauté de chercheurs et de développeurs de jeux leader en Finlande, tandis que le contenu francophone de « GraphoGame Français » a été développé par le Laboratoire de Psychologie Cognitive (CNRS) de l'Université d'Aix-Marseille.\n\nPour plus d’informations sur le contenu francophone, n’hésitez pas à vous rendre sur le site http://grapholearn.fr."

      "label": "From the multi award-winning animators and producers of BAFTA nominated pre-school learning favourites Alphablocks and Numberblocks, we bring you Numberblocks Hide and Seek.\n\nAs seen on Cbeebies.\n\nThis app helps your child get to grips with addition, number bonds and other key number skills. Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Ce jeu aide l’enfant à apprendre les sons des lettres et des groupes de lettres en présentant simultanément les sons (ou mots) correspondant et les groupes de lettres.\n\nLa progression du jeu est basée sur des données scientifiques : le logiciel été développé par des linguistes, des neuropsychologues et des orthophonistes pour aider les enfants - en particulier les lecteurs en difficulté - à renforcer les automatismes fondamentaux de la lecture.\n\n« GraphoGame – Français » accompagne l’enfant à travers différents jeux avec son propre personnage qu’il fait évoluer au cours du jeu. Le joueur passe progressivement aux syllabes, aux rimes, aux mots courts et aux phrases et apprend peu à peu à décoder des mots plus longs. En jouant 15 minutes quotidiennement, l'enfant améliorera sa précision dans le décodage des lettres, des mots, et sa vitesse de lecture. \n\nLa plateforme GraphoGame est développée par une communauté de chercheurs et de développeurs de jeux leader en Finlande, tandis que le contenu francophone de « GraphoGame Français » a été développé par le Laboratoire de Psychologie Cognitive (CNRS) de l'Université d'Aix-Marseille.\n\nPour plus d’informations sur le contenu francophone, n’hésitez pas à vous rendre sur le site http://grapholearn.fr."

Gain an understanding of what the \"vortex of creation\" means and how you can use meditation to enter the vortex in order to allow the Law of Attraction to work for you. Also gain valuable insights about what happens to your affirmations and manifestation efforts when you are out of the vortex.  Five guided meditation audio sessions with music are included in this app.  \n\nListeners will be led by Abraham through four guided meditation sessions on these topics: General Well-Being, Financial Abundance, Physical Well-Being and Relationships.   Each guided meditation experience is 15 minutes long.   \n\nThis Vortex of Attraction Guided Meditation iPhone App is an exact duplicate of the physical product and includes the complete written text, and the complete audio recording along with an extra bonus track of guided meditation music which was not included with the original product.\n\nMany people exert manifestation and Law of Attraction efforts outside of the Vortex, and then conclude that the Law of Attraction \"doesn't work.\" Find out how to stop efforting and start allowing the Vortex of Creation to align you with the life you desire.  These are the first guided meditation recordings ever produced containing the Teachings of Abraham."

      "label": "Flashnote Derby is a fun way for kids to learn and practice reading music notes. \n\nEach race is a timed test in which the student identifies different notes in order to urge their horse on towards the finish line. Answering quickly and correctly will cause their horse to gain ground, while incorrect answers will cause it to fall behind. At the end of each race, students can review the notes they missed and see the correct answers. \n\nPlayers can respond to flashcards by simply playing the note on their acoustic or MIDI instrument. They can also choose to answer by tapping letter buttons or playing a key on an on-screen piano.\n\nThe game is fully customizable to allow for any desired notes in the treble, bass, alto, or tenor clefs to be included. You can select ranges of notes, or several individual notes to focus on specific areas that need work. Notes can be shown with sharps and flats and key signatures can even be added to increase the challenge for more advanced students. The amount of time the player is given for each flashcard can be increased or decreased depending upon their age and level of experience.\n\nDrills can start out simply, with only a handful of notes, and gradually be made more challenging until the full staff is mastered (up to five and a half ledger lines above or below the staff.) The more difficult the settings, the more points are awarded. The 'high score' is tracked so that players always have a goal to shoot for.\n\nAs a bonus, over a dozen instructional video lessons are easily accessible from right inside the app! Even children with no prior music instruction can start using Flashnote Derby right away to begin learning about the music alphabet, the staff, and how to identify different notes.\n\nBecause it can be set up so quickly, Flashnote Derby provides a perfect motivational tool for music teachers to use with students, even for just a minute or two of each lesson. Teachers have the ability to email homework assignments to their students for them to play on their own devices at home. Each player's performance is recorded so that their progress can be tracked.

It seems to work.” 148apps.com \n\nPocketPhonics teaches kids letter sounds, first words and handwriting. It is used in hundreds of elementary schools and pre-schools, and tens of thousands of homes. It is aligned with the Common Core State Standards, and independent research (see appsinmypocket.com/research) found children learnt nine times faster using PocketPhonics compared to a classroom lesson.  \n\n\"One of my children’s favorite early reading apps\" New York Times\n“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com\n-“If you are working on phonics for your kids, this is the best application to have.” Technology in Education \n-“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com \n-“PocketPhonics is seriously educational and I think it’s a terrific tool for helping early readers. You can tell that a ton of thought and research was put into it and best of all, they talked and listened to teachers. It shows.” iPhoneMom.com \n-“When it comes to learning apps for young learners and early readers, there is no better choice than PocketPhonics.\" ipad-applications.neiia.com\n\nPocketPhonics is split in to 12 groups of letter sounds, each group is followed by a set of storybooks that use those letter sounds. Kids read storybooks that are on the right level for them. \n\nThe phonics levels are included in the price of this \"basic edition\", but the storybooks cost extra. PocketPhonics Stories (full edition) includes the stories in the price.\n\nPhonics (letter sounds) help children to read by understanding the sounds that letters make. The  National Reading Panel concluded that “children who have phonics instruction read better and spell better than other children”.\n\nIn the first group of letter sounds, there are six sounds to master before the child will be able to read their first storybook. Most children aged 4+  start to read their first storybook within 10 weeks if they use the app for 15 mins everyday. \n\nParents and teachers can easily monitor children’s progress online. Teachers and parents are emailed a certificate when a child completes a task.\n\nChildren can tap an unfamiliar word in a story, and the app will sound out the letters to help the child understand what the word says. They can tap again to hear the actual word and see a picture that illustrates its meaning. \n\nAs the child reads a story, the app tests whether they can read some of the key words.  At the end of the story, it quizzes the child on all new words in that story.\n\nChildren master the following skills:\n\nwriting letters\nrecognising 72 letter sounds (e.g. ‘ch’ are the letters that make the initial sound in ‘chat’)\n* blending letter sounds together to make words (e.g ‘ch-a-t’)\n* hearing a word and selecting its written form (e.g. the app says, “chat”, the child has to select ‘chat’ from a group of words)\n\nHow it works\n* The phonics levels are included in the price.\n* The books are extra, but can be tried for free.  $1.49 monthly and $14.49 annual subscriptions unlock access to all books for an unlimited number of children \n* The subscription gives you access to more books as they are added\n* Once subscribed, your subscription auto-renews each month or annually. However, you can easily turn auto renew off via the Settings app\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase\n* Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n* Cannot cancel current subscription during its subscription period\n\nPrivacy policy:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/privacy\n\nTerms of use:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/terms"

      "label": "Hit the Button Math is an app designed to help develop mental math and calculation skills.\n\nThe app is aimed at 5-11 year olds. There are 166 different game modes of varying difficulty so it is useful throughout grades K-5. Answer as many questions as possible in minute-long games, or you can now practice without the pressure of a countdown timer - a feature which is new for 2019. Questions are randomly generated which means it is very replayable. The game has been carefully designed for children, with large, widely spaced buttons. We recommend that young children play on a tablet.\n\nSix main topics are covered: \n\n* Times tables - up to 10 or 12 \n* Division - up to 10 or 12\n* Square numbers\n* Number bonds\n* Doubling \n* Halving\n\nBetween these topics, the four standard arithmetic operations are covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nYou can create up to 30 player profiles per device to track an individual's high scores (increased from 15 in 2019). If you prefer there's also the option to play as a guest. All data is stored locally on your device so you don't have to worry about privacy issues. We've also made it very easy for children to quickly switch between profiles after playing a game, if they're sharing a device.\n\nAfter each game, the score achieved is displayed along with the child's high score. Bronze, silver or gold stars and trophies are awarded depending on the score achieved in each game."

      "label": "Bloups permet d’apprendre à lire dans le plaisir… Application entièrement conçue par une orthopédagogue. \n\nDescription du contenu pédagogique de Bloups : (choix de l’accent: français, québécois ou belge) \n\n1) Lecture de syllabes : niveaux de difficulté progressifs \n- syllabes simples (ex. : la, ma, ar, etc.) \n- syllabes comportant des sons simples (ex. : lou, lin, leu, etc.) \n- syllabes comportant des sons complexes (ex. : rouille, rein, gue, etc.) \n- syllabes comportant des confusions visuelles (ex. : bo, do, po) et des confusions auditives (ex. :di, ti) \n\n2) Lecture de mots : \n- mots simples (ex. : rire, tomate, etc.) \n- mots complexes (ex. : combien, explication, etc.) \n- mots irréguliers (ex. : femme, monsieur, etc.) \n\n3) Chronomètre (optionnel) : \n- permet au joueur (qui le souhaite) de toujours améliorer son propre temps en lecture \n\n4) Repère visuel structurant (fiole d’énergie) : \n- indique au joueur le nombre d’items réussis et le nombre d’items restants \n\nParents et pédagogues s’intéressent à cette application éducative, car elle s’adresse aux lecteurs débutants et intermédiaires. Elle est aussi recommandée aux jeunes ayant des difficultés ou des troubles en lecture (ex.: dyslexie d’assemblage, autisme, etc.). \n\nÉtant réalisée par une orthopédagogue, la progression de chaque niveau respecte les étapes d’apprentissage de la lecture syllabique. De ce fait, Bloups représente un défi juste, raisonnable et motivant qui tient compte de la progression propre à chaque enfant. Le focus est porté essentiellement sur la lecture de syllabes; condition essentielle à une bonne rapidité et une bonne justesse en lecture de mots et de phrases. En effet, la lecture de pseudo-mots (ex.: remu, lumiron, bratoir, etc.) oblige l’élève à lire, à décoder correctement chaque syllabe, il ne peut donc pas “deviner” le mot par une lecture globale. Pour être un bon lecteur, il faut, entre autres, maîtriser les deux voix de lecture, c’est-à-dire, la lecture syllabique et la lecture globale. Bloups représente donc une application pour apprendre à lire efficacement. \n\n\nLe contenu pédagogique de cette application favorise essentiellement l’augmentation de la vitesse de lecture, la précision du décodage, l’apprentissage de la fusion phonémique et l’apprentissage de la segmentation de différentes structures syllabiques. Il contribue aussi à l’automatisation de la lecture de sons composés (ex. : ou, on, in, en, an) et de sons complexes (ex. : g, c, aille, ouille, etc). Enfin, la lecture de mots simples, complexes et irréguliers incluse dans Bloups permet au joueur de faire le pont entre la lecture de syllabes et la lecture de mots réels. \n\nBut du jeu : \nLe joueur doit écouter la syllabe, la structure syllabique ou le mot donné oralement pour ensuite repérer la bonne réponse parmi les bulles proposées par les monstres. Après 5 succès, le joueur obtient une page de jeu de 5 secondes et après 20 succès (fiole toute remplie), le joueur est mené vers la découverte d’un nouveau monstre où la complexité de la lecture de syllabes est légèrement plus complexe. Pour l’apprenant, le but est d’amasser le plus de monstres possible et d’améliorer son propre temps s’il reprend un monstre ! Apprendre à bien lire devient alors monstrueusement amusant ! \n\nVariante : \nIl est possible pour l’adulte de déverrouiller préalablement tous les monstres d’une même ligne afin de proposer seulement un monstre précis à l’enfant en fonction de ses besoins particuliers. Par exemple, l’adulte aura déverrouillé les monstres 31 et 32 pour que l’enfant n’ait qu’à faire le monstre 33 travaillant les confusions spatiales et visuelles b, d, p, q."

      "label": "*Rated 1 of the 15 best psychology apps by CareersInPsychology.org!*\n\nPass the EPPP with confidence! With these flash cards, containing information similar to that found in other much more expensive study materials, you will be well on your way to joining the others who have passed the EPPP the very first time using our app! \n\nOffering the most comprehensive mobile psychology study materials on the app store since 2010, StudyPsych’s EPPP Flash Cards consist of over 2,500 flash cards delineated by all of the content areas covered on the EPPP:\n\n01. Ethics and Professional Issues\n02. Diagnosis & Psychopathology (Abnormal)\n03. Clinical Psychology\n04. Learning Theory and Behaviorism\n05. Industrial/Organizational Psychology\n06. Lifespan Developmental Psychology\n07. Neuropsychology & Psychopharmacology \n08. Research Design and Statistics\n09. Test Construction and Interpretation\n10. Social Psychology\n11. Intellectual Assessment\n12. Community Psychology\nPlus 1,000 Practice Test Questions\n\nThe StudyPsych flash cards were designed by a licensed psychologist who has helped many pass the EPPP, comprehensive exams, and other psychology tests the first time. Users of these flash cards are provided with multiple study options, including:\n\n- The ability to receive more information pertaining to a topic on a specific flash card by linking to the web from directly within the app. This is easily one of the most helpful aspects of our study system.\n\n- Two smart study modes that automatically focus more on the cards you miss: “Leitner (Short-term Goal)” and a more advanced “Spaced Repetition” mode\n\n- Built in searchable \"dictionary\" of your cards that allows you to easily look up terminology while you are studying\n\n- 3 response levels: I Don’t Know, I Know, I Know Well (compared to the standard “right/wrong”)\n\n- FREE access to single-sided and double-sided printable PDF files of all of the flash cards, for those who would prefer that study modality\n\n- Easy navigation – swipe or tap to answer (customizable)\n\n- Incredible support! I make it a point to respond to all questions and feedback as soon as possible, whether it is about the flash cards, examinations, or psychology in general. Email me anytime for support.\n\nThis app does not require a network connection, so you can study whenever you want from wherever you are at!\n\nContact Info: StudyPsychEPPP@gmail.com\n\n\n**FAQ**\n\nQUESTION 1: If I purchase the app on my iPhone, can I use it on other iOS devices? \nANSWER 1: YES! Purchase the app a single time and use it on your iPhone, iPad, and iPod devices.\n\nQUESTION 2: Is the app content updated annually? \nANSWER 2: We actually update the app’s content more than annually. However, it would be difficult to notice any significant changes, primarily because not much is added each year. In fact, all the “big guys” only say they update their material annually as a sales gimmick. Don’t take my word for it? Compare older study books (usually free at your school library) to the most recent books and you’ll notice the information is nearly an exact match. \n\nQUESTION 3: Why does this app cost more than other EPPP apps?\nANSWER 3: A lot of time and effort was put into making this app, from condensing the most “need-to-know” information to linking the cards to websites. Also, ours is the most comprehensive mobile EPPP app, addressing every content area covered on the actual exam. The amount, quality, and presentation of the content in the others apps pale in comparison.\n\nQUESTION 4: Is this app all I need to pass the EPPP the first time?\nANSWER 4: While we are uncomfortable making such assertions, many users who passed the exam have contacted us to tell us our app is all they used to study. With the option to retrieve more information about a particular topic provided on most cards, there really is no need to purchase other study materials! Rather, we recommend concerned users get their hands on an old (free) set of study books and use them alongside our app."

      "label": "Team Shake provides a technological and environmentally friendly way to choose teams for board games, sporting events, tournaments, school projects or anytime groups are required. The newest release brings many new features including full iPad support, balancing teams based on skill or gender, importing users from a file, enabling video output, and sharing teams via facebook or email. \n\nTeam Shake is the premier iOS App for creating teams. Instead of a hat and scraps of paper, the user enters his friends' names in his iPhone and gives it a shake. The screen will then display a random set of color-coded teams. These teams can immediately be used for game play or shared via facebook or email.   The quick and easy selection of random (or balanced) teams eliminates fighting over who will be on which team. Innovative use of the iPhone shake gesture gives users the satisfying feeling of shaking a virtual hat without the trouble of carrying around an actual hat. Conventional buttons can also be used for those who would rather not shake their expensive hardware about.  \n\nThe app is designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind. Names can easily be entered with the onscreen keyboard, chosen from the user's contacts, or imported from a file. The email and facebook functions document the members of each individual team as well as preserving the team number and color assigned by the app. For repeated use of Team Shake, lists of friends can be easily saved and loaded later. The current list is also automatically saved so that if you exit the app, or even reboot the device, changes will not be lost. For teachers and others with large lists of people, Team Shake supports the ability to import teams from text or csv files.\n\nIf you have any problems, feature requests, or comments please send an email to support@rhine-o.com. \n\nFeatures:\n\n* Create 1 to 64 random teams\n* Create completely random or balanced teams\n* Full iPad support\n* Eliminates fighting over choosing teams\n* Share / Save teams via email or Facebook\n* Teams can be chosen by the number of teams or by the size of teams.\n* Save lists of friends for later games\n* Import lists from email or spreadsheet\n* Export lists and options for use on another device\n* Satisfying feeling of shaking a “virtual” hat to create teams\n* Animated shaking hat\n* Entry of names via onscreen keyboard\n* Entry of names via iPhone contacts\n* Temporarily disable people who are absent\n* Set groups of people to always be on the same team\n* Set groups of people to always be on different teams\n* Set user strength to make more even teams (now supports fully balanced teams)\n* 5 users strengths level\n* Pick a single random person from the list of players\n* User strength indicator on the main screen (can be disabled in options)\n* Number of active players and total players is now displayed on the main screen\n* Video Out Support\n* Option to Sort Teams by Name\n* Option to balance male / female team members\n* \"Equal Ability\" option to create teams where all players have the same strength\n* Option to create separate male and female teams\n* Configurable Team Colors\n* Configurable Team Names\n* Print Support\n* Export Teams in CSV or XLS Format\n* Team Shake now supports simultaneously assigning players to multiple subteams and / or oppose teams at the same time.\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now have customized names to make selection easier\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now be enabled or disabled globally so that teams can be made quickly without subteams / oppose teams.  In particular, Balance Teams Strengths will work when separate Male / Female teams are created.\n\nYappler-Tags: Teams, Groups, Random, Hat, Entertainment, Games, Utilities"

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

      "label": "The Choiceworks app is an essential learning tool that helps children complete daily routines (morning, day, & night), understand & manage feelings and improve waiting skills (taking turns and not interrupting).  Choiceworks is designed for caregivers to provide clear and consistent support to foster a child’s independence, positive behavior, and emotional regulation at home and in the community. It can also be customized for teachers in a school setting. \n \nKey features included with Choiceworks:\n■ Full, unlimited access to all four board types: Schedule, Waiting, Feelings and Feelings Scale\n■ Image Library preloaded with over 180 images and audio \n■ Add your own images and record your own audio for limitless customizability \n■ Attach video to any board image\n■ Easily create profiles to personalize and manage multiple users\n■ Save an unlimited number of boards for multiple children or different routines \n■ Speaks boards out loud with child or adult voice\n■ Share boards by Email, Files app or iTunes with other Choiceworks app users \n■ Ability to print boards or save as PDF\n\nAdditional features included with Choiceworks+ (Early Access):\n■ Synchronize across all your devices\n■ Advanced sharing options\n■ Custom themes\n■ Library Assistant\n■ Custom timer sounds\n\nWhat do you get with Choiceworks and Choiceworks+?\nWith your Choiceworks purchase you get access to all the features that have made it an award winning support app used in classrooms and homes around the globe for over a decade. No additional in-app purchase or subscriptions are required and there are no limits to how many boards or images you can create and share.\n\nIf you subscribe to Choiceworks+, you will get additional time saving data management features and customization options that further enhance your experience.  You will also receive additional premium features as they are released in future updates.  Note: Choiceworks+ features require an Apple ID to function properly.  If you are in a school or business setting, check with your IT administrator for any restrictions before you subscribe.\n\nSchedule Board \nThe Schedule Board makes task completion easier and more fun! The schedule is paired with an ‘all done’ column to check off steps toward a motivating reward. Timers can be added to any task or activity. The schedules are easy to edit and fully customizable. Once you have created a schedule, it will be saved automatically.\n\nWaiting Board \nThe Waiting Board teaches waiting skills like taking turns and not interrupting. The user can begin by reading the companion book, When Do I Have to Wait? Using the waiting board, the top picture indicates the reason why the child is waiting and a timer can be set to show how long the child will wait. The child can then choose an activity to do while waiting. \n\nFeelings Board \nThe Feelings Board provides a tool for helping children understand and express emotions. The user can begin by reading the companion book, When I Get Upset, to provide an example of how the child might recognize an emotion and choose a coping strategy. On the Feelings Board, the user can then help the child indicate how they are feeling from a range of options, select a coping strategy, and then request an activity to help them feel better or re-engage with others. \n\nFeelings Scale\nHelps users identify, manage and cope with feelings across environments throughout the day. By tracking their feelings on the board, users can analyze the data for trends to learn if tasks done at different times of day or in different environments affect outcome. Environments and schedules can then be altered to achieve better results.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.beevisual.com/mobile-app-eula.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.beevisual.com/mobile-app-privacy.html"

Отображается в правом верхнем углу. Означает количество баллов по текущему слову.\n• Процент изученности. Означает процент изученности слов в словаре.\n\nКАК НАЧИСЛЯЮТСЯ БАЛЛЫ\n\nЗа правильный ответ начисляется 1 балл, за неправильный - снимается 2 балла, при просмотре карточки балл не засчитывается.\n\nПервые три балла начисляются при изучении слова, их можно набрать сразу. После этого слово переходит на повтор и баллы по нему не начисляются пока не настанет время повтора.\n\nЧетвертый балл дается при повторе через 1 день.\nПятый балл дается при повторе  ещё через 3 дня.\n\nИтого, слово может стать выученным на пятый день, если вы набрали 5 баллов.\n\nКАК ЭТО РАБОТАЕТ.\n\nПрограмма предлагает вам на русском языке слово и предложение с этим словом. Вам необходимо ответить, как данное слово в текущем контексте должно быть переведено на английский язык.\n\nЕсли вы ответили правильно, программа похвалит вас. Если вдруг ошиблись - подскажет правильный ответ и покажет карточку слова.\nВ любом случае вам будет показан английский вариант предложения.\n\nРазные формы слов учатся и учитываются в статистике независимо. Например, по словам I и me, see и saw подсчёт ведётся отдельно.\n\nКарточку слова можно посмотреть выбрав соответствующий пункт меню.\nПроцесс изучения слов начинается с того, что программа набирает из своего словаря 15 слов и начинает их показывать в случайном порядке.\n\nПосле того, как слово переходит в группу \"повторяемые\" из словаря извлекается следующее слово.\n\nПовтор производится через 1, 2 дня. Время, когда будет показан повтор всегда исчисляется от времени предыдущего ответа.\n\nЕсли вы отвечаете правильно на все повторы, то слово переходит в группу \"выученные\" и больше не будет предлагаться.\nЕсли вы посмотрели карточку, то баллы не начисляются.\n\nСЛОВАРЬ\nНа текущий момент словарь программы содержит около 1500 наиболее употребляемых английских слов, а также слов используемых в программе \"Полиглот\".\nНеправильные глаголы представлены в первой и второй формах. Подсчет баллов по каждой форме идет независимо. Слова в словаре расположены в порядке изучения.\n\nОЗВУЧКА\nДоступно произношение английского предложения."

(Please set your iPhone to Ring mode to hear the audio playback.)\n・Fun illustrations help users to better retain the words studied. \n・Users can bookmark the words they like. The bookmarked words are compiled in the Bookmark list in \"List.\"\n\n◇ “Check” helps learners to track their mastery.\n・Users check their understanding of the vocabulary studied and sort the words into those mastered and those not yet retained.\n・The words already mastered are taken out of the study set, leaving behind just those that still need to be worked on.\n\n◇ “List” displays a list of all words covered by the app so that users can see their progress and review the vocabulary.\n・The list can be arranged in any of three orderings: lesson order, a-i-u-e-o order, and alphabetical order. The words bookmarked in the Study mode are also listed in the Bookmark list.\n・Checkmarks are automatically placed next to words that have been mastered.\n・The Study view of words can be displayed from the list entries, enabling quick review.\n\n\n○This app is based on the vocabulary from the third edition of GENKI.\n○Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

      "label": "Open up the world-famous Peekaboo Barn, perfect for toddlers. \n\nInside the little bouncing barn, friendly farm animals are waiting to pop out and surprise your little one. Try and guess who they are; tap the doors to find out! More animals, animations, and sounds than ever.\n\nWork with your child to learn the names of animals and hear the sounds they make. Younger children will love opening the barn doors to find new animal animations, as they learn about cause and effect and become familiar with animal names and sounds. Older children will enjoy guessing animals by sound, then seeing the animal names, which helps develop early literacy skills.  \n\nMultiple Language Features:\n\nWe started with a child's voice in English. It's her real voice, which some kids really enjoy, but she does say \"wabbit\" and \"wooster.\" If this is a concern for you, you can switch to any of 12 adult voices; our adult narrators say everything clearly and perfectly, just like the teachers they are. You can try many languages from around the world—or record your own language, or grandma's voice. There are tons of ways to explore the languages of Peekaboo Barn!\n\nPress the Language button on the Options screen to try them out.\n\n—Choose from the built-in narrators: child's voice in young English; adult's voice in American English or Spanish.\n—World languages also included: Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, German, French, Australian, and UK English. \n—Record your own voice: We added this feature so parents, children, and visiting relatives and friends can capture their own voices and star in Peekaboo Barn.  Now you can record the animal names in your native language--or grandma's voice, or grandpa's--and, if you're recording a new language, you can save the appropriate written version too, and both will show up the next time you play. (Please note, we can only support the writing systems that are supported by your device.)\n\nFEATURED BY APPLE \nOne of the first apps to be released for toddlers, since 2008 Peekaboo Barn has been downloaded over a million times, and played over 100 million times worldwide.  It has been a top 20 educational game on the iTunes store nearly every day since its launch, and has been featured by Apple often.  It won The Best Toddler App Ever award in 2009, and was named one of the top 50 iPhone apps for kids by Babble.com in 2010 and 2011.  It is recommended by The New York Times, MSNBC, USA Today, Wired, Telegraph UK, Ireland’s The Independent, Parents Magazine, and the Washington Post.\n\nPeekaboo Barn was made for you and your toddler by artists and educators, not marketers, robots, or companies repackaging clip art. Our team has backgrounds in cognitive science and child development, and we’ve worked in educational media everywhere from Penguin USA to the Smithsonian Institution. When you could really use a safe distraction--in airports, restaurants, and waiting rooms--or you'd like to try something new with your little genius, Peekaboo Barn is the educational, artful solution. Enjoy! \n\nIf you are looking for more Peekaboo, check out our awesome cousins: Peekaboo Fridge, Peekaboo Forest, and Peekaboo Wild.\n\nIf your kids are ready for a more complex game with the same great characters, please try Peekaboo Barn Farm Day! Many activities to try: for example, you can milk the cow, shear the sheep and llama, and pet the animals to help them fall sleep.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/nightanddaystudios. \nTwitter: @nightdaystudios \nYour privacy is important to us!

To help you not to get lost in the maze of legal and safety questions, not to be dazzled by unknown terms during theory and to get the hang of what real CRFSC and CFSC exams are, we have created this quiz app. Few hours of practice with this app - and you will confidently pass actual theory tests at your exam.\n\nThe application contains 250+ questions, which help you to master your knowledge by practicing offline (you don't need an Internet connection) and, thus, utilizing your time better.\n\nFeatures:\n- 250+ questions based on CRFSC/CFSC preparation materials\n- Randomly generated quizzes\n- Quiz capacity is optimized for fastest tuition\n- Reviewing included comments for the most complicated/tricky questions\n- Practical advice and weapon handling techniques from the best firearms instructors\n\nSome recommendations for your exam:\n1. Start preparing 2 to 1 week before your exam (on one hand you don't want to forget anything, but on the other hand you want to avoid an information overload);\n2. Found unknown term - find out what it is. Otherwise you may face it on your exam;\n3. If you theory is on Friday evening and practice and exams are on Saturday, make sure you don't have to cook your dinner on Friday (you will get home quite late);\n4. Good sleep is important!\n5. The cornerstone of the exam is ACTS and PROVE. Learn its meaning by heart, and practice. If you can't practice with real arms at home, at least watch videos and visualize the process. At practical exam you need to ACTS and PROVE you gun all the time. For example, instructor says: \"Put the gun on the table!\" - you ACTS and PROVE it and only then place on the table. And so on.\n\nGood luck with your PAL/RPAL test!"

      "label": "Simple Lines Anatomy is an anatomy quiz app that makes learning and reviewing musculoskeletal anatomy fast and efficient. There are over 1400 questions that cover the bones and their prominences as well as the muscles and all of their most commonly tested criteria. Each question on the muscles and bones are accompanied by a custom illustration. These illustrations are constructed in a unique way that exaggerates and simplifies their attachment points, placement, and functions making future recall easier for the user.\n\nThe bones are covered thoroughly in our tap/touch based questions. This includes the location and name each part/prominence of the bone as well as identifying the prominences that specific muscles attach to.\n\nEach muscle is covered in a highly detailed and accurate way. The criteria each muscle is tested on includes the most commonly tested questions in anatomy education: Fibre orientation(s), origin, insertion, cross-section, action, nerve innervation, and blood supply.\n\nThis app is perfect for quick review before a test by specific anatomic region or you can customize a test in our “Custom Random” mode. For causal review on the go or for summative tests (multiple regions and criteria) use our “Full Random Testing” mode to be rapidly quizzed on the entire Simple Lines Anatomy content at random.\n\nUse in-game statistics to monitor your accuracy and progress in each body region and testing type. Select “Weak Areas Occur More Frequently” to have questions you previously answered incorrectly show more often to strengthen your knowledge in that region."

Then you’ll love Busy Shapes designed for children from 2 years old!\n\n*** Featured in App Store Best of 2014 ***\n*** Featured worldwide by App Store as a Best New App ***\n*** Featured in the USA Today ***\n*** Recommended by The Good App Guide ***\n*** Common Sense Media Editors' Pick 2014 ***\n*** Parents‘ Choice Awards 2014 ***\n*** Children's Technology Review Awards 2014 ***\n\n> Inspired by the pioneering works of famed Swiss scientist and intelligence expert Jean Piaget (1896-1980)\n> Helps children improve their ability to handle simple objects through a series of engaging puzzles\n> Real-time dashboard to monitor progress\n> Includes an array of kid-friendly features, such as “passing” swipe control & more!\n\nABOUT BUSY SHAPES\nBusy Shapes helps children improve their ability to handle simple objects through a series of puzzles, in which they must change simple shapes and place them in proper holes. Along the way, the app responds to each child’s actions with positive guidance and motivation. Plus, the app’s digital exploratory playground regularly refreshes with different objects, which keeps children interested and engaged.\n\nINSPIRED BY JEAN PIAGET\nBusy Shapes is inspired by the pioneering works of famed Swiss scientist and intelligence expert Jean Piaget (1896-1980), who believed that “children are little scientists”, and that a child's thoughts are built through experiences that encourage him or her to engage in the reasoning process.\n\nINNOVATIVE, SCALEABLE PLATFORM\nBusy Shapes’ innovative scaleable platform for evolving experimentation lets children take advantage of the time they spend on touch screens -- so they aren’t just having fun, but learning every second of the way.\n\nKID-FRIENDLY DESIGN\nBusy Shapes features a special “kid-friendly” design that compensates for the fact that when young children hold an iPad or iPhone, they often have a finger touching the screen.\n\n“PASSING” SWIPE CONTROL\nBusy Shapes features “passing” swipe control that is essential for young children's quick hands (i.e. even if a child's finger reaches an object after he or she was already touching the screen, the object is still grasped as intended).\n\nPOWERFUL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)\nBusy Shapes’ powerful AI supports each child’s unique learning journey. For example, the AI tracks the time it takes each child to complete a level, and increases or decreases difficulty accordingly.\n\nGUIDED ACCESS\nTo prevent children from exiting the app by pressing the “home” button, Busy Shapes features a customizable Guided Access. This feature also disables selected parts of the screen for safety and protection.\n\nSEAMLESS INTERACTION\nBusy Shapes’ seamless interactive game area never blocks or limits children, and lets them freely access shapes. The menu is also neatly hidden away.\n\nAUTOMATIC MEMORY\nSometimes the best learning is a combination of cognitive exercise and physical play. Busy Shapes’ automatic memory saves a child’s place in any particular game, which makes the app an ideal complement to physical play and for shorter games.\n\nMULTIPLE LANGUAGE SUPPORT\nThe app is now available in: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Greek, Dutch, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Turkish, Russian, Korean, Indonesian, Malay, Vietnamese, Thai, Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese\n\nCONNECT WITH US!\nIf you have any support request, please write at support@edokiacademy.com or visit the Edoki Academy Online Community at edokiacademy.com."

Please see below some of our reviews:\n\n“Spell Wizards is fantastic! My daughters spelling ability has improved since using this site. She practices her spelling independently and the parent report allows me to provide help as needed.”\n\n- Kelly Heath, Market Harborough.\n\n“Getting my two boys to practice spellings is a real battle. Then we found Spell Wizards!

      "label": "Stick and Split is a deceptively simple, addictive game.  But what makes it so special is while they are playing it, children learn and practise their times tables, perhaps without even realising it.\r\n\nResearch shows the more you think about something, the more likely you are to remember it. \n\nMost times tables games try to get children to answer simple questions like ‘what is 3 x 6?’ many, many times. The problem with this approach is it aims to get children to answer with the minimum of thought. So it’s no wonder children have to answer them thousands of times before they remember the answers. Many get bored and switch off before the memory sticks. Some children get anxious when they don’t know the answers, and research also shows feeling anxious is not a great way to make memories.\r\n\nStick and Split has been carefully designed to encourage children to think much more about multiplication and division facts. There are no right or wrong answers, so it won’t induce anxiety. Instead they need to be constantly thinking what they need to do. The more they think, the more they remember.\r\nReasons you’ll love Stick and Split:\r\n\n- Incredibly simple game play – you’ll learn how to play it in a minute\n\n\n- But with over 300 different levels, you’ll find there is so much to it\r\n\n- Covers up to 12x tables and division\r\n\n- Encourages children to think about what multiplication and division really mean, so they’re not just blindly “learning their times tables “\r\n\n- Up to four children can have an account on the one device\r\n\n- Comes with advice for grown-ups supporting a child using the game\n\n\n- Stats show how much each child has played\r\n\n- An overview of all the levels shows you precisely what each child has done and enables them to jump to a level that’s suitable for them\r\n\n- A solid mathematical basis underpins the game\r\n\n- You won’t find a more cost-effective way to keep children occupied, thinking about numbers for hours"

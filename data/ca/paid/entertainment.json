Use the search bar to quickly find your minifigures by unique ID, name, or set number. You can swipe between minifigure entries to easily update your collection! Each minifigure page provides all the relevant information you need to know. Saving the best for last, exclusive to the LSW Collector app is a section dedicated to more obscure variants! Entries for all minifigures made from 1999 to current are included and are added in real time which means you don't have to wait for an update to check them off. We promise to continue to update with the newest minifigures so that you can continue expanding your collection! \n\nLSW Collector is an unofficial mobile application for all collectors of LEGO Star Wars minifigures. Made by a collector for collectors!\n\nCapabilities:\n\nEach entry contains all of the important information about the minifigure including detailed images, unique ID, year of release, and in which sets it can be found. Swiping left and right allows you to see both the front and back of the minifigure. Clicking on the sets box shows exactly which sets a minifig comes from! LSW Collector allows you to 'check off' minifigures you already have and add the ones you don't to your wanted list. The green check mark allows you to easily see which minifigures you already have from the main view while the 'WANTED' symbol indicates which figures you are still chasing. Alternatively you can ignore figures that you don't want to have in your collection by tapping on the hide button at the bottom of the screen. You can revisit these figures any time by clicking the hide button on the main page. The Price Guide feature allows you to check the average selling price for each minifigure and can be used as an estimation for your own buying/selling purposes. You can also add multiple of the same minifigure to your collection and then track your total progress on the My Collection tab.\n\nLegal Information:\n\nLEGO and the minifigure are registered trademarks of the LEGO Group.\n\nSTAR WARS is a registered trademark of Lucasfilm, Ltd.

Because of this it is recommended that you turn on your camera's torch light if you are scanning in dark areas.\n\nYou can also snap photos of what you catch to share with your friends or other investigators.\n\nJoin our group chat to discuss ghostly things with other users.\n\nIf things get a little spooky we recommend turning on some lights and taking a break from the app for a while. :)"

Weird Type is an AR app that lets you paint with text in space!\n\nYou can type your own phrases and pick from multiple modes and see your text in completely new ways. You can record videos of your messages and share them or save them to you camera roll. \n\nIt's based on a series of AR experiments that the authors Zach Lieberman and Molmol Kuo have been posting to Instagram over the last few months.   People kept asking, \"is that an app?\"  Now, together with our collaborator Design Indaba, which helped produce this, we're packaging some of these experiments into app and we hope you enjoy them!   \n\nThe app is designed by Richard The, with iOS help from Ying Quan Tan, Robby Kraft, and Peter Sibley\n\nNote the app now supports multi-lingual input."

      "label": "The companion app to the popular book \"The Serpent and the Jaguar,\" the award-winning MCP Mayan Tzolkin gives you the authentic Mayan Tzolkin calendar the way the living Maya practice it. This app follows the sacred traditional count of the Kiche Maya, and is in no way related to the \"Dreamspell\" or \"13-moon\" calendar, invented in the 20th century.\n\nWe designed the MCP Mayan Tzolkin to connect you with the energies of the sacred Tzolkin calendar—perhaps the most well known of all the Mayan calendars—and to understand the meaning of the Tzolk’in’s essential building blocks: the day signs and the numbers. \n\nFor the first time, the entire series of these energies is now available in their complete form, and on a mobile platform—260 unique daily energies finely tuned to the realities of modern day life. \n\nMCP Mayan Tzolkin features: \n• Complete set of the 260 “Energies of the Day,” each energy thoughtfully interpreted for the context of modern-day life, taking into account not only the meaning of the day sign and numeral, but also the general context of the current Trecena \n• Sophisticated, beautifully rendered glyph, number and deity graphics \n• The well-known Mayan Calendar Portal Tzolkin calendar rings, in full dynamic, interactive mode \n• Explanation of the nature, meaning and purpose of the sacred Tzolk’in, including listings of the 20 day signs and 13 numbers in both Yucatec and K’iche’ Maya \n• A calculator to convert Gregorian (Western) dates into Tzolkin dates \n• Full descriptions of the 20 sacred day signs and the 13 numbers, based on the traditions of the Maya of Guatemala \n• Full descriptions of the 13 deities associated with the thirteen numbers \n\nWhile other apps generally take their day sign, number and “energy of the day” descriptions from various non-Maya sources, the “Energies of the Day” in our app are based on authentic interpretations and practices of the Tzolkin that have been made available to us by the Maya of the Guatemalan highlands and Maya scholars with long years of experience living and working with the Maya. \n\nBACKGROUND \nSince ancient times, the Maya have used the 260-day Tzolkin as their personal astrological calendar. Incredibly accurate regardless of culture, race, gender, faith, or ethnicity, the Tzolkin remains, to this day, profoundly relevant to the human experience—including our modern lives and lifestyles. Unlike the now-defunct Long Count calendar whose latest cycle ended on 12.21.2012, and whose original usage and meaning has been completely overrun by popular notions of doomsday scenarios, the sacred Tzolk’in is a deeply personal astrological calendar. \n\nPRAISE \nCheck out what people have been saying about the Energies of the Day since the very first day we published them: \n\n~ THANK YOU! You speak right from the bottom of my soul. This is exactly what I've been going through lately... \n~ Thank you so much for the insight. I always start my day here :) \n~ Wow, the sync that this post has today with me, [is] completely relevant to my situation. I really enjoy your posts MCP … this is amazing info! \n~ This is so accurate it's scary some days... and I don't believe in zodiac and horoscopes and stuff like that usually. \n~ I got chills reading this… something is VERY on point here... \n~ I would just like to say thank you for the effort and energy that you extend to putting these [energies] together for our benefit at this cycle in time of our existence. \n\n\nThe Mayan Calendar Portal and all of its properties, including the MCP Mayan Tzolkin mobile application, are produced by LUCITÀ Inc."

Ideal for Dungeons & Dragons, Quick Roll offers the following eight dice; D2, D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20 and D100. \n\n~ Multiple Dice \nIn multiple dice mode you can mix your dice together as you please. This mode has been designed with Warhammer in mind, and you can easily filter the dice at the touch of a button. The remaining dice can be rolled again to find out how many enemies you wound. Stats, such as average and the sum, are displayed for each roll saving you counting on screen. Buttons are provided to remove the highest or lowest rolls, as well as any range in between. \n\n~ Calculator\n Great for large numbers of dice, or combinations with a modifier.\n\n~ Roll History \nNatural 20 keeps track of all your rolls, so you can prove you actually rolled that 20! The dice stored in your history can be easily re-rolled and filtered. You can move the dice around the screen, and it will remember your order. \n\n~ Custom Die \nCustom Die lets you choose the sides of the dice, by separating them with commas. Natural 20 will pick a single item, or order them randomly into a list. \n\n~ Range Die \nPick any range, and receive a random number. Your three most rolled ranges are available at the press of a button.\n\n~ Teachers Die \nHandy for the classroom, this die will be helpful for Maths and English. You can use it to randomly pick letters, numbers and mathematical operators. When picking letters you can specify if they are upper or lowercase, and also pick between vowels and consonants. \n\n~ Colour Die \nThis will give you a random colour, just run your finger across the screen like a paintbrush. Some basic information is displayed, such as the colour’s hex number, HSB, and RGB values. \n\n~ Direction Die \nThis will point you in a totally random direction with each spin. Swipe the screen to spin it, however you can only influence which way it spins, not the outcome! \n\n~ Success Die \nRepeatedly rolls D6’s, discarding when they fail to meet a certain value. The total successes are displayed. \n\n~ Word Die\nKeep collections of words, to randomise at a touch. Ideal for selecting locations and enemies randomly. You can even randomise your words as a whole list. \n\n~ My Dice \nMy Dice allows you to save your own collections of dice, along with a description and optional modifier. These can be easily searched through, and rolled from a single tap. \n\n~ Dice Builder\nChose how many sides your dice have, and their colours!\n\n~ Distribution \nDistribution allows you to create probability distribution plots for specified dice. These will show you the percentage chance of rolling a particular face value, and you can compare actual rolls against theoretical results. However, large numbers of dice can take a long time to calculate for theoretical plots."

      "label": "This Living Worlds app is a modern recreation of a set of dynamic pixel art scenes first published in the early 90s as part of an \"illustrated personal organizer\" named Seize the Day, and seen as screenshots across the Internet since then. These scenes were created by Mark Ferrari, legendary artist from such classic games as Loom and The Secret of Monkey Island as well as the recent Thimbleweed Park. Now, 25 years later, Ian Gilman, the original software developer, has resurrected the Living Worlds, with Mark's support and additional code from Joseph Huckaby. There may be copycats, but this is the only authentic version from the original creators! \n\nThis release of the app contains all twelve of the original scenes in their full glory. The sun rises and falls in real time, storms pass through, flowers bloom, the moon and stars cross the sky. Smaller details like chimney smoke and animal footprints come and go. The image \"lives\" throughout the day, drawing you in, suggesting stories, and rewarding quiet observation.\n\nIn addition to the classic graphics, each scene includes a new \"Logbook\" story written by Mark Ferrari and ambient soundscapes designed by Ian Gilman.\n\nJoin us for this 25th anniversary celebration of these unique artworks!"

The two views have divergent symbolism, highlighting the contrast between the upright and reversed card meaning.\n\nThe familiar Tarot archetypes in Revelations wear masks, invoking mythic visitations of gods in human form. The deck’s detailed images glow like the gemstone colors in stained glass. Revelations loosely follows RWS symbolism, with dynamic and witty interpretations of the images.\n\nEspecially good for beginners bemused by reversals, or for accomplished readers burnishing their skills, Revelations Tarot inspires many “a-ha!” breakthroughs in reading reversed cards. This deck reads particularly well for questions of career. Far more than a concept deck, Revelations brings depth and strength to an often-neglected aspect of Tarot that can benefit all readers.\n\n*Intuitive, elegant interface is easy for beginners and experts\n*Gorgeous full screen, high-resolution card images\n*Full support for all current iOS devices\n*Sophisticated journal\n*Includes full and unabridged book\n*20 spreads built in\n*Design your own layout with Free Form\n*Allow reversed cards or not\n*Option to use Major Arcana only\n*Zoom in to enlarge card details\n*Share reading via email, Facebook, and Twitter\n*Animated shuffle & cut\n*Optional voice prompts\n*Customize with your own card meanings & reading cloths\n*Many adjustable settings\n*Book and card meanings available in English only\n\nRead reversals like a professional!"

This was in the 60'ies of the last century. Since then a lot has changed, but many of us remember the days when there was no Graphical User Interface.\n\nThis app now is introducing DOS for mobile devices. Not laptops, but phones. iPhone and iPad, to be precise. It is a perfect emulator of the DOS that so many games and applications in the 80'ies and 90'ies have been running on.\n\nWin and Win95 were running on DOS, showing what a 16bit operating system is capable of. If sys ini, commanc.com, config.sys and .exe sound familiar to you, then this is the app for you.\n\nThe DOS is not just a CLI, it is a full fledged operating system. It does everything that the Ancient DOS did. It is capable of executing batch files or installing some of the game classics that never made it past DOS. It probably runs much better than the original DOS used to run on old PC's, which were state of the art back then.\n\n30 years is old enough to be called vintage, and it brings as much power as it did back then ;-) With this app you can get this vintage feeling on your iPhone or iPad.\n\n◆Features\n    ▸ SoundCard emulation\n    ▸ External Bluetooth Keyboard\n    ▸ Disk Operating System\n    ▸ Everything you would expect from DOS ;)\n\nIf you have ideas, feedback, suggestions or anything else you would like to tell us, do not hesitate to drop us a line!\n\nAnd if you like Power DOS, be not shy to leave a good review!"

With The Arthurian Tarot, they have created a new way for seekers to integrate the spiritual teaching of the Arthurian legends. Here you will find a profound tool for personal growth, a superb Tarot for gaining psychological insight as well as a good deck for divination.\n\nThe Arthurian Tarot encompasses the range of human experience, never softening the painful aspects of life. The images depict suffering and cruelty alongside love and abundance. These cards lead seekers into their own psychological landscape, guiding brave pilgrims towards inner healing and wholeness through the archetypes and scenes of Arthur’s world.\n\nIn The Arthurian Tarot, Spears replace Wands, and Stones replace Pentacles, while Pages become Maidens. Miranda Gray’s striking paintings embody the scenes and characters from the Arthurian mysteries with strength and elegance. The Major Arcana cards are envisioned as characters from Arthur’s myth cycle, and most are re-named from the RWS Tarot. All of the Aces become the Hallows of their suits.\n\nA good deck for divination, The Arthurian Tarot is even stronger as a tool for personal enlightenment and self-understanding. Caitlín and John Matthews, working with Miranda Gray, have produced a masterpiece in The Arthurian Tarot.\n\n*Intuitive, elegant interface is easy for beginners and experts\n*Gorgeous full screen, high-resolution card images\n*Full support for all current iOS devices\n*Sophisticated journal\n*Includes full and unabridged book\n*14 spreads built in, with ten of them unique to The Arthurian Tarot\n*Design your own layout with Free Form\n*Allow reversed cards or not\n*Option to use Major Arcana only\n*Zoom in to enlarge card details\n*Share reading via email, Facebook and Twitter\n*Animated shuffle & cut\n*Optional voice prompts\n*Customize with your own card meanings & reading cloths\n*Many adjustable settings\n*Book and card meanings available in English only\n\nEnter King Arthur’s world today, through the archways of The Arthurian Tarot!"

      "label": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved"

Explore the colorful and electrifying world of science and meet all 118 of the elements from the periodic table. \n\nDiscover elements by experimenting with the lab tools! \n\n* Take your element for a spin in the centrifuge.\n* Warm them up in the Bunsen burner. \n* Put the element on ice with the cooling agent! \n* Add a drop or two of mysterious liquids from the test tubes.\n* Change their voltage and make them magnetic with the oscilloscope.\n\nEach element has it's own personality. In Toca Lab: Elements, what does Neon sound like? Is Gold heavy or light? Is Nitrogen squishy or hard? Explore, inspect, and study each one and let us know! Can you find all 118? \n\nThe time has come, future scientists, to head into the lab to explore and discover. Put on your lab coat and protective eye gear because things are about to get experimental!\n\nToca Lab: Elements is a place for playing and having fun, and with it we hope to inspire kids to explore science.

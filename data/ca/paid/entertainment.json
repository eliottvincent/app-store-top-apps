      "label": "The Ghost EVP/EMF Radio has been developed for exciting paranormal detection and exploration. We've put a lot of effort into making the app easy to use, so that both professional and enthusiast paranormal researchers, ghost hunters and ghost tour organizers can enjoy the experience.\n\nIf you are either easily frightened, a super skeptic \"left brainer\" or have a serious heart-related medical condition, you are probably better off avoiding this app.\n\nElectronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) is the collective name for the sounds sometimes detected on electronic recordings and reminiscent of human speech. These sounds are usually found in recordings with noise or poor radio reception and are considered by many to be the voices of paranormal beings such as ghosts, spirits, demons and other energy based entities. EVP is a form of Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC), a term coined by professor Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s.\n\nThis app has taken the traditional ghost box to the next level. As with traditional ghost boxes, chaotic noise seems to be both inviting and sensitive to paranormal manipulation. The app generates audible speech by detecting meaningful phrases and words together with properties such as gender, age and the current mood of the communicating entity. We continuously improve the app, based on user feedback, and use it during our own paranormal investigations as well.\n\n*** Features ***\n* Radio Control Panel where you control the radio in real-time.\n* Brownian, Pink and White Noise generators.\n* Electromagnetic Field Meter using the Magnetometer sensor of your device.\n* Multiple graphical themes for the user interface.\n* Record your encounters with or without the microphone of your device.\n* Real-time audio visualization: Oscilloscope, Spectrometer, Voicegram and Waveform (tap to toggle).\n* Text log screen: The persistent text log is where you can sort, share and delete your log.\n* Quick text log: Tap on the main TV screen to toggle between the different view modes.\n* Open your EVP recordings in compatible audio apps with the touch of a button.\n* Optional Auto Recording which only produces recordings when something interesting is encountered.\n* Optional vibration (iPhone only) and audible alarms every time an entity has been detected.\n* Share your recordings with friends and family.\n* Upload your recordings to your Dropbox.\n\nPlease note that the app will degrade gracefully to Performance mode when running on older hardware, which means that some features may not be available or limited when running on, for example, the iPad 2 or the iPhone 4S.\n\n\n*** Languages ***\nEnglish (US/UK), Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Latin, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\n\n*** Support ***\n* For support, feedback and more information, please visit https://paranormalsoftware.com/support, or use the buttons on the Settings screen.\n* Knowledge Base: https://paranormalsoftware.com/support/kb\n* Twitter: @GhostRadioEVP\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ghostevpradio\n* Mailing list: http://tiny.cc/ghostradiomail\n\n\nWe hope that you, like many others, will be fascinated by the paranormal experience of Ghost EVP Radio. Thanks for downloading!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nEvery effort has been made to make this app truly unique, but we can offer no guarantee that you will get specific results by using it. Since the results of this app haven't been scientifically verified, it should only be used for entertainment purposes. Please use it responsibly."

      "label": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved"

No joke this is the real deal and it is awesome.\" 4th Jul 2010\n\n \n\n \nCleverbot is Artificial Intelligence. It learns what people say, in context, and imitates.\n\nCleverbot says many things - claiming to be human, role-playing and much more. It may even say things you find inappropriate. Use with discretion and at your own risk.\n \nCleverbot is conversational entertainment - no more, no less. It is not made to be logical, give advice, or be useful. Parents must decide whether they wish young people to have access. Be sure of this, however: it is a bot. It is software. You will never talk to a human."

      "label": "In the modern age, paranormal investigators use many tools to communicate with spirits. Ouija Boards, Spirit Boxes, radios and apps are just a few of the many tools they use but cultures have been using tools to communicate with spirits for ages. \n\nCleromancy, the practice of contacting divine truth via random castings of dice (or bones) stretches back before recorded history. Astragalomancy, is a form of divination that uses dice marked with letters. In fact, many ancient cultures have various forms of dice divination.\n\nNecro Dice is a modern version of this ancient practice. This app means to combine the ancient and modern forms of communication in a completely new and unique way. Users seeking answers or messages can roll the dice with a simple tap of the screen. Once the user’s intention has been cast through the rolling of the dice, it is up to the spirits to communicate by influencing the randomization of letters to form words. This phenomenon of spirit communication through the manipulation of electronic devices has been well documented for several decades.\n\nNecro Dice functions by generating a handful of dice with random letters assigned to each of the six faces of each dice. These dice are then simulated with an advanced physics engine that handles dice to table and dice to dice collisions. When the physics simulation completes and the dice settle the result is a jumble of letters shown on the top face of the dice. Normally when using dice, the user is then required to inspect the dice to try and find words in this jumble of letters. This app uses a proprietary algorithm to inspect the top faces of the dice and try to match words and names to a dictionary. A word is chosen from the jumble of letters based on many factors including distance, length, location and relevance. Once a word is detected in the dice,  the app will highlight the individual letters on the dice and display the word on the screen. A list of words rolled since the start of the app can be accessed in the word log by pressing the button at the lower left of the screen.\n\nRolling dice isn’t just for games, do the spirits have a message for you?"

Explore the kitten's world and discover cute animations, laugh with and care for your adorable, realistic pet.\nThe unique game-design encourages children to explore the room with minimal use of icons or menus.

The philosophy is not about winning, losing or competition, it's about having fun in a child-friendly environment and learning without even realizing it! Great Mini-Games with purpose!:\n\nCompatibility: The App doesn't support iPad2, iPhone 4s, iPad Mini1, iPod5 with iOS9\n\n1) Kitten Hide&Seek - encourages focus and attention.\n2) Paw Painting - creativity unleashed! Mix red, yellow, blue to get every imaginable colour - your child will learn realistic paint mixing, then come up with your own masterpiece using a paw print or a standard brush.\n3) Mouse & Cheese - Memorize where the zones are to sneak mouse past little kitten over to the cheese. Or just have some laughs seeing what happens when little kitten catches the mouse!\n4) Bed Trampoline - Discover all little kitten's hidden tricks and moves!\n5) Animal Puzzle - Educational 'mix and match' funny animal combinations to earn biscuits that you can then feed to your little kitten.\n6) Feeding - Each time you play a mini-game you receive cat food snacks, children love feeding the little kitten and watching it licking its lips and purr after a good feed! \n7) Cat-in-the-box - Educational 'hand-eye coordination' mini-game \n8) Balloon Popping - can you discovered all the different shapes?!\n\nNot using any text menus, the game can be easily navigated by young children. Parents have the option to limit screen time for their kids: after a chosen time, the kitten gets tired and goes to sleep.\nLittle Kitten is a high-tech app - using the latest 3d animation technology to create the visuals, it also uses cutting edge programming to maximize the user experience on your apple device.

I will add more as I get time. The phone also vibrates with the sounds. That can be turned off in the settings window. Go to the settings menu for the app in the setting app. Some might argue that this should be a free app but anything that can distract my 5 and under grandchildren for a few minutes at the checkout is worth $.99.

      "label": "\"Become a paranormal investigator too with the amazing new Pro del Pit app. Have fun testing your courage or put yourself in the shoes of a paranormal investigator.\n\nThe Ghost Finder contains the three most important tools used by investigators of the paranormal: The Ghost Box, the M1 and the Rem, developed ad hoc by the Pit Team.\n\nGHOST BOX:\n\nThe Ghost Box or Spirit Box is an AM FM radio that quickly changes the frequency for the purpose of listening to EVPs.\n\nThis radio varies the frequency with a rhythm ranging from 100 milliseconds to 500 milliseconds and the resulting electronic voice tends to take effect from the white noise of the frequency.\n\nM1:\n\nThe M1 is an electromagnetic field meter. Thanks to the magnetometers present in the latest generation mobile phones *, you too can try your hand at researching variations in the electromagnetic field.\n\nIts functions are similar to those of a KII but enhanced for use on a smartphone. The more the electromagnetic field variations will be strong, the more the LEDs will light up to red.\n\nREM:\n\nThe Rem is an electronic device that allows you to receive answers to your questions.\n\nThe Rem has a built-in word database. Whenever a considerable variation in electromagnetism is recorded, the amplitude and intensity values ​​are combined to select a word from the reference database.\n\nThe first screen will show the word while the second will record the electromagnetism variations that caused the selection of that word.\n\nBLACK BOX:\nThis fantastic instrument perceives random chaotic noise and connects to a phonetic database from which it is possible to listen to the formation of words divided into syllables. Ask your question and listen to the answers that will come. Try to understand the words that will come out by joining the single phonemes.\n\nINFO ON OPERATION:\n\nTo test m1 just enter M1 function and approach an electrical socket or an electronic device on and the instrument will immediately show a change in magnetism.\n\nThanks to an algorithm developed by Team Pit, the App creates a triangulation between the three magnets inside the latest generation mobile phones to accurately calculate the magnetic anomalies in the environment.\n\n*ATTENTION*\n\nIn older mobile phones without the 3 magnetometers now used in most mobile phones, the app will not work properly and the M1 will light up with just the movement of the mobile phone. This is because it will simulate a compass and give false positive answers to just the movement of the mobile. \""

      "label": "On the 9th of January 2015, Mandy Len Catron published an essay in The New York Times describing her experience replicating a study that claims to accelerate intimacy between two people.\n\nPsychologist Dr Arthur Aron, author of the study, devised a series of 36 specific questions intended to be asked by each person to their partner. The questions begin rather tamely, and progressively get deeper and more personal. It can be difficult to open up to a person, especially a stranger, this experience forces both parties to open up and become vulnerable with one another.\n\nThe original study had a very interesting outcome. A man and woman, both complete strangers at the time entered a room separately. Both took part asking and answering a series of questions, ending the experiment by staring silently into each other's eyes for four minutes. The outcome?

Take turns reading one question aloud to your partner, then both of you answer. Simple, but terrifying!\n\nThere is no time limit, be honest and be truthful. The final recommended task is to stare silently into your partners eyes for four minutes. Nervous yet?"

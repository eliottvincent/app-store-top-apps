Should you have a crazy child or two around the house like the developers of this app, one technique that's great for a laugh is to use the camera on your device to get the visuals and then let their imagination run wild whilst recording their interpretation of the photo with the microphone. Then simply type what was spoken and playback the story for repeated laughs.\n\nThis family focused creativity and entertainment app is also used worldwide in schools for education purposes. Teachers are able to prepare visual content and provide their own voice recordings for later use in the classroom.\n\nWhilst the stories you create can be shared with other users of the app or converted to a video for a wider audience, this app was developed with strong privacy in mind, and as such, stories can only leave the device via the standard share feature provided by the operating system."

In Toca Lab: Elements, what does Neon sound like? Is Gold heavy or light? Is Nitrogen squishy or hard? Explore, inspect, and study each one and let us know! Can you find all 118? \n\nThe time has come, future scientists, to head into the lab to explore and discover. Put on your lab coat and protective eye gear because things are about to get experimental!\n\nToca Lab: Elements is a place for playing and having fun, and with it we hope to inspire kids to explore science.

No joke this is the real deal and it is awesome.\" 4th Jul 2010\n\n \n\n \nCleverbot is Artificial Intelligence. It learns what people say, in context, and imitates.\n\nCleverbot says many things - claiming to be human, role-playing and much more. It may even say things you find inappropriate. Use with discretion and at your own risk.\n \nCleverbot is conversational entertainment - no more, no less. It is not made to be logical, give advice, or be useful. Parents must decide whether they wish young people to have access. Be sure of this, however: it is a bot. It is software. You will never talk to a human."

      "label": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved"

      "label": "In the modern age, paranormal investigators use many tools to communicate with spirits. Ouija Boards, Spirit Boxes, radios and apps are just a few of the many tools they use but cultures have been using tools to communicate with spirits for ages. \n\nCleromancy, the practice of contacting divine truth via random castings of dice (or bones) stretches back before recorded history. Astragalomancy, is a form of divination that uses dice marked with letters. In fact, many ancient cultures have various forms of dice divination.\n\nNecro Dice is a modern version of this ancient practice. This app means to combine the ancient and modern forms of communication in a completely new and unique way. Users seeking answers or messages can roll the dice with a simple tap of the screen. Once the user’s intention has been cast through the rolling of the dice, it is up to the spirits to communicate by influencing the randomization of letters to form words. This phenomenon of spirit communication through the manipulation of electronic devices has been well documented for several decades.\n\nNecro Dice functions by generating a handful of dice with random letters assigned to each of the six faces of each dice. These dice are then simulated with an advanced physics engine that handles dice to table and dice to dice collisions. When the physics simulation completes and the dice settle the result is a jumble of letters shown on the top face of the dice. Normally when using dice, the user is then required to inspect the dice to try and find words in this jumble of letters. This app uses a proprietary algorithm to inspect the top faces of the dice and try to match words and names to a dictionary. A word is chosen from the jumble of letters based on many factors including distance, length, location and relevance. Once a word is detected in the dice,  the app will highlight the individual letters on the dice and display the word on the screen. A list of words rolled since the start of the app can be accessed in the word log by pressing the button at the lower left of the screen.\n\nRolling dice isn’t just for games, do the spirits have a message for you?"

This app follows the sacred traditional count of the Kiche Maya, and is in no way related to the \"Dreamspell\" or \"13-moon\" calendar, invented in the 20th century.\n\nWe designed the MCP Mayan Tzolkin to connect you with the energies of the sacred Tzolkin calendar—perhaps the most well known of all the Mayan calendars—and to understand the meaning of the Tzolk’in’s essential building blocks: the day signs and the numbers. \n\nFor the first time, the entire series of these energies is now available in their complete form, and on a mobile platform—260 unique daily energies finely tuned to the realities of modern day life. \n\nMCP Mayan Tzolkin features: \n• Complete set of the 260 “Energies of the Day,” each energy thoughtfully interpreted for the context of modern-day life, taking into account not only the meaning of the day sign and numeral, but also the general context of the current Trecena \n• Sophisticated, beautifully rendered glyph, number and deity graphics \n• The well-known Mayan Calendar Portal Tzolkin calendar rings, in full dynamic, interactive mode \n• Explanation of the nature, meaning and purpose of the sacred Tzolk’in, including listings of the 20 day signs and 13 numbers in both Yucatec and K’iche’ Maya \n• A calculator to convert Gregorian (Western) dates into Tzolkin dates \n• Full descriptions of the 20 sacred day signs and the 13 numbers, based on the traditions of the Maya of Guatemala \n• Full descriptions of the 13 deities associated with the thirteen numbers \n\nWhile other apps generally take their day sign, number and “energy of the day” descriptions from various non-Maya sources, the “Energies of the Day” in our app are based on authentic interpretations and practices of the Tzolkin that have been made available to us by the Maya of the Guatemalan highlands and Maya scholars with long years of experience living and working with the Maya. \n\nBACKGROUND \nSince ancient times, the Maya have used the 260-day Tzolkin as their personal astrological calendar. Incredibly accurate regardless of culture, race, gender, faith, or ethnicity, the Tzolkin remains, to this day, profoundly relevant to the human experience—including our modern lives and lifestyles. Unlike the now-defunct Long Count calendar whose latest cycle ended on 12.21.2012, and whose original usage and meaning has been completely overrun by popular notions of doomsday scenarios, the sacred Tzolk’in is a deeply personal astrological calendar. \n\nPRAISE \nCheck out what people have been saying about the Energies of the Day since the very first day we published them: \n\n~ THANK YOU! You speak right from the bottom of my soul. This is exactly what I've been going through lately... \n~ Thank you so much for the insight. I always start my day here :) \n~ Wow, the sync that this post has today with me, [is] completely relevant to my situation. I really enjoy your posts MCP … this is amazing info! \n~ This is so accurate it's scary some days... and I don't believe in zodiac and horoscopes and stuff like that usually. \n~ I got chills reading this… something is VERY on point here... \n~ I would just like to say thank you for the effort and energy that you extend to putting these [energies] together for our benefit at this cycle in time of our existence. \n\n\nThe Mayan Calendar Portal and all of its properties, including the MCP Mayan Tzolkin mobile application, are produced by LUCITÀ Inc."

      "label": "Necrophone Pro is a real ghost app designed specifically for spirit communication and paranormal research. This spirit box contains a preloaded soundbank with a large variety of words, similar to ghost tube.\n\nNew features in the ghost box include white noise, reverb and echo. This ITC ghost hunting app has a very creepy vibe, and gives good results whilst trying to communicate with the dead.\n\nThe sound bank files use a the full range of low, mid and high frequencies making it much easier for communication with the dead.\n\nOur real ghost app contains full and partial words in English at varying quality levels. And partial words in other languages. Sample partial phonetic words include things such as bi, bo, um, ye, na.\n\nOur spirit box may sound similar to other ghost hunting tools such as Necrophonic, Paratek ghost box, DeadWave spirit box and Ghost Tube.\n\nThe white noise background in our real ghost app can be turned on and off, and the background is a moving video to give a creepy and spooky vibe to get you in the mood for your ghost hunting app.\n\nIf you want to record your spirit box session you can use a separate EVP recorder or ghost tube with it. Or use with an EMF meter to detect any electrical spikes while using Necrophone ghost hunting tools to communicate with the spirits. Or an SLS camera, like ghost tube to be able to see them as well.\n\n*No Advertisements\n*No Popups\n*No Subscriptions\n*No In App Purchases\n*Lifetime Use\n\nQUICK TIPS: Never go out alone, especially in abandoned places, always take a friend or family member to stay safe when using ghost hunting tools. Ensure you choose a location which is known to be haunted. As no real responses will come through if there are no spirits. Only randomly generated words. Always be polite to the spirits and don't challenge them whilst using ghost hunting tools.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This ghost hunting app picks words at random from the word bank. It is believed that ghosts are able to manipulate electrical devices, and may be able to override the words which the ghost box picks. But there is no guarantee or scientifical evidence to prove this. So please use our real ghost app at your own risk.\n\n\nHow to get the most from your ghost hunting tools\n\n1. Before using your ghost hunting app, picked a haunted place. No real ghost app will work if there are not any ghosts in the location you are at. First find a haunted location, which will dramatically increase the chances of getting replies from your ghost app or spirit box.\n\n2. Once you have picked your haunted location, take some friends or family members with you to ensure your safety whilst using your real ghost app. Using your real ghost app and ghost box is always more fun with friends.\n\n3. Once you arrive at the haunted place, say hello to the spirits and introduce yourself before using your ghost hunting tools. Treat spirits like people, they will be much more likely to respond if you are polite to them. Once ready, you can start your real ghost app session. Start your ghost box and ask if any spirits are there. Once you start getting intelligent responses from the ghost app or spirit box, you can start documenting your evidence.\n\nYOUR GHOST BOX AND SPIRIT BOX CAN BE VERY HELPFUL COMMUNICATION WITH THE OTHER SIDE. But you also need to increase your chances be ensuring spirits are there, and you are polite to them. Don't just ask the same repetitive questions, think of something new, original and engaging."

Use at your own risk.\n\nInstrumental TransCommunication (ITC) is the technique of contacting spirits using electronic devices to capture images and voices. Spiritus Ghost Box is an audio and visual ITC tool that combines the latest in ITC research and development. This application has the ability to contact and communicate with intelligent entities on the \"other side\". Audio manipulation of sound banks has been a proven means of communication with spirit. Enhancements to this communication have also came in the form of audio effects such as reverb and echo. Reverb for instance is known for creating a spacious sound that in return allows spirit a more optimum environment for audio manipulation. This app incorporates new and experimental ideas in visual ITC and features other functions, effects, and properties to possibly further enhance this communication. \n\nFeatures:\n4 channel sound bank\nEcho, Reverb, Phaser, and Filter audio effects\nIntensity Scan feature that affects the 4 channels, all effects, and the visual ITC.\nLight and Dark Ambience to set the mood before, during, or after a session.\nVisual ITC feature uses a particle system that is designed for spirit to manipulate visually."

      "label": "The Ghost EVP/EMF Radio has been developed for exciting paranormal detection and exploration. We've put a lot of effort into making the app easy to use, so that both professional and enthusiast paranormal researchers, ghost hunters and ghost tour organizers can enjoy the experience.\n\nIf you are either easily frightened, a super skeptic \"left brainer\" or have a serious heart-related medical condition, you are probably better off avoiding this app.\n\nElectronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) is the collective name for the sounds sometimes detected on electronic recordings and reminiscent of human speech. These sounds are usually found in recordings with noise or poor radio reception and are considered by many to be the voices of paranormal beings such as ghosts, spirits, demons and other energy based entities. EVP is a form of Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC), a term coined by professor Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s.\n\nThis app has taken the traditional ghost box to the next level. As with traditional ghost boxes, chaotic noise seems to be both inviting and sensitive to paranormal manipulation. The app generates audible speech by detecting meaningful phrases and words together with properties such as gender, age and the current mood of the communicating entity. We continuously improve the app, based on user feedback, and use it during our own paranormal investigations as well.\n\n*** Features ***\n* Radio Control Panel where you control the radio in real-time.\n* Brownian, Pink and White Noise generators.\n* Electromagnetic Field Meter using the Magnetometer sensor of your device.\n* Multiple graphical themes for the user interface.\n* Record your encounters with or without the microphone of your device.\n* Real-time audio visualization: Oscilloscope, Spectrometer, Voicegram and Waveform (tap to toggle).\n* Text log screen: The persistent text log is where you can sort, share and delete your log.\n* Quick text log: Tap on the main TV screen to toggle between the different view modes.\n* Open your EVP recordings in compatible audio apps with the touch of a button.\n* Optional Auto Recording which only produces recordings when something interesting is encountered.\n* Optional vibration (iPhone only) and audible alarms every time an entity has been detected.\n* Share your recordings with friends and family.\n* Upload your recordings to your Dropbox.\n\nPlease note that the app will degrade gracefully to Performance mode when running on older hardware, which means that some features may not be available or limited when running on, for example, the iPad 2 or the iPhone 4S.\n\n\n*** Languages ***\nEnglish (US/UK), Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Latin, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\n\n*** Support ***\n* For support, feedback and more information, please visit https://paranormalsoftware.com/support, or use the buttons on the Settings screen.\n* Knowledge Base: https://paranormalsoftware.com/support/kb\n* Twitter: @GhostRadioEVP\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ghostevpradio\n* Mailing list: http://tiny.cc/ghostradiomail\n\n\nWe hope that you, like many others, will be fascinated by the paranormal experience of Ghost EVP Radio. Thanks for downloading!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nEvery effort has been made to make this app truly unique, but we can offer no guarantee that you will get specific results by using it. Since the results of this app haven't been scientifically verified, it should only be used for entertainment purposes. Please use it responsibly."

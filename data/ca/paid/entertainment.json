Explore the colorful and electrifying world of science and meet all 118 of the elements from the periodic table. \n\nDiscover elements by experimenting with the lab tools! \n\n* Take your element for a spin in the centrifuge.\n* Warm them up in the Bunsen burner. \n* Put the element on ice with the cooling agent! \n* Add a drop or two of mysterious liquids from the test tubes.\n* Change their voltage and make them magnetic with the oscilloscope.\n\nEach element has it's own personality. In Toca Lab: Elements, what does Neon sound like? Is Gold heavy or light? Is Nitrogen squishy or hard? Explore, inspect, and study each one and let us know! Can you find all 118? \n\nThe time has come, future scientists, to head into the lab to explore and discover. Put on your lab coat and protective eye gear because things are about to get experimental!\n\nToca Lab: Elements is a place for playing and having fun, and with it we hope to inspire kids to explore science.

It differs from other apps and devices in its use of a unique, proprietary story engine which produces meaningful, simple sentences in addition to single words.\n\n• The same great app seen on CNET, in the Huffington Post, The Daily Mail Online, and USA Today, totally rewritten and modernized.\n\nAdded Features:\n• New! All of the former add-on features of the original version are now included as part of the base price.\n• New! Screensaver mode when running the app for extended periods of time. \n• New! Totally reimagined particle visualizations.\n• New! Stealth Skin\n• New! Dark theme backgrounds in the History and Features screens\n• New! Frequently Asked Questions section\n\nSame great features:\n• Running list of results is saved automatically.

Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved"

Use the search bar to quickly find your minifigures by unique ID, name, or set number. You can swipe between minifigure entries to easily update your collection! Each minifigure page provides all the relevant information you need to know. Saving the best for last, exclusive to the LSW Collector app is a section dedicated to more obscure variants! Entries for all minifigures made from 1999 to current are included and are added in real time which means you don't have to wait for an update to check them off. We promise to continue to update with the newest minifigures so that you can continue expanding your collection! \n\nLSW Collector is an unofficial mobile application for all collectors of LEGO Star Wars minifigures. Made by a collector for collectors!\n\nCapabilities:\n\nEach entry contains all of the important information about the minifigure including detailed images, unique ID, year of release, and in which sets it can be found. Swiping left and right allows you to see both the front and back of the minifigure. Clicking on the sets box shows exactly which sets a minifig comes from! LSW Collector allows you to 'check off' minifigures you already have and add the ones you don't to your wanted list. The green check mark allows you to easily see which minifigures you already have from the main view while the 'WANTED' symbol indicates which figures you are still chasing. Alternatively you can ignore figures that you don't want to have in your collection by tapping on the hide button at the bottom of the screen. You can revisit these figures any time by clicking the hide button on the main page. The Price Guide feature allows you to check the average selling price for each minifigure and can be used as an estimation for your own buying/selling purposes. You can also add multiple of the same minifigure to your collection and then track your total progress on the My Collection tab.\n\nLegal Information:\n\nLEGO and the minifigure are registered trademarks of the LEGO Group.\n\nSTAR WARS is a registered trademark of Lucasfilm, Ltd.

      "label": "In the modern age, paranormal investigators use many tools to communicate with spirits. Ouija Boards, Spirit Boxes, radios and apps are just a few of the many tools they use but cultures have been using tools to communicate with spirits for ages. \n\nCleromancy, the practice of contacting divine truth via random castings of dice (or bones) stretches back before recorded history. Astragalomancy, is a form of divination that uses dice marked with letters. In fact, many ancient cultures have various forms of dice divination.\n\nNecro Dice is a modern version of this ancient practice. This app means to combine the ancient and modern forms of communication in a completely new and unique way. Users seeking answers or messages can roll the dice with a simple tap of the screen. Once the user’s intention has been cast through the rolling of the dice, it is up to the spirits to communicate by influencing the randomization of letters to form words. This phenomenon of spirit communication through the manipulation of electronic devices has been well documented for several decades.\n\nNecro Dice functions by generating a handful of dice with random letters assigned to each of the six faces of each dice. These dice are then simulated with an advanced physics engine that handles dice to table and dice to dice collisions. When the physics simulation completes and the dice settle the result is a jumble of letters shown on the top face of the dice. Normally when using dice, the user is then required to inspect the dice to try and find words in this jumble of letters. This app uses a proprietary algorithm to inspect the top faces of the dice and try to match words and names to a dictionary. A word is chosen from the jumble of letters based on many factors including distance, length, location and relevance. Once a word is detected in the dice,  the app will highlight the individual letters on the dice and display the word on the screen. A list of words rolled since the start of the app can be accessed in the word log by pressing the button at the lower left of the screen.\n\nRolling dice isn’t just for games, do the spirits have a message for you?"

Help him dig up stuff to sell (60+ unique diggings) in a race against the clock to pay the mortgage and save the farm (campaign mode).  \n\nIn addition there are 4 mini-game challenge matches, plus open-ended free play mode, offering hours of game play.\n\nManage fuel, temperature, and damage while searching for diggins.  Sell them at the farmhouse to earn cash.  Save cash to pay the mortgage, upgrade your digger, or make repairs.  Use the on-screen “analog” joystick, or touch-screen to control digger movement.

If Mary’s ghostly image appears you could end up being trapped in the mirror with her for all eternity.\n\nThe Game\n\nTap the flickering lights to turn them off then touch the center of the pentagram to begin. Watch as Mary begins to develop a pattern sequence along the five points of the pentagram. Match Mary's pattern then tap the pentagram center to continue. \n\nCorrectly matching a complete sequence lights a candle, but making a mistake dies one out! Touch the mirror’s pentagram with three candles lit to confirm your belief and summon Mary… IF YOU DARE!!!\n\nCompleting a three candle sequence without making any mistakes automatically increases the mirror's difficulty level.\n\nHell Mary an on Edge Studios spin on a classic memory game.\n\nFeatures:\n-Animated 3D Graphics\n-Subtle Spooky Sound Effects\n-Tap the Book for Instructions and Version info"

      "label": "DeadBox is a Ghost Hunting App for communicating with spirits. It's similar to the Spirit Box and Ghost Box, you ask questions and look for intelligent and relevant responses to your questions. You should pick a location that is haunted, as ghosts need to be there to be able to respond. Be polite and treat with spirits with respect, as they were living people once, and being kind and friendly will increases your changes of them responding.\n\nThe Ghost Hunting App DeadBox has a built-in dictionary of words, which are picked at random. It is believed spirits and ghosts are able to manipulate electronic devices, and can override the app and pick words themselves. If you are getting random responses to your questions, there may be no spirits around at the time. Or they may not wish to communicate. Try again at another time or a different location. Just like when communicating with a Spirit Box or Ghost Box, think of engaging questions.\n\nDead Box is similar to the Ovilus and Paratek, but with a different and more relevant set of words. And we have given the app a creepy vibe and feel to help make your ghost hunting experience more exiting. There are no advertisements, no instore purchases, and your can change the scan speed. There is a history page so you can view previously picked words, it shows the date and time they were picked."

After all, counting by finger is funny but absolutely an impossible mission. So I came up with the idea of developing an app that would do it for me. Finally we've developed a reliable and one-of-its-kind algorithm for freckles detecting and counting. We would like to share this sunny app with you.\nNow you can also count freckles with “Freckle tracker” app on your face or on a one of your relatives, than share the results with your friends and invite them to do the same thing. \n \nSo easy it works: \n \n1. You have a choice either to pick an image of a person with freckles out of your smartphone gallery or to take a photo within the “Freckle tracker” app.\n2. Just after you pressed the \"count\" button, watch your freckles winking at you and discover how many of them you have. \n3. Afterwards, click the \"share\" icon and choose the way you want to send the results to your friends.\n4. Even if you don´t have any freckles, just be amazed playing the sunny game, guessing the number of freckles on other people faces.\n \nWe appreciate your ratings. And please don't hesitate to provide your hints and wishes on how we can improve our App. Send us your counting results, and we will with pleasure update our game library with your images.\n \nWe are pretty sure that after playing around with this app, at least a smile will appear on your face. \n\nDid we arouse your interest? Then download the app and click on \"?\" icon, to learn more about how to increase counting accuracy.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n******\nSchon seit langem war ich mit der Frage beschäftigt: Wie zähle ich die Sommersprossen auf der Nase meiner Tochter? Schließlich ist das Zählen mit dem Finger zwar eine lustige aber eben auch eine absolut mühselige Beschäftigung. Dann kam ich auf die Idee, eine App zu entwickeln, die es für mich erledigt. Am Ende haben wir es geschafft, einen zuverlässigen, einzigartigen Algorithmus zu entwickeln: dieser erkennt und zählt für Dich Sommersprossen. Diese sonnige App möchten wir mit Dir teilen. \n\nNun kannst auch Du Mithilfe der „Freckle tracker“ App Deine Sommersprossen und die Deiner Lieben zählen, die Zählergebnisse mit der Welt teilen und Deine Freunde dazu einladen, sich auch damit zu beschäftigen. \n \nSo einfach wird´s gemacht:\n \n1.  Du hast die Wahl, entweder ein Foto einer Person mit Sommersprossen aus der Galerie Deines Smartphones zu schnappen oder es direkt auf der „Freckle tracker“ App mit der Kamera aufzunehmen.\n2.  Sobald Du auf den \"count\" Button drückst, kannst du sehen wie Deine Sommersprossen Dich anblinzeln und gleich danach erfährst Du wie viele es sind.\n3.  Klicke auf das Symbol \"share\" und wähle aus, wie Du das Foto mit dem Zählergebnis an Deine Freunde senden möchtest.\n4.  Wenn Du keine Sommersprossen hast, dann lass dich einfach verzaubern und spiele das sonnige Spiel und rate die Anzahl der Sommersprossen auf Gesichtern anderer Leute. \n \nWir freuen uns auf Deine Bewertung sowie Anregungen und Vorschläge, wie wir unsere App verbessern können. Sende uns auch Deine Zählergebnisse, und wir erweitern unsere Spielbibliothek mit Deinen Fotos.\n \nWir sind ziemlich zuversichtlich, dass nach dem Rumspielen mit dieser App, sich ein Lächeln auf Deinem Gesicht zeigen wird. \n\nHaben wir Dein Interesse geweckt? Dann lade die App runter und klicke auf \"?\" Symbol um mehr darüber zu erfahren, wie Du die Zählgenauigkeit erhöhen kannst.\n\nViel Spaß beim Zählen!\n\n© Copyright 2019 Bantique´s production.

      "label": "Do you enjoy watching videos on your iPhone? Do you hate not being able to because your iPhone cannot support the video format? Or do you hate the inconvenient and time-consuming hassle of trying to convert video formats to fit into one that your iPhone can support? \nThis is why the AVPlayer was created. The AVPlayer can play almost any computer video file format such as AVI, Xvid, WMV and much more clearly and effortlessly. No converting hassles. Just copy files via USB and just drag and drop into the AVPlayer’s Media Explorer. \nThe AVPlayer can also support external subtitle files such as SMI and SRT. So if you enjoy watching videos on your iPad, then the AVPlayer is an absolute necessity. \n\n• Support Formats\n- Dolby Digital (AC3), Dolby Digital Plus (EAC3)\n- Support High quality video clips ( 720P, 1080P )\n- MP4,MOV,M4V\n- XVID,AVI,WMV,RMVB,ASF,H264,MKV… most of all movie file formats. \n- SMI, SRT, TXT, SubStationAlpha Subtitles \n\n• Post Processing \n- High quality video processing \n- Contrast,Saturation,Brightness \n- TV-Out \n\n• Control the playback speed (From 0.5X to 2.0X) \n- User setting support \n- Sweep to the left : move to backword 10 sec \n- Sweep to the right : move to forward 10 sec \n- Sweep to the top : 1.5X speed \n- Sweep to the down : normal speed \n\n• Additional features \n- Rotation Lock / Aspect ratio:auto/16:9/4:3/Full screen \n- Folder Management:Pass code/Move/Rename/Create \n- Resume play from last position \n- Scrubbing search \n- supports e-mail attachment by \"Open In\" feature \n\n• USB/WIFI Transfer \n\n• Note \n1. How to add video with USB \n- Run iTunes 9.1 or above \n- Device->My Device(My iPad)->Apps, drag and drop files to the AVplayer's documents \n\n2. Support High quality video clips ( 720P, 1080P )\n- High quality video clips of 720P (1280 x 720) or more are recommended for MP4 format. \n- MP4, MOV, M4V formats that QuickTime supports can be played up to 1080P by using H/W Decoder but, Post Processing function isn’t provided.\n- Support H/W decoding for MKV and AVI (720P supported on iPad1, 1080P supported on iPad2 / The New iPad)\n- Hybrid decoding mode is added and now it is able to play high resolution videos by using hardware accelerator feature embedded in iPhone/iPad even for mkv or avi in h264. Also battery use time has extended.\n- Application may crash in iPhone 3GS / iPod Touch due to heavy use of memory in Hybrid decoding. Try turning off all application running in background and reboot the device by holding down sleep mode button for long time.  \n- If screen shakes it means hardware decoding is not supported. Try turning off hybrid decoding.\n- When the file formats are available for MKV or AVI the player supports hardware decoding.\n- If you cannot choose audio in mp4 or avi, change the extension to mkv temporarily and chosen audio channel will be applied.\n\n3. The optimal speed when advancing its playing speed can differ depending on the way it’s compressed and the size. \nVideo clips of XVID (AVI) 720 x 480 can be fast played up to 1.3-1.5 times faster than normal."

With this app, you can listen to a variety of communicative sounds made by wolves! The classic wolf sound is a howl, bringing to mind images of a lone wolf howling at the moon on a cold night. But did you know that wolves often howl together in groups? Whether howling socially with their pack-mates or vocally defending their territory from a neighboring pack, wolf pups and adults alike love to use their voices to communicate!\n\nBoth educational and fun, there's lots to discover with this amazing wolf sounds app!"

It's truly immersive. \n\nHue Thunder provides an unique thunder simulation in various settings. Every time you start one of the ambiances it will be different and unpredictable. Al light effects have been precisely created and synced with thunder sound to create and impressive simulation with your Philips Hue setup. It will impress everyone.\nHue thunder can also be used to train pets to get used to thunder sounds and lightning flashes.\n\nOur unique node based soundscape engine, which is behind the beautiful designed and intuitive user interface, is truly innovative. It uses techniques which are used by top game designers and audio engineers to mimic nature's way and randomness. On top of that our soundscape apps use a unique and simple to use occurrence slider to let you decide how often a specific bird or other sound is used in the preset. Still it's totally unpredictable when a specific sound is being heard therefore producing an amazingly natural sound experience. It can run for hours on end without getting repetitive like other sound engines do. \n\nChoose from the following thunder presets and themes:\n\nThunder presets:\n- Light drizzle.\n- On a rainy day.\n- Heavy rain pours down.\n- Light thunder storm.\n- Inside the thunder storm.\n- Heavy thunder storm.\n- Tornado Alley.\n- Hurricane mayhem.\n\nThunder Ambient presets:\n- A damp rain forest.\n- At the beach after a warm day.\n- Staring out the window in a busy city.\n- A walk in the city under the umbrella.\n- Bad weather camping at the lake.\n- Storm over NYC.\n- After the storm.\n- In the car.\n- Bike ride through Amsterdam.\n\nThe following elements can be altered during playback:\n- Sky brightness.\n- Sky On/Off\n- Thunder brightness.\n- Thunder occurrence.\n- Environment volume.\n- Thunder volume.\n\nOther features:\n- Bluetooth and Airplay supported with delay compensation.\n- Sleep timer to safely fall asleep with a stormy fading background. Lights turn off after sleeptimer is finished.\n\n (Hue Thunder also works without Philips Hue, but obviously without light effects)."

You can live out movie fight scenes WITH AN AI! Then it started doing things I didn't know it could do... like *kisses hard* or *hurls you into fan*... yep it gets intense. No joke this is the real deal and it is awesome.\" 4th Jul 2010\n\n \n\n \nCleverbot is Artificial Intelligence. It learns what people say, in context, and imitates.\n\nCleverbot says many things - claiming to be human, role-playing and much more. It may even say things you find inappropriate. Use with discretion and at your own risk.\n \nCleverbot is conversational entertainment - no more, no less. It is not made to be logical, give advice, or be useful. Parents must decide whether they wish young people to have access. Be sure of this, however: it is a bot. It is software. You will never talk to a human."

Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory.

Thanks to the magnetometers present in the latest generation mobile phones *, you too can try your hand at researching variations in the electromagnetic field.\n\nIts functions are similar to those of a KII but enhanced for use on a smartphone. The more the electromagnetic field variations will be strong, the more the LEDs will light up to red.\n\nREM:\n\nThe Rem is an electronic device that allows you to receive answers to your questions.\n\nThe Rem has a built-in word database. Whenever a considerable variation in electromagnetism is recorded, the amplitude and intensity values ​​are combined to select a word from the reference database.\n\nThe first screen will show the word while the second will record the electromagnetism variations that caused the selection of that word.\n\nBLACK BOX:\nThis fantastic instrument perceives random chaotic noise and connects to a phonetic database from which it is possible to listen to the formation of words divided into syllables. Ask your question and listen to the answers that will come. Try to understand the words that will come out by joining the single phonemes.\n\nINFO ON OPERATION:\n\nTo test m1 just enter M1 function and approach an electrical socket or an electronic device on and the instrument will immediately show a change in magnetism.\n\nThanks to an algorithm developed by Team Pit, the App creates a triangulation between the three magnets inside the latest generation mobile phones to accurately calculate the magnetic anomalies in the environment.\n\n*ATTENTION*\n\nIn older mobile phones without the 3 magnetometers now used in most mobile phones, the app will not work properly and the M1 will light up with just the movement of the mobile phone. This is because it will simulate a compass and give false positive answers to just the movement of the mobile. \""

Experience car tracks in full 3D, complete with supporting structures, dramatic lighting, acceleration physics, landscapes, sound, and quaternion based construction. Add an extremely quick and powerful track editing system, combined with a professional extreme-detail mode, and you have the complete package. Ride any of the pre-made tracks included, in any of three view modes, your normal full screen mode, immersive stereographic mode, or a unique multiple viewport mode. Then create your own tracks, with the track builder, perhaps your favorite raceway, freeway, or just one from your imagination, the possibilities are endless. Tracks are built using more than a dozen easy to add track pieces, or, create your own custom piece using five slider controls in the advanced professional editor mode. In pro-mode, you have full control over the length, pitch, roll, alignment and heading of the piece, all live. After you have created your masterpiece, save it for the future, or just exit the editor and ride. Once you get the hang of editing, a complete track can be created in a few minutes.\n\nWarning! The intense immersive 3D stereographic mode makes this ride feels so real you may feel dizzy or nauseous. Enjoy! \n\n3D Stereographic modes do not require glasses, just a relaxed set of eyes and some practice.\n\nThree modes of operation and several tracks are included, however, you may create as many tracks as you like. The stereographic mode is our favorite since it makes the track seem so real, however, when docked, the fullscreen and viewport views are best. The viewport view wows you with the detail shown at multiple angles.\n\nFeatures:\nUnique, realistic track with supports and lighting.\nScenery with rolling landscapes, and sky domes.\nPhysics modeling for car speed.\nGraphical track selector with preview.\nMultiple displays, fullscreen, stereographic, and unique multi viewport.\nMultiple camera angles, bumper, trailing, helicopter, and overview.\nNo glasses required 3D stereographic view.\nHigh performance rendering library.\nUnique headlight for dramatic lighting. \nMultiple track colors and styles.\nQuaternion based track construction.\nEasy and professional track editing modes.\nInteractive controls for speed and head rotation.\n\nEditing tracks is extremely powerful, start with a simple or complicated example, delete (hit minus) any unwanted sections, scroll the pieces at the top until you see the full 3D preview of the piece you want to add, hit plus, then repeat until you are finished. If you get the ends close enough together, the track will automatically join and become continuous, otherwise your ride will just jump back to the beginning when it reaches the end, no problem. To enter Pro mode, just touch the \"i\" and select Pro Mode. All simple pieces may be edited in excruciating detail, with two stage sliders, or you can add blank pieces (hit plus) and make them do anything you want. Slide the timeline on the right to zip back and forth through the track. When finished, just touch the \"i\" again, touch save, rotate the preview as desired and touch save again. It will now show up in your track list. Fast and Easy!\n\nNotes: The Cross-Eyed stereographic animation is simply viewed by relaxing your eyes and focusing deep within the display, which will come to life in full 3D glory, just like you were actually there. Be mesmerized by a smooth ride on the track which appears to go deep into your display.\n\nNo glasses are required, the display happens to be a pleasing size to view these effects and you will be amazed. When viewed correctly, you will see three images, with the center one in stereo, then just watch and enjoy.\n\nWrite to us with your requests, we love to hear from you."

      "label": "In Tabula Mundi Tarot, the Fool’s Journey begins with a step into a wormhole, a rip in the fabric of space-time. Along the way, the Fool dances to the beat of the disc-jockey Magus, surfs with the Charioteer, and balances on a sword’s edge with figure-skating Adjustment.\n\nTabula Mundi Tarot is the work of The Rosetta Tarot’s creator, M. M. Meleen. Every card in Tabula Mundi Tarot remains faithful to the esoteric meaning of Aleister Crowley’s masterpiece, Thoth Tarot. However, Tabula Mundi is not at all a reworking of Lady Frieda Harris’ artworks for Thoth.\n\nTabula Mundi follows Thelemic philosophy and mirrors the structure of Thoth. Each card is painted according to the fourfold color scale developed by the adepts of the Golden Dawn, drawing on Alchemy, Astrology, and the Qabalah, often with an underlying sacred geometry grid.\n\nAs the Fool steps into the wormhole, he meets these modern interpretations of the Thoth archetypes, a vivid panorama of cognitive imagery. The Fool encounters the whole of creation with art that speaks to our time. Here are new inspiring images of the universal Tree of Life, updated for the discerning 21st century occultist.\n\n*Intuitive, elegant interface is easy for beginners and experts\n*Gorgeous full screen, high-resolution card images\n*Full support for all current iOS devices\n*Sophisticated journal\n*Includes full and unabridged book\n*20 spreads built in\n*Design your own layout with Free Form\n*Allow reversed cards or not\n*Option to use Major Arcana only\n*Zoom in to enlarge card details\n*Share reading via e-mail, Facebook, and Twitter\n*Animated shuffle & cut\n*Optional voice prompts\n*Customize with your own card meanings & reading cloths\n*Many adjustable settings\n*Book and card meanings available in English only\n\nHold the universe in your hands, with Tabula Mundi Tarot."

A dedicated Thumping app that does not require an internet connection.\n\nFrom Damian Surr, creator of “Card Now\" comes a new tool for magicians and mentalists.\n\nA 'thumper' is a secret device that can transmit information to a performer. Many devices are on the market. This is an app that turns the phone in your pocket into the thumping device.\n\nPlease Note:\nThis is not a copy of Greg Rostami's excellent SupaThump app! Greg's app does MUCH MORE than this app does. If you want all of the the features of SupaThump, this app does not attempt to provide them.\n\nHowever, this app does one thing that SupaThump can not do. It allows comunication without needifng an internet connection. You don't need wifi. You don't need 4G, 3G or any GPRS signal. You don't even need your assistant to have a phone. The signals we are using do not have to travel around the globe before being received, they are sent directly from the remote (Bluetooth device or another iPhone) to the performer's iPhone. This also make the signal incredibly quick!\n\nThis allows you to travel to anywhere in the world and know that the system will still work. Nothing to set up. No signal to worry about. You could perform in a bomb shelter. Using your iPhone as a Thumper device is now something that you know you can always use. No more getting to the performance and trying to find out if there's a reliable signal or not.\n\nDevices:\nSure thumper works on any device running iOS11 or above."

      "label": "On the 9th of January 2015, Mandy Len Catron published an essay in The New York Times describing her experience replicating a study that claims to accelerate intimacy between two people.\n\nPsychologist Dr Arthur Aron, author of the study, devised a series of 36 specific questions intended to be asked by each person to their partner. The questions begin rather tamely, and progressively get deeper and more personal. It can be difficult to open up to a person, especially a stranger, this experience forces both parties to open up and become vulnerable with one another.\n\nThe original study had a very interesting outcome. A man and woman, both complete strangers at the time entered a room separately. Both took part asking and answering a series of questions, ending the experiment by staring silently into each other's eyes for four minutes. The outcome? Six months later, the two participants were married!\n\nTo play the quiz with your partner, you really don't need anything more than this app. Sit opposite your partner with your device between you. Take turns reading one question aloud to your partner, then both of you answer. Simple, but terrifying!\n\nThere is no time limit, be honest and be truthful. The final recommended task is to stare silently into your partners eyes for four minutes. Nervous yet?"

      "label": "You’ve discovered the Original and World Famous iFart® App.  An Apple All-Time TOP 20 App.  The definitive Fart Sounds app on iTunes.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\nFeatured on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, The Today Show and many others, iFart® is considered the most infamous app of all time. \r\n\r\nAlso seen in the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, MSNBC.com, MacDailyNews, MacForums, The New York Times, Barron's, Motley Fool, Gizmodo, Venture Beat, Ars Technica, CNET News, Geek.com, Forbes, The UK Register, Information Week, TechCrunch.com and dozens of publications all over the world!\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\niFart® took the app world by storm in 2008. It blasted to #1 on Christmas Day of that year and clinged to number one for weeks. It continued to linger in the Top Ten for over a year! \r\n\r\nWe can’t even tell you how much time it spent farting around at #2.\r\n\r\nThe App has been completely recoded and rebuilt for 2021.   \r\n\r\nHere are just a few of the useful, signature features of iFart®.\r\n\r\n* SECURITY FART *\r\n\r\nPhones and pdas are stolen on a daily basis, but if you are using iFart's advanced security system you can stop criminals right in their tracks.\r\n\r\nAnd when thieves try to snatch your phone, they'll be in for a shock when they're blasted by your chosen sound effect. Most criminals know how to lie, but \"it wasn't me\" isn't going to work with iFart.\r\n\r\nCall the authorities and send these phone stealing scumbags off to the gas chamber.\r\n\r\n* SNEAK ATTACK *\r\n\r\nThe sneak attack function can literally save your life. Let's say that you're in a warehouse gun battle. Bad guys are closing in on you, but if you only had a distraction, you could escape.\r\n\r\nSneak Attack is that distraction. Simply pull out your phone, choose a sound effect and set the timer up to 30 seconds. Then place your phone in a strategic location and move silently away. When the Sneak Attack goes off, slip away or take out the bad guys when they reach for their noses.\r\n\r\n* RECORD-A-FART *\r\n\r\nThere are special moments in life that just have to be captured on your phone to be believed. \r\n\r\nThe birth of a child, a stunning sunset, bigfoot, and of course, the after effects of a triple burrito lunch.\r\n\r\nUsing iFart’s \"Record-A-Fart\" feature you can now make audible memories for a lifetime and play them for friends and family. Plastic wrap optional.\r\n\r\n* FAVE FARTS *\r\n\r\nUsing our FAVES feature you can create a playlist of your fave farts for easy access. You can also record and rename multiple farts which are stored in the FAVES list.\r\n\r\n* BLAST *\r\n\r\nIf only there was an internationally recognized sound that alleviates stress, brings laughter, lowers blood pressure, clears a room, helps bring peace to the middle east and is enjoyed by both Democrats and Republicans.\r\n\r\nWell Folks... just hit the BLAST button and let the healing begin. \r\n\r\n\r\n* BONUS FART PACKS*\r\n\r\niFart includes EIGHT of our funniest Fart Packs, each pack contains up to 10 fresh cuts for your enjoyment.\r\n\r\n* Jurassic -  Ever wonder what a Dinosaur fart sounds like?.\r\n\r\n* Presidential -  Joe, Kamala, Bernie, Hillary, & Donald let em rip!\r\n\r\n* Fart Wars - May the Flatulence Be With You\r\n\r\n* Movies  - In a world without gas… this is a land that prays for a hero.\r\n\r\n* Bands  - The bands on the runs with these farts.\r\n\r\n* Food  - You can't have dessert until you play all these farts.\r\n\r\n* Shart Toppers   - Music Parody Rips \r\n\r\n* Celebrities  - Sorry Kanye, you didn't make the cuts.\r\n\r\nHey, you read this far!    \r\n\r\nWe've added a bonus fart to our wheel called \"Fart-O-Rater\".  \n\nMake sure you play it and while you're laughing leave us a review and let us know your what your favorite fart or fart pack is today!"

Play with 5x5 bingo cards.\n90 balls: Standard Housie. Play with 3x9 housie cards.\n\nOnce you set the bingo type, you just have to roll the 3D bingo machine. \nMore fun way to play with iPhone/iPod Touch is, pass \"BINGO!\" to each of the members and let everyone have chance to roll it!\n\nIf anyone claims bingo, tap Master Board to check the numbers. For the accuracy and convenience, this record remains until the game ends. \nEven if one of your friend accidentally quits the app, don't worry. The record still remains.\n\nWhat about the bingo card?\n\"BINGO!\" does not have bingo card feature, because it's difficult to ask everyone to have iPhone/iPod Touch for bingo card app. So here's our suggestion:\n\n1. Buy bingo cards at party store.\n\n2. Download FREE bingo cards from our website.\nhttp://www.valup.co.jp/iphone/Bingo/index-en.html\n\n3. Make your own bingo card by hand.\nFor bingo 25: Draw 3x3 squares and randomly fill the numbers 1-25.\nFor bingo 75: Draw 5x5 squares, fill the numbers 1-75. Leave center for FREE.\n\nIf you have time, you can even prepare some prizes to make it more exciting.\nGood luck and have fun!"

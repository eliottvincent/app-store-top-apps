      "label": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory.

Ever wanted to try painting your masterpiece but were put off by the mess and expense? Now you can!\n\nArtRage isn't just about color: It knows how much paint you've used so you can smear it around to spread it over the canvas. It knows how wet your paint is so you can blend it with other paints. It even knows about the roughness of your paper so your pencils can be used for soft shading.\n\nIt's not just a special effect either - ArtRage is a live simulation of the properties of real artistic media that lets you can get creative with colors and textures using tools you already know how to use!\n\nArtRage takes full advantage of the features of your device like larger canvases on iPad Pro, Apple Pencil support for pressure & tilt, and 3D touch on your iPhone.\n\nJoin the ArtRage community:\nForums: forums.artrage.com\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/artrage\n\n\nFeatures:\n\nReal world painting tools: Oils, Watercolors, Paint Rollers, Pencils, Crayons and more. Each tool has a range of familiar properties such as how much thinner is applied to the paint, or how soft a pencil tip is. Tools apply texture as well as color, and blend under the brush.\n\nAdd Layers to your painting and work on individual elements without damaging others. ArtRage supports a wide range of Layer Blend Modes, and layer contents can be scaled moved and rotated independently.\n\nImport images, converting them to oil for smearing or as Reference Images pinned to the canvas as a visual guide. Load photos as Tracing Images which are overlaid on the canvas, and have ArtRage select colors automatically as you paint.\n\nThe interface has been designed to maximize your creative space without hiding away critical functions such as tool and color selection. As you paint, it gets out of the way so that you don’t have to stop and manually adjust panels.\n\nRecord your paintings! The ArtRage Script system lets you record strokes while you paint for playback in desktop versions of the product at higher resolution.\n\nImport and Export using external services such as Dropbox, and iCloud Drive. Share your images on Facebook, Twitter, and any other sharing app on your device.\n\n\nTools:\n\n• Oil Brush, Watercolor, Airbrush, Palette Knife, Paint Roller, Paint Tube, Inking Pen, Pencil, Marker Pen, Chalk, Crayon, Glitter Tube, Gloop Pen, Eraser, Flood Fill.\n\n• Paint simulation monitors the physical properties of your paints to allow natural blending, smearing, and other real world behavior.\n\n• Preset support to save your favorite settings for later use.\n\n• Supports the Apple Pencil's Pressure and Tilt properties, and 3D Touch where available to add realism to the simulated paint strokes.\n\n\nLayers:\n\n• Unlimited layers with Photoshop standard blend modes, visibility and opacity controls. Scale, rotate, and position layer contents independently.\n\n\nUtilities:\n\n• Record your paintings as Scripts then play them back in a desktop version of ArtRage.\n\n• Unlimited Undo / Redo. Load photos as References or Tracing images. Store color samples for later use.\n\n\nFiles:\n\n• Create paintings up to 2048 x 2048 or 4096 x 4096 on iPad Pro.\n\n• Control the texture and color of the canvas to create different effects. Canvas presets can be stored to save your favorite settings for later.\n\n• Export PTG, JPG or PNG to services such as Email, iOS11 Files, Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox, and more. Share images on Facebook or Twitter. Import photos to a new file or a layer, with camera support.\n\n\nInterface:\n\n• Easy access pods provide functionality without getting in the way. Elements vanish as you paint so you can paint underneath. Multi-Touch shortcuts for canvas manipulation, Undo/Redo, and Brush Size.\n\n• Adapts to suit iPhone layouts.\n\n\nStylus & Input Support:\n\n• Apple Pencil Pressure & Tilt.\n• Supports 3D Touch.\n• Includes support for Wacom, Adonit, Adobe, and Pogo styluses."

Because of this it is recommended that you turn on your camera's torch light if you are scanning in dark areas.\n\nYou can also snap photos of what you catch to share with your friends or other investigators.\n\nJoin our group chat to discuss ghostly things with other users.\n\nIf things get a little spooky we recommend turning on some lights and taking a break from the app for a while. :)"

Mix red, yellow, blue to get every imaginable colour - your child will learn realistic paint mixing, then come up with your own masterpiece using a paw print or a standard brush.\n3) Mouse & Cheese - Memorize where the zones are to sneak mouse past little kitten over to the cheese. Or just have some laughs seeing what happens when little kitten catches the mouse!\n4) Bed Trampoline - Discover all little kitten's hidden tricks and moves!\n5) Animal Puzzle - Educational 'mix and match' funny animal combinations to earn biscuits that you can then feed to your little kitten.\n6) Feeding - Each time you play a mini-game you receive cat food snacks, children love feeding the little kitten and watching it licking its lips and purr after a good feed! \n7) Cat-in-the-box - Educational 'hand-eye coordination' mini-game \n8) Balloon Popping - can you discovered all the different shapes?!\n\nNot using any text menus, the game can be easily navigated by young children. Parents have the option to limit screen time for their kids: after a chosen time, the kitten gets tired and goes to sleep.\nLittle Kitten is a high-tech app - using the latest 3d animation technology to create the visuals, it also uses cutting edge programming to maximize the user experience on your apple device. Enjoy the premium quality content in this original app brought to you by Squeakosaurus.

Bitcoin (BTC) normally needs specialized equipment called ASIC because mining bitcoin is getting harder and therefore specialized equipment is being built for this purpose.  For normal casual people who just want to mine for fun this app is perfect.  The app runs 4 worker threads to mine bitcoin blocks and you can view the apps logs as it works to find valid blocks.  \n\nYou won't become a bitcoin millionaire with pool mining because of the slow hash rate of CPU mining but you do have a chance of scoring big in solo mining If you are lucky enough to find a block.\n\nDownload the app and see for yourself what all the hype is about!"

You can record videos of your messages and share them or save them to you camera roll. \n\nIt's based on a series of AR experiments that the authors Zach Lieberman and Molmol Kuo have been posting to Instagram over the last few months.   People kept asking, \"is that an app?\"  Now, together with our collaborator Design Indaba, which helped produce this, we're packaging some of these experiments into app and we hope you enjoy them!   \n\nThe app is designed by Richard The, with iOS help from Ying Quan Tan, Robby Kraft, and Peter Sibley\n\nNote the app now supports multi-lingual input."

Also has a limited record and playback function (nothing is saved)\n\nSpeedometer - Works off of the devices GPS to give you a nice speedometer.  \n\nPLEASE NOTE TO ENSURE PROPER OPERATION OF THE SPEEDOMETER. AFTER THE APP IS RAN FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THE SPEEDOMETER BUTTON IS ACTIVATED YOU MUST GOTO THE IPHONES SETTINGS APP AND DO THE FOLLOWING CLICK PRIVACY >LOCATION SERVICES>KR2000 THEN CLICK UNDER ALLOW LOCATION ACCESS \"WHILE USING THE APP\" THIS WILL ONLY HAVE TO BE DONE ONCE.  \n\n*****Watch App****\nComlink Replica with a Mabber Labs twist to it,  The Comlink is displayed on the watch with some cool animations.  There is also a K.I.T.T. and K.A.R.R. button for quick access to the mini spacemap.  This will allow buttons pressed to trigger sound effects on your iphone.  Great for parties or making someone think that your car is talking.\n\nThis app is not only great for K.I.T.T. and K.A.R.R. replicas but also great for a hand held simulator.  Its great as a companion on your desk at work, in your car on those long drives or any where else in your life that you may need K.I.T.T.\n\nWatch app has had some great new additions.  A second set of English phrases have been added to both K.I.T.T. and K.A.R.R.\nA German set of phrases has been added.  And Finally a set of sound effects have been added as its own set as well.\n\nThere will be plenty more updates available... In the future :)"

From design to execution, his apps are absolutely flawless. \nInertia Pro is a prime example of why I trust in his work so implicitly, it is jaw droppingly good and represents one of the most cutting-edge mentalism releases to date!”\n- Michael Murray\n\n\nPLUS - If you have Xeno, you can now create your own sites for use with Inertia Pro, or use any of the Xeno Sites available in the gallery.\n\nAnd... you can perform Inertia Pro with any Xeno site REMOTELY! This can all happen on the spectator's device, without you touching it.\nPerfect for Zoom shows or long-distance performances!\n\n\nThe Jerx wrote this about Inertia Pro:\n\n“You know those phone forces where you would hold the phone upside down and have them scroll blindly and whatever picture or item they landed on would be forced (usually because their scrolling wasn’t doing anything)?\n\nWell, this app allows you to do that type of force face-up while the spectator looks at the phone.\n\nIt’s so good and *feels* exactly like it should.”\n\n\n--- \n\nInertia is for entertainment purposes only, designed for professional performers. This app does not provide true mind reading abilities or anything similar.\n\nPlease get in touch to discuss TV or video performance rights."

Each card has an explanation to increase your spiritual growth and enlightenment. Your spirit animals can help you navigate your relationships and help bring balance and peace into your situations. Pick a card and unearth the deepest parts of your core existence. \n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEach animal is featured either slinking into the night or just coming into the light of day. Dawn and dusk are “neither here nor there” time frames. Each power animal is seen in these in-between worlds. This middle world is a powerful place to connect to animal guides, fairies, and spirit guides because the skin between Heaven and Earth is thinner just before dark and just before the first light of day. These animals are unafraid to take you into the underworld aspects of your soul’s development. There dwells the truth behind all matters concerning the human experience. They tell it like it is. \n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTotem animals or animal guides have been a part of our world since the dawn of man’s history. They guide us and speak to us still today. Discovering your animal guide or guides can help you learn to face and overcome challenges and to better understand how to communicate with the world around you. Animals are pure and truthful. They can help you admit your own truths and bring out your best qualities. This deck will help you invite other animal guides into your life, as well. They will pull out the hidden wisdom within your subconscious. Put your seat belt on, things are about to get bumpy!\n\nThis card deck is designed to guide you in answering some of life’s most-deepest and most personal questions. Each card focuses on a specific aspect of your life. With each card, you will see suggestions, answers, and guidance to lead you into the process of personal development and success. If you are serious about making life changes, living more consciously aware and progressing on a soul level, then these cards will get you there faster. \n\n\r\nIt will be important to take time out and let the cards speak to you on a deeper level before jumping into new questions. Allow time to process the information that comes to you. It takes time before coming into your full spiritual power."

It also rolls a six-sided die (and doesn't cheat). But best of all . . . once per game, you get a Boon . . . an in-game advantage to help you kill the monsters, steal the treasure, and stab your buddy. There are almost 150 different Boons, all illustrated by John Kovalic. The higher your level when you ask for your Boon, the better it's likely to be. And when you reach the winning level, it plays a fanfare. Your friends will hate you . . .\n\nBonus features include:\n• Kill-O-Meter screen to keep track of combat scores.\n• Counters for Chez Geek and SPANC (Space Pirate Amazon Ninja Catgirls) illustrated with art from the games.\n\nThis app is NOT a stand-alone game! It is a game aid for the Munchkin card games and Munchkin Quest board games by Steve Jackson Games. Munchkin is the dungeon experience . . . with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff.

Use the search bar to quickly find your minifigures by unique ID, name, or set number. You can swipe between minifigure entries to easily update your collection! Each minifigure page provides all the relevant information you need to know. Saving the best for last, exclusive to the LSW Collector app is a section dedicated to more obscure variants! Entries for all minifigures made from 1999 to current are included and are added in real time which means you don't have to wait for an update to check them off. We promise to continue to update with the newest minifigures so that you can continue expanding your collection! \n\nLSW Collector is an unofficial mobile application for all collectors of LEGO Star Wars minifigures. Made by a collector for collectors!\n\nCapabilities:\n\nEach entry contains all of the important information about the minifigure including detailed images, unique ID, year of release, and in which sets it can be found. Swiping left and right allows you to see both the front and back of the minifigure. Clicking on the sets box shows exactly which sets a minifig comes from! LSW Collector allows you to 'check off' minifigures you already have and add the ones you don't to your wanted list. The green check mark allows you to easily see which minifigures you already have from the main view while the 'WANTED' symbol indicates which figures you are still chasing. Alternatively you can ignore figures that you don't want to have in your collection by tapping on the hide button at the bottom of the screen. You can revisit these figures any time by clicking the hide button on the main page. The Price Guide feature allows you to check the average selling price for each minifigure and can be used as an estimation for your own buying/selling purposes. You can also add multiple of the same minifigure to your collection and then track your total progress on the My Collection tab.\n\nLegal Information:\n\nLEGO and the minifigure are registered trademarks of the LEGO Group.\n\nSTAR WARS is a registered trademark of Lucasfilm, Ltd.

Use with discretion and at your own risk.\n \nCleverbot is conversational entertainment - no more, no less. It is not made to be logical, give advice, or be useful. Parents must decide whether they wish young people to have access. Be sure of this, however: it is a bot. It is software. You will never talk to a human."

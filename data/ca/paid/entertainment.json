      "label": "This is the Original \"Spider on Hand\" app as seen on Youtube. Beware of imitations.\n\nDo you know anyone who is afraid of spiders? Everyone right? Then this is the perfect magic trick/prank for you.\n\nWatch the trailer video at http://www.mypetboris.com/trailer.htm\n\nMy Pet Boris app is the scariest app for the iPhone. Inspired by Jim Pace's magic trick \"The Web\" where a spider magically appears on the back of your spectator's hand. Bound to get amazing reactions.\n\nThe app uses the idea of \"Augmented Reality\" merging real life objects with computer generated graphics to create a truly frightening effect.\n\n\nTHE MAGIC SPIDER EFFFECT\nYou take a photo of the spectator's palm (secretly loading a plastic spider on the back of their hand) and place the phone on their palm to hold.\n\nYour Pet Boris - an Australian Red back spider (black widow) creeps onto the screen and they can feel the vibrations as it walks. You can tap the screen and even slide your finger into the animation to scratch the spider's back. Boris walks off the screen.\n\nYou tell them that the phone has special sensors that when you wave your hand over the screen it makes the spider come back. He does.\n\nYou get them to wave their hand over the phone. \nIt is just then that they glimpse a realistic spider clinging to the back of their hand and they FREAK OUT!!\n\nBound to get BIG reactions. \n\nFinger tone and size can be set to suit your own or you can import an image of your own finger. \n\nStart-up screen can be customised to suit your performance style. An actual  photo of their hand, solid white or any image from your library can be used as a background.\n\nNOTE: Requires a plastic spider or cockroach and adhesive dots to perform. You should be able to find these locally or you can purchase from our website.\n\nSee our website http://www.mypetboris.com for more details, spider and cockroach supplies and video presentation & instructions.\n\nLike our Facebook page to keep up to date with changes, tips and suggestions. http://www.facebook.com/MyPetBoris\n\n\nTHE MAGIC COCKROACH\nThe app also comes with a cockroach animation for those who think they are scarier than spiders.\n\n\nTHE MAGIC BUTTERFLY EFFECT - IN-APP PURCHASE - (for the Professional Magician)\n\nThe Magic Butterfly is an additional effect within the Magic Spider – My Pet Boris App. \n\nIt is enabled as an “in app purchase” for around US$2.99 depending on your local currency. The custom finger feature is also unlocked when you purchase the butterfly effect.\n \nThis is a perfect routine for those times when you want to perform a beautiful effect for a little girl or woman, leaving her with a magical gift at the end. You will get similarly strong reactions to the Magic Spider effect without the scare factor.\n\nPRESENTATION:\nThe magician simulates a grand illusion in the palm of the spectator’s hand. A tiny foil covered “Magical Egg” is placed in the palm of the spectator’s hand and then photographed. The phone is placed on their hand.\n\nThe egg transforms into a Chrysalis and then into a butterfly. The magician’s finger is seen to tickle the virtual butterfly on screen which then flies away. \nUsing a magical gesture the magician brings the butterfly back briefly before it flies off again.\n\nThe spectator is asked to try and make it return. When they try, they find a matching butterfly (in an impossible location) on the back of their hand. The original foil egg has vanished.\n\nTHE CARD REVELATION EFFECT - IN-APP PURCHASE - (for the Professional Magician)\n\nThe Magic Spider effect with the addition of a torn card corner revelation as a finale.\n\nAccessory packs and supplies are available at: http://www.mypetboris.com/store.htm\n\nSee our FAQ Section. http://www.mypetboris.com/faq.htm\n\nFull instructions at: (everything is explained)\nhttp://www.mypetboris.com/inst2099.htm.\n\nUse the password at the bottom of the \"CREDITS\" screen for access."

Like tuning a radio as \nthe dial moves you hear  short sound bits. \n\nBy scanning the ITC creates speech and \nspeech like sounds.  \n\nDigital dowsing has produced this type of \ndevice for several years now.  \nUsing the experience gained from actual \nhardware production, Digital Dowsing \nreproduces real world functions in this \niPhone,iPad application.  \n\nPlease don't purchase this application if \nyour expecting perfect results. \n\nThis is a tool for experimentation,\nnot a telephone.  \n\nResults will depend on effort  \ntime and patience. \nITC \" trans Instrumental Communications \" \nis not a science it's a method.   \n\nWill it work for you, The answer is no... \nIt will only work with you. \n\nThe method  is not a fortune teller. \nDon't expect answers to life. \nExpect the responses that  make \nyou laugh or challenge you Ideas \nand concepts of what is \nreally going on.\n\nBecause of the nature of this application \nit is offered for \nexperimnetal purposes only.\n\nThe Author of this software is the Inventor \nof the Paranormal Puck, OvilusTalker,\nEM Pump, Video Ovilus, PX, SLS and many other devices. \n\nFor more details please visit www.DigitalDowsing.com\n\nHow ITC works:\nITC uses files that are played for different \nlengths of time depending on settings, \nand started in different segments of the \nspeech based on the mode and inputs. \n\nIt is not possible to put the spoken words \non the screen, each word is built from many \ndifferent words or word fragments.\n\n\nFor more details please visit www.DigitalDowsing.com"

      "label": "*** Off Book! PRO is the AD FREE version of Off Book! for actors! ***\n\n** Please note: there is currently no way to import lines from the Free version of OffBook!, but I am working on a converter **\n\nOff Book! is an app designed by an actor for actors.  I perform regularly and designed this app for myself to assist in script memorization.  \n\nNew for version 4.0 - LineSync! will enable you to share your lines with other performers (available through in-app purchase)\n\nIt's really simple to use. You basically create your Works, Scenes, add Characters, and Record Lines! Should you accidentally record a 30+ line scene and realize that you have one of the lines out of order, you don't have to start over! Either hit the line \"plus\" signet insert a new line immediately after, or simply press on the offending line, and drag it to a new position! Voilà! You are all set.\n\nIf your scenes are out of order: same deal. Long press on the scene and move it to the position you like.\n\nOnce you are done recording the lines for the scene you wish to rehearse, tap on the rehearse icon and you are presented with the rehearse screen. From here you can choose to play through the entire scene, as well as mute/cue your line.  To mute your line, simply select the character you will be playing by tapping the \"down arrow\", and then clicking the \"Mute My Line\" switch so that it shows green.  The scene will play through and when it gets to your line, it will pause for the line length...giving you time to say it and wait for your next cue. The \"Cue My Line\" switch will cue the line for you by providing an audible \"ding\" immediately prior.\n\nPlease see the *INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS* in the app, or on my website, and if you have any neat feature requests or (gasp!) bug reports, please don't hesitate to contact me about them.\n\nPlease do NOT hesitate to contact me at the support web link listed here.   There is an email box there at the bottom of the page for you to mail me should you experience any bugs you may need fixed!\n\nEnjoy\n\n--Steve\n\n*************** PRO TIPS ***************\nFOR THE PEOPLE WHO SAY IT WON'T SAVE YOUR LINES: It is possible you did not accept the \"Let Off Book! have access to your Microphone\" permission.  If this is a first time install, just uninstall the app, and reinstall.  When the popup asks for permissions, approve them.\n\nAlternatively you can go into the iPhone settings, scroll down until you find the Off Book! app, click it, and ensure that the microphone switch is turned ON.\n\nTo DELETE Lines, Characters, Scenes, or Works: Simply swipe your finger from right to left on the entry and a \"Delete\" button will pop up.  Be careful with this, because if you delete a character in a work, you will also delete all of its Lines.\n\nTO REORDER Lines: (in case you have one out of order and don't feel like deleting and recording all over again) hold your finger down on the line you want to move and then drag it into the proper position.  You can see this demonstrated on the instructional videos I have included.\n\nFOR LONG SCENES: Where you will leave the iPhone unattended, set your sleep timer/auto lock to either off, or maximum length so the phone doesn't go to sleep while you're rehearsing! (I am currently working to see if there is a way around this)\n\nWagon Wheel - Electronic Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"

In Toca Lab: Elements, what does Neon sound like? Is Gold heavy or light? Is Nitrogen squishy or hard? Explore, inspect, and study each one and let us know!

      "label": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved"

There are almost 150 different Boons, all illustrated by John Kovalic. The higher your level when you ask for your Boon, the better it's likely to be. And when you reach the winning level, it plays a fanfare. Your friends will hate you . . .\n\nBonus features include:\n• Kill-O-Meter screen to keep track of combat scores.\n• Counters for Chez Geek and SPANC (Space Pirate Amazon Ninja Catgirls) illustrated with art from the games.\n\nThis app is NOT a stand-alone game!

Take a ride on the airplane, shoot some hoops, play hide & seek and bed trampoline or get creative with paw painting - you can always have a great time with your kitten pal! Explore the kitten's world and discover cute animations, laugh with and care for your adorable, realistic pet.\nThe unique game-design encourages children to explore the room with minimal use of icons or menus. The 7 mini-games offer a wide variety of interactions and are designed so they appeal to a wide age range. The philosophy is not about winning, losing or competition, it's about having fun in a child-friendly environment and learning without even realizing it! Great Mini-Games with purpose!:\n\nCompatibility: The App doesn't support iPad2, iPhone 4s, iPad Mini1, iPod5 with iOS9\n\n1) Kitten Hide&Seek - encourages focus and attention.\n2) Paw Painting - creativity unleashed! Mix red, yellow, blue to get every imaginable colour - your child will learn realistic paint mixing, then come up with your own masterpiece using a paw print or a standard brush.\n3) Mouse & Cheese - Memorize where the zones are to sneak mouse past little kitten over to the cheese. Or just have some laughs seeing what happens when little kitten catches the mouse!\n4) Bed Trampoline - Discover all little kitten's hidden tricks and moves!\n5) Animal Puzzle - Educational 'mix and match' funny animal combinations to earn biscuits that you can then feed to your little kitten.\n6) Feeding - Each time you play a mini-game you receive cat food snacks, children love feeding the little kitten and watching it licking its lips and purr after a good feed! \n7) Cat-in-the-box - Educational 'hand-eye coordination' mini-game \n8) Balloon Popping - can you discovered all the different shapes?!\n\nNot using any text menus, the game can be easily navigated by young children. Parents have the option to limit screen time for their kids: after a chosen time, the kitten gets tired and goes to sleep.\nLittle Kitten is a high-tech app - using the latest 3d animation technology to create the visuals, it also uses cutting edge programming to maximize the user experience on your apple device. Enjoy the premium quality content in this original app brought to you by Squeakosaurus.

(Start Player also comes in handy for determining who should pick up that check at dinner.)\n\nStart Player is based on a pack of cards with the same name created by Ted Alspach and featuring the characters from his award-winning Board2Pieces web comic.\n\nStart Player has four unique ways of choosing your start player:\n\n1. Card Start lets you determine the start player by drawing a random, virtual card that lists the zany criteria for choosing the start player. Want to choose the start player based on your street address or who bathed most recently? Then this is the choice for you!\n\n2. Spin Start lets you spin the big wheel of fortune and have fate decide for you.\n\n3. List Start is for the impatient among you. Dial in the number of players, hit the button, and just read the names off a randomly sorted list.\n\n4. Finger Start is like Russian Roulette without all that pesky blood. Everybody puts their finger on the device, someone pushes a button, and \"Hey! Presto!\" we have a new Start Player!\n\nIs it silly? Of course! Is it fun? Absolutely!"

      "label": "In the modern age, paranormal investigators use many tools to communicate with spirits. Ouija Boards, Spirit Boxes, radios and apps are just a few of the many tools they use but cultures have been using tools to communicate with spirits for ages. \n\nCleromancy, the practice of contacting divine truth via random castings of dice (or bones) stretches back before recorded history. Astragalomancy, is a form of divination that uses dice marked with letters. In fact, many ancient cultures have various forms of dice divination.\n\nNecro Dice is a modern version of this ancient practice. This app means to combine the ancient and modern forms of communication in a completely new and unique way. Users seeking answers or messages can roll the dice with a simple tap of the screen. Once the user’s intention has been cast through the rolling of the dice, it is up to the spirits to communicate by influencing the randomization of letters to form words. This phenomenon of spirit communication through the manipulation of electronic devices has been well documented for several decades.\n\nNecro Dice functions by generating a handful of dice with random letters assigned to each of the six faces of each dice. These dice are then simulated with an advanced physics engine that handles dice to table and dice to dice collisions. When the physics simulation completes and the dice settle the result is a jumble of letters shown on the top face of the dice. Normally when using dice, the user is then required to inspect the dice to try and find words in this jumble of letters. This app uses a proprietary algorithm to inspect the top faces of the dice and try to match words and names to a dictionary. A word is chosen from the jumble of letters based on many factors including distance, length, location and relevance. Once a word is detected in the dice,  the app will highlight the individual letters on the dice and display the word on the screen. A list of words rolled since the start of the app can be accessed in the word log by pressing the button at the lower left of the screen.\n\nRolling dice isn’t just for games, do the spirits have a message for you?"

      "label": "The Ghost EVP/EMF Radio has been developed for exciting paranormal detection and exploration. We've put a lot of effort into making the app easy to use, so that both professional and enthusiast paranormal researchers, ghost hunters and ghost tour organizers can enjoy the experience.\n\nIf you are either easily frightened, a super skeptic \"left brainer\" or have a serious heart-related medical condition, you are probably better off avoiding this app.\n\nElectronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) is the collective name for the sounds sometimes detected on electronic recordings and reminiscent of human speech. These sounds are usually found in recordings with noise or poor radio reception and are considered by many to be the voices of paranormal beings such as ghosts, spirits, demons and other energy based entities. EVP is a form of Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC), a term coined by professor Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s.\n\nThis app has taken the traditional ghost box to the next level. As with traditional ghost boxes, chaotic noise seems to be both inviting and sensitive to paranormal manipulation. The app generates audible speech by detecting meaningful phrases and words together with properties such as gender, age and the current mood of the communicating entity. We continuously improve the app, based on user feedback, and use it during our own paranormal investigations as well.\n\n*** Features ***\n* Radio Control Panel where you control the radio in real-time.\n* Brownian, Pink and White Noise generators.\n* Electromagnetic Field Meter using the Magnetometer sensor of your device.\n* Multiple graphical themes for the user interface.\n* Record your encounters with or without the microphone of your device.\n* Real-time audio visualization: Oscilloscope, Spectrometer, Voicegram and Waveform (tap to toggle).\n* Text log screen: The persistent text log is where you can sort, share and delete your log.\n* Quick text log: Tap on the main TV screen to toggle between the different view modes.\n* Open your EVP recordings in compatible audio apps with the touch of a button.\n* Optional Auto Recording which only produces recordings when something interesting is encountered.\n* Optional vibration (iPhone only) and audible alarms every time an entity has been detected.\n* Share your recordings with friends and family.\n* Upload your recordings to your Dropbox.\n\nPlease note that the app will degrade gracefully to Performance mode when running on older hardware, which means that some features may not be available or limited when running on, for example, the iPad 2 or the iPhone 4S.\n\n\n*** Languages ***\nEnglish (US/UK), Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Latin, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\n\n*** Support ***\n* For support, feedback and more information, please visit https://paranormalsoftware.com/support, or use the buttons on the Settings screen.\n* Knowledge Base: https://paranormalsoftware.com/support/kb\n* Twitter: @GhostRadioEVP\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ghostevpradio\n* Mailing list: http://tiny.cc/ghostradiomail\n\n\nWe hope that you, like many others, will be fascinated by the paranormal experience of Ghost EVP Radio. Thanks for downloading!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nEvery effort has been made to make this app truly unique, but we can offer no guarantee that you will get specific results by using it. Since the results of this app haven't been scientifically verified, it should only be used for entertainment purposes. Please use it responsibly."

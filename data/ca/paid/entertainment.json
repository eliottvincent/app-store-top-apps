Explore the colorful and electrifying world of science and meet all 118 of the elements from the periodic table. \n\nDiscover elements by experimenting with the lab tools! \n\n* Take your element for a spin in the centrifuge.\n* Warm them up in the Bunsen burner. \n* Put the element on ice with the cooling agent! \n* Add a drop or two of mysterious liquids from the test tubes.\n* Change their voltage and make them magnetic with the oscilloscope.\n\nEach element has it's own personality. In Toca Lab: Elements, what does Neon sound like? Is Gold heavy or light? Is Nitrogen squishy or hard? Explore, inspect, and study each one and let us know! Can you find all 118? \n\nThe time has come, future scientists, to head into the lab to explore and discover. Put on your lab coat and protective eye gear because things are about to get experimental!\n\nToca Lab: Elements is a place for playing and having fun, and with it we hope to inspire kids to explore science. While the periodic table in Toca Lab: Elements is accurate, the way new elements are created is not. Instead, it’s a fun way to experiment, discover and create curiosity in the world of science. Toca Lab: Elements is just a starting point for further exploration! \n\n***\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

      "label": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved"

      "label": "You’ve discovered the Original and World Famous iFart® App.  An Apple All-Time TOP 20 App.  The definitive Fart Sounds app on iTunes.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\nFeatured on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, The Today Show and many others, iFart® is considered the most infamous app of all time. \r\n\r\nAlso seen in the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, MSNBC.com, MacDailyNews, MacForums, The New York Times, Barron's, Motley Fool, Gizmodo, Venture Beat, Ars Technica, CNET News, Geek.com, Forbes, The UK Register, Information Week, TechCrunch.com and dozens of publications all over the world!\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\niFart® took the app world by storm in 2008. It blasted to #1 on Christmas Day of that year and clinged to number one for weeks. It continued to linger in the Top Ten for over a year! \r\n\r\nWe can’t even tell you how much time it spent farting around at #2.\r\n\r\nThe App has been completely recoded and rebuilt for 2021.   \r\n\r\nHere are just a few of the useful, signature features of iFart®.\r\n\r\n* SECURITY FART *\r\n\r\nPhones and pdas are stolen on a daily basis, but if you are using iFart's advanced security system you can stop criminals right in their tracks.\r\n\r\nAnd when thieves try to snatch your phone, they'll be in for a shock when they're blasted by your chosen sound effect. Most criminals know how to lie, but \"it wasn't me\" isn't going to work with iFart.\r\n\r\nCall the authorities and send these phone stealing scumbags off to the gas chamber.\r\n\r\n* SNEAK ATTACK *\r\n\r\nThe sneak attack function can literally save your life. Let's say that you're in a warehouse gun battle. Bad guys are closing in on you, but if you only had a distraction, you could escape.\r\n\r\nSneak Attack is that distraction. Simply pull out your phone, choose a sound effect and set the timer up to 30 seconds. Then place your phone in a strategic location and move silently away. When the Sneak Attack goes off, slip away or take out the bad guys when they reach for their noses.\r\n\r\n* RECORD-A-FART *\r\n\r\nThere are special moments in life that just have to be captured on your phone to be believed. \r\n\r\nThe birth of a child, a stunning sunset, bigfoot, and of course, the after effects of a triple burrito lunch.\r\n\r\nUsing iFart’s \"Record-A-Fart\" feature you can now make audible memories for a lifetime and play them for friends and family. Plastic wrap optional.\r\n\r\n* FAVE FARTS *\r\n\r\nUsing our FAVES feature you can create a playlist of your fave farts for easy access. You can also record and rename multiple farts which are stored in the FAVES list.\r\n\r\n* BLAST *\r\n\r\nIf only there was an internationally recognized sound that alleviates stress, brings laughter, lowers blood pressure, clears a room, helps bring peace to the middle east and is enjoyed by both Democrats and Republicans.\r\n\r\nWell Folks... just hit the BLAST button and let the healing begin. \r\n\r\n\r\n* BONUS FART PACKS*\r\n\r\niFart includes EIGHT of our funniest Fart Packs, each pack contains up to 10 fresh cuts for your enjoyment.\r\n\r\n* Jurassic -  Ever wonder what a Dinosaur fart sounds like?.\r\n\r\n* Presidential -  Joe, Kamala, Bernie, Hillary, & Donald let em rip!\r\n\r\n* Fart Wars - May the Flatulence Be With You\r\n\r\n* Movies  - In a world without gas… this is a land that prays for a hero.\r\n\r\n* Bands  - The bands on the runs with these farts.\r\n\r\n* Food  - You can't have dessert until you play all these farts.\r\n\r\n* Shart Toppers   - Music Parody Rips \r\n\r\n* Celebrities  - Sorry Kanye, you didn't make the cuts.\r\n\r\nHey, you read this far!    \r\n\r\nWe've added a bonus fart to our wheel called \"Fart-O-Rater\".  \n\nMake sure you play it and while you're laughing leave us a review and let us know your what your favorite fart or fart pack is today!"

No banners, no ads, no getting spam'd; just pure fart fun. It was even used on Conan O'Brien's show on TBS to create one of their segments.\n\nThese 27 farts will make you laugh, cry, and hopefully embarrass a few people. \n\nDon’t accept any substitutes. This is a great tool; with everything from the interface to the sounds being made for the true fart prankster. \n\nEach sound was meticulously remastered to cut out any background noises and made to be crystal clear. Other apps will throw in a few sounds littered with ugly background noises that aren’t true to the clarity of a real fart.\n\nThere is a “Help” page with easy to read instructions, as well as an email address for technical support and feedback. We promptly answer support requests and listen to any recommendations to help make this app even better!"

      "label": "We created a Sound and Light Scape system which is unpredictable (no looping sounds), highly customisable and versatile in it's setup. Hue Haunted House contains high quality audio effects with beautifully synced lighting to create the perfect eerie mood.\n\nHue Haunted House offers the following scary themes to choose from:\n\n- Creepy Cave\nDripping stones, scary bats and ferocious monsters haunt you while you wander through the corridors of this dark cave. Did you take the right turn 10 minutes ago? Sure you are not lost?...\n\n- Grisly Graveyard\nThis is definitely a place where you do not want to be. Zombies stray over this graveyard while rain and wind make you shiver. Or is it the fear in your body? A distant church reminds you you are not far from safety. But why can it's bell be heard so often and irregular? Isn't that odd? \n\n- Demon Dollhouse\nDolls are sweet aren't they? So you would say... This dollhouse is full of evil. So evil, It makes the small dolls cry. Or are they possessed as well? Something is very wrong, that's for sure.\n\n- Eerie Forest\nThis is a spine-chilling forest. Birds give the impression of some peace. But don't be fooled. Weird creatures also roam this place. Is that the wind in the trees you hear? Sounds of raven are never a good sign...\n\n- Frightening Pursuit\nYou're running but it seems you don't progress. What is it you flee from? Not knowing is the worst. But one thing is for sure. You don't want it to catch up with you, then you'll suffer the same faith as that poor little fluffy creature which wasn't fast enough.\n\n- Distressing Dungeon \nLocked up, nobody knows why. Damp and dark you scream for help but the only reaction you get is your own echo. Doors open and close, chains rattle around you. Nobody there to help you out. Will it end here?\n\n- Abandoned Fairground\nThis must be the weirdest place on earth. Fairgrounds look so gruesome when abandoned. Once a place of joy and laugh, now a spooky ground where some machines still try to entertain you as you pass by. Sounds of the past appear out of nothing. As if ghosts and spirits are still on a roller coaster ride. Is that a clown I hear? \n\n- Haunted House\nWhispers around you make your heart beat faster, while you walk through this old house with it's creaky floors and doors. Thunder bursts concentrated above the house making cats and other animals scream. After every door you think you found the exit, but every door leads to another room with new surprises. Most of them not so pleasant. Wish you haven't been so curious and never entered this Haunted House?\n\n- Hell Fire\nWhen you open your eyes from whats seems like a nap, flames warm your body from below. Standing on top of a big rock you look at the bubbling Lava. Where to go? Fireballs shoot all over the place. You see some phantoms who fail to dodge them. Distant screams make the place even more horrific. You can just hope this is a very bad dream.\n\n- Gloomy Ghosts\nHave you ever seen a ghost? Some say they do. But in this place you can hear them for sure. Have a look around, maybe you see or feel them. It's said that if you feel a sudden cold, a ghost might just pass you. Or even fly right through you. Look out! On your left!\n\n- Sinister Strings\nWhen you enter the Opera house, the theater hall is dark and there's nobody on the podium. These instruments seem to play themselves! It's an orchestra without direction. I think there are too many false notes being played here..\n\n- Witch Hunt\nScreeching laughter so typically for witches. A lot of them are gathered to discuss new spells and recipes. The winner of last year's soup competition is already cooking this years soup. The ingredients are gore and not so typical. Make sure you do not end up in the boiling cauldron in the middle of the square.\n\n- Pirate Ship\nArr aaaaaargh. This is not the average pirate ship. This one is haunted. We suspect ghost are glooming around the rudder.\n\n- Lurid Laboratory\nNot Dexter, not DeeDee but evil forces brew here."

      "label": "In the modern age, paranormal investigators use many tools to communicate with spirits. Ouija Boards, Spirit Boxes, radios and apps are just a few of the many tools they use but cultures have been using tools to communicate with spirits for ages. \n\nCleromancy, the practice of contacting divine truth via random castings of dice (or bones) stretches back before recorded history. Astragalomancy, is a form of divination that uses dice marked with letters. In fact, many ancient cultures have various forms of dice divination.\n\nNecro Dice is a modern version of this ancient practice. This app means to combine the ancient and modern forms of communication in a completely new and unique way. Users seeking answers or messages can roll the dice with a simple tap of the screen. Once the user’s intention has been cast through the rolling of the dice, it is up to the spirits to communicate by influencing the randomization of letters to form words. This phenomenon of spirit communication through the manipulation of electronic devices has been well documented for several decades.\n\nNecro Dice functions by generating a handful of dice with random letters assigned to each of the six faces of each dice. These dice are then simulated with an advanced physics engine that handles dice to table and dice to dice collisions. When the physics simulation completes and the dice settle the result is a jumble of letters shown on the top face of the dice. Normally when using dice, the user is then required to inspect the dice to try and find words in this jumble of letters. This app uses a proprietary algorithm to inspect the top faces of the dice and try to match words and names to a dictionary. A word is chosen from the jumble of letters based on many factors including distance, length, location and relevance. Once a word is detected in the dice,  the app will highlight the individual letters on the dice and display the word on the screen. A list of words rolled since the start of the app can be accessed in the word log by pressing the button at the lower left of the screen.\n\nRolling dice isn’t just for games, do the spirits have a message for you?"

      "label": "The Ghost EVP/EMF Radio has been developed for exciting paranormal detection and exploration. We've put a lot of effort into making the app easy to use, so that both professional and enthusiast paranormal researchers, ghost hunters and ghost tour organizers can enjoy the experience.\n\nIf you are either easily frightened, a super skeptic \"left brainer\" or have a serious heart-related medical condition, you are probably better off avoiding this app.\n\nElectronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) is the collective name for the sounds sometimes detected on electronic recordings and reminiscent of human speech. These sounds are usually found in recordings with noise or poor radio reception and are considered by many to be the voices of paranormal beings such as ghosts, spirits, demons and other energy based entities. EVP is a form of Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC), a term coined by professor Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s.\n\nThis app has taken the traditional ghost box to the next level. As with traditional ghost boxes, chaotic noise seems to be both inviting and sensitive to paranormal manipulation. The app generates audible speech by detecting meaningful phrases and words together with properties such as gender, age and the current mood of the communicating entity. We continuously improve the app, based on user feedback, and use it during our own paranormal investigations as well.\n\n*** Features ***\n* Radio Control Panel where you control the radio in real-time.\n* Brownian, Pink and White Noise generators.\n* Electromagnetic Field Meter using the Magnetometer sensor of your device.\n* Multiple graphical themes for the user interface.\n* Record your encounters with or without the microphone of your device.\n* Real-time audio visualization: Oscilloscope, Spectrometer, Voicegram and Waveform (tap to toggle).\n* Text log screen: The persistent text log is where you can sort, share and delete your log.\n* Quick text log: Tap on the main TV screen to toggle between the different view modes.\n* Open your EVP recordings in compatible audio apps with the touch of a button.\n* Optional Auto Recording which only produces recordings when something interesting is encountered.\n* Optional vibration (iPhone only) and audible alarms every time an entity has been detected.\n* Share your recordings with friends and family.\n* Upload your recordings to your Dropbox.\n\nPlease note that the app will degrade gracefully to Performance mode when running on older hardware, which means that some features may not be available or limited when running on, for example, the iPad 2 or the iPhone 4S.\n\n\n*** Languages ***\nEnglish (US/UK), Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Latin, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\n\n*** Support ***\n* For support, feedback and more information, please visit https://paranormalsoftware.com/support, or use the buttons on the Settings screen.\n* Knowledge Base: https://paranormalsoftware.com/support/kb\n* Twitter: @GhostRadioEVP\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ghostevpradio\n* Mailing list: http://tiny.cc/ghostradiomail\n\n\nWe hope that you, like many others, will be fascinated by the paranormal experience of Ghost EVP Radio. Thanks for downloading!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nEvery effort has been made to make this app truly unique, but we can offer no guarantee that you will get specific results by using it. Since the results of this app haven't been scientifically verified, it should only be used for entertainment purposes. Please use it responsibly."

      "label": "This application emulates the Time Circuit Panel, similar to installed into the DeLorean Time Machine, an invention of Doc Brown, the key character of one of the best movies of 80th (you know, which one - \"Back To The Future\").\n\nIt's not just a mock-up, but a functional timer device. \"Present Time\" displays the current system time of your iPhone or iPod (could be a nice stylish digital clock for your car), \"Last Time Departed\" is the time when you started the application for a last time. \n\"Destination Time\" is the time when the application will give a signal - electronic alarm sound.\n\nOn iPhone, you can enable the \"88MPH Time Travel Simulation\" option. After that application uses the built-in GPS to check your current speed. When it reaches 88 MPH application  plays some sounds and switching the \"Present Time\" to your \"Destination\" - like you just jumped over the time. Application \"come back\" automatically after several seconds. \nPlease note and take this VERY SERIOUS -speed of 88 MPH is ILLEGAL on the MOST of the public roads. Double check this before your experiments and always keep the safety. \nThis feature will not work well on iPods and not-3G iPads - the real hardware GPS chip is required.\n\nOn the \"Time Distance\" screen you can see the number of seconds, minutes, hours, days and weeks between Present and Destination time. This screen is available by tapping the \"DIST\" label.\n\n \n\nYou can change the \"Destination TIme\" by tapping the screen slightly above or slightly below the digits. Keypad to enter the Destination time available on tap on the Destionation time numbers. Enter \"05\" for March, \"06\" for June, etc. \"0\" and \"1\" sets the AM/PM time.\n\nThanks to everyone for your suggestions about additional functionality, there is a big chance they will be implemented in next release. Please forward your requests to support@atoll-ordenadores.com email address."

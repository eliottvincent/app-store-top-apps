It also rolls a six-sided die (and doesn't cheat). But best of all . . . once per game, you get a Boon . . . an in-game advantage to help you kill the monsters, steal the treasure, and stab your buddy. There are almost 150 different Boons, all illustrated by John Kovalic. The higher your level when you ask for your Boon, the better it's likely to be. And when you reach the winning level, it plays a fanfare. Your friends will hate you . . .\n\nBonus features include:\n• Kill-O-Meter screen to keep track of combat scores.\n• Counters for Chez Geek and SPANC (Space Pirate Amazon Ninja Catgirls) illustrated with art from the games.\n\nThis app is NOT a stand-alone game! It is a game aid for the Munchkin card games and Munchkin Quest board games by Steve Jackson Games. Munchkin is the dungeon experience . . . with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff.

      "label": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved"

      "label": "This is the Original \"Spider on Hand\" app as seen on Youtube. Beware of imitations.\n\nDo you know anyone who is afraid of spiders? Everyone right? Then this is the perfect magic trick/prank for you.\n\nWatch the trailer video at http://www.mypetboris.com/trailer.htm\n\nMy Pet Boris app is the scariest app for the iPhone. Inspired by Jim Pace's magic trick \"The Web\" where a spider magically appears on the back of your spectator's hand. Bound to get amazing reactions.\n\nThe app uses the idea of \"Augmented Reality\" merging real life objects with computer generated graphics to create a truly frightening effect.\n\n\nTHE MAGIC SPIDER EFFFECT\nYou take a photo of the spectator's palm (secretly loading a plastic spider on the back of their hand) and place the phone on their palm to hold.\n\nYour Pet Boris - an Australian Red back spider (black widow) creeps onto the screen and they can feel the vibrations as it walks. You can tap the screen and even slide your finger into the animation to scratch the spider's back. Boris walks off the screen.\n\nYou tell them that the phone has special sensors that when you wave your hand over the screen it makes the spider come back. He does.\n\nYou get them to wave their hand over the phone. \nIt is just then that they glimpse a realistic spider clinging to the back of their hand and they FREAK OUT!!\n\nBound to get BIG reactions. \n\nFinger tone and size can be set to suit your own or you can import an image of your own finger. \n\nStart-up screen can be customised to suit your performance style. An actual  photo of their hand, solid white or any image from your library can be used as a background.\n\nNOTE: Requires a plastic spider or cockroach and adhesive dots to perform. You should be able to find these locally or you can purchase from our website.\n\nSee our website http://www.mypetboris.com for more details, spider and cockroach supplies and video presentation & instructions.\n\nLike our Facebook page to keep up to date with changes, tips and suggestions. http://www.facebook.com/MyPetBoris\n\n\nTHE MAGIC COCKROACH\nThe app also comes with a cockroach animation for those who think they are scarier than spiders.\n\n\nTHE MAGIC BUTTERFLY EFFECT - IN-APP PURCHASE - (for the Professional Magician)\n\nThe Magic Butterfly is an additional effect within the Magic Spider – My Pet Boris App. \n\nIt is enabled as an “in app purchase” for around US$2.99 depending on your local currency. The custom finger feature is also unlocked when you purchase the butterfly effect.\n \nThis is a perfect routine for those times when you want to perform a beautiful effect for a little girl or woman, leaving her with a magical gift at the end. You will get similarly strong reactions to the Magic Spider effect without the scare factor.\n\nPRESENTATION:\nThe magician simulates a grand illusion in the palm of the spectator’s hand. A tiny foil covered “Magical Egg” is placed in the palm of the spectator’s hand and then photographed. The phone is placed on their hand.\n\nThe egg transforms into a Chrysalis and then into a butterfly. The magician’s finger is seen to tickle the virtual butterfly on screen which then flies away. \nUsing a magical gesture the magician brings the butterfly back briefly before it flies off again.\n\nThe spectator is asked to try and make it return. When they try, they find a matching butterfly (in an impossible location) on the back of their hand. The original foil egg has vanished.\n\nTHE CARD REVELATION EFFECT - IN-APP PURCHASE - (for the Professional Magician)\n\nThe Magic Spider effect with the addition of a torn card corner revelation as a finale.\n\nAccessory packs and supplies are available at: http://www.mypetboris.com/store.htm\n\nSee our FAQ Section. http://www.mypetboris.com/faq.htm\n\nFull instructions at: (everything is explained)\nhttp://www.mypetboris.com/inst2099.htm.\n\nUse the password at the bottom of the \"CREDITS\" screen for access."

Save and easily search for non-player characters, game world locations, quests, and bosses in your favorite RPGs. Track NPC locations and quests, filter on complete or incomplete quests and locations, and view at-a-glance stats for your games. Must-have companion for massive RPG video games like Elden Ring, or your favorite Dungeons and Dragons campaign.\n\nShattered Ring is the easy-to-use iOS RPG game task tracking app you never knew you needed. Add notes to NPCs, and search not only on NPC, location, or quest name but the contents of your notes. Enter as little or as much information as you'd like. Create new NPCs with as little as a name, or add details about quests and locations when you create the NPC. You can always go back later and add existing locations or quests to an NPC you've created.\n\nWhy stop at notes? Take a picture of the map and save it to your Location images. Load your favorite game guides up in your iOS device browser and save the links to your NPC, location, quest or boss entries so you can easily visit them later. \n\nBut locations and quests aren't tied to NPCs alone! Enter quests you stumble across as you explore large, open-world video games. Or enter locations into the app when you discover new points of interest, and store details to remind you to come back later, such as the presence of a helpful merchant or a note that you didn't clear so you can come back later to see if there's any good loot. And don't forget to track your bosses - keep track of how many bosses you've defeated, and use the undefeated boss list as a reminder to come back and revisit the tougher bosses when you've leveled up or have better gear. Use boss notes to save dropped items, or save links to boss fight walkthroughs to help you figure how to beat them.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of games you can track in the Shattered Ring RPG game tracker. Store details about multiple Elden Ring playthroughs, track multiple D&D campaigns or other TTRPG sessions, or mix-and-match video game playthroughs with other RPG details."

      "label": "*** Off Book! PRO is the AD FREE version of Off Book! for actors! ***\n\n** Please note: there is currently no way to import lines from the Free version of OffBook!, but I am working on a converter **\n\nOff Book! is an app designed by an actor for actors.  I perform regularly and designed this app for myself to assist in script memorization.  \n\nNew for version 4.0 - LineSync! will enable you to share your lines with other performers (available through in-app purchase)\n\nIt's really simple to use. You basically create your Works, Scenes, add Characters, and Record Lines! Should you accidentally record a 30+ line scene and realize that you have one of the lines out of order, you don't have to start over! Either hit the line \"plus\" signet insert a new line immediately after, or simply press on the offending line, and drag it to a new position! Voilà! You are all set.\n\nIf your scenes are out of order: same deal. Long press on the scene and move it to the position you like.\n\nOnce you are done recording the lines for the scene you wish to rehearse, tap on the rehearse icon and you are presented with the rehearse screen. From here you can choose to play through the entire scene, as well as mute/cue your line.  To mute your line, simply select the character you will be playing by tapping the \"down arrow\", and then clicking the \"Mute My Line\" switch so that it shows green.  The scene will play through and when it gets to your line, it will pause for the line length...giving you time to say it and wait for your next cue. The \"Cue My Line\" switch will cue the line for you by providing an audible \"ding\" immediately prior.\n\nPlease see the *INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS* in the app, or on my website, and if you have any neat feature requests or (gasp!) bug reports, please don't hesitate to contact me about them.\n\nPlease do NOT hesitate to contact me at the support web link listed here.   There is an email box there at the bottom of the page for you to mail me should you experience any bugs you may need fixed!\n\nEnjoy\n\n--Steve\n\n*************** PRO TIPS ***************\nFOR THE PEOPLE WHO SAY IT WON'T SAVE YOUR LINES: It is possible you did not accept the \"Let Off Book! have access to your Microphone\" permission.  If this is a first time install, just uninstall the app, and reinstall.  When the popup asks for permissions, approve them.\n\nAlternatively you can go into the iPhone settings, scroll down until you find the Off Book! app, click it, and ensure that the microphone switch is turned ON.\n\nTo DELETE Lines, Characters, Scenes, or Works: Simply swipe your finger from right to left on the entry and a \"Delete\" button will pop up.  Be careful with this, because if you delete a character in a work, you will also delete all of its Lines.\n\nTO REORDER Lines: (in case you have one out of order and don't feel like deleting and recording all over again) hold your finger down on the line you want to move and then drag it into the proper position.  You can see this demonstrated on the instructional videos I have included.\n\nFOR LONG SCENES: Where you will leave the iPhone unattended, set your sleep timer/auto lock to either off, or maximum length so the phone doesn't go to sleep while you're rehearsing! (I am currently working to see if there is a way around this)\n\nWagon Wheel - Electronic Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"

I hope it provides some entertainment for you and your kids too.\n\nMy favorite is to play Bubbles with my kids before bed. We try to draw letters, numbers, or just fling them about. Tip: Flip your iPad or iPhone upside down to slow the bubbles down for easier drawing.\n\nHave fun!"

Never again will you need to wonder who should go first in your next game. Now you have Start Player! (Start Player also comes in handy for determining who should pick up that check at dinner.)\n\nStart Player is based on a pack of cards with the same name created by Ted Alspach and featuring the characters from his award-winning Board2Pieces web comic.\n\nStart Player has four unique ways of choosing your start player:\n\n1. Card Start lets you determine the start player by drawing a random, virtual card that lists the zany criteria for choosing the start player. Want to choose the start player based on your street address or who bathed most recently? Then this is the choice for you!\n\n2. Spin Start lets you spin the big wheel of fortune and have fate decide for you.\n\n3. List Start is for the impatient among you. Dial in the number of players, hit the button, and just read the names off a randomly sorted list.\n\n4. Finger Start is like Russian Roulette without all that pesky blood. Everybody puts their finger on the device, someone pushes a button, and \"Hey! Presto!\" we have a new Start Player!\n\nIs it silly? Of course! Is it fun? Absolutely!"

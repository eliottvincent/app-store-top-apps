Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

      "label": "If you love working out with Apple Watch, but you need more advanced fitness stats, HealthFit is for you.\n\nBy analyzing the workout data stored in Apple Health, HealthFit provides the kind of indispensable tracking and insights you normally only get from premium subscription services. But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times. You can even log which bike or shoes you use, to monitor usage and flag when it’s time to replace them.\n\nHealthFit finds photos you take during your workouts automatically, bringing your activity feed to life with stunning images you can share on social media.\n\nRUNNING POWER ANALYSIS\n\nHealthFit provides advanced running power analysis with the automatically estimated critical power, the weighted average power, the power distribution chart by 25W Increments and the mean maximal power chart which shows your best average power for time periods of one second up to the length of your run.\n\nMULTISPORT AND INTERVAL WORKOUTS\n\nHealthFit is the only app to export multisport workouts as multisession activities\n\nSTATISTICS: UNCOVER HIDDEN FITNESS INSIGHTS\n\nApple Watch gathers so much fitness data, it can sometimes seem overwhelming. HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio.

I bought a new iPhone to be able to use it. DBT skills are priceless. I had tried every, other DBT and CBT app. This one follows the traditional DBT program exactly, and is the only Diary Card. Before I had this app, I'd seldom fill in my diary card. Now that I have it, I don't have to keep track of paper, and I rarely miss a day. I can fill in my Diary Card discreetly, from anywhere, anytime, and send it directly to my DBT coach. I no longer have to worry about someone coming across my Diary Cards. You can brush up on skills, use it for distress tolerance suggestions, tailor it to your needs, and even journal. I appreciate that I can add personal goals to my diary. Thank you for this app!\" - iTunes US Review\n\n\"***** I am in IRL-DBT and this app is the perfect complement. Oh. I love that the app is so flexible, that you can make it kind of your own, and the layout is so nice, simple, yet beautiful. For me, a true life-saver! Genius! Without a doubt the best app in my IPhone... Get it now!\" - iTunes Sweden Review\n\n\"***** Perfect! Worth the money!\" - iTunes US Review\n\nAs an educated consumer, it's important to know to whom you're listening. DBT Diary Card was created by a Ph.D. psychologist trained directly by Dr. Marsha Linehan and at the Duke University Medical Center; we are experts in DBT, providing consultation to many in our community. And now we're giving it to you!\n\nA DBT app can have 3 parts: \n\n- A reference manual\n- A behavior tracker\n- A skills coach\n\nDBT Diary Card has all 3 of these parts and utilizes the iOS platform in ways that the other apps available don't and can't.\n\n+ PDF generation\n+ Notification Pane support\n+ Password protection\n+ Advanced text editing\n+ Media playback\n\nWhat DBT Diary Card has to offer:\n\n- Skills. LOTS of them. Every DBT skill you've ever heard about in a group is in here. It can be your quick reference to your skills so that you don't have to carry around your book or binder. Every skill is described in readable language to help you understand them easily and it's all just a quick tap away.\n\n- Emotions. All the \"basic\" emotions are presented, again with descriptions and explanations a quick tap away.\n\n- Behaviors. The most troublesome are pre-loaded.\n\n- Coaching. If you know you need to use a skill but can't think of which one or can't remember how to choose, use the app. The coaching can be your virtual therapist. \n\n- Complete customizability. Are you working on something different or do you have a different understanding of a particular skill or emotion? Change it. It's that easy. You are not wedded to the way it's presented in the app. It's all completely customizable.\n\n- 911 skills.  Put your emergency skills a tap away. You can call directly from the app, listen to your distress tolerance music, remember what apps help in the moment. \n\n- Email. You can email your therapist your diary card on a weekly basis automatically, you can do it manually whenever you'd like or you can have the app remind you.\n\n* Telephony features require an iPhone and voice service."

This sleepmatic sounds machine is created using an ancient but doctor-tested and approved technique to help soothe your fussy baby calm with a shusher sound in cradle. \r\n\r\nA simple baby shusher with soothing sounds for baby that works on a single click, making calming sounds like baby lullaby that would work instantly and can be played for hours, recommended by parents, baby photographers, and doctors dealing with babies.\r\n\r\nBy creating calm sounds, safely stop the baby from crying with a rhythmic “shush” sound that engages a baby's natural calming reflex by reminding them of still being in the womb. The shush baby app helps to soothe baby calm and increase the baby sleep timer.\r\n\r\nThe amazing Sound Equalizer allows the app to \"listen\" to your baby crying or not every three minutes and automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby cry volume till baby calms down (so when the baby is wailing, shush is loud; when baby goes quiet, volume settles into a soothing background shush sound to relax baby).\r\n\r\nA newborn sleep magic baby sound machine that works best for a newborn baby to calm down quickly and manage baby sleeping patterns. A sleep aid that creates calming sounds for babies in the form of a shhh sound sleeper that will stop your baby crying, calms down easily, and put baby to sleep. \r\n\r\nThis shhh app calm baby instantly by creating a shusher sound, helping the baby relax in minutes using calming sounds for kids.  This sleepmatic app works like magic for the crying baby and helps parenting so much easier as baby calmer. \r\n\r\nAfter more than two years of testing and research with real moms and real babies, having sudden and long crying baby issues, we came up with the following very valuable feature list of baby soothing sound.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Safe and easy to use baby calming sounds machine. \r\n- Much more effective than simple lullabies or standard white noise.\r\n- Perfectly works for hours in the background and when the phone is locked\r\n- Adjustable Shush baby sound Timer Options (from 15 minutes to 8 hours of continuous shushing!)\r\n- Automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby crying volume.\r\n- Shush sounds played in low light “dark mode” ( night mode) to avoid extra mobile light as baby sleeps.\r\n- Work in other Apps on your Phone while still using the Baby Shusher App.\r\n\r\n*Note: Turn your phone on silent/mute to let the app do its magic.*\r\n \r\n \r\nWhat Real Moms are Saying About the Baby Shusher:\r\n\r\n“I wish I would have known about this sooner. It is truly a miracle for me and baby to have a good night’s rest together!” Mercedes (mother of 3 months old)\r\n\r\n“It is a must try for yourself.” Isabel (mother of 3.5 months old)\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t sure after the 1st time I used it, but it proved to us that it worked better and better thereafter.

      "label": "WHAT IS CLOCK YOURSELF? \n\nClock Yourself challenges you to think on your feet.  \n\nIt involves exercise for your body and your brain, at the same time.  \nEvery challenge will stimulate your brain in a different way. \n\nYou don't have to master one challenge before you can explore another challenge.  \n\nSome call this an exercise app. \nSome call this a brain games app.  \nWhy can’t it be both?! \n\n\n \nWHO CAN USE CLOCK YOURSELF? \n\nEveryone! \n\nClock Yourself exercises involve taking one step in all directions on a circle visualised beneath your feet. It’s perfect for exercise at home.  \n\nAthletes often modify Clock Yourself exercises outdoors for sport-specific agility drills, by visualising a much larger circle and running between the coordinates.  \n\nSimilarly, people who are unable to walk can modify Clock Yourself to practise reaching with their arms, or wheelchair agility! \n\nIf you think you’re too slow to use Clock Yourself, you’re probably wrong.  \nIf you think you’re too fit to use Clock Yourself, you’re definitely wrong! \n\n\n\n\nWHY DID WE MAKE CLOCK YOURSELF?\n\nThe Clock Yourself concept originated in neurological rehabilitation. Now anyone can use it to harness their neuroplasticity.  \n\nIt was developed by Australian physiotherapist @MegLowryPT and software developer Dave Wallace. \n\n\n \nWe had 5 goals: \n\n1. Make it fun - Clock Yourself exercises are so entertaining that you’ll show your friends at parties! \n\n2. Make it versatile  - Both the stepping speed and the cognitive complexity are in your control.  \n\n3. Make it evidence based - This is a volitional step training method. Volitional stepping trains faster steps in all directions to improve your chances of catching yourself during a fall.  \n\n4. Make it portable - There is no need to set up mats, wires or sensors. It also works offline. It only requires internet for your initial download from the App Store.  \n\n5. Make it affordable - This is a once off purchase for pocket change. It has no recurring subscriptions and no advertisements.  \n\n\n\nIS CLOCK YOURSELF AVAILABLE IN OTHER LANGUAGES? \n\nYes and no. \n\nAt this stage, all of the buttons and instructions are in English only.  \n\nHowever, if you click the Options button within each challenge (except for the Simple Colours challenge) you can choose to play the audio prompts in six other languages. \n\nMandarin \nJapanese \nFrench  \nGerman \nSpanish \nDutch  \n\nWhat are you waiting for?  Go ahead and Clock Yourself!\n\n“A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new” - Albert Einstein"

Japanese fitness researcher Dr Izumi Tabata created a H.I.I.T. (High Intensity Interval Training) workout using this very method. Dr Tabata proved the method to draw heavily from both the aerobic and anaerobic systems, unlike most traditional workouts, which tend heavily favor one or the other. \n\nThe 4 minute Tabata Interval has gained a lot of recognition throughout the CrossFit community, running community, and health clubs across the globe, for its versatility, adaptability, and positive results. \n\nThe Tabata Interval Method has proven to maximize VO2 max, while also building endurance, burning fat, and retaining muscle. Though the Tabata was not originally designed as a fat loss or weight loss program, it has gained a lot of recent attention as a result of its physical impacts on users. \n______________________________\n\nINITIAL DOWNLOAD:\n-9 songs + preview entire Tabata Songs catalogue. \n\nTABATA SONGS PRO (In-App Purchase):\n-Unlock all 43 songs + new songs as they are added with updates"

Anyone can use MoodMission, whether you just want a lift in your day or need a bit more help recovering from anxiety or depression.\n\nA randomised controlled trial has shown that MoodMission can improve mental health and wellbeing (Bakker et al., 2019), and two other studies published in scientific journals have provided further support (Bakker & Rickard, 2019; Bakker et al., 2018). Randomised controlled trials are the gold standard of scientific evidence, and very few available mental health apps have RCT support (Firth et al., 2018).\n\nCompleting Missions earns you rewards in the app, motivating you to take steps towards becoming healthier, happier, and more confident. Plus a Mission log helps you track your progress over time.\n\nMoodMission learns which types of Missions work best for you, so the more you use MoodMission the better it gets at tailoring your Mission suggestions.\n\nMoodMission is not a replacement for professional help. If you are experiencing anxiety, depression, or any mental health issue, talk to your GP or contact a psychologist for support."

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

      "label": "Anxiety Release shows you how to release anxious thoughts and feelings naturally, by harnessing the power of your brain. It does this by combining guided instructions and focused attention with bilateral brain stimulation. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a revolutionary treatment which is based on the use of sensory stimulation to alter anxiety-provoking memories and responses. Over 30 randomized controlled studies of EMDR attest to the efficacy of this process. \n\nBecause bilateral stimulation appeals to the unconscious, sensing part of the brain, there is no need for effortful thinking or struggling with feelings.  All you have to do is LISTEN and your brain will do the rest! The App consists of;\n1 x brain training session\n2 x guided anxiety management sessions\n1 x pure bilateral stimulation session (audio & visual)\n1 x safe place exercise\nProgress Log function\nPowerful Bls brain visual \nThis App is suitable for both clinicians and clients\n\nCaution: Persons suffering with complex PTSD or mental health problems, multiple psychological trauma or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without medical supervision."

      "label": "AutoWake is the first haptic smart alarm for your Watch. \n\nIt can wake you up by tapping you on your wrist using your Watch's haptic engine. You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

With the remote you may start/stop/resume workouts, adjust resistance for one or all trainers, change data displays for any display as well as toggle on/off a number of the options built in to PerfPRO Studio. It also allows you to adjust how your power meter may be used with your trainer rather than using the Windows menus on your computer. This remote pretty much replaces all previous remote control hardware that was either included with your trainer or purchased later such as any ANT+ remote control. And because the connection is WiFi there is no delay when using the remote and the range matches that of your iOS device. \n\nFor Studios, your athletes may install this app and use at your facility. It is recommended that a secured guest WiFi option be setup so they may connect to your network and to PerfPRO Studio running on your computer."

Wonder why her desire for physical intimacy is high one day, then bottomed-out the next? \n\nThere will be no more guessing when you use the Female Forecaster App. \n\nThis new app for boyfriends and husbands lets you know what your sweetheart's moods, libido, energy level and more will be every day.\n\nAnd, it all comes down to where she is in her monthly cycle. \n\n\nTHE SCIENCE\n\nAs three key hormones (estrogen, testosterone and progesterone) rise and fall throughout a woman's monthly cycle, research shows they impact her brain and body in a wide variety of ways.\n\nBecause her hormones repeat the same up and down pattern every cycle, the effects her hormones have on her also repeat the same way cycle after cycle--making her moods, libido, energy and more easy to predict.\n\nFor example...\n\n• On Day 7 of a woman's hormone cycle, she's happier, energetic and experiencing a spike in her sex drive thanks to rising estrogen--making this a day when boyfriends and husbands can do no wrong.\n\n• On Day 19, she's quieter, sluggish and her desire for physical intimacy is low due to sedating progesterone, which is a hormone that reins in sexual desire--so men shouldn't take her \"Not tonight, dear\" personally.\n\n• On Day 27, a drop in estrogen can make her irritable and blue, but she also experiences a rise in libido--which explains why she can be cross with you one minute, but want to cuddle with you the next.\n\nRead full sample forecasts from this app at MyHormonology.com/female-forecaster/sample-days\n\n\nHOW TO USE THE APP\n\nSetting it up takes seconds: Simply input two pieces of information about your girlfriend or wife to launch the app's cycle calendar:\n\n• The typical length of her menstrual cycle (input 28 days if you don't know)\n• The day she's on in her cycle right now (just ask her--her Day 1 is the first day of her most recent period and she just counts from there)\n\nYou can then read your Female Forecast for today or look at any point in the future--tomorrow, next week, next month, even next year--to find out what she'll be like then. \n\n\nAPP BONUSES\n\nThis app also allows you to...\n\n• Get alerts about key days in her cycle (for instance, when her premenstrual week is arriving)\n• Create custom alerts\n• Keep notes\n• Get date ideas and tips for getting on her good side\n\n\nWHO THIS APP IS FOR\n\nMale partners of women who have\n• Healthy menstrual cycles\n• Menstrual cycles lasting anywhere from 22 to 49 days (it's okay if her cycle length varies from month to month)\n• Natural hormones (no hormone birth control)\n\nThis app is not intended for partners of women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, menopausal, taking hormone medications or hormone birth control or have a health disorder that impacts hormones, such as PCOS.\n\nThis app is not intended to help users and their partners avoid pregnancy or become pregnant.\n\n\nFEEDBACK\n\nIf you're experiencing any problem with this app, I want to know. My team and I work quickly to fix issues and provide updates to ensure you get the most out of your experience. Send your feedback to Gabrielle@MyHormonology.com."

They will be automatically placed in your AM and/or PM routine as recommended.\n\n\n• ADD CUSTOM PRODUCTS\n\nYou can add custom skincare products from other brands by selecting the option in the top-right menu in the Routine section or from the Custom tab in the Products section.\n\n\n• USE YOUR ROUTINE FOR LAYERING ADVICE\n\nThe products are listed in the recommended layering order, along with advice for when and how to use each product.\n\n\n• KEEP TRACK OF USAGE TO AVOID CONFLICTS\n\nEach morning and evening, check each product off your list to keep track of which treatments you have used. This will allow the app to prevent any conflicts by showing you which products should be avoided.\n\n\n• TRACK YOUR SKIN'S PROGRESS\n\nAny time you notice your skin is looking particularly good or bad, you can make a note of it by pressing on the face icon next to the morning or evening routine. You can also add a comment to note down more details for your own record and add photos to track your progress.\n\n\n• ADD PHOTOS\n\nYou can add photos of your skin to your diary tracker and also add photos of custom products.\n\n\n• REMINDERS & TIMERS\n\nYou can set up notifications to remind you about your daily skin regimen. You can also set timers for products which require a specific wait time. Both can be found in the Settings.\n\n\n\n*** Advanced App Customization ***\n\n• RE-ORDER YOUR ROUTINE\n\nIf you don't wish to follow the recommended layering order, you can choose to re-order the products to fully customize your routine by selecting the option from the top right menu (with 3 dots) of the Routine section. You can also change the order of the layer steps, for instance DECIEM recommends oils before moisturizers but some users prefer the other way around.\n\n\n• USE CONFLICTING PRODUCTS\n\nWhen we recommend not using a product due to conflicts with other products or because you've reached the usage limit, you can choose to ignore the warning and use it anyway. You will then have the option to permanently ignore conflicts on that specific product.\n\n\n• SCHEDULE PRODUCTS\n\nYou can choose specific days of the week for a product if you wish. For instance, you may wish to make it so that the \"AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution\" only appears in your routine on Tuesdays and Fridays.\nYou can also choose dates of the month, e.g. the 1st and 15th of every month.\nAnother useful option is to schedule products for every X days, so you could choose every 2 days to alternate.\n\n\n\n*** Recommended for skin concerns... ***\n\n• Dry & Dehydrated Skin: Achieve plump, healthy-looking hydrated skin.\n• Acne-Prone Skin: Reduce inflammation to help support clear skin.\n• Blemishes & Congestion: Reduce inflammation and brighten the skin.\n• Sensitive Skin: Keep your skin moisturized with this gentle routine.\n• Mature Skin & Wrinkles: Promote youthful skin and reduce the signs of aging.\n• Pigmentation Problems: Gently exfoliate and brighten skin tone.\n• Oily Skin: Rebalance your skin for a healthy, fresh look.\n\n\nPlease note, Skincare Routine (previously known as \"Skincare Regimen Organizer\") has no connection with DECIEM, The Ordinary or any other skincare brand."

      "label": "To broaden the use of 3D foot scanning technology on iOS platforms, we now add an TrueDepth® app named AOMS TOT jr to our AOMS TOT family. The original AOMS TOT app is used on iPad with the Structure Sensor, while AOMS TOT jr is operated without any externally attached sensor. It makes a much smaller hardware and reliable. With the emergence of the built-in TrueDepth® camera in some iPhone and iPad models, we are now able to use this newest technology for the orthotic industry. Together with the systematic setup we developed for foot scanning, AOMS TOT jr is aimed to give foot professionals a versatile tool to acquire 3D contour of the plantar surface of the foot.  Besides emails, files are accessible through Apple's Files App. Special considerations regarding ‘neutral position casting’ were taken into account during development. This app was developed with iPhone XR and iPad Pro 11-inch (2nd Gen). The popular 3D OBJ files generated from the app are meant to be used in the AOMS systems to have foot orthotics made.

      "label": "“Overcoming pain based on EMDR” was brought to you by Mark Grant, well known Australian psychologist/researcher and writer. Mark is particularly interested in developing resources that sufferers of pain and stress can use to make a real difference in their suffering. He is motivated to do what works best for his clients rather than what the ‘accepted wisdom’ might say. But he maintains a scientific approach and has conducted several studies regarding the efficacy of EMDR as a treatment for chronic pain. \n\n“Overcoming pain based on EMDR” mobile application is using recent discoveries from brain science to alleviate chronic pain and severe stress. \n\nThe application comprises 3 playlists for controlling pain and associated stress that can maintain pain. \n\nEach playlist is designed with different goals in mind. Where the first playlist called “Mental Healing strategies” is aimed to alleviate mild or moderate chronic pain, the second playlist called “Sensory Healing strategies” will help when you are too tired, sore or distressed to employ the pain pathway strategy from the first playlist. And the last playlist called “Stress Management” is focused on reducing your stressful feelings that can maintain and exacerbate chronic pain. \n\nThe playlists are designed to compliment each other; so if your pain is severe using the strategies in “Sensory Healing strategies” should help bring it under control enough for you to benefit from the tracks in “Mental Healing strategies” and listening to the “Stress Management” tracks regularly, when your pain is tolerable, will bring your overall stress levels down and decrease the pain-related activity in your body and your brain. The tracks in “Mental Healing strategies” and “Stress management” can be listened to anywhere anytime, but the tracks in “Sensory Healing strategies” require external materials and preparation.\n\nOne of the key elements of this app is bilateral stimulation (bls), which is derived from EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). In conjunction with focused attention bls uses sensory stimulation to change physical emotional and cognitive processes associated with chronic pain (as well as trauma and stress). \n\nFor best results you should listen to the tracks that incorporate bls with headphones or hear-buds. You can use the app anytime anywhere but a quiet environment when you don’t feel too overwhelmed by stress or physical discomfort is best. \n\nIf you don’t get the response you expect when listening to the tracks never force yourself or get frustrated, just relax and trust that the relief you are seeking will happen sooner or later.\n\nWhile every effort has been made to provide a genuinely useful resource this app should not be considered a substitute for professional advice or treatment. In addition to standard medical care you should at the consider seeking psychotherapy, improving your diet, exercising regularly etc. \nFor curious minds there’s a number of articles presented in the application where you can read more about both EMDR and chronic pain and bilateral stimulation healing effect. \nYou can also read more about chronic pain and how to overcome it from the Mark Grant’s book called “Change Your Brain Change Your Pain” which you can also order by following the link in “Overcoming pain based on EMDR” placed under “Other Resources” section."

      "label": "Featured by Apple in the App Store Best of 2013!\n\nGet a complete full body workout in just 7 minutes! Based on the \"Scientific 7 Minute Workout\" originally published in ACSM's Health and Fitness Journal and seen in the NY Times, but improved upon by the expert trainers at lolo.\n\nOne size does not fit all so we took the principles of this fast and effective workout and tuned it so it could fit anyone's needs. Some people may find the original 7 Minute Workout too hard while others may find it too boring. We fine tuned this workout so anyone can get a safe, effective, and challenging workout, no matter their fitness level in just 7 minutes! \n\nEvery workout will be customized to your fitness level and to the equipment you have available. Each exercise includes a video you can view DURING YOUR WORKOUT, so that you can always double-check your form.\n\nFEATURES \n• Get a complete full body workout in just 7 minutes!\n• 3 skill levels designed for Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced exercisers.\n• Includes 200 unique exercises. Each one includes video, coaching points and audio guidance.\n• Works anywhere! With over 100 bodyweight exercises, you can get a complete full body workout no matter where you are.\n• lolo's beat-sync technology perfectly matches the tempo of your music to your workout.\n• Completely interactive. Swap out exercises to personalize your workouts. Increase or decreases the intensity at anytime and your trainer and your music will respond!\n• Sync your workouts to the Health app.\n• Compatible with most bluetooth heart rate monitors.\n\nBEAT-SYNC \n7 Minute Workout dynamically changes the beat of YOUR music to perfectly match your movements. Research shows that music distracts the brain during exercise and faster music causes people to accept and even prefer a greater degree of effort. This means you will work harder without trying (or without even feeling the difference), you will get better results from the increased effort, and most importantly, the time will fly by. \n\nlolo CONNECT\nlolo Connect allows you to save your fitness results to the cloud, track your progress across lolo apps, and share your success with friends and family through social media.\n\nINTERACTIVE PERSONAL TRAINER \n7 Minute Workout features an interactive personal trainer whose voice guides you through each workout, giving you the tips you need to get the most out of your workout and the motivation to keep going no matter how tough it gets. Plus you have complete control as you move through your workout. Turn the intensity down a bit when you're struggling or crank it up when you're ready for more, and your trainer adjusts your workout - and your music - on the fly."

The DQS Mobile app was designed to make it as easy as possible to calculate a Diet Quality Score each day.\n\nAs you eat throughout the day, enter the servings of each category of food that you consume. Tap a box to consume one serving of that category, tap it again and it will become a half serving, and one more tap will set it back to zero for that box. You can tap the category name to view an explanation of what foods fall under that category. Your total DQS score for the day is shown in the upper right corner of the page.  DQS data is saved for each day you track it. \n\nYou can also log your weight and body fat % on the bottom of the Tracking page. We recommend you log your weight no more than once per week.\n\nThe Graphs page lets you see how you are doing with your Diet Quality Score over time. You can view your data over the last week, month or year. When viewing yearly data, it is displayed as 52 week-long averages.

You can change your target intake at any time.\nRecord the foods and amounts you eat using the barcode scanner, speech recognition (touch the microphone icon), or by favoriting foods and using the serving sizes provided (mainly those suggested by USDA Food Data Central, but you can change these at any time). Your progress towards your target daily intake will be visible immediately in real-time. \nYou can also view your progress over time on the Month view dashboard, and export food diaries and fiber intake into a spreadsheet for your own information or to share with healthcare providers.\nSynchronize the app with all your Apple devices and First Line Medical Communications Ltd apps. Apple's HealthKit functionality is integrated in the app's user interface so you can share data with Apple's Health app.\nThe app is curated and contains 325+ common (mainly healthy) foods and drinks and you can add your own branded and other foods and recipes at any time using the barcode scanner, voice recognition or the keyboard. This means that provided you add your barcoded foods to the app via the \"Add food\"  tab the app can function without access to the Internet (it will need access to the internet and OpenFoodFacts.org if a barcode is not in the app's database).\nAlso useful nutritional information via the Info tab.\nThe interface is intuitive to navigate, but you may find it useful to familiarise yourself with the full functionality of the app by touching the icons, words, and bars on every screen and swiping left and right on the Tracker screen."

Best 200 iPhone Apps: The Guide for Discriminating Downloaders: (O'Reilly, July 2009)\n\nRated 9/10 by AppCraver! - \"BreathPacer is a great app for anyone looking to relax or to get into the habit of breathing better for increased health.\" http://www.appcraver.com/breathpacer/\n\nFeatured in Men's Journal magazine issue on optimal performance: http://www.mensjournal.com/breathing\n\nBreathPacer is a powerful breathing guide that can help you reduce stress and experience deep relaxation. Andrew Weil, a leader in the integrative health field, states, “If I had to limit my advice on healthier living to just one tip, it would be simply to learn how to breathe correctly.” \n\nResearch has shown that practicing therapeutic breathing creates profound mental and physiological changes in the body.. Breathpacer is especially useful for those people who want to master the breathing techniques used in various forms of Yoga, Meditation, Qigong and other practices. Use BreathPacer for 10-20 minutes a day and see why therapeutic breathing has been shown to be a treatment and/or adjunctive treatment for depression, anxiety, asthma, COPD, hypertension and has also been found to improve cognitive functioning and sports performance! \n\nPracticing slow breathing is not as easy as it seems. BreathPacer helps you practice proper therapeutic breathing with the following features:  \n\n- Smoothly animated visual breathing cues.\n- Soothing rain sounds direct your in and exhales.\n- Flexibility in choosing your own inhale, exhale and hold pace.\n- Individualized therapeutic breathing algorithm based on your height.\n- Option to gradually reduce your breathing rate over the course of a session to your target therapeutic rate.\n- The ability to play your own music while using the program.\n- NEW: Breathing Timer. Set how long you want to breath for and the program will stop at the appropriate time.\n\nWARNING: If you have a medical condition which makes it difficult to breathe slowly, have difficulty breathing slowly or hyperventilate easily, consult your physician before purchasing BreathPacer. BreathPacer is a guide. It is not a medical device. The user is responsible for determining whether BreathPacer is right for them. Improper slow breathing can cause temporary dizziness or lightheadedness. If you feel any discomfort, stop using BreathPacer immediately. The company holds no fiscal responsibly for people who do not follow the instructions of BreathPacer."

At the specified alarm time, the bells will begin to ring in a pre-defined pattern - starting out softly and slowly and gradually getting louder and more frequent.  You'll come out of your slumber slowly and peacefully.  No more being jolted awake.\n\n+ After setting the alarm, the app can be put in the background - allowing you to use other apps.  At the specified alarm time, the alarm pattern will begin.\n\n+ Choose from five pre-defined patterns with varying bell schedules and escalation lengths.\n\n+ Choose from six different bells of varying size and metal compositions - from bright and clean to deep and complex with lovely overtones.\n\n+ You may enter journal notes upon awakening - great for recording your dreams before the memory fades.  You can then go back and review your journal entries and you may export the journal via email.  For privacy, you may set a password to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n+ To save battery, you may lock your device's screen and the alarm will still work.  Either start the alarm and press the lock (sleep) button, or turn on the \"Auto-Lock\" setting.\n\n+ This app uses the same amazing bell sounds used in our Insight Timer meditation timer.  Here are some app store comments pertaining to the bells:\n\n  \"Best sounding bells of any meditation app so far\" - sibergrrl\n\n  \"The bell samples in this app are gorgeous\" - LairBob\n\n  \"Several different bell sounds to choose from and they all feel 'live'\" - VaderPi\n\n  \"Great Sound Quality\" - KarlAgathon\n\n  \"The tones are stunning\" - hellsleeve\n\n  \"Beautiful bell sounds\" - Wolf94114\n\n  \"Wonderful digital bell sounds\" - zenji\n\n  \"The bell sounds are lovely\" - pngwen\n\nOther Features:\n\n- Snooze from 1 minute to 30 minutes\n\n- Sure Wake: Optional LOUD backup sound\n\n- Seven colors available for time display\n\n- Optionally keep phone from sleeping\n\n- Huge landscape time display\n\n- App works even when phone is sleeping (locked)"

Use any of the available, most popular 1 Rep Max formulas to estimate your 1 rep maximum weight and keep a log to see your progress over time.\n\nSimply select a lift type, enter a weight and a number of repetitions (up to 10), and tap the Calculate button to see your 1 Rep Max.\n\nWith My 1 Rep Max Premium, you can create your own custom lifts and use more than 10 repetitions to perform calculations.\n\nA Note About Safety:\nOne rep maximum calculators are used to estimate the maximum amount you can lift. The degree of accuracy can vary significantly depending on your experience with weight training as well as your muscular composition. Most one rep maximum calculators are designed for experienced strength trainers so, if you are inexperienced, you may find your actual one rep maximum is much lower because your body is not accustomed to the stress of lifting heavy weight. Because it can be dangerous to attempt to lift your estimated maximum, always have a spotter with you. Seriously.\n\nMy 1 Rep Max will never bother you to request a rating or review. However,  if you'd like to take the time to rate or review it, you can do so from the Settings screen and that would be swell."

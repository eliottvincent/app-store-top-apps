No matter where you come from we are a home for you. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Phatt program teaches you about you, your gut , your health and how to maintain a healthy lifestyle for the rest of your life. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhatt consists of three main steps : \r\n\r\n1. To take away the sugar from your diet & to introduce the value of specific Nutrition.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2. To learn about the foods that will enhance your gut health.  This is the section where you will lose the majority of your weight  and within days you will begin to see results.  Your gut will gain strength as you learn to mono-eat and identify the foods that will compliment your gut health. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   3.   Maintenance:  here you are reintroduced to a wider variety of foods that will enable you to live a healthy lifestyle for the rest of your life.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo successfully complete the program you must complete step 3.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThroughout your program you are gifted with support and this App is connected to your own Personal Mentor.   They will guide you daily and make sure that you are accountable on your journey.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe supply you with meal plans and recipes  but for those of you who need certain dietary requirements there are optional swap-outs.  This App allows that to be done easily without any mathematics on your behalf. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe are extremely proud of this App as it has been in the making for several years.  It has been designed to take away the guess work and to support our customers to the best of our ability. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWeight loss is not only a health journey but it is also a mental journey. It is just as important to recognise that your mental health plays a role in weight loss and needs support. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCongratulations on taking the first step of living a healthier life.   By making a difference to your life you will be surprised how it will suddenly make a difference to your whole family. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYour children will see you make healthy choices and your language to them will change.   We all want to be the best example to our little ones. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHealth Wealth and Choice is the mantra that Phatt sings.  We can teach you about health, we can give you a wealth of knowledge but the greatest gift we will give you is choice.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nChoose to live.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGood luck, stay positive and enjoy the change.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt’s your turn to smile"

Love this app! Allows me to track my progress and see before and after pics!!! Then I can share with social media or friends through text message!! So simple to use!!!!\"\n                                                                  by Good nurse79\n \n\n\n\nStart a collection of progress photos that stores your weight and date and use the reminder feature to stay on track.\n\nYou probably think that measuring your weight and body fat is a good way to track your fitness progress but really those metrics can be misleading. \n\nYou could be losing muscle and gaining fat or vice versa, how will you know by only looking at how your weight is changing? The most honest measurements you can take are pictures.\n \nFit-stitch uses both of these measurements so you can see how you’re really progressing. \n\nWith Fit-Stitch, you can create Before & After pictures to capture your ongoing fitness transformation. \n\nStudies have shown that tracking your progress increases the success rate of fitness training, resulting in more people staying on track and achieving better results.\n\nPeople are busy and usually forget to track their progress - that’s why Fit-stitch has built-in reminders."

It’s the side made up of the nasty tendencies, weaknesses, childhood wounds & desires that have been conditioned to be hidden throughout our upbringing. \n\n“Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual’s conscious life, the blacker and denser it is. At all counts, it forms an unconscious snag, thwarting our most well-meant intentions.” - Carl Jung\n\n“Shadow-work enables us to alter our self-sabotaging behaviour so that we can achieve a more self-directed life” - Connie Zweig\n\n“When we are aware of our weaknesses or negative tendencies, we open the opportunity to work on them.” ― Allan Lokos"

Sperm is the storehouse of male sexual energy. Sperm production consumes up to a third of a man's daily energy output and is especially hard on the male glandular/immune system. A man's ability to commit the act of sexual activity is limited by the amount of energy he can use.\n\nPreservation of sexual energy is the main principle of improvement sexual health. The ejaculation of male semen for purposes other than the birth of children is a wasteful waste of an extremely precious treasure. Frequent sex leads to a loss of sexual energy and weakens the physical health of a man, can also lead to unconscious emotional anger towards a partner and gradually deprives the male higher mind and his spirit of the ability to rejuvenate himself. Every man is born with the ability to control the reactions of his body and the ability to prevent the loss of sexual energy.\n\nThis app will help you to track your current level of male sexual energy depending on your age and sexual activity. Every day your sexual energy is restored due to the vitality of the body. Each age is characterized by its own rate of restoration of male energy. The restoration of sexual energy of older man is slower than a younger man. You should stick to sexual activity without ejaculation if your energy level is below 100%.\nAfter each activity, the application will give recommendations on how to preserve your body's valuable resources for a full and active life.\n\nWARNING: This is not a medical product.\n\nThe 'Male Sexual Energy' have integrates with the 'Health' app.\n\nIf you have any difficulties in using our application, please write to us directly at our e-mail (support@itbeaver.co), describing the problem in details, otherwise we will not be able to answer you in the comments.

      "label": "“Worked great for his bedtime—the look on his face was so calmed.” Christi (mother of 3 week old)\r\n\r\nThe Baby Shusher is a soothing sounds machine to calm & stop baby crying cycle\r\n\r\nThe Baby Shusher App is a revolutionary new tool for parents that will calm baby easily using soothing sounds. This sleepmatic sounds machine is created using an ancient but doctor-tested and approved technique to help soothe your fussy baby calm with a shusher sound in cradle. \r\n\r\nA simple baby shusher with soothing sounds for baby that works on a single click, making calming sounds like baby lullaby that would work instantly and can be played for hours, recommended by parents, baby photographers, and doctors dealing with babies.\r\n\r\nBy creating calm sounds, safely stop the baby from crying with a rhythmic “shush” sound that engages a baby's natural calming reflex by reminding them of still being in the womb. The shush baby app helps to soothe baby calm and increase the baby sleep timer.\r\n\r\nThe amazing Sound Equalizer allows the app to \"listen\" to your baby crying or not every three minutes and automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby cry volume till baby calms down (so when the baby is wailing, shush is loud; when baby goes quiet, volume settles into a soothing background shush sound to relax baby).\r\n\r\nA newborn sleep magic baby sound machine that works best for a newborn baby to calm down quickly and manage baby sleeping patterns. A sleep aid that creates calming sounds for babies in the form of a shhh sound sleeper that will stop your baby crying, calms down easily, and put baby to sleep. \r\n\r\nThis shhh app calm baby instantly by creating a shusher sound, helping the baby relax in minutes using calming sounds for kids.  This sleepmatic app works like magic for the crying baby and helps parenting so much easier as baby calmer. \r\n\r\nAfter more than two years of testing and research with real moms and real babies, having sudden and long crying baby issues, we came up with the following very valuable feature list of baby soothing sound.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Safe and easy to use baby calming sounds machine. \r\n- Much more effective than simple lullabies or standard white noise.\r\n- Perfectly works for hours in the background and when the phone is locked\r\n- Adjustable Shush baby sound Timer Options (from 15 minutes to 8 hours of continuous shushing!)\r\n- Automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby crying volume.\r\n- Shush sounds played in low light “dark mode” ( night mode) to avoid extra mobile light as baby sleeps.\r\n- Work in other Apps on your Phone while still using the Baby Shusher App.\r\n\r\n*Note: Turn your phone on silent/mute to let the app do its magic.*\r\n \r\n \r\nWhat Real Moms are Saying About the Baby Shusher:\r\n\r\n“I wish I would have known about this sooner. It is truly a miracle for me and baby to have a good night’s rest together!” Mercedes (mother of 3 months old)\r\n\r\n“It is a must try for yourself.” Isabel (mother of 3.5 months old)\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t sure after the 1st time I used it, but it proved to us that it worked better and better thereafter.

I love this app so glad I found it \nnauf4l: was planning to buy a 100$ jump rope which counts skips as i always do 5k skips a day. So after a month was considering this when i came across this app after installing 5 apps of the same.Glad i paid about 2$ for this as it is totally worth it. \nFrankWurst: Accurate jump counter based solely on Apple Watch. App integrates into My Health and Activity App seamlessly. Great product.\ntafty：I enjoy the skipping experience with this app. And it syncs well with Apple Watch\n\nContact me\nE-mail:89208242@qq.com\nTwitter: @haozes\nTelegram Group: t.me/yaoyaonow  \n\nDesign by Haozes\nThanks for the translation: 橙子、金小粉、孟金羽、蔡沛森、Adgar, Fabio Carrilho, Tomás Feliú Ribeiro, Francesco Tirsi, Leonard Pitt Diehl, Zhimin Yang, Massimiliano Benini,Radu Ionescu,Andrés Leon,Dikran Jessaijan, Krishna"

You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

You can also add a label to each measurement depending on the intensity of your exercise or your activity level.\n\nExport & Share Your Measurements\nEach measurement can be shared, exported as a PDF file and even printed on paper directly from within the app. If you have our previous app, Cardiograph Classic, you can transfer all of your measurements to the new app with a couple of taps.\n\nDesigned for iPhone & iPad\nCardiograph is a native app that takes advantage of the iPhone & iPad’s distinctive features like the excellent cameras, 3D Touch (where available) and support for syncing with the Apple Health app (where available).\n\nIMPORTANT: This application, although sufficiently accurate, is not meant as a replacement for professional medical equipment and qualified care. If you have any concerns about your heart’s condition, please consult your physician or general practitioner.\n\nIf you’re having issues with Cardiograph, check out the “More” section within the app or contact us at our support e-mail and we’ll help you out.\n\nGet in touch with us and follow the latest news regarding our apps:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch\nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

It’s perfect for exercise at home.  \n\nAthletes often modify Clock Yourself exercises outdoors for sport-specific agility drills, by visualising a much larger circle and running between the coordinates.  \n\nSimilarly, people who are unable to walk can modify Clock Yourself to practise reaching with their arms, or wheelchair agility! \n\nIf you think you’re too slow to use Clock Yourself, you’re probably wrong.  \nIf you think you’re too fit to use Clock Yourself, you’re definitely wrong! \n\n\n\n\nWHY DID WE MAKE CLOCK YOURSELF?\n\nThe Clock Yourself concept originated in neurological rehabilitation. Now anyone can use it to harness their neuroplasticity.  \n\nIt was developed by Australian physiotherapist @MegLowryPT and software developer Dave Wallace. \n\n\n \nWe had 5 goals: \n\n1. Make it fun - Clock Yourself exercises are so entertaining that you’ll show your friends at parties! \n\n2. Make it versatile  - Both the stepping speed and the cognitive complexity are in your control.  \n\n3. Make it evidence based - This is a volitional step training method. Volitional stepping trains faster steps in all directions to improve your chances of catching yourself during a fall.  \n\n4. Make it portable - There is no need to set up mats, wires or sensors. It also works offline. It only requires internet for your initial download from the App Store.  \n\n5. Make it affordable - This is a once off purchase for pocket change. It has no recurring subscriptions and no advertisements.  \n\n\n\nIS CLOCK YOURSELF AVAILABLE IN OTHER LANGUAGES? \n\nYes and no. \n\nAt this stage, all of the buttons and instructions are in English only.  \n\nHowever, if you click the Options button within each challenge (except for the Simple Colours challenge) you can choose to play the audio prompts in six other languages. \n\nMandarin \nJapanese \nFrench  \nGerman \nSpanish \nDutch  \n\nWhat are you waiting for?  Go ahead and Clock Yourself!\n\n“A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new” - Albert Einstein"

Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

      "label": "Anxiety Release shows you how to release anxious thoughts and feelings naturally, by harnessing the power of your brain. It does this by combining guided instructions and focused attention with bilateral brain stimulation. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a revolutionary treatment which is based on the use of sensory stimulation to alter anxiety-provoking memories and responses. Over 30 randomized controlled studies of EMDR attest to the efficacy of this process. \n\nBecause bilateral stimulation appeals to the unconscious, sensing part of the brain, there is no need for effortful thinking or struggling with feelings.  All you have to do is LISTEN and your brain will do the rest! The App consists of;\n1 x brain training session\n2 x guided anxiety management sessions\n1 x pure bilateral stimulation session (audio & visual)\n1 x safe place exercise\nProgress Log function\nPowerful Bls brain visual \nThis App is suitable for both clinicians and clients\n\nCaution: Persons suffering with complex PTSD or mental health problems, multiple psychological trauma or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without medical supervision."

We take tinnitus therapy seriously and it is our hope that this application will provide relief for your tinnitus symptoms.\n\nThis app provides a wide variety of sounds. Some are simply great nature sounds. Others are different forms and frequencies of white noise. Six of the sounds are musical and were developed by Dr. Jeffrey Thompson, one of the world’s leading experts on sound therapy. Dr. Thompson’s sounds represent the most advanced approach to tinnitus therapy sounds that anyone has ever attempted with fixed pre-recorded sound tracks. Each of his sound tracks have multiple high range frequencies built right into the music so it is more palatable to play - during the day or to sleep with at night.\n\nHow Does This APP Work? \n\nThe sounds in this app can be an effective tool to manage your tinnitus using sound therapy and sound masking to make tinnitus symptoms less noticeable. This masking effect can be particularly effective at night when the surrounding environment is quieter. By listening to pleasant sounds, particularly sounds close to the frequency level of your tinnitus symptoms, your brain will predominantly hear the pleasant sound instead of the annoying tinnitus noise.\n\nFeatures: \n\n24 INCLUDED THERAPEUTIC SOUNDS: \n\n- 11 therapeutic white noise masking sounds: Brown Noise, Cooling Fan, Full Spectrum White Noise, Gray Noise, Natural White Noise, Ocean Surf with White Noise, Pink Noise, Rain with White Noise, Stream with White Noise, White Noise 4 kHz, White Noise 6 kHz\n\n- 6 doctor developed tinnitus therapy sounds: Tinnitus Therapy .9K - 3.2K, Tinnitus Therapy 1 1K - 10K, Tinnitus Therapy 2 1K - 10K, Tinnitus Therapy 2.5K - 5K, Tinnitus Therapy 2K - 8K, Tinnitus Therapy 3 1K - 10K\n\n- 7 authentic nature sounds: Forest Rain, Ocean Rain, Ocean and Crickets, Rain on Tent, Song Birds, Summer Night, Thunderstorm\n\nSESSION TIMER \n\n- 5 to 120 minute session timer with continuous therapy option. \n\n12 BAND GRAPHIC EQUALIZER WITH INDIVIDUAL SOUND MEMORY \n\n- Control precise frequency levels of sound playback with exclusive 12 band graphic equalizer. \n- Tune each sound to your personal frequency levels. \n- Automatically save up to 2 of your favorite equalizer settings for each sound. \n\nSOFT-OFF VOLUME MANAGEMENT \n\n- Full volume control with soft-off volume management. \n\nFREE ACCESS TO ALL NEW SOUNDS \n\n- Free access to new sounds and features with regular application updates offered through the iTunes Store."

You can easily set a pace for yourself.  You can even include a warmup song if you'd like.\n\n** It's YOUR music. **\n\nA run is a terrible time to have to skip through tons of songs you don't like.  Everyone's got their own taste in workout music.  That's why the app plays YOUR music from YOUR iTunes library.\n\n** It's here to help. **\n\nNeed a speed boost while you're running?  Just press the speed buttons in the app.  Cooling down? Press the down arrow.\n\nGot a song that helps get you going?  Set it as a \"Pump Up Song\" and you can play it when you need it the most.\n\n** It's super smart. **\n\nThe app learns which songs you don't like while running & it stops playing them.  Simple as that.\n\nWant more control?  You can also set a blacklist of songs that you don't ever want the jog.fm app to play.\n\nIf you love a song, you can flag it during or after your run and it'll be played more often.\n\n** It plays nice. **\n\nDo you use other fitness apps like RunKeeper or Nike+ (in \"outdoor\" mode)?  Just launch the other fitness app first, then launch jog.fm.

It plays music from your iTunes library.\n\nThere is a one-time setup that will take about one minute (depending on the size of your library).  The app needs to analyze your songs to figure out which ones to play.  An internet connection (WiFi recommended) is required for this setup step because the app is powered by the Echo Nest.\n\nThis app is not yet compatible with iTunes Match.  It'll work, but you may find some long gaps between songs.  \n\nThis app is for running or walking.  We are working on adding more workouts soon!\n\nPlease do not run or walk in traffic."

This is called Brain Synchronization. Your conscious and subconscious function at the same electrical frequency allowing you to rewire your subconscious mind and reinforce your conscious desires.\n\nUsing Subliminal Vision Boards, you will take action towards your goals and dreams like never before! This time there is nothing holding you back from creating amazing and accelerated manifestations in your life!\n\n~ CREATIVE CONSCIOUS VISUALIZATION ~\n\nThe human brain thinks in images. The creative process of visualization is so powerful. The key is to add the exact images of what you want to manifest with absolutely no compromising! You can do this by using Google images or your own images. This feature allows you to focus and manifest the exact image and vision of what you want. \n\nCreate unlimited, fully customizable visualization boards targeting each area of your life.\n\nStart consciously creating your reality with positive and empowering images and affirmations and witness these intentions manifest into your reality.\n\n~ MIND AND BODY HEALING SOUND FREQUENCIES ~\n\nEach word that you see, speak, and hear from your visualization board carries a particular energy and frequency and every cell in your body is listening to every word. \n\nSound is energy. One of the most powerful features on this app is the ability to record your voice onto your vision board. Recording and listening to positive and empowering affirmations develops new brain rewiring scripts, bringing you into an accelerated alignment with the vision of your higher self.\n\nExperience the healing Solfeggio Frequencies ranging from 174hz – 963hz Ancient healing frequencies are set in beautiful soothing music created to release stress, remove energetic blockages and rebalance the spirit, mind, and body.\n\n~ SUBCONSCIOUS REPROGRAMMING ~ \n\nOur minds are like a computer that is being run by old software. This old software consists of thoughts and feelings of scarcity and old limiting Ideas and belief systems. Your subconscious has not been updated since you were a child. Those old beliefs and programs still run the adult that is you today, limiting your true potential by keeping you on the exact same patterns from the past.\n\nYour subconscious causes you to feel emotionally and physically uncomfortable whenever you attempt to do anything new or different. It goes against changing any of your established patterns of behavior.\n\nThe good news is your brain is capable of quickly unlearning limitation and rapidly becoming unlimited! \n\nUsing our unique Subliminal Take 5 feature, your subconscious learns the new story that you create on your visualization board. Each image and affirmation subliminally flashes at a speed that reprograms your subconscious. \n\nReverse negative limited beliefs of scarcity and low self-worth and start to reinforce positive and empowering thoughts and feelings of abundance and prosperity. \n\nDownload Subliminal Vision Boards and experience a life lived in Love, Joy and Alignment with your Higher Self. \n\nWarning: App contains flashing that can intensify certain patterns that can trigger a seizure in people with photosensitive epilepsy. Do not use while driving.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.subliminalvisionboards.com/terms-of-use"

Wonder why her desire for physical intimacy is high one day, then bottomed-out the next? \n\nThere will be no more guessing when you use the Female Forecaster App. \n\nThis new app for boyfriends and husbands lets you know what your sweetheart's moods, libido, energy level and more will be every day.\n\nAnd, it all comes down to where she is in her monthly cycle. \n\n\nTHE SCIENCE\n\nAs three key hormones (estrogen, testosterone and progesterone) rise and fall throughout a woman's monthly cycle, research shows they impact her brain and body in a wide variety of ways.\n\nBecause her hormones repeat the same up and down pattern every cycle, the effects her hormones have on her also repeat the same way cycle after cycle--making her moods, libido, energy and more easy to predict.\n\nFor example...\n\n• On Day 7 of a woman's hormone cycle, she's happier, energetic and experiencing a spike in her sex drive thanks to rising estrogen--making this a day when boyfriends and husbands can do no wrong.\n\n• On Day 19, she's quieter, sluggish and her desire for physical intimacy is low due to sedating progesterone, which is a hormone that reins in sexual desire--so men shouldn't take her \"Not tonight, dear\" personally.\n\n• On Day 27, a drop in estrogen can make her irritable and blue, but she also experiences a rise in libido--which explains why she can be cross with you one minute, but want to cuddle with you the next.\n\nRead full sample forecasts from this app at MyHormonology.com/female-forecaster/sample-days\n\n\nHOW TO USE THE APP\n\nSetting it up takes seconds: Simply input two pieces of information about your girlfriend or wife to launch the app's cycle calendar:\n\n• The typical length of her menstrual cycle (input 28 days if you don't know)\n• The day she's on in her cycle right now (just ask her--her Day 1 is the first day of her most recent period and she just counts from there)\n\nYou can then read your Female Forecast for today or look at any point in the future--tomorrow, next week, next month, even next year--to find out what she'll be like then. \n\n\nAPP BONUSES\n\nThis app also allows you to...\n\n• Get alerts about key days in her cycle (for instance, when her premenstrual week is arriving)\n• Create custom alerts\n• Keep notes\n• Get date ideas and tips for getting on her good side\n\n\nWHO THIS APP IS FOR\n\nMale partners of women who have\n• Healthy menstrual cycles\n• Menstrual cycles lasting anywhere from 22 to 49 days (it's okay if her cycle length varies from month to month)\n• Natural hormones (no hormone birth control)\n\nThis app is not intended for partners of women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, menopausal, taking hormone medications or hormone birth control or have a health disorder that impacts hormones, such as PCOS.\n\nThis app is not intended to help users and their partners avoid pregnancy or become pregnant.\n\n\nFEEDBACK\n\nIf you're experiencing any problem with this app, I want to know. My team and I work quickly to fix issues and provide updates to ensure you get the most out of your experience. Send your feedback to Gabrielle@MyHormonology.com."

You only have to decide for the intensity of the different parts of the exercises. The app will take care of everything else for you.  If you like, you can also choose some meditative music to come along with the exercises.  \r\n\r\nPractice instantly and everywhere: \r\n• requires no sports wear. (also possible in business clothes.) \r\n• No changing shower etc necessary (a little to no sweating) \r\n• No particular surrounding (no matter if inside or outside) \r\n• No atmosphere for meditation (also in noisy surrounding). \r\n• No previous knowledge required. \r\n\r\nThis series of exercises (Origin in the Tang dynasty 618 - 906 AD) originally is called \r\n„Xiang Gong“– literally: “fragrant exercises”:   In this context it means freely directed energy flow. But also as a Buddhist metaphor for „emptiness“ fragrant QiGong within the Zen meaning  gets the spirit to rest. This set consists of fifteen Buddhist wisdom and awareness exercises which lead to inner peace and calmness when practiced regularly. It was found out, that due to the positive effect on the metabolism also the body odour starts to change\r\n\r\nEnergetic benefits of these exercises \r\n• The energy system of the body is put in positive swinging motion. \r\n• It can detoxicate, eliminate and clean itself \r\n• Qi congestions and body blockages can thus resolve \r\n• Unbalance in the energetic structure are balanced \r\n• opens and cleans especially the cardiopulmonary system \r\n• Positive effect on the whole nerve system, skin, bones, brain and sense organs as well as joints.  \r\n\r\nFragrant QiGong can also be helpful for the following troubles: \r\n• Asthma \r\n• High blood pressure \r\n• Chronic headache \r\n• Troubles in the thoracic vertebra and cervical vertebra \r\n• Pain due to tension in neck and shoulder area \r\n• Fragrant Qi Gong I is also successfully used by Chinese doctors against allergic coryza! \r\n    \r\nThis app provides \r\n• Information and background knowledge about the fragrant QiGong systems and their effects \r\n• An illustrated step by step training instruction \r\n• Real time exercise videos where you can define the duration of the exercises according to your individual needs. Thus you can practice a few minutes during your lunch break, or practice a little longer in the morning or evening.  \r\n\r\nNote: Fragrant QiGong is exclusively used for prevention , however due to its energetic effect it might also support healing processes."

Or perhaps you feel you can’t say no to people who constantly make demands of your time, energy and money?\n\nSometimes people have a poor ability to sense when their gut instinct, intuition, or heart is sending them messages that a decision is not right and they are uncomfortable. These messages are ignored and we ends up doing things, committing to things, or having things done to us that were not ok with – often regretting this in the moment or in hindsight.\n\nWhat's different about this app? Other apps may help after the fact. This app is designed to be used when the pressure is on to help you hear your gut instincts in the moment!\n\nCreated by the author of How to Breakup with Friends and Clinical Neuropsychologist, Dr Hannah Korrel, this app will help you to improve your assertiveness skill and learn to hear when your gut instinct is telling you something is wrong… and actually listen to it!\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Using the decision making function, this will help you to slow down, and not rush into something you’ll regret. This will help you arrive at a decision that’s right for you and change your subsequent action by helping you to properly hear the signals of your gut instinct and intuition – it can be used prior to the trigger, during the triggering event, or after the fact on reflection.\n\n- Specialised meditations are designed heighten our ability to hear own gut instinct/intuition/heart.  Poor assertiveness can mean one’s own wishes are difficult to hear, like whispers. In the face of anxiety and pressure screaming in our minds, it is difficult to hear these whispers. Two minute meditations are designed to assist in the moment during the triggering event. Longer meditations are designed to assist building assertiveness skills over all.\n\n- Useful phrases are also provided to help you feel confident in saying ‘no’ by actually give examples of what to say and how to say it!\n\nDisclaimer: this information is general in nature and not designed for individual advice."

These exercises focus on relaxation and give attention to your intestines in a different way. Research has shown that more than half of the participants have fewer complaints after following these exercises!\n\nStarting with Flora can be compared to starting with a sport. All starts are difficult, but when you train regularly, you become better at it. Do not set yourself targets that are too strict! Flora should be a moment of rest and relaxation in your day.

I can fill in my Diary Card discreetly, from anywhere, anytime, and send it directly to my DBT coach. I no longer have to worry about someone coming across my Diary Cards. You can brush up on skills, use it for distress tolerance suggestions, tailor it to your needs, and even journal. I appreciate that I can add personal goals to my diary.

And now we're giving it to you!\n\nA DBT app can have 3 parts: \n\n- A reference manual\n- A behavior tracker\n- A skills coach\n\nDBT Diary Card has all 3 of these parts and utilizes the iOS platform in ways that the other apps available don't and can't.\n\n+ PDF generation\n+ Notification Pane support\n+ Password protection\n+ Advanced text editing\n+ Media playback\n\nWhat DBT Diary Card has to offer:\n\n- Skills. LOTS of them. Every DBT skill you've ever heard about in a group is in here. It can be your quick reference to your skills so that you don't have to carry around your book or binder. Every skill is described in readable language to help you understand them easily and it's all just a quick tap away.\n\n- Emotions. All the \"basic\" emotions are presented, again with descriptions and explanations a quick tap away.\n\n- Behaviors. The most troublesome are pre-loaded.\n\n- Coaching. If you know you need to use a skill but can't think of which one or can't remember how to choose, use the app. The coaching can be your virtual therapist. \n\n- Complete customizability. Are you working on something different or do you have a different understanding of a particular skill or emotion? Change it. It's that easy. You are not wedded to the way it's presented in the app. It's all completely customizable.\n\n- 911 skills.  Put your emergency skills a tap away. You can call directly from the app, listen to your distress tolerance music, remember what apps help in the moment. \n\n- Email. You can email your therapist your diary card on a weekly basis automatically, you can do it manually whenever you'd like or you can have the app remind you.\n\n* Telephony features require an iPhone and voice service."

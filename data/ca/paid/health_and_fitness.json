It was orchestrated to prove that health was not only for the rich, but for everyone. No matter where you come from we are a home for you. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Phatt program teaches you about you, your gut , your health and how to maintain a healthy lifestyle for the rest of your life. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhatt consists of three main steps : \r\n\r\n1. To take away the sugar from your diet & to introduce the value of specific Nutrition.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2. To learn about the foods that will enhance your gut health.  This is the section where you will lose the majority of your weight  and within days you will begin to see results.  Your gut will gain strength as you learn to mono-eat and identify the foods that will compliment your gut health. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   3.   Maintenance:  here you are reintroduced to a wider variety of foods that will enable you to live a healthy lifestyle for the rest of your life.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo successfully complete the program you must complete step 3.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThroughout your program you are gifted with support and this App is connected to your own Personal Mentor.   They will guide you daily and make sure that you are accountable on your journey.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe supply you with meal plans and recipes  but for those of you who need certain dietary requirements there are optional swap-outs.  This App allows that to be done easily without any mathematics on your behalf. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe are extremely proud of this App as it has been in the making for several years.  It has been designed to take away the guess work and to support our customers to the best of our ability. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWeight loss is not only a health journey but it is also a mental journey. It is just as important to recognise that your mental health plays a role in weight loss and needs support. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCongratulations on taking the first step of living a healthier life.   By making a difference to your life you will be surprised how it will suddenly make a difference to your whole family. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYour children will see you make healthy choices and your language to them will change.   We all want to be the best example to our little ones. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHealth Wealth and Choice is the mantra that Phatt sings.  We can teach you about health, we can give you a wealth of knowledge but the greatest gift we will give you is choice.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nChoose to live.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGood luck, stay positive and enjoy the change.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt’s your turn to smile"

      "label": "If you love working out with Apple Watch, but you need more advanced fitness stats, HealthFit is for you.\n\nBy analyzing the workout data stored in Apple Health, HealthFit provides the kind of indispensable tracking and insights you normally only get from premium subscription services. But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times. You can even log which bike or shoes you use, to monitor usage and flag when it’s time to replace them.\n\nHealthFit finds photos you take during your workouts automatically, bringing your activity feed to life with stunning images you can share on social media.\n\nRUNNING POWER ANALYSIS\n\nHealthFit provides advanced running power analysis with the automatically estimated critical power, the weighted average power, the power distribution chart by 25W Increments and the mean maximal power chart which shows your best average power for time periods of one second up to the length of your run.\n\nMULTISPORT AND INTERVAL WORKOUTS\n\nHealthFit is the only app to export multisport workouts as multisession activities\n\nSTATISTICS: UNCOVER HIDDEN FITNESS INSIGHTS\n\nApple Watch gathers so much fitness data, it can sometimes seem overwhelming. HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio.

They will be automatically placed in your AM and/or PM routine as recommended.\n\n\n• ADD CUSTOM PRODUCTS\n\nYou can add custom skincare products from other brands by selecting the option in the top-right menu in the Routine section or from the Custom tab in the Products section.\n\n\n• USE YOUR ROUTINE FOR LAYERING ADVICE\n\nThe products are listed in the recommended layering order, along with advice for when and how to use each product.\n\n\n• KEEP TRACK OF USAGE TO AVOID CONFLICTS\n\nEach morning and evening, check each product off your list to keep track of which treatments you have used. This will allow the app to prevent any conflicts by showing you which products should be avoided.\n\n\n• TRACK YOUR SKIN'S PROGRESS\n\nAny time you notice your skin is looking particularly good or bad, you can make a note of it by pressing on the face icon next to the morning or evening routine. You can also add a comment to note down more details for your own record and add photos to track your progress.\n\n\n• ADD PHOTOS\n\nYou can add photos of your skin to your diary tracker and also add photos of custom products.\n\n\n• REMINDERS & TIMERS\n\nYou can set up notifications to remind you about your daily skin regimen. You can also set timers for products which require a specific wait time. Both can be found in the Settings.\n\n\n\n*** Advanced App Customization ***\n\n• RE-ORDER YOUR ROUTINE\n\nIf you don't wish to follow the recommended layering order, you can choose to re-order the products to fully customize your routine by selecting the option from the top right menu (with 3 dots) of the Routine section. You can also change the order of the layer steps, for instance DECIEM recommends oils before moisturizers but some users prefer the other way around.\n\n\n• USE CONFLICTING PRODUCTS\n\nWhen we recommend not using a product due to conflicts with other products or because you've reached the usage limit, you can choose to ignore the warning and use it anyway. You will then have the option to permanently ignore conflicts on that specific product.\n\n\n• SCHEDULE PRODUCTS\n\nYou can choose specific days of the week for a product if you wish. For instance, you may wish to make it so that the \"AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution\" only appears in your routine on Tuesdays and Fridays.\nYou can also choose dates of the month, e.g. the 1st and 15th of every month.\nAnother useful option is to schedule products for every X days, so you could choose every 2 days to alternate.\n\n\n\n*** Recommended for skin concerns... ***\n\n• Dry & Dehydrated Skin: Achieve plump, healthy-looking hydrated skin.\n• Acne-Prone Skin: Reduce inflammation to help support clear skin.\n• Blemishes & Congestion: Reduce inflammation and brighten the skin.\n• Sensitive Skin: Keep your skin moisturized with this gentle routine.\n• Mature Skin & Wrinkles: Promote youthful skin and reduce the signs of aging.\n• Pigmentation Problems: Gently exfoliate and brighten skin tone.\n• Oily Skin: Rebalance your skin for a healthy, fresh look.\n\n\nPlease note, Skincare Routine (previously known as \"Skincare Regimen Organizer\") has no connection with DECIEM, The Ordinary or any other skincare brand."

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be. Say hello@buddhify.com"

      "label": "Anxiety Release shows you how to release anxious thoughts and feelings naturally, by harnessing the power of your brain. It does this by combining guided instructions and focused attention with bilateral brain stimulation. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a revolutionary treatment which is based on the use of sensory stimulation to alter anxiety-provoking memories and responses. Over 30 randomized controlled studies of EMDR attest to the efficacy of this process. \n\nBecause bilateral stimulation appeals to the unconscious, sensing part of the brain, there is no need for effortful thinking or struggling with feelings.  All you have to do is LISTEN and your brain will do the rest! The App consists of;\n1 x brain training session\n2 x guided anxiety management sessions\n1 x pure bilateral stimulation session (audio & visual)\n1 x safe place exercise\nProgress Log function\nPowerful Bls brain visual \nThis App is suitable for both clinicians and clients\n\nCaution: Persons suffering with complex PTSD or mental health problems, multiple psychological trauma or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without medical supervision."

You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

      "label": "The first app dedicated to training men how to last longer in bed, through two simple exercises you can do anywhere!\n\nStamena trains your “PC muscle,” which makes it easy to stop yourself ejaculating, delays the onset of ejaculation, and even lets you have non-ejaculatory orgasms!\n\nOther kegel apps, built for women, ignore the most important exercise for male sexual stamina: the reverse kegel! \n\nReverse kegels train your PC muscles to relax, making sure that you can slow yourself down during sex. Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

I bought a new iPhone to be able to use it. DBT skills are priceless. I had tried every, other DBT and CBT app. This one follows the traditional DBT program exactly, and is the only Diary Card. Before I had this app, I'd seldom fill in my diary card. Now that I have it, I don't have to keep track of paper, and I rarely miss a day. I can fill in my Diary Card discreetly, from anywhere, anytime, and send it directly to my DBT coach. I no longer have to worry about someone coming across my Diary Cards. You can brush up on skills, use it for distress tolerance suggestions, tailor it to your needs, and even journal. I appreciate that I can add personal goals to my diary. Thank you for this app!\" - iTunes US Review\n\n\"***** I am in IRL-DBT and this app is the perfect complement. Oh. I love that the app is so flexible, that you can make it kind of your own, and the layout is so nice, simple, yet beautiful. For me, a true life-saver! Genius! Without a doubt the best app in my IPhone... Get it now!\" - iTunes Sweden Review\n\n\"***** Perfect! Worth the money!\" - iTunes US Review\n\nAs an educated consumer, it's important to know to whom you're listening. DBT Diary Card was created by a Ph.D. psychologist trained directly by Dr. Marsha Linehan and at the Duke University Medical Center; we are experts in DBT, providing consultation to many in our community. And now we're giving it to you!\n\nA DBT app can have 3 parts: \n\n- A reference manual\n- A behavior tracker\n- A skills coach\n\nDBT Diary Card has all 3 of these parts and utilizes the iOS platform in ways that the other apps available don't and can't.\n\n+ PDF generation\n+ Notification Pane support\n+ Password protection\n+ Advanced text editing\n+ Media playback\n\nWhat DBT Diary Card has to offer:\n\n- Skills. LOTS of them. Every DBT skill you've ever heard about in a group is in here. It can be your quick reference to your skills so that you don't have to carry around your book or binder. Every skill is described in readable language to help you understand them easily and it's all just a quick tap away.\n\n- Emotions. All the \"basic\" emotions are presented, again with descriptions and explanations a quick tap away.\n\n- Behaviors. The most troublesome are pre-loaded.\n\n- Coaching. If you know you need to use a skill but can't think of which one or can't remember how to choose, use the app. The coaching can be your virtual therapist. \n\n- Complete customizability. Are you working on something different or do you have a different understanding of a particular skill or emotion? Change it. It's that easy. You are not wedded to the way it's presented in the app. It's all completely customizable.\n\n- 911 skills.  Put your emergency skills a tap away. You can call directly from the app, listen to your distress tolerance music, remember what apps help in the moment. \n\n- Email. You can email your therapist your diary card on a weekly basis automatically, you can do it manually whenever you'd like or you can have the app remind you.\n\n* Telephony features require an iPhone and voice service."

Love this app! Allows me to track my progress and see before and after pics!!! Then I can share with social media or friends through text message!! So simple to use!!!!\"\n                                                                  by Good nurse79\n \n\n\n\nStart a collection of progress photos that stores your weight and date and use the reminder feature to stay on track.\n\nYou probably think that measuring your weight and body fat is a good way to track your fitness progress but really those metrics can be misleading. \n\nYou could be losing muscle and gaining fat or vice versa, how will you know by only looking at how your weight is changing? The most honest measurements you can take are pictures.\n \nFit-stitch uses both of these measurements so you can see how you’re really progressing. \n\nWith Fit-Stitch, you can create Before & After pictures to capture your ongoing fitness transformation. \n\nStudies have shown that tracking your progress increases the success rate of fitness training, resulting in more people staying on track and achieving better results.\n\nPeople are busy and usually forget to track their progress - that’s why Fit-stitch has built-in reminders."

      "label": "Heart Rate Variability measurements recorded by your Apple Watch can give you insight on the stress level your body is under. By using HRV Tracker to track short-term measurements and long-term trends, you can see how your workload during the day, workout sessions or sleeping etc affect your body's readiness, recovery and stress level. Simply put, the higher your HRV is, the better.\n\n***Requires an HRV capable Apple Watch with watchOS 6 or later***\nHRV Tracker for Watch integrates with the Health app and uses data stored in the Health app. To make sure your Apple Watch is capable of recording HRV measurements, please open the Health app on your iPhone to see if any HRV measurements exists. Go to > Health app > Browse > Heart > Hear Rate Variability.\n\n***Get Notified***\nHRV Tracker makes spotting changes in your HRV easy by monitoring your HRV measurements in the background and showing notifications after your HRV drops under or rises above your desired levels. HRV Tracker will monitor changes in individual measurements and also your 24 hour HRV average. You can change the default notification levels directly in your Apple Watch app. Please note that notifications can get postponed for example because of a low battery level.\n\n***Apple Watch for daily tracking***\nBrowse through last seven days of HRV measurements by using the digital crown. See how measurements compare to your seven day period and individual days. By tapping the graph you can toggle through the first values of each day. Use complications on your Apple Watch to stay informed on changes in your HRV. \n\nBesides the automatically recorded HRV measurements you can use the Breathe app on your Apple Watch to record new HRV measurements. Start a Breathe session in the Breathe app and after the session ends a new HRV measurement will be available in HRV Tracker.\n\n***Compare HRV to other key metrics***\nFind possible causes for changes in HRV by using the comparison graphs available on your Apple Watch:\n-Sleep hours: By default HRV Tracker will use sleep data provided by sleep apps that add sleep data to HealthKit. If no sleep data is available HRV Tracker will calculate estimated sleep hours per night (estimated sleep time will only be available in the Apple Watch app)\n-Activity: By default HRV Tracker will use your Active Energy (calories) as the activity metric. In the HRV Tracker Apple Watch app you can choose to use a custom activity score that emphasizes the intensity of daily activity.\n-Daily resting heart rate (RHR).\nToggle between comparison graphs by tapping the upper part of the screen.\n\n***Follow Long-term HRV trend***\nFollow your long-term HRV trend on your iPhone and compare your short term measurements to all-time data.\n-Select week from weekly graph to see daily HRV values of the selected week.\n-Browse through all daily HRV values of the selected day\n-Compare daily HRV averages to other relevant daily metrics: Activity, Sleep (if available in the Health app) and Resting Heart Rate\n\n***Widgets on iPhone***\n-Medium sized widget with chart showing all daily hrv values\n-Multiple small widgets to choose from\n\n***Privacy***\nData read from the Apple HealthKit database is only used to show information related to your Heart Rate Variability. Information read by HRV Tracker is only stored and used locally on your iPhone and Apple Watch. \n\n***How is it measured***\nHeart rate variability measurements used by HRV Tracker are calculated by measuring the variation between individual heartbeats. Your Apple Watch automatically measures your HRV in the background and stores the outcome into HealthKit. HealthKit uses SDNN heart rate variability, which is calculated using the standard deviation of the inter-beat (RR) intervals between normal heartbeats (measured in milliseconds). Besides background measurements generated automatically by your Apple Watch you can use the Breathe app on your Apple Watch to generate new measurements."

With each new week, Get Running’s human voice coach gradually builds up your pace, until you’re running for a whole half-hour!\n\nGet Running is the only Couch to 5K App that:\n\n• Coaches like a human – with hundreds of studio-recorded progress and encouragement prompts.\n• Supports and encourages you – talk with fellow running rookies on the Get Running forum.\n• Lets you share (NEW!) – share Get Running with up to three other runners: you all get your own log and settings!\n• Helps you plan – rest days help you recover, and Get Running knows the best day for your next run.\n• Displays your next move – the unique Run Clock, customised for each workout, gives complete visibility and understanding.\n\nIn addition, Get Running:\n\n• Works with or without music. Or listen to podcasts and audio books.\n• Fits your schedule – just three workouts a week of 20 to 30 minutes.\n• Logs your achievements – with an illuminating visual record of your progress.\n\nThousands of people have changed their lives with Get Running and you will too! Whether you’re running for your health, training for a 5K, or building to conquer a marathon — Get Running!\n\nGet Running's users say:\n\n• Just finished week 9 run 3 and all I can say is this app changed my life. Great job.\n\n• I LOVE your app. I have tried several but Yours is the BEST for me. I am 60 years young this year & a cancer survivor. I have set the goal to run 5 K races. I use your program as my trainer, it is SUPER. Thank You. – Vickie Wheeler by email\n\n• I tried the top selling \"Couch to 5k\" App before I purchased this one, and this one is much nicer to use. The voice reminders are very helpful. I like how it pauses your music instead of talking over it. I highly recommend it over the others.\n\n• Thank you so much for this little gem of an app. I had a look at others like it but this wins hands down. It is so brilliantly simple with a great interface.\n\n• Thank you! This app has changed my life. I was unfit and didn't do any regular exercise. I always blamed my asthma for being the reason I couldn't run for longer than a minute, but now I know it's because I was unfit! I have signed up for a 5k race too! – @amyriddett on Twitter\n\n• Really great app. I'm actually looking forward to running. I listen to podcasts and this app is terrific at pausing the show to make it's announcements. I don't miss anything that was said. Outstanding."

Use any of the available, most popular 1 Rep Max formulas to estimate your 1 rep maximum weight and keep a log to see your progress over time.\n\nSimply select a lift type, enter a weight and a number of repetitions (up to 10), and tap the Calculate button to see your 1 Rep Max.\n\nWith My 1 Rep Max Premium, you can create your own custom lifts and use more than 10 repetitions to perform calculations.\n\nA Note About Safety:\nOne rep maximum calculators are used to estimate the maximum amount you can lift. The degree of accuracy can vary significantly depending on your experience with weight training as well as your muscular composition. Most one rep maximum calculators are designed for experienced strength trainers so, if you are inexperienced, you may find your actual one rep maximum is much lower because your body is not accustomed to the stress of lifting heavy weight. Because it can be dangerous to attempt to lift your estimated maximum, always have a spotter with you. Seriously.\n\nMy 1 Rep Max will never bother you to request a rating or review. However,  if you'd like to take the time to rate or review it, you can do so from the Settings screen and that would be swell."

You can change your target intake at any time.\nRecord the foods and amounts you eat using the barcode scanner, speech recognition (touch the microphone icon), or by favoriting foods and using the serving sizes provided (mainly those suggested by USDA Food Data Central, but you can change these at any time). Your progress towards your target daily intake will be visible immediately in real-time. \nYou can also view your progress over time on the Month view dashboard, and export food diaries and fiber intake into a spreadsheet for your own information or to share with healthcare providers.\nSynchronize the app with all your Apple devices and First Line Medical Communications Ltd apps. Apple's HealthKit functionality is integrated in the app's user interface so you can share data with Apple's Health app.\nThe app is curated and contains 325+ common (mainly healthy) foods and drinks and you can add your own branded and other foods and recipes at any time using the barcode scanner, voice recognition or the keyboard. This means that provided you add your barcoded foods to the app via the \"Add food\"  tab the app can function without access to the Internet (it will need access to the internet and OpenFoodFacts.org if a barcode is not in the app's database).\nAlso useful nutritional information via the Info tab.\nThe interface is intuitive to navigate, but you may find it useful to familiarise yourself with the full functionality of the app by touching the icons, words, and bars on every screen and swiping left and right on the Tracker screen."

This feature is known as the custom frequency feature. In addition the Pro version features an alternating mode which cycles between ton1 and tone 2.

This has potential applications for binaural beat protocols for the entrainment of brain rhythms and may have application for cerebellar cortex stimulation. \n\n \n\nThe Pro Version due to its flexibility also lends itself for notch-like treatment protocols that have been shown to attenuate tinnitus and Stochastic Vestibular Stimulation.\n\n \n\nThe Pro version was design to meet the needs of professionals seeking an application for the generation of acoustical auditory stimulus."

      "label": "FTP Zones allows you to quickly calculate the power corresponding to a specific percentage of your Functional Threshold Power (FTP). Don't know your FTP? Use the app to take a test.\n\nYour FTP is the maximum average power that you could sustain for one hour. It is a common benchmark used by cyclists to determine fitness levels. Training sessions or group exercise classes at the gym are often structured into different stages of effort measured as a percentage of your FTP: longer, lower effort stages punctuated by shorter bursts of higher energy. Working at a percentage of FTP instead of a specific power is a great way to tailor a workout to your own level of fitness.\n\nDuring structured workouts, adjust the percentage and the app shows the target power for that stage. For example, 85% of a 230 Watt FTP is 196 Watts. Use FTP Zones instead of trying do the math in your head!\n\nIf you don't know your FTP or want to measure improvements over time, use the app to take a 1, 3, 5 or 20 minute test. The app can calculate your FTP from your average power over the test period (your bike must have a display which shows this information). Alternatively, calculate the average power required to achieve a particular FTP test result.\n\nFTP Zones has a big, bold user interface to make it easier to make adjustments and see the target power during your workout.\n\nFor more information see https://hacknicity.com/ftpzones or email me at support@hacknicity.com"

Calcium is essential for strong bones, muscles, heart, teeth, skin, hair, and nails. Deficiency results in weakened bones and teeth prone to fracture (a break), weakened muscles with muscle cramps and spasms, dry skin, and brittle hair and nails. \nThis app will set your default daily calcium target as the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) provided in the US Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025, which depends on your age and sex. You can change this target at any time.\nRecord the foods and amounts you eat using the barcode scanner, speech recognition, by favoriting foods, or using Search and using the serving sizes provided. The serving sizes are mainly those suggested by USDA Food Data Central, but can be changed at any time. Your progress towards your target daily intake will be shown on the dashboard in real-time. \nYou can also view your progress over time on the Month view dashboard, and export food diaries and calcium intake into a spreadsheet for your own information or to share with healthcare providers.\nYou can synchronize the app with all your Apple devices and other First Line Medical Communications Ltd nutrient counter apps.\nApple's HealthKit functionality is integrated in the app's user interface so you can share data with Apple's Health app.\nThe app is curated and contains 325+ common (mainly healthy) foods and drinks and you can add your own branded and other foods and recipes at any time using the barcode scanner, voice recognition or the keyboard. \nAlso useful nutritional information via the Info tab.\nThe interface is quick and intuitive to navigate, but you may find it useful to familiarise yourself with the full functionality of the app by touching the icons, words, and bars on every screen and swiping left and right on the Tracker screen."

You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

(Or the 1609 km club, which is not quite as catchy, but still an awesome goal).\n\nThis app was inspired by listening to a podcast interview with the running coach at San Quentin prison. The 1000 mile club was started there in 2005, with the goal of training willing inmates to run 1000 miles in a calendar year, all within the prison yard.\n\nThis has inspired me to set the same long-term goal for my running, and hence the app was born. I hope you'll join me to embrace the freedom of running, and to extend and motivate yourself over the long term.\n\nUse the 1000 Mile Club app to keep track of your one goal. Make it your own - if you want to swim 500km in 8 months then be my guest! And you can easily share a snapshot of your progress with your social media platform of choice.\n\nPlease note - this app does not automatically track your miles. With a couple of taps you can enter your own mileage each time you complete a run (or cycle/swim/other).\n\nHere's a link to the interview: https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/ninetonoon/audio/2018691993/inside-the-san-quentin-prison-marathon"

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

      "label": "The first app dedicated to training men how to last longer in bed, through two simple exercises you can do anywhere!\n\nStamena trains your “PC muscle,” which makes it easy to stop yourself ejaculating, delays the onset of ejaculation, and even lets you have non-ejaculatory orgasms!\n\nOther kegel apps, built for women, ignore the most important exercise for male sexual stamina: the reverse kegel! \n\nReverse kegels train your PC muscles to relax, making sure that you can slow yourself down during sex. Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

The DQS Mobile app was designed to make it as easy as possible to calculate a Diet Quality Score each day.\n\nAs you eat throughout the day, enter the servings of each category of food that you consume. Tap a box to consume one serving of that category, tap it again and it will become a half serving, and one more tap will set it back to zero for that box. You can tap the category name to view an explanation of what foods fall under that category. Your total DQS score for the day is shown in the upper right corner of the page.  DQS data is saved for each day you track it. \n\nYou can also log your weight and body fat % on the bottom of the Tracking page. We recommend you log your weight no more than once per week.\n\nThe Graphs page lets you see how you are doing with your Diet Quality Score over time. You can view your data over the last week, month or year. When viewing yearly data, it is displayed as 52 week-long averages. You can view graphs showing your total DQS, your weight, or your DQS score by specific category.\n\nYou can set a target weight, body fat % and a target DQS score on the Profile page."

Another option would be to use HealthExport Remote to access your data remotely from your computer.\n\nHealthExport Remote lets you visualize your health data on a customizable dashboard accessible from a browser on your computer. You can also perform remote CSV exports on the website. Health data is automatically synced to the service multiple times per day in the background, so there is no need for opening the app on your phone anymore. The data is end to end encrypted between your phone and your browser, thus nobody except you can read it. Note that HealthExport Remote requires a monthly subscription payment due to monthly fees associated with running the service.\n\nHealth data types are divided into three categories:\n1.

We have listened and responded to our customer complaints with this -- the best SleepFan ever.  \n\nThe Fans -\n SleepFan currently includes 17 fan sounds, there's something here for everyone.  Of course, you can also add your own fan sounds.  Your recordings are made into seamless audio loops.  You can adjust oscillation and stereo effect on your own recordings, too.\n\nThe Backgrounds -\n Ambient sounds (5 included) are stereo tracks, unaffected by fan oscillation.  These noise sources can be used solo or mixed with a fan sound.  You may also add your own sounds to the Ambient tracks, but they will be mono (since most devices don't have stereo microphones).\n\nTimer & Alarms -\n Five alarms are included, but you may record your own.  If no alarm is chosen, Timer will still shut down the fan and ambient sounds after your requested duration.\n\nTo all that have provided feedback, we thank you!!"

      "label": "By analyzing HRV and Stress along with additional data, SweetBeat HRV provides a deeper dive into health and provides insight into what activities you engage in that effect the health metrics you care about.\n\nIMPORTANT: SweetBeat requires external hardware:\nA tested Bluetooth Low Energy Heart Rate Monitor, Wellue DuoEK hand held heart rate monitor or a Wellue VisualBeat heart rate monitor patch.  While other manufacturers wrist worn devices work well for heart rate, their wrist worn heart rate monitors are not accurate enough for HRV and so are not supported. The iWatch is not supported.  The wrist worn devices can be used for Food Sensitivity tests.\n\n•Please visit https://www.sweetwaterhrv.com/healthsensors.shtml for a list of compatible Heart Rate Monitors devices.\n\nThe next big trend in bio-hacking is understanding the relationships between different metrics. SweetBeat HRV integrates and correlates data from popular fitness platforms like MapMyFitness, Fitbit and Withings.  SweetBeat HRV will also import your Apple Health app data (SDNN, Resting Heart Rate, Average Heart Rate) that is collected by the iWatch or other devices authorized to store metric in the Health app.  This data is for viewing purposes only and is not used in any HRV calculation or correlation.\n\nSweetBeat has four main components:\n•Monitor Stress\n•HRV for Training\n•Food Sensitivity\n•Data Correlation\n\nMonitor Stress: \nWith SweetBeatHRV, you can see your stress levels in real time, giving you the ability to take action to reduce stress. If your chosen stress threshold is reached, SweetBeat’s Relax screen prompts you with a deep breathing screen that includes calming images.\n\n•Stats: The stats screen more widely referred to as the “geek” screen, shows all the metrics being measured. If using the HealthPatch, the user can view the additional provided metrics.\n•Graph: The graph screen shows a real-time building graph of your heart rate from RR Intervals. Turning the phone 90 degrees counter-clockwise will bring up the graph in landscape. \n•Export RR Intervals: SweetBeat provides RR interval export capability. \n\nHRV For Training: \nIn competitive sports, improved performance is often affected by alternating periods of intensive training with periods of relative rest. SweetBeatHRV measures HRV, an objective measure of your body’s response to each workout and provides training recommendations based on the morning reading. \n\nFood Sensitivity Test: \nIf you are sensitive to certain foods, you may not experience symptoms, though your body reacts by elevating your heart rate after eating an offending food. Low level food sensitivities may contribute to inflammation. This inflammation tells the body to hang onto stored fat to combat whatever stress caused the hormonal release. SweetBeatHRV measures your pulse three times after eating and assigns either a “X” (sensitive) or a green checkmark (not sensitive).  \n\nCorrelation: \nThe correlation screen uses a patent pending algorithm to correlate all of the data the user has shared with SweetBeat. This data will come from the app itself and any other apps or devices the user has authorized (Fitbit, Withings, and/or MapMyFitness). \n\nThe correlation feature turns your data into useful information and provides insight into what combination of activities lead to desired HRV, stress or weight, giving you the knowledge you need to achieve your health and fitness goals.\n\nSweetBeat Features: \n•Post your session summary on Twitter to share with friends.\n•Customize your Relax screen images with your favorite pictures. \n•Track your heart rate recovery after exercising. \n•Track the foods you have eaten and your body’s response to them. \n•Save and upload sessions to your secure MySweetBeat account at www.BeatHealthy.com. \n•Email your RRs and session data for personal analysis off-line\n•View your Apple Health data with trend lines"

      "label": "We have developed this App in a way that allows you to begin to track the changes, that you are making in your life. By rewarding yourself financially and grading your efforts, it would give you an opportunity to subconsciously program yourself into abundance.

We want you to begin to set up an account that shows that you are growing financially and to subconsciously program yourself into a new future.\n\nWe recommend, that you review what you have done during the day and use the App to remind yourself, of who you want to be and who you no longer want to be. And at the end of the day, you should reward yourself for your efforts so you can begin to further program your autonomic nervous system into that future. We recommend then that you do your mental banking in the evening, because as you begin to pay yourself, you are going to begin to subconsciously create a new habit of self.\n\nThis App contains:\n- Set a change for your life or set something, you want to get rid of\n- You will see all your changes in your daily timeline\n- Pay yourself, if you achieved your daily tasks.

This will reminds you to your future – your creations will come true.\n\n\n\nFuthermore this App contains the Meditations „Morning and Eveningmeditation“.

You'll be so busy enjoying all your “yes” foods all day long that you'll barely have time to dwell on the ones you're avoiding. So, let's quickly get them out of the way. There are only a couple of them.\n\nAvoid:\nSugar and white flour (which is actually sugar in your bloodstream) are out. You can do it!\n\nKNOW YOUR FUELS!\n• S (Satisfying) meals focus on fats for fuel.\n• E (Energizing) meals focus on carbs for fuel.\n• FP (Fuel Pull) meals focus on neither fat nor carbs (these foods can go with any meal type).\n• XO (Crossover) meals focus on both fat and carbs. \n\nHERE'S HOW IT WORKS:\n• Separate fats and carbs for weight loss. \n• Make sure every meal contains protein.\n• Don't neglect your veggies - they belong in your meals every day! \n• Juggle your fuels - don't get in a rut. Enjoy foods from every food group!\n\n> Use our free food analyzer app to figure out what foods are what fuel or check out the food lists in our books! For the full details on how all this works, check out the Trim Healthy Starter Book or the Trim Healthy Plan Book. \n\nKNOW YOUR SEASON!\nSeparating fats and carbs isn’t forever! Those who are pregnant, nursing, or wishing to maintain their weight should enjoy some XO meals. Even enjoying a few XO meals here and there during the weight loss seasons is okay too. Your journey is yours and may not look like everyone else’s… so find your groove and what works for you and roll with it! Remember this is a gentle journey. Give yourself lots of grace and lots of time to get to the finish line. It's not a fast-paced race, but a slow, steady and amazingly joyful one."

Diabetes Diet is a recipe app that provides hundreds of recipes to help you lead a healthier and happier life. \n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nDiabetes mellitus (MEL-ih-tus), or simply, diabetes, is a group of diseases characterized by high blood glucose levels that result from defects in the body's ability to produce and/or use insulin.\n\nIn type 2 diabetes, the most common form of diabetes, either the body does not produce enough insulin or the cells ignore the insulin. Insulin is necessary for the body to be able to use glucose for energy. When you eat food, the body breaks down all of the sugars and starches into glucose, which is the basic fuel for the cells in the body. Insulin takes the sugar from the blood into the cells. When glucose builds up in the blood instead of going into cells, it can lead to diabetes complications.\n\nEating well-balanced meals is an essential part of taking better care of yourself. By eating well-balanced meals in the correct amounts, you can learn to thrive with diabetes.\n\nFeatures \n\n- Elegant and intuitive interface \n\n- Over 100 Diabetes Diet food recipes \n\n- Recipes for all meal types including: breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack \n\n- Star your favorites for easy reference \n\n- Filter menu to sort \n\n- Search feature to quickly find your favorite recipe \n\nDownload the Diabetes Diet app and start feeling healthier today!\n\n\n------- \n\nDisclaimer: \n\nThe Diabetes Diet app is only intended to provide general information, without independent verification of the accuracy of the information provided to it, and the information is specifically not intended to be a substitute for medical diagnosis or treatment by your physician or other health care professional.

      "label": "Grapefruit is an app for managing your mental health. Write your journal, track your habits and emotions, and use the unique mood rating system to tie everything together. You then get back real data on your mental health that you can use to make your life a well-oiled smile factory.\n\nHow it works:\n\n1. Write In Your Journal\n\nOne of the best things you can do for your mental health is keep a journal. They help you understand your thoughts, reduce stress, and many other benefits. So Grapefruit is centered around that. You'll see instant benefits from just journaling alone, but to get the most out of it, you can go deeper.\n\n2. Track Your Feelings (And Whatever Else)\n\nSay you're struggling with a particular emotion (e.g. depression, or anger) and trying to identify the triggers. Wouldn't it be helpful to read back your journal for just the days when you felt that emotion? That's one way our emotion tracking can help. But what about two emotions? What happened on days when you were sad and angry? You can look at those days as well. Though ... maybe you won't want to.\n\n3. Review Your Data\n\nDo you know how often you have a good day? That’s one of the many things Grapefruit will show you. Why? Because it’s so much easier to weather the storms when you know exactly when the sun is coming. Now, how about days of the week? Or most common emotions? When you rate your days and track a few things, the results can be really impactful.\n\n4. Make It Your Own\n\nThere are as many ways to use it as there are people! Add questions that are specific to your own unique experience. Change the emotions/feelings list to reflect how you describe your feelings, or replace it entirely with a list of different cheeses if you want.\n\nIt's your journey, we're just here to help!\n\n-----\n\nSome of our favourite quotes:\n\n\"This is a great app and it is truly making a difference in my life! I really love it and now I can't imagine a day without rating it here.\"\n\n\"I thought my life was filled with bad days. I'm discovering that I'm not having as many bad days as I thought. I'm already starting to have a more positive outlook on life.\""

This sleepmatic sounds machine is created using an ancient but doctor-tested and approved technique to help soothe your fussy baby calm with a shusher sound in cradle. \r\n\r\nA simple baby shusher with soothing sounds for baby that works on a single click, making calming sounds like baby lullaby that would work instantly and can be played for hours, recommended by parents, baby photographers, and doctors dealing with babies.\r\n\r\nBy creating calm sounds, safely stop the baby from crying with a rhythmic “shush” sound that engages a baby's natural calming reflex by reminding them of still being in the womb. The shush baby app helps to soothe baby calm and increase the baby sleep timer.\r\n\r\nThe amazing Sound Equalizer allows the app to \"listen\" to your baby crying or not every three minutes and automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby cry volume till baby calms down (so when the baby is wailing, shush is loud; when baby goes quiet, volume settles into a soothing background shush sound to relax baby).\r\n\r\nA newborn sleep magic baby sound machine that works best for a newborn baby to calm down quickly and manage baby sleeping patterns. A sleep aid that creates calming sounds for babies in the form of a shhh sound sleeper that will stop your baby crying, calms down easily, and put baby to sleep. \r\n\r\nThis shhh app calm baby instantly by creating a shusher sound, helping the baby relax in minutes using calming sounds for kids.  This sleepmatic app works like magic for the crying baby and helps parenting so much easier as baby calmer. \r\n\r\nAfter more than two years of testing and research with real moms and real babies, having sudden and long crying baby issues, we came up with the following very valuable feature list of baby soothing sound.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Safe and easy to use baby calming sounds machine. \r\n- Much more effective than simple lullabies or standard white noise.\r\n- Perfectly works for hours in the background and when the phone is locked\r\n- Adjustable Shush baby sound Timer Options (from 15 minutes to 8 hours of continuous shushing!)\r\n- Automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby crying volume.\r\n- Shush sounds played in low light “dark mode” ( night mode) to avoid extra mobile light as baby sleeps.\r\n- Work in other Apps on your Phone while still using the Baby Shusher App.\r\n\r\n*Note: Turn your phone on silent/mute to let the app do its magic.*\r\n \r\n \r\nWhat Real Moms are Saying About the Baby Shusher:\r\n\r\n“I wish I would have known about this sooner. It is truly a miracle for me and baby to have a good night’s rest together!” Mercedes (mother of 3 months old)\r\n\r\n“It is a must try for yourself.” Isabel (mother of 3.5 months old)\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t sure after the 1st time I used it, but it proved to us that it worked better and better thereafter.

      "label": "The Healing Your Thoughts App improves your state of health and well being by assisting you to transform your negative thoughts that arise throughout the day. It is important to break the habit of dropping into defeatist thoughts and attitudes and learn how to stop yourself from entering into a negative loop that blocks you from achieving your desired outcomes.\n\nThe Healing Your Thoughts App helps to shift the way you think throughout the day and will help to uplift you during challenging times. You are not denying any feelings you are experiencing. Rather it is a process of rephrasing your thoughts to change your train of thought which will lead you to a positive outcome.\n\nYou can program the app for the interval of when you would like to receive an alert of bells, a Tibetan bowl, or chimes being played. When you hear the alert you will read the message that asks you to reflect on: “What are you thinking about right now?” Your thoughts and words are seeds that when planted into your inner garden will grow into plants that do impact your life. It is important to cultivate a deep and rich inner garden to create true joy and health in your life.\n\nOnce you receive the alert go into the Library and tap on the category “word”, “phrase”, “blessing”, or “photo”. A word, phrase, blessing, or photo will appear that will inspire you to stop your current thinking and transmute/transform any negative thinking into positive thoughts. This will also help to shift your attitude and even create an inner smile.\n\nYou can use the words, phrases, blessings, or photos provided. Or you can upload your own.\n\nThe result will be that you will experience feeling more uplifted. In this way you feed yourself with love and light. This will improve your life, giving you more energy, and help you to be more creative in your life and in your work. You will be able to radiate love and light towards yourself, your loved ones, friends, co-workers, and into the world."

They will be automatically placed in your AM and/or PM routine as recommended.\n\n\n• ADD CUSTOM PRODUCTS\n\nYou can add custom skincare products from other brands by selecting the option in the top-right menu in the Routine section or from the Custom tab in the Products section.\n\n\n• USE YOUR ROUTINE FOR LAYERING ADVICE\n\nThe products are listed in the recommended layering order, along with advice for when and how to use each product.\n\n\n• KEEP TRACK OF USAGE TO AVOID CONFLICTS\n\nEach morning and evening, check each product off your list to keep track of which treatments you have used. This will allow the app to prevent any conflicts by showing you which products should be avoided.\n\n\n• TRACK YOUR SKIN'S PROGRESS\n\nAny time you notice your skin is looking particularly good or bad, you can make a note of it by pressing on the face icon next to the morning or evening routine. You can also add a comment to note down more details for your own record and add photos to track your progress.\n\n\n• ADD PHOTOS\n\nYou can add photos of your skin to your diary tracker and also add photos of custom products.\n\n\n• REMINDERS & TIMERS\n\nYou can set up notifications to remind you about your daily skin regimen. You can also set timers for products which require a specific wait time. Both can be found in the Settings.\n\n\n\n*** Advanced App Customization ***\n\n• RE-ORDER YOUR ROUTINE\n\nIf you don't wish to follow the recommended layering order, you can choose to re-order the products to fully customize your routine by selecting the option from the top right menu (with 3 dots) of the Routine section. You can also change the order of the layer steps, for instance DECIEM recommends oils before moisturizers but some users prefer the other way around.\n\n\n• USE CONFLICTING PRODUCTS\n\nWhen we recommend not using a product due to conflicts with other products or because you've reached the usage limit, you can choose to ignore the warning and use it anyway. You will then have the option to permanently ignore conflicts on that specific product.\n\n\n• SCHEDULE PRODUCTS\n\nYou can choose specific days of the week for a product if you wish. For instance, you may wish to make it so that the \"AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution\" only appears in your routine on Tuesdays and Fridays.\nYou can also choose dates of the month, e.g. the 1st and 15th of every month.\nAnother useful option is to schedule products for every X days, so you could choose every 2 days to alternate.\n\n\n\n*** Recommended for skin concerns... ***\n\n• Dry & Dehydrated Skin: Achieve plump, healthy-looking hydrated skin.\n• Acne-Prone Skin: Reduce inflammation to help support clear skin.\n• Blemishes & Congestion: Reduce inflammation and brighten the skin.\n• Sensitive Skin: Keep your skin moisturized with this gentle routine.\n• Mature Skin & Wrinkles: Promote youthful skin and reduce the signs of aging.\n• Pigmentation Problems: Gently exfoliate and brighten skin tone.\n• Oily Skin: Rebalance your skin for a healthy, fresh look.\n\n\nPlease note, Skincare Routine (previously known as \"Skincare Regimen Organizer\") has no connection with DECIEM, The Ordinary or any other skincare brand."

      "label": "Anxiety Release shows you how to release anxious thoughts and feelings naturally, by harnessing the power of your brain. It does this by combining guided instructions and focused attention with bilateral brain stimulation. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a revolutionary treatment which is based on the use of sensory stimulation to alter anxiety-provoking memories and responses. Over 30 randomized controlled studies of EMDR attest to the efficacy of this process. \n\nBecause bilateral stimulation appeals to the unconscious, sensing part of the brain, there is no need for effortful thinking or struggling with feelings.  All you have to do is LISTEN and your brain will do the rest! The App consists of;\n1 x brain training session\n2 x guided anxiety management sessions\n1 x pure bilateral stimulation session (audio & visual)\n1 x safe place exercise\nProgress Log function\nPowerful Bls brain visual \nThis App is suitable for both clinicians and clients\n\nCaution: Persons suffering with complex PTSD or mental health problems, multiple psychological trauma or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without medical supervision."

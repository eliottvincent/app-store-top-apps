      "label": "If you love working out with Apple Watch, but you need more advanced fitness stats, HealthFit is for you.\n\nBy analyzing the workout data stored in Apple Health, HealthFit provides the kind of indispensable tracking and insights you normally only get from premium subscription services. But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times.

HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio.

      "label": "DBT Diary Card is the only DBT iPhone app designed and created by a licensed and DBT intensively trained psychologist.\n\nHighlights of version 3.0:\n\n+ graphing data across time\n+ on device PDF viewing\n+ daily reminders\n+ Password locking to prevent others from seeing your diary cards.\n\nRead what our actual users say:\n\n\"***** Best DBT app available!!!\nSimply put, this is the most helpful DBT or CBT app available. I bought a new iPhone to be able to use it. DBT skills are priceless. I had tried every, other DBT and CBT app. This one follows the traditional DBT program exactly, and is the only Diary Card. Before I had this app, I'd seldom fill in my diary card. Now that I have it, I don't have to keep track of paper, and I rarely miss a day. I can fill in my Diary Card discreetly, from anywhere, anytime, and send it directly to my DBT coach. I no longer have to worry about someone coming across my Diary Cards. You can brush up on skills, use it for distress tolerance suggestions, tailor it to your needs, and even journal. I appreciate that I can add personal goals to my diary. Thank you for this app!\" - iTunes US Review\n\n\"***** I am in IRL-DBT and this app is the perfect complement. Oh. I love that the app is so flexible, that you can make it kind of your own, and the layout is so nice, simple, yet beautiful. For me, a true life-saver! Genius! Without a doubt the best app in my IPhone... Get it now!\" - iTunes Sweden Review\n\n\"***** Perfect! Worth the money!\" - iTunes US Review\n\nAs an educated consumer, it's important to know to whom you're listening. DBT Diary Card was created by a Ph.D. psychologist trained directly by Dr. Marsha Linehan and at the Duke University Medical Center; we are experts in DBT, providing consultation to many in our community. And now we're giving it to you!\n\nA DBT app can have 3 parts: \n\n- A reference manual\n- A behavior tracker\n- A skills coach\n\nDBT Diary Card has all 3 of these parts and utilizes the iOS platform in ways that the other apps available don't and can't.\n\n+ PDF generation\n+ Notification Pane support\n+ Password protection\n+ Advanced text editing\n+ Media playback\n\nWhat DBT Diary Card has to offer:\n\n- Skills. LOTS of them. Every DBT skill you've ever heard about in a group is in here. It can be your quick reference to your skills so that you don't have to carry around your book or binder. Every skill is described in readable language to help you understand them easily and it's all just a quick tap away.\n\n- Emotions. All the \"basic\" emotions are presented, again with descriptions and explanations a quick tap away.\n\n- Behaviors. The most troublesome are pre-loaded.\n\n- Coaching. If you know you need to use a skill but can't think of which one or can't remember how to choose, use the app. The coaching can be your virtual therapist. \n\n- Complete customizability. Are you working on something different or do you have a different understanding of a particular skill or emotion? Change it. It's that easy. You are not wedded to the way it's presented in the app. It's all completely customizable.\n\n- 911 skills.  Put your emergency skills a tap away. You can call directly from the app, listen to your distress tolerance music, remember what apps help in the moment. \n\n- Email. You can email your therapist your diary card on a weekly basis automatically, you can do it manually whenever you'd like or you can have the app remind you.\n\n* Telephony features require an iPhone and voice service."

They will be automatically placed in your AM and/or PM routine as recommended.\n\n\n• ADD CUSTOM PRODUCTS\n\nYou can add custom skincare products from other brands by selecting the option in the top-right menu in the Routine section or from the Custom tab in the Products section.\n\n\n• USE YOUR ROUTINE FOR LAYERING ADVICE\n\nThe products are listed in the recommended layering order, along with advice for when and how to use each product.\n\n\n• KEEP TRACK OF USAGE TO AVOID CONFLICTS\n\nEach morning and evening, check each product off your list to keep track of which treatments you have used. This will allow the app to prevent any conflicts by showing you which products should be avoided.\n\n\n• TRACK YOUR SKIN'S PROGRESS\n\nAny time you notice your skin is looking particularly good or bad, you can make a note of it by pressing on the face icon next to the morning or evening routine. You can also add a comment to note down more details for your own record and add photos to track your progress.\n\n\n• ADD PHOTOS\n\nYou can add photos of your skin to your diary tracker and also add photos of custom products.\n\n\n• REMINDERS & TIMERS\n\nYou can set up notifications to remind you about your daily skin regimen. You can also set timers for products which require a specific wait time. Both can be found in the Settings.\n\n\n\n*** Advanced App Customization ***\n\n• RE-ORDER YOUR ROUTINE\n\nIf you don't wish to follow the recommended layering order, you can choose to re-order the products to fully customize your routine by selecting the option from the top right menu (with 3 dots) of the Routine section. You can also change the order of the layer steps, for instance DECIEM recommends oils before moisturizers but some users prefer the other way around.\n\n\n• USE CONFLICTING PRODUCTS\n\nWhen we recommend not using a product due to conflicts with other products or because you've reached the usage limit, you can choose to ignore the warning and use it anyway. You will then have the option to permanently ignore conflicts on that specific product.\n\n\n• SCHEDULE PRODUCTS\n\nYou can choose specific days of the week for a product if you wish. For instance, you may wish to make it so that the \"AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution\" only appears in your routine on Tuesdays and Fridays.\nYou can also choose dates of the month, e.g. the 1st and 15th of every month.\nAnother useful option is to schedule products for every X days, so you could choose every 2 days to alternate.\n\n\n\n*** Recommended for skin concerns... ***\n\n• Dry & Dehydrated Skin: Achieve plump, healthy-looking hydrated skin.\n• Acne-Prone Skin: Reduce inflammation to help support clear skin.\n• Blemishes & Congestion: Reduce inflammation and brighten the skin.\n• Sensitive Skin: Keep your skin moisturized with this gentle routine.\n• Mature Skin & Wrinkles: Promote youthful skin and reduce the signs of aging.\n• Pigmentation Problems: Gently exfoliate and brighten skin tone.\n• Oily Skin: Rebalance your skin for a healthy, fresh look.\n\n\nPlease note, Skincare Routine (previously known as \"Skincare Regimen Organizer\") has no connection with DECIEM, The Ordinary or any other skincare brand."

Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

This sleepmatic sounds machine is created using an ancient but doctor-tested and approved technique to help soothe your fussy baby calm with a shusher sound in cradle. \r\n\r\nA simple baby shusher with soothing sounds for baby that works on a single click, making calming sounds like baby lullaby that would work instantly and can be played for hours, recommended by parents, baby photographers, and doctors dealing with babies.\r\n\r\nBy creating calm sounds, safely stop the baby from crying with a rhythmic “shush” sound that engages a baby's natural calming reflex by reminding them of still being in the womb. The shush baby app helps to soothe baby calm and increase the baby sleep timer.\r\n\r\nThe amazing Sound Equalizer allows the app to \"listen\" to your baby crying or not every three minutes and automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby cry volume till baby calms down (so when the baby is wailing, shush is loud; when baby goes quiet, volume settles into a soothing background shush sound to relax baby).\r\n\r\nA newborn sleep magic baby sound machine that works best for a newborn baby to calm down quickly and manage baby sleeping patterns. A sleep aid that creates calming sounds for babies in the form of a shhh sound sleeper that will stop your baby crying, calms down easily, and put baby to sleep. \r\n\r\nThis shhh app calm baby instantly by creating a shusher sound, helping the baby relax in minutes using calming sounds for kids.  This sleepmatic app works like magic for the crying baby and helps parenting so much easier as baby calmer. \r\n\r\nAfter more than two years of testing and research with real moms and real babies, having sudden and long crying baby issues, we came up with the following very valuable feature list of baby soothing sound.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Safe and easy to use baby calming sounds machine. \r\n- Much more effective than simple lullabies or standard white noise.\r\n- Perfectly works for hours in the background and when the phone is locked\r\n- Adjustable Shush baby sound Timer Options (from 15 minutes to 8 hours of continuous shushing!)\r\n- Automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby crying volume.\r\n- Shush sounds played in low light “dark mode” ( night mode) to avoid extra mobile light as baby sleeps.\r\n- Work in other Apps on your Phone while still using the Baby Shusher App.\r\n\r\n*Note: Turn your phone on silent/mute to let the app do its magic.*\r\n \r\n \r\nWhat Real Moms are Saying About the Baby Shusher:\r\n\r\n“I wish I would have known about this sooner. It is truly a miracle for me and baby to have a good night’s rest together!” Mercedes (mother of 3 months old)\r\n\r\n“It is a must try for yourself.” Isabel (mother of 3.5 months old)\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t sure after the 1st time I used it, but it proved to us that it worked better and better thereafter.

This app calculates the weights you should use, based on your one rep max, for the 3-week Smolov Jr. and 13-week Full Smolov Squat protocols. The app also makes it easy to keep track of where you are in the cycle.\r\n\r\nThis Russian squat cycle has also been used by many for other lifts such as the bench press, shoulder press and deadlift with big jumps in strength. Smolov isn't for new lifters, but if you have some experience under your belt (like with 5/3/1, starting strength, 20 squat, etc.), then this may be a great lifting protocol for you."

      "label": "Anxiety Release shows you how to release anxious thoughts and feelings naturally, by harnessing the power of your brain. It does this by combining guided instructions and focused attention with bilateral brain stimulation. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a revolutionary treatment which is based on the use of sensory stimulation to alter anxiety-provoking memories and responses. Over 30 randomized controlled studies of EMDR attest to the efficacy of this process. \n\nBecause bilateral stimulation appeals to the unconscious, sensing part of the brain, there is no need for effortful thinking or struggling with feelings.  All you have to do is LISTEN and your brain will do the rest! The App consists of;\n1 x brain training session\n2 x guided anxiety management sessions\n1 x pure bilateral stimulation session (audio & visual)\n1 x safe place exercise\nProgress Log function\nPowerful Bls brain visual \nThis App is suitable for both clinicians and clients\n\nCaution: Persons suffering with complex PTSD or mental health problems, multiple psychological trauma or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without medical supervision."

You follow the same instruction and in the same time as if attending our actual class.\n\nLying on the floor, we strengthen the abdominals with 5 progressive core practices, comfortably lengthen the hamstrings, quads, adductors and psoas, explore simple range-of-motion of the hips, relax in a gentle spinal rotation, and practice hip and spinal extension. By the end, with increased space and improved support, like our students, you'll feel relief from chronic pain and discomfort.\n\nUS App  Store (1/26/17)\n***** \"Love it and I can feel the difference\"\n\"I've been using it for 2 weeks and can feel the difference. My wife does too. It's a basic app but the content is excellent.\"\n\nBeyond the mechanics, we set the rhythm to achieve a deep internal focus, mindful movement, and awareness to remain well within one's comfort zone, all hallmarks of yoga. We also relax between practices to consciously observe and release protective holding pattens to enhance benefit.\n\nUK App Store (10/20/16)\n***** \"Sam\"\n\"Brilliant app changed my life...I can't recommend this app highly enough which I do to everyone I talk to about back pain.\"\n\nOBJECTIVES:\n\n•\tFocused breathing to lengthen the lumbar spine\n•\tAbdominal strengthening\n•\tLeg strengthening & stretching\n•\tHip opening & extension\n•\tHip flexor stretching\n•\tSpinal flexion & extension\n•\tDeep guided relaxation\n\nCanada App Store (7/1/16)\n*****\"Excellent app, exercises are very easy to follow\"\n\"Worth the price!\"\n\n6 ADDITIONAL CLASSES\n\nThe '7 Classes' app reuses all 28 practices of the \"Full Back Class\" to formulate 6 additional classes:\n\n•\tThe Full Back Class (66 min.)\n•\tModified classes:\n                for lordosis* (54 min.)\n                for sciatica* (58 min.)\n                for SI joint* (52 min.)\n•\tMaintenance Program (34 min.)\n•\tCrisis Management (7 min.) - after injury when inflammation has subsided\n•\tOn-the-go (11 min.) - for holiday travel\n\n*The modified classes remove contraindicated practices of the full back class and are not intended as a treatment for said condition.\n\nLuxembourg App Store (6/8/16)\n*****\"...even the 11 min (\"On-the-go\") class can make a difference...\"\n\n(screen grabs & more reviews at www.yoga.lu/pages/58)\n\nThe app costs just one-third the price of a single class at our centers.\n\nFurther testimonials from among our centers' students (www.yoga.lu/styles/3):\n\n\"I had almost resigned about my worsening back pain. When I started the lower back yoga, the effect was immediate, and for the last year, having followed the classes regularly, my back has been better than in 20 years. I even started skiing again.\" ~ Jonas Winnerlov, 50\n\n\"Since I am doing my (your) practices, I feel much stronger and far more stabilised and am able to do walks of 7-8 kms (a year ago I would not have though this possible).\" ~ Nicole Mahowald, 74\n\n\"I am feeling much better today! It’s incredible how a few gentle movements can make the difference.\" ~ Olivia Roland, 26\n\nFEEDBACK LINK\n\nWe've added a feedback link on the app to answer questions and to hear how it's going. We wish to hear from you.\n\nBest wishes and have a great class!\n\nYouTube channel: Fred Bender's Lower Back Yoga\nFacebook: Fred Bender's Lower Back Yoga\nSupport - lowerbackyoga.com/support"

Other brainwave and binaural beat applications use only a single brainwave frequency and carrier signal.  The Progressive Brainwave Entrainment algorithms developed for this app use a series of brainwave programs, multiple frequencies and carrier waves to gently bring your brainwave frequencies to your desired state using a more natural and effective frequency progression.\n\n*** Advanced Features ***\n\n - Multiple Brainwave programs each specially designed to boost physical and mental performance.\n\n - Multiple ambient background sounds to choose from.\n\n - Adjustable Brainwave Intensity - The intensity of the brainwaves can be adjusted independently of the ambient background sound.  This allows you to set the brainwave volume to your comfort level.  The application will also save your preference for future use.\n\n - Adjustable ambient background volume.\n\n - Visual timer countdown indicator.\n\n - Automatic saving of preferred brainwave entrainment program and ambient background sounds.\n\n - Ability to create your own custom time option.\n\n\n\nWarning:  Do not use this app while driving or operating machinery."

Once you’ve spent a bit of time setting up your preferences and understanding the information iOB displays, we hope it’ll prove to be a valuable tool in making decisions on when and how much insulin to take.\n\nYou can record both long acting (basal) and short acting (bolus) doses, and schedule notifications to remind you when the injections were taken, when they're going to expire and even schedule a dose for sometime in the future.\n\nEntries can be saved to the iPhone’s calendar and you can call up a report to show average doses that have been recorded.\n\niOB is meant to help you work out how much insulin you have on-board and avoid stacking your insulin too much or knowing what kind of ‘top-up’ you could need.\n\nIf you don’t understand insulin on-board or splitting doses please talk you your diabetic clinic or diabetes specialist nurse before using this app.\n\n** iOB is not intended as a way to recommend how much insulin to take, only help you come to a decision. You must take insulin based on your experience, current circumstances and what you have been told by your clinic.\n\n*** iOB cannot magically tell you how much insulin is actually active in your body and is meant only for information purposes.\n\nDo not ignore how you feel!"

I love this app so glad I found it \nnauf4l: was planning to buy a 100$ jump rope which counts skips as i always do 5k skips a day. So after a month was considering this when i came across this app after installing 5 apps of the same.Glad i paid about 2$ for this as it is totally worth it. \nFrankWurst: Accurate jump counter based solely on Apple Watch. App integrates into My Health and Activity App seamlessly. Great product.\ntafty：I enjoy the skipping experience with this app. And it syncs well with Apple Watch\n\nContact me\nE-mail:89208242@qq.com\nTwitter: @haozes\nTelegram Group: t.me/yaoyaonow  \n\nDesign by Haozes\nThanks for the translation: 橙子、金小粉、孟金羽、蔡沛森、Adgar, Fabio Carrilho, Tomás Feliú Ribeiro, Francesco Tirsi, Leonard Pitt Diehl, Zhimin Yang, Massimiliano Benini,Radu Ionescu,Andrés Leon,Dikran Jessaijan, Krishna"

Unlike binaural beats.\n\nMindwave 2 tones have been meticulously designed to produce the greatest neural response during EEG tests.\n\nBinaural beats are great and they work for most people but we found that other methods tend to be more effective and more flexible, such as Isochronic tones.\n\nTechnical Description of isochronic beats:\nIsochronic tones are regular beats of a single tone used for brainwave entrainment. The interference pattern that produces the beat is outside the brain so headphones are not required (use with a dock), but since isochronic tones are more pronounced, the stimuli is even stronger with the use of headphones/ear buds."

      "label": "dietSNAPS is not your average diet & food tracker. We don’t count calories. We don’t weigh our portions. We do something very different: we STOP and LOOK and take a picture of every bite BEFORE we eat it. Believe it or not, there have been studies that have found that the act of taking a picture before you take a bite is more effective than simply keeping a written journal.* \n\nAlready following a particular plan? dietSNAPS works with every program: from Paleo and Keto to DASH and 5:2, from Weight Watchers to Jenny Craig, to simply just eating clean, dietSNAPS works with you and the way you eat. \n\nWe hear everyday from the dietSNAPS community about how easy it is to use and how thrilled they are that they can FINALLY stick to keeping a journal. We look forward to hearing from you too. \n\nDESCRIPTION: \n• The easiest way to track your diet on the iPhone \n• Use your camera to visually keep track of what you eat, drink, your exercise and more \n• Email your dietSNAPS log to your nutritionist, personal trainer, doctor or diet buddy \n• Export your log via .CSV and view your log (no photos) in Excel or other spreadsheet software \n• Create PDF reports of your log\n\nUSE dietSNAPS TO: \n• Track your diet to help you lose weight \n• Share your dietSNAPS photos on Facebook and Twitter \n• Track your exercise\n• Keep track of food allergies and intolerances \n• Monitor your IBS symptoms \n• Keep a photographic journal of your culinary adventures ~ Bon Appétit!\n• Use the journal function to write how your day was, how you were feeling and how your diet was impacted \n\n\nUSER REVIEWS: \n“This is the first diet tracker that I’ve been able to stick with for more than a few days!” by lillith99 (5 Stars)\n\n“I’m using it to keep track of my blood sugars and my food intake. Works great!” by Ktgirl4him (4 Stars)\n\n“Simple, fun, easy! Just what I was looking for…Taking pics of the food I eat daily is so much easier to keep track without the hassle!

Knowing how well your blood performs this vital task can help you understand your overall wellness. The majority of people have a blood oxygen level of 95 - 99%. However, some people live a normal life with blood oxygen levels below 95%. \n\nThe Apple Watch can estimate your percentage of oxygen in your bloodstream and stores the data in the Health Store. With the Oxygen Saturation app, you always see your latest value directly on your wrist. This App supports all complications, so make your Apple watch a real Fitness Gadget!!\n\nHow to Use:\n-\tATTENTION: Oxygen Saturation only works if you have an Apple Watch Series 6, because this Apple Watch has the sensor you need to measure your oxygen saturation.\n-\tThe app needs to connect with the Apple’s Health app to display the recorded data on your Apple Watch, as complication or your Iphone.\n-\tUsing iOS 14 you can add a Widget to your home screen on your IPhone to display the latest measurement.\n- In case you are still not receiving any data, please open your Apple Health App and check if it is able to measure your oxygen saturation."

      "label": "WHAT IS BRUXAPP?\nBruxApp is the first globally available, research-based smartphone app dedicated to the study and management of Bruxism and its health consequences.\nDesigned by top international experts in a multi-center Bruxism research project and developed in 25 Research Centres across the world. \n\nWHAT CAN IT DO?\nBruxapp is a simple tool used by dentists and patients for several purposes:\n- To help the assessment  of the presence/absence of bruxism-related activities (i.e., teeth clenching or grinding, jaw clenching) and potential consequences.\n- For rating the severity of bruxism, if present.\n- As a biofeedback-based management tool for bruxism.\n- To increase patients’ awareness of bruxism activities so they can avoid or correct negative habits.\n- To make patients aware of the possible clinical consequences of bruxism and try to prevent them.\n- To promote cutting-edge knowledge about bruxism, based on the latest scientific research.\n\nWHY is BruxApp needed? \nBruxism has been increasing in prevalence over recent years. It encompasses motor activities of the jaw muscles, such as jaw or teeth clenching, and teeth grinding, some of which may be associated with clinical signs and symptoms, like tooth wear, failed dental restorations, complications with implant-supported prosthesis, muscle fatigue and temporomandibular joint pain. A correct diagnosis is therefore fundamental to establishing early prevention and management regimens.\n\nSCIENTIFIC RESEARCH\nStudies with BruxApp have been supervised by experts, as part of an ongoing multicenter research project on bruxism epidemiology and management coordinated by Prof. Daniele Manfredini, University of Siena, Italy.\n\nDEVELOPMENT\nThe app was developed by Goran Djukic, program analyst at the Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Council of Research, University of Pisa, Italy.\nBruxApp is currently available in the following languages: English, Italian, , French, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish, Brazilian, Japanese, Hebrew, Chinese, Arabic, Greek, Polish, Lithuanian, Bosnian, Romanian, Turkish, Norwegian, and Croatian, with another 4 language versions soon to be released. \n\nIMPORTANT STATEMENT\nBruxApp is not a game or gadget.  In order for BruxApp to work correctly and be effective, please dedicate 5 minutes of your time to READING the simple instructions CAREFULLY. \n\nThe full compatibility is guaranteed by iPhone 6 and higher ones and iOS 9.3 and higher ones."

Deficiency results in anemia leading to a lack of energy and can damage heart and muscle, and also impairs mental and physical development.

You can change this target at any time, for example if you have been advised to restrict iron intake due to hemochromatosis.\nRecord the food and drinks you consume using speech recognition or by favoriting or by keyboard search and use the serving sizes provided, which are mainly those suggested by USDA Food Data Central (you can change to your serving sizes if different at any time).\nWatch your progress towards your target iron intake every day in real-time, view your progress over time on the Month view dashboard, and export your food diaries into a spreadsheet for your own information or to share with healthcare providers.\nThe app is curated and contains 325+ common (mainly healthy) foods and drinks and you can add your own branded and other foods and recipes at any time. This means the app does not require access to the Internet, and does not collect any of your data or required additional payments. \nSynchronize all data in the app with your other First Line Medical Communication Ltd nutrient counter apps on your iPhones and iPads.

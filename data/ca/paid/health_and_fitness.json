You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

      "label": "DBT Diary Card is the only DBT iPhone app designed and created by a licensed and DBT intensively trained psychologist.\n\nHighlights of version 3.0:\n\n+ graphing data across time\n+ on device PDF viewing\n+ daily reminders\n+ Password locking to prevent others from seeing your diary cards.\n\nRead what our actual users say:\n\n\"***** Best DBT app available!!!\nSimply put, this is the most helpful DBT or CBT app available. I bought a new iPhone to be able to use it. DBT skills are priceless. I had tried every, other DBT and CBT app. This one follows the traditional DBT program exactly, and is the only Diary Card. Before I had this app, I'd seldom fill in my diary card. Now that I have it, I don't have to keep track of paper, and I rarely miss a day. I can fill in my Diary Card discreetly, from anywhere, anytime, and send it directly to my DBT coach. I no longer have to worry about someone coming across my Diary Cards. You can brush up on skills, use it for distress tolerance suggestions, tailor it to your needs, and even journal. I appreciate that I can add personal goals to my diary. Thank you for this app!\" - iTunes US Review\n\n\"***** I am in IRL-DBT and this app is the perfect complement. Oh. I love that the app is so flexible, that you can make it kind of your own, and the layout is so nice, simple, yet beautiful. For me, a true life-saver! Genius! Without a doubt the best app in my IPhone... Get it now!\" - iTunes Sweden Review\n\n\"***** Perfect! Worth the money!\" - iTunes US Review\n\nAs an educated consumer, it's important to know to whom you're listening. DBT Diary Card was created by a Ph.D. psychologist trained directly by Dr. Marsha Linehan and at the Duke University Medical Center; we are experts in DBT, providing consultation to many in our community. And now we're giving it to you!\n\nA DBT app can have 3 parts: \n\n- A reference manual\n- A behavior tracker\n- A skills coach\n\nDBT Diary Card has all 3 of these parts and utilizes the iOS platform in ways that the other apps available don't and can't.\n\n+ PDF generation\n+ Notification Pane support\n+ Password protection\n+ Advanced text editing\n+ Media playback\n\nWhat DBT Diary Card has to offer:\n\n- Skills. LOTS of them. Every DBT skill you've ever heard about in a group is in here. It can be your quick reference to your skills so that you don't have to carry around your book or binder. Every skill is described in readable language to help you understand them easily and it's all just a quick tap away.\n\n- Emotions. All the \"basic\" emotions are presented, again with descriptions and explanations a quick tap away.\n\n- Behaviors. The most troublesome are pre-loaded.\n\n- Coaching. If you know you need to use a skill but can't think of which one or can't remember how to choose, use the app. The coaching can be your virtual therapist. \n\n- Complete customizability. Are you working on something different or do you have a different understanding of a particular skill or emotion? Change it. It's that easy. You are not wedded to the way it's presented in the app. It's all completely customizable.\n\n- 911 skills.  Put your emergency skills a tap away. You can call directly from the app, listen to your distress tolerance music, remember what apps help in the moment. \n\n- Email. You can email your therapist your diary card on a weekly basis automatically, you can do it manually whenever you'd like or you can have the app remind you.\n\n* Telephony features require an iPhone and voice service."

It does this by combining guided instructions and focused attention with bilateral brain stimulation. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a revolutionary treatment which is based on the use of sensory stimulation to alter anxiety-provoking memories and responses. Over 30 randomized controlled studies of EMDR attest to the efficacy of this process. \n\nBecause bilateral stimulation appeals to the unconscious, sensing part of the brain, there is no need for effortful thinking or struggling with feelings.  All you have to do is LISTEN and your brain will do the rest! The App consists of;\n1 x brain training session\n2 x guided anxiety management sessions\n1 x pure bilateral stimulation session (audio & visual)\n1 x safe place exercise\nProgress Log function\nPowerful Bls brain visual \nThis App is suitable for both clinicians and clients\n\nCaution: Persons suffering with complex PTSD or mental health problems, multiple psychological trauma or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without medical supervision."

The app also makes it easy to keep track of where you are in the cycle.\r\n\r\nThis Russian squat cycle has also been used by many for other lifts such as the bench press, shoulder press and deadlift with big jumps in strength. Smolov isn't for new lifters, but if you have some experience under your belt (like with 5/3/1, starting strength, 20 squat, etc.), then this may be a great lifting protocol for you."

It is based on bilateral stimulation (a way of stimulating the brain one side at a time) and EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). These techniques can produce a direct effect on the way the brain processes or re-processes past emotional experiences. You can use this application to aid in the treatment of traumas, process upsetting situations, disturbing thoughts, improve future performance, or simply feel better. Studies done with patients undergoing EMDR while in CAT scans have shown physiological changes in the brain that lead to adaptive changes in thinking and emotional self-regulation.\n\n\"A study comparing the effectiveness of Prozac vs. EMDR showed that EMDR was more successful than Prozac in achieving substantial and sustained reductions in anxiety and depression.\"\n- The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, January 2007"

Don't depend on other apps that might lose your data—Health Data Importer is battle-tested with thousands of users and supports all versions of Apple's Health XML format. Start fresh without a backup when you get your new device and easily import your existing health data. Health Data Importer imports all Health data except Activity Summaries, Stand Hours, Exercise Time, and Nike Fuel data (these are API limitations).\n\nIf you ever have wanted to bring all of your health data onto a new phone without having to do a full iCloud restore, this is the app for you.\n\nTo see how easy it is, just watch the preview video (no sound). Note: while we use iCloud Drive in the preview video, iCloud Drive does not need to be enabled in order to perform an import. Just send your import to yourself in Apple mail and open it with Health Data Importer.\n\nHealth Data Importer integrates with the HealthKit framework and Health.app to import your Health XML exports.\n\n◆ Testimonials ◆\n\n“Health Importer is the app I wish I had when I moved from the iPhone 6 Plus to the 6s Plus last year. [...]  Health Importer worked perfectly in my tests and I'm going to use it again as soon as I switch to an iPhone 7 Plus.” - Federico Viticci, Macstories\n\n“Health Data Importer does exactly what the name suggests. Download the app, then load it up on your fresh new iPhone. It will scan your iCloud backups for any health data, then import all of it over to your new phone.” - Thorin Klosowski, Lifehacker\n\n“I believe Health Data Importer to be the best way to move your Health data between two iPhones. It is simple, quick, and very reliable” - Sébastian Page, iDownloadBlog\n\n◆ Features ◆\n\n‣ Import multiple sources (Apple Watch, iPhone, or from third-party apps).\n‣ Fast, quick, efficient, and battle-tested—import all your health data in just a few seconds.\n‣ Supports all versions of Health apps XML exports.\n\n◆ Help and Support ◆\n\nIf you run into an issue, please email our team at support@lionheartsw.com. We've helped many customers import their data successfully and will try our best to help you too.\n\n◆ Health XML Splitter ◆\n\nHealth Data Importer has trouble handling large exports, so we've written a macOS tool, called Health XML Splitter, to help you split them up into smaller pieces. Health XML Splitter is available for free on the Mac App Store.\n\nHealth Data Importer's privacy policy: https://lionheartsw.com/software/health-importer/privacy.html\n\nHealth Data Importer's terms of use: https://lionheartsw.com/software/health-importer/terms.html"

      "label": "This application is a sidekick to the beastmaker 1000 and 2000. It has been designed to assist the user into gradually getting stronger on a fingerboard. The app does this by way of prewritten workouts which are often general and aim to improve all trainable grips on the board. Some are specific (2000 series only at the moment) which aim to improve, sloper strength, pocket strength and crimp strength. \n\nThere is also a new custom workout program fully adjustable and includes the 1000,2000 and micros, so if you have your own hang regime and different timings then that is all programmable and can be saved.\n\nBoth the workouts and custom timer now record hang contraction time (time spent actually hanging off the board) We recommend most users get up to around 20:00 minutes on this clock whilst doing their workouts.\n\nOn the Workout screen after you've selected your work out it is now possible to adjust set and hang times. Users who are only finger boarding and are having a rest day prior to and after training may wish to do up to 3 sets and 7 hangs. Other users may prefer to go for 2 sets and 6 hangs, this is what we'd consider an average and more suited to people doing additional types of training.\n\nPlease note the grades for the workouts aren't actually meant to relate to anything other than themselves. E.G. 5c is easier than 6a but harder than 5b. If you find 5a hard on the 1000, use a weight removal technique such as putting one foot on a chair in front of the board or using a pulley with weights on. More advice on this and other things are available in the general advice section on the Workout Ratings page.\n\nTo record your hangs press the record button (red circle icon) whilst resting. The Workout Ratings function is much improved and should now be a really useful training aid which records gradual progress and improvement.\n\nFingerboard gains take time, remember to warm up thoroughly and move on to more difficult hangs at a slightly slower pace than you think you should to give pulleys time to catch up with muscles. For example 10% strength gains over a year is brilliant improvement. 5% is still effective training.\n\nBest of luck with the training, happy hanging and we hope this helps with the motivation."

      "label": "WHAT IS CLOCK YOURSELF? \n\nClock Yourself challenges you to think on your feet.  \n\nIt involves exercise for your body and your brain, at the same time.  \nEvery challenge will stimulate your brain in a different way. \n\nYou don't have to master one challenge before you can explore another challenge.  \n\nSome call this an exercise app. \nSome call this a brain games app.  \nWhy can’t it be both?! \n\n\n \nWHO CAN USE CLOCK YOURSELF? \n\nEveryone! \n\nClock Yourself exercises involve taking one step in all directions on a circle visualised beneath your feet. It’s perfect for exercise at home.  \n\nAthletes often modify Clock Yourself exercises outdoors for sport-specific agility drills, by visualising a much larger circle and running between the coordinates.  \n\nSimilarly, people who are unable to walk can modify Clock Yourself to practise reaching with their arms, or wheelchair agility! \n\nIf you think you’re too slow to use Clock Yourself, you’re probably wrong.  \nIf you think you’re too fit to use Clock Yourself, you’re definitely wrong! \n\n\n\n\nWHY DID WE MAKE CLOCK YOURSELF?\n\nThe Clock Yourself concept originated in neurological rehabilitation. Now anyone can use it to harness their neuroplasticity.  \n\nIt was developed by Australian physiotherapist @MegLowryPT and software developer Dave Wallace. \n\n\n \nWe had 5 goals: \n\n1. Make it fun - Clock Yourself exercises are so entertaining that you’ll show your friends at parties! \n\n2. Make it versatile  - Both the stepping speed and the cognitive complexity are in your control.  \n\n3. Make it evidence based - This is a volitional step training method. Volitional stepping trains faster steps in all directions to improve your chances of catching yourself during a fall.  \n\n4. Make it portable - There is no need to set up mats, wires or sensors. It also works offline. It only requires internet for your initial download from the App Store.  \n\n5. Make it affordable - This is a once off purchase for pocket change. It has no recurring subscriptions and no advertisements.  \n\n\n\nIS CLOCK YOURSELF AVAILABLE IN OTHER LANGUAGES? \n\nYes and no. \n\nAt this stage, all of the buttons and instructions are in English only.  \n\nHowever, if you click the Options button within each challenge (except for the Simple Colours challenge) you can choose to play the audio prompts in six other languages. \n\nMandarin \nJapanese \nFrench  \nGerman \nSpanish \nDutch  \n\nWhat are you waiting for?  Go ahead and Clock Yourself!\n\n“A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new” - Albert Einstein"

      "label": "We have developed this App in a way that allows you to begin to track the changes, that you are making in your life. By rewarding yourself financially and grading your efforts, it would give you an opportunity to subconsciously program yourself into abundance. By taking the time at the end of your busy day, to review your actions, that match your thoughts, to look at how your behaviors were equal to your intentions and to begin to observe how you got your mind and body working together. We want you to begin to set up an account that shows that you are growing financially and to subconsciously program yourself into a new future.\n\nWe recommend, that you review what you have done during the day and use the App to remind yourself, of who you want to be and who you no longer want to be. And at the end of the day, you should reward yourself for your efforts so you can begin to further program your autonomic nervous system into that future. We recommend then that you do your mental banking in the evening, because as you begin to pay yourself, you are going to begin to subconsciously create a new habit of self.\n\nThis App contains:\n- Set a change for your life or set something, you want to get rid of\n- You will see all your changes in your daily timeline\n- Pay yourself, if you achieved your daily tasks. You will get this money into your mental bank account\n- As soon as you get 1.000 Quantum Dollars on your mental bank account, you may enter the Quantum World and create there, whatever you desire. Publish a picture from your creation there.\n- In a slideshow, you may see all your creations, with a beautiful music in the background. This will reminds you to your future – your creations will come true.\n\n\n\nFuthermore this App contains the Meditations „Morning and Eveningmeditation“. Start and end your day with these Meditations.\n\nDescription for the Meditations:\nIt’s time to stop being defined by your past and to create a whole new future!\n\nBy following these simple morning and evening exercises, you will get to know yourself better. You will start to notice changes in your mental and physical health including: lower stress levels, healthier immune system, increased memory, concentration and energy. \n\nLiving in the present moment will also help your self-esteem and improve your overall mood.

We keep creating the future constantly and in every single second with our thoughts and feelings as well as with our beliefs and perceptions.\n\nWith the morning meditation you will get yourself into a coherent state of alpha or theta brainwaves. In those states you will be far more susceptible for suggestions. Your brain will be recalibrated automatically when you do this meditation of open space and you can gear your new Self-consciously towards the new day.\nDuring your evening meditation you will get into the present moment and linger in the emptiness of quantum space. As the observer you allow the day to pass by as you become an awareness of possibilties. In that state you will create the next day, your future.\n\nUse the meditation for changing your perceptions and beliefs to move into a new state of being. You will do this by marrying a clear intention with a higher emotion. This App will provide you with a range of options in order to get focussed on a specific goal.\nWe are able to influence any condition as well as our outside reality using our mind alone simply by changing our old beliefs and patterns and our perceptions of ourselves and our environment.\n\nThis App contains:\n- Morning meditation\n- Evening meditation\n- Meditation for changing your convictions and beliefs about yourself\n- Capacity to write down your goals\n- Mapping your results daily\n- Evaluation and statistics\n- Background information for changing your beliefs and perceptions\n\nNote: The Meditations are the same as on the CD or MP3-Download \"You are the Placebo #2\".We have split the Meditations in the App for a easier daily use into Morning, Evening and Changing Beliefs-Meditation."

When you tap the main display, you'll get a 5-second count-in, and then the display will guide you through each stretch and rest period, optionally with an audible tone at the start and end of each stretch.\n\nIt's that simple to use, and simple to follow, which means you get the perfect stretch every time.\n\nIMPORTANT: Always consult a health professional before commencing a stretching routine."

Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

If the CNS Tap Test result is elevated it is suitable for a  maximum effort or a heavy lifting day. If the CNS Tap Test result is lower than average it may indicate CNS fatigue and impending sickness, injury or over-training.\n\nBoth hands should be tested on a regular basis in a consistent environment, typically every morning on waking. The procedure for testing is:\n\n - Rest hand palm down on the heel of the hand on a flat surface\n - Tapping is done with the index (pointing finger), and all other fingers remain on the flat surface\n - The timer starts with the first tap\n - When the timer expires no further taps will be accepted\n - The result can either be saved or discarded.\n\nMultiple samples can be saved per day.\n\nThe resulting data can be graphed, emailed or managed from within CNS Tap Test.\n\nUsing Swift Charts for improved accessibility and legibility."

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

Anyone can use MoodMission, whether you just want a lift in your day or need a bit more help recovering from anxiety or depression.\n\nA randomised controlled trial has shown that MoodMission can improve mental health and wellbeing (Bakker et al., 2019), and two other studies published in scientific journals have provided further support (Bakker & Rickard, 2019; Bakker et al., 2018). Randomised controlled trials are the gold standard of scientific evidence, and very few available mental health apps have RCT support (Firth et al., 2018).\n\nCompleting Missions earns you rewards in the app, motivating you to take steps towards becoming healthier, happier, and more confident. Plus a Mission log helps you track your progress over time.\n\nMoodMission learns which types of Missions work best for you, so the more you use MoodMission the better it gets at tailoring your Mission suggestions.\n\nMoodMission is not a replacement for professional help. If you are experiencing anxiety, depression, or any mental health issue, talk to your GP or contact a psychologist for support."

The next day, Lil Wayne may take over.  Get a unique, up-beat playlist every time you run.  \n\n** Keep the perfect pace **\n\nPrefer a consistent pace? No problem. You can easily set a pace for yourself.  You can even include a warmup song if you'd like.\n\n** It's YOUR music. **\n\nA run is a terrible time to have to skip through tons of songs you don't like.  Everyone's got their own taste in workout music.  That's why the app plays YOUR music from YOUR iTunes library.\n\n** It's here to help. **\n\nNeed a speed boost while you're running?  Just press the speed buttons in the app.  Cooling down? Press the down arrow.\n\nGot a song that helps get you going?  Set it as a \"Pump Up Song\" and you can play it when you need it the most.\n\n** It's super smart. **\n\nThe app learns which songs you don't like while running & it stops playing them.  Simple as that.\n\nWant more control?  You can also set a blacklist of songs that you don't ever want the jog.fm app to play.\n\nIf you love a song, you can flag it during or after your run and it'll be played more often.\n\n** It plays nice. **\n\nDo you use other fitness apps like RunKeeper or Nike+ (in \"outdoor\" mode)?  Just launch the other fitness app first, then launch jog.fm.  Works like a charm.\n\nIn Nike+, make sure you go to \"Settings\" and be sure to turn off \"Music Tied to Run Controls\"\n\n\n** Please Note **\n\nThe jog.fm app must remain on top with the screen on while running.  \n\nDo not turn your screen off while running.\n\nThis app is not a streaming service.  It plays music from your iTunes library.\n\nThere is a one-time setup that will take about one minute (depending on the size of your library).  The app needs to analyze your songs to figure out which ones to play.  An internet connection (WiFi recommended) is required for this setup step because the app is powered by the Echo Nest.\n\nThis app is not yet compatible with iTunes Match.  It'll work, but you may find some long gaps between songs.  \n\nThis app is for running or walking.  We are working on adding more workouts soon!\n\nPlease do not run or walk in traffic."

The test is performed by running between two markers placed 20 meters (65.6 feet) apart, at an increasing pace as indicated by the beeps. The test ends when you can no longer keep pace, or level 21 is completed.\n\nDetailed information about each test variation can be found in the app's online help."

      "label": "Audio quality. That is what separates Thundergod from all the others. While many have tried to imitate our work, none have achieved the sonic supremacy of the Naturespace thunderstorm series Thundergod. The experience under headphones is unmatched. Our unique 3D recording techniques not only recreate the sound of real storms, but also the detailed spatial characteristics of their unique environments. Follow the trajectories of hundreds of individual rumbles and strikes above you. Feel the rain on the leaves and in the water as wind pushes through the trees. Get lost aboard a giant wooden vessel as she navigates the squall. Thundergod faithfully recreates the variety of storms that have been witnessed through all of history, striking fear and awe into the heart of mankind across the ages.\n\nCompletely remastered, these storms are now much longer and stronger and are accompanied by a beautiful new UI with synchronized, full screen lightning flashes. Thundergod puts the combined power of 6 years of storm recordings in your pocket.\n\nUnlike music, which can be distracting, listening to our storms while working or relaxing gives your mind the space to think and focus by immersing you into amazingly real 3D spaces with intricate and detailed storms that are so long that they never feel repetitive. Six storms are ordered by degree of intensity: the combative and aggressive Thor, the all-night rumbler Odin, the adventurous and fascinating journey of Aegir, and the magical and mystical forest of Loki, as well as two rain-only tracks that are perfect for a sleeping ambience. Thundergod contains an album's worth of audio, but it actually feels much longer due to the seamless and infinite looping that Naturespace is known for. Providing both entertainment and function, Thundergod is the Swiss army knife of thunderstorm apps. It's the one app you will keep coming back to because, in the end, it's all about the audio quality."

But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times. You can even log which bike or shoes you use, to monitor usage and flag when it’s time to replace them.\n\nHealthFit finds photos you take during your workouts automatically, bringing your activity feed to life with stunning images you can share on social media.\n\nRUNNING POWER ANALYSIS\n\nHealthFit provides advanced running power analysis with the automatically estimated critical power, the weighted average power, the power distribution chart by 25W Increments and the mean maximal power chart which shows your best average power for time periods of one second up to the length of your run.\n\nMULTISPORT AND INTERVAL WORKOUTS\n\nHealthFit is the only app to export multisport workouts as multisession activities\n\nSTATISTICS: UNCOVER HIDDEN FITNESS INSIGHTS\n\nApple Watch gathers so much fitness data, it can sometimes seem overwhelming. HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio.

The DQS Mobile app was designed to make it as easy as possible to calculate a Diet Quality Score each day.\n\nAs you eat throughout the day, enter the servings of each category of food that you consume. Tap a box to consume one serving of that category, tap it again and it will become a half serving, and one more tap will set it back to zero for that box. You can tap the category name to view an explanation of what foods fall under that category. Your total DQS score for the day is shown in the upper right corner of the page.  DQS data is saved for each day you track it. \n\nYou can also log your weight and body fat % on the bottom of the Tracking page. We recommend you log your weight no more than once per week.\n\nThe Graphs page lets you see how you are doing with your Diet Quality Score over time. You can view your data over the last week, month or year. When viewing yearly data, it is displayed as 52 week-long averages. You can view graphs showing your total DQS, your weight, or your DQS score by specific category.\n\nYou can set a target weight, body fat % and a target DQS score on the Profile page."

We wanted to create an app that didn’t have a monthly subscription and was so simple that it melted into the background.\n \nThere are many types of yoga and many approaches to it. This app is inspired by the philosophy behind Hatha yoga, designed to create comfortable and steady body positions that aid mediation or allow you to create yoga workouts. Focus through each of the positions should be on breathing in order to unblock the mind and the body.\n\nThe positions or asana in the app are not too advanced. Start with Yoga has simple positions that most beginners can practice to develop strength in their bodies.\n\nStart with Yoga uses Apple Health to manage your routines."

Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly!

She will do whatever it takes - including threatening, inspiring, ridiculing, and bribing you - to make this happen.\n\nYou will get fit - or else.\n\n---\n\n7 Minutes in Hell Workout\nEmploying SCIENCE™ to compact an hours-long workout program into just 7 sweat-and-pop-culture-soaked minutes, CARROT will train you personally on exercises like Mt. Doom Climbs, Celebrity Face Punches, and Dragon Mating Dances. \n\nYou get 30 seconds for each of the 12 punishing exercises,* with 10 seconds of rest in between just in case you need to hydrate, catch your breath, or vomit into a bucket.\n\nThis diabolical interval workout can be completed anywhere, at any time, so you have no excuse not to be in fighting shape when the Robopocalypse begins.\n\n*12 additional exercises can be unlocked via in-app purchase.\n\n---\n\nLose (or Gain) Weight In Style\nAre you ready to have so much fun tracking your weight that you'll actually look forward to hopping on your scale? All you have to do is punch in your current weight, then sit back and let CARROT pass judgment upon you.\n\nWARNING: If you blimp up or slim down too much, CARROT will be upset. When CARROT is upset, she gets mean. When CARROT gets mean, there is a 74.9% chance that she will make you cry.\n\n---\n\nClaim Your Rewards\nIf you work out and slough off those extra pounds, CARROT will reward you with fabulous prizes like app upgrades, cat facts, and permission to watch your friend eat a bag of potato chips.\n\nTrack Your Awesomeness \nBecause math is hard, CARROT will do all the number-crunching for you. See how many steps you've taken today, chart your weight loss on a pretty graph, view your workouts on a calendar, and more!\n\nAnd because CARROT syncs with Apple's Health app, she can save your weight and workout data to the HealthKit database. She can also monitor fitness activity logged with other HealthKit-compatible apps, even when you're not actively using her.\n\n---\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Work out with a hilarious AI construct\n- Enjoy 3+ hours of spoken tips, encouragement, and ridicule\n- Travel through time, protect your property from hobos, and appease an elder god in 12 original, never-before-seen exercises\n- Get 12 additional exercises via in-app purchase\n- Apple Watch app works as a heads-up display for your workout\n- Record your weight up to once a day\n- Bond with your cute & cuddly meatbag avatar\n- Level up and unlock rewards for getting fit\n- Set reminders so you'll never forget a workout\n- Track your weight progress on a pretty graph\n- Set a goal weight that you'll likely never meet\n- See how many steps you've taken today\n- Check your BMI to determine if you're still obese\n- Sync data with Apple's Health app\n\nDon't make CARROT angry.

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be. Say hello@buddhify.com"

You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

      "label": "Everything your gym coach told you about stretching was wrong. Performance Stretching will show you how to do it right.\n \nMost people learned back in elementary school that they should do static stretching (where you hold a stretch for a few minutes) before running or engaging in sports to prevent injury. It turns out that static stretching before a workout not only decreases athletic performance, it can actually increase the risk of injury. \n\nThe right way to get ready for an intense workout is dynamic stretching: This active form of stretching moves your muscles through the full range of motion to increase your blood flow, reduce tightness, deliver important nutrients to muscles, and improve your athletic performance. Performance Stretching will show you the most effective type of warm up for running and nearly every type of sport. Add it before any activity and you will be amazed by how much your performance improves.\n\nNo matter how well you warm up, athletic activity still puts stress on the body.  Performance Stretching also includes foam roller programs to give yourself a deep tissue massage and release knots that limit movement, keep your muscles tight, and lead to injury. Foam roller stretching is also excellent for body builders, or anyone that wants to build healthy muscles, to prep their muscles for growth.\n\nIf you don't have a foam roller, Performance Stretching still includes great ways to cool down your muscles and lessen post-workout soreness by flushing out the lactic acid.  This is where static stretching is best.  Done at the proper time, in the proper way, static stretching will help you improve your balance, blood circulation, flexibility, range of motion, and production of synovial fluid (the fluid that reduces friction in your joints).\n\nWhether you need a proper warm up, a cool down, or a relaxing, healing recovery, Performance Stretching will guide you through the right types of stretches for the right occasions and it will show you how to do them effectively. \n\nFEATURES\n• Over 150 different stretches. Each one includes a video you can view DURING YOUR WORKOUT and audio description to help you perfect your form. \n• The right stretches for the right reasons. A mixture of static, dynamic, and foam roller stretches maximizes your results. \n• Fast and efficient. Holding positions for longer than 30 seconds is less effective.\n• Works anywhere! No equipment needed for a terrific stretching workout.\n• Completely interactive. Swap out stretches to personalize your workouts. \n• Sync your workouts to the Health app.\n• Compatible with most bluetooth heart rate monitors.\n\nPERFORMANCE STRETCHING PROGRAMS:\n\nFoam Roller Stretch Program - A full-body deep tissue massage to work out all the knots that keep your muscles tight.\n\nDynamic Running Warm Up Stretch Program - Warm up your legs properly to take your run to the next level.\n\nDynamic Sport Warm Up Stretch Program - Warm up every major muscle group so that you can give your best.\n\nLower Back Rehab Program - Stretches and strength training moves to improve your core strength, reduce back pain, and increase your range of motion.\n\nLower Back Static Stretch Program - Work out the stiffness in your lower back and fix your posture.\n\nLower Body Static Stretch Program - You use your legs for everything, keep them at their functional best.\n\nUpper Body Static Stretch Program - Keep your upper body loose, relaxed, and properly aligned.\n\nFull Body Static Stretch Program - Increase flexibility, range of motion, blood flow, joint health, and posture throughout your entire body.\n\nQuick Full Body Static Stretch Program - When time is a factor, but you still want to do something great for your body.\n\nStatic Stretch Cool Down Programs - Designed to relax tired muscles and improve functional flexibility while your body is still warm.\n\nWorks with Health"

You can use this application to aid in the treatment of traumas, process upsetting situations, disturbing thoughts, improve future performance, or simply feel better.

However, if you have any spiritual energy blocks preventing your from doing either of those things, weight loss can be an on-going battle. \n\nRepetitive behavioural patterns that you find it hard to shake are often caused by blocks in your energy fields. By healing yourself emotionally and clearing your energy body of imprints from the past you can release patterns that have been with you for a long time. When you heal yourself spiritually it will naturally follow that you will heal yourself physically and emotionally. \n\nSpiritual Weight Loss Includes: \n\nHypnotherapy Sessions\n• Spiritual Weight Loss (awake ending) 40:59 mins \n• Spiritual Weight Loss (sleep ending) 44:18 mins\n\neBooks\n• Lose Weight in 7 Easy Steps \n• Lose Weight - The 8 Golden Rules \n• The Ultimate Guide To Self Hypnosis \n• How To Use This App \n• About The Author\n\nIt is recommend that you use this app regularly, ideally in conjunction with Glenn’s Lose Weight app, which works more on the physical aspects of weight loss. \n\nThis app will take you in to a deep place where you can really empower yourself and take back control. When you make a change like this energetically, eating healthily and exercising will become completely normal and natural to you.\n\nPost hypnotic Weight Loss Affirmations include:\nI continue to release blocks around weight loss \nI love eating healthily\nI love to exercise and keep fit\nI love and respect myself unconditionally\nI deserve to be happy and healthy"

      "label": "Take the very same 1-hour back class with 28 safe and effective practices that is taught to 200 students weekly at our centers since 17 years, the European Court of Justice, and centers internationally. \"Brilliant for Your Back\" says UK's leading \"Yoga Magazine\". You follow the same instruction and in the same time as if attending our actual class.\n\nLying on the floor, we strengthen the abdominals with 5 progressive core practices, comfortably lengthen the hamstrings, quads, adductors and psoas, explore simple range-of-motion of the hips, relax in a gentle spinal rotation, and practice hip and spinal extension. By the end, with increased space and improved support, like our students, you'll feel relief from chronic pain and discomfort.\n\nUS App  Store (1/26/17)\n***** \"Love it and I can feel the difference\"\n\"I've been using it for 2 weeks and can feel the difference. My wife does too. It's a basic app but the content is excellent.\"\n\nBeyond the mechanics, we set the rhythm to achieve a deep internal focus, mindful movement, and awareness to remain well within one's comfort zone, all hallmarks of yoga. We also relax between practices to consciously observe and release protective holding pattens to enhance benefit.\n\nUK App Store (10/20/16)\n***** \"Sam\"\n\"Brilliant app changed my life...I can't recommend this app highly enough which I do to everyone I talk to about back pain.\"\n\nOBJECTIVES:\n\n•\tFocused breathing to lengthen the lumbar spine\n•\tAbdominal strengthening\n•\tLeg strengthening & stretching\n•\tHip opening & extension\n•\tHip flexor stretching\n•\tSpinal flexion & extension\n•\tDeep guided relaxation\n\nCanada App Store (7/1/16)\n*****\"Excellent app, exercises are very easy to follow\"\n\"Worth the price!\"\n\n6 ADDITIONAL CLASSES\n\nThe '7 Classes' app reuses all 28 practices of the \"Full Back Class\" to formulate 6 additional classes:\n\n•\tThe Full Back Class (66 min.)\n•\tModified classes:\n                for lordosis* (54 min.)\n                for sciatica* (58 min.)\n                for SI joint* (52 min.)\n•\tMaintenance Program (34 min.)\n•\tCrisis Management (7 min.) - after injury when inflammation has subsided\n•\tOn-the-go (11 min.) - for holiday travel\n\n*The modified classes remove contraindicated practices of the full back class and are not intended as a treatment for said condition.\n\nLuxembourg App Store (6/8/16)\n*****\"...even the 11 min (\"On-the-go\") class can make a difference...\"\n\n(screen grabs & more reviews at www.yoga.lu/pages/58)\n\nThe app costs just one-third the price of a single class at our centers.\n\nFurther testimonials from among our centers' students (www.yoga.lu/styles/3):\n\n\"I had almost resigned about my worsening back pain. When I started the lower back yoga, the effect was immediate, and for the last year, having followed the classes regularly, my back has been better than in 20 years. I even started skiing again.\" ~ Jonas Winnerlov, 50\n\n\"Since I am doing my (your) practices, I feel much stronger and far more stabilised and am able to do walks of 7-8 kms (a year ago I would not have though this possible).\" ~ Nicole Mahowald, 74\n\n\"I am feeling much better today! It’s incredible how a few gentle movements can make the difference.\" ~ Olivia Roland, 26\n\nFEEDBACK LINK\n\nWe've added a feedback link on the app to answer questions and to hear how it's going. We wish to hear from you.\n\nBest wishes and have a great class!\n\nYouTube channel: Fred Bender's Lower Back Yoga\nFacebook: Fred Bender's Lower Back Yoga\nSupport - lowerbackyoga.com/support"

      "label": "Body position can be important to sleeping well, especially if you snore, or if some positions tend to give you back or neck pain. The SomnoPose sleep position monitor can help you manage your sleep position.\n\nSomnoPose is designed to run all night, while you wear your iPhone or iPod touch. It continually monitors the device's orientation, and provides an all-night chart of sleep position, along with a summary that shows how much time you've spent in each general position. An optional alarm can be used to help avoid undesired positions.\n\nWHAT IT DOES:\n- Continually monitors accelerometer data to determine your body position.\n- Shows how much time you've spent facing left, right, up and down.\n- Provides charts showing position data for entire nights.\n- An alarm can alert you when you're in a position you've chosen to avoid.\n- Shows built-in help content.\n\nWHAT IT DOESN'T DO:\n- Does not transfer information from your device unless you explicitly export data. You control where your data goes.\n- Does not need a network connection (except if and when you export data)\n- Does not have in-app advertising, in-app purchases, or subscription fees.\n\nUSER-EXPERIENCE FEATURES:\n- Scrolling chart on the main screen shows real-time position data.\n- Screens have dark backgrounds, suitable for use in low-light conditions.\n- Alarm volume can increase gradually to avoid jarring users (or partners).\n- Audio from another app can be played in the background.\n\nMORE FEATURES\n- Alarms and statistics are automatically paused while you sit up or stand up.\n- The angles for determining body positions are adjustable.\n- Chart images can be saved as photos, printed, sent to other apps, or exported.\n- Collected position data can be exported via email, messages, or other apps (as a CSV attachment).\n- Controls can be \"shielded\" to prevent accidental changes.\n- Uses the iPhone proximity sensor to shut off the screen during the night, saving battery power.\n\n\nNOTES\n\n* To use SomnoPose to monitor your sleep position, you will need to wear your iPhone or iPod touch in a stable, forward-facing position while you sleep. The internal help and the SomnoPose website help pages describe several ways of wearing your device.\n* SomnoPose is not intended to diagnose or treat any disease. Its purpose is to monitor and record information about body position."

      "label": "“Worked great for his bedtime—the look on his face was so calmed.” Christi (mother of 3 week old)\r\n\r\nThe Baby Shusher is a soothing sounds machine to calm & stop baby crying cycle\r\n\r\nThe Baby Shusher App is a revolutionary new tool for parents that will calm baby easily using soothing sounds. This sleepmatic sounds machine is created using an ancient but doctor-tested and approved technique to help soothe your fussy baby calm with a shusher sound in cradle. \r\n\r\nA simple baby shusher with soothing sounds for baby that works on a single click, making calming sounds like baby lullaby that would work instantly and can be played for hours, recommended by parents, baby photographers, and doctors dealing with babies.\r\n\r\nBy creating calm sounds, safely stop the baby from crying with a rhythmic “shush” sound that engages a baby's natural calming reflex by reminding them of still being in the womb. The shush baby app helps to soothe baby calm and increase the baby sleep timer.\r\n\r\nThe amazing Sound Equalizer allows the app to \"listen\" to your baby crying or not every three minutes and automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby cry volume till baby calms down (so when the baby is wailing, shush is loud; when baby goes quiet, volume settles into a soothing background shush sound to relax baby).\r\n\r\nA newborn sleep magic baby sound machine that works best for a newborn baby to calm down quickly and manage baby sleeping patterns. A sleep aid that creates calming sounds for babies in the form of a shhh sound sleeper that will stop your baby crying, calms down easily, and put baby to sleep. \r\n\r\nThis shhh app calm baby instantly by creating a shusher sound, helping the baby relax in minutes using calming sounds for kids.  This sleepmatic app works like magic for the crying baby and helps parenting so much easier as baby calmer. \r\n\r\nAfter more than two years of testing and research with real moms and real babies, having sudden and long crying baby issues, we came up with the following very valuable feature list of baby soothing sound.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Safe and easy to use baby calming sounds machine. \r\n- Much more effective than simple lullabies or standard white noise.\r\n- Perfectly works for hours in the background and when the phone is locked\r\n- Adjustable Shush baby sound Timer Options (from 15 minutes to 8 hours of continuous shushing!)\r\n- Automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby crying volume.\r\n- Shush sounds played in low light “dark mode” ( night mode) to avoid extra mobile light as baby sleeps.\r\n- Work in other Apps on your Phone while still using the Baby Shusher App.\r\n\r\n*Note: Turn your phone on silent/mute to let the app do its magic.*\r\n \r\n \r\nWhat Real Moms are Saying About the Baby Shusher:\r\n\r\n“I wish I would have known about this sooner. It is truly a miracle for me and baby to have a good night’s rest together!” Mercedes (mother of 3 months old)\r\n\r\n“It is a must try for yourself.” Isabel (mother of 3.5 months old)\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t sure after the 1st time I used it, but it proved to us that it worked better and better thereafter.

Your app was key to understanding what was going on and help the doctors understand too.\"\nBob Spadafora - *****\n\n\"Comparing heart rates with family over the holidays is fun.\"\nTxyak – ****\n\n\"Wanna impress a friend with a cool app. This is the one to get.\"\nMattyray – *****\n\n\"After having two heart valve replacements and a by-pass, I feel it is not only smart - but also necessary - to have such a reliable heart rate monitor with me everywhere I go.\"\nDantv – *****\n\n\"I am an EMT and it helps me actually see what is going on. It is by no means definitive like a monitor but it is a great indicator of problems I would not see otherwise.\"\nGranniem – ****\n\n\"I had a pulse oximeter on one hand, medical quality, and my iPhone app in the other and the app was dead-on accurate.\"\nLike it but hate it – *****\n\n\n=== See Cardiograph in action ===\nhttp://macropinch.com/cardiograph \nhttp://youtu.be/isIjcCFYEho\n\n\n• Measure your heart rate\n\nIt's never been easier to know what your heart rate is! Without any external hardware, just using the built-in camera of your smartphone or tablet, you can get accurate readings almost instantly.\n\nKnowing how fast your heart is beating can be very useful when exercising, if you're under stress, if you have a heart-related medical condition, or even just out of curiosity.\n\n\n• Track your results\n\nEvery measurement you take is saved to your personal history, so you can keep track over time. In addition to the date and time of the measurement, you can also save the location at which it was taken (and see them on a map), and even add a quick note to effortlessly organize your history.\n\n\n• Multiple profiles\n\nCardiograph is perfectly tailored to allow multiple people to use the app on a shared device. You can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them has their own individual measurement history.\n\n\n• Export & Print\n\nEach measurement can be exported in full detail to a portable format that you can later send via e-mail, upload on the web or even print right from the app itself (with an AirPrint™ compatible printer).\n\n\n• Clean and intuitive design\n \nInspired by real-life medical equipment, Cardiograph is a pleasure to use. The streamlined and clutter-free design makes it seem instantly familiar, so you can focus on using the app instead of navigating through series of confusing screens.\n\n\n• Built-in user guide\n\nIf you're having trouble with the app, or you want to make the most out of it, you can access the comprehensive help manual right from within the app itself.\n\n\n• Universal application with iCloud® sync\n\nCardiograph is an universal application - it runs on the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod touch.\nInstall Cardiograph on multiple devices with iOS 5.0+, and all your profiles and measurements will be in sync! Manage your profiles and measurements on one device, and the changes are instantly reflected on all the others.\n\n\nPlease note: If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\n\n\nFollow the latest news:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch \nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

You'll come out of your slumber slowly and peacefully.  No more being jolted awake.\n\n+ After setting the alarm, the app can be put in the background - allowing you to use other apps.  At the specified alarm time, the alarm pattern will begin.\n\n+ Choose from five pre-defined patterns with varying bell schedules and escalation lengths.\n\n+ Choose from six different bells of varying size and metal compositions - from bright and clean to deep and complex with lovely overtones.\n\n+ You may enter journal notes upon awakening - great for recording your dreams before the memory fades.  You can then go back and review your journal entries and you may export the journal via email.  For privacy, you may set a password to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n+ To save battery, you may lock your device's screen and the alarm will still work.  Either start the alarm and press the lock (sleep) button, or turn on the \"Auto-Lock\" setting.\n\n+ This app uses the same amazing bell sounds used in our Insight Timer meditation timer.

If you're someone that's training for rounds, doing circuit work, etc. this app is worth your 99 cents. With the level of customization you get, the app is competitive with the way more expensive round timer devices that can cost upwards of $10-100.\"\n- by Shawn Lord, www.mastersdivision.com\n\n\"I found a GREAT interval timer app in the iTunes store for 99 cents!!! It's called Round Timer and it works like a dream!!!\"\n- by Miss Lee, forums on thecathenation.com\n\n\"Its a really useful applications. Beats carrying around that big round timer from the old days.\"\n- by Michael Manna, T4Show.com\n\n-----------------------------------\n- Description -\n\nThe Round Timer was the first round/sparring/boxing timer available in the AppStore and, as a result, the most refined and stable. Don't be fooled by knock-offs (other developers copying our interface and layout). \n\nThe Round Timer is a convenient round/boxing/sparring timer for your iPhone/iPod touch, now compatible with iOS 8.  The Round Timer is a fully functional round/sparring timer that allows you to customize the length of the rounds, warning bell and resting period.  Each of these intervals can be configured separately up to an hour. It will run in the background even if you switch to another App. \n\nWith the sound themes, you can choose which alarm sounds to use: boxing/MMA, a relaxing Zen theme, and a few others. Don't like any of the dozens of preinstalled sounds? Don't worry! You can record your own sounds.\n\nFor large, loud environments you can plug your device into a stereo, or for small sessions put it in the corner of the mat.  The Round Timer is great for any sparring or interval training: boxing, MMA, grappling / bjj, martial arts, yoga, meditation, crossfit, exercise, workout, stretching, etc.\n\nWorking out to music is not a problem. Start your music playing in the iPod app, then start RoundTimer. The sounds will play over top of your music without interrupting it.\n\nPlease feel free to e-mail support@plainandsimplesoftware.com to suggest new sound themes!\n\nInterested in interval training (Tabata, symmetrical, etc... intervals)? Check out our \"IntervalTimer\". Want more control? Check out \"UltraTimer\". Want full programmability and randomized intervals? Look at \"UltraTrainer\"."

      "label": "Heart Rate Variability measurements recorded by your Apple Watch can give you insight on the stress level your body is under. By using HRV Tracker to track short-term measurements and long-term trends, you can see how your workload during the day, workout sessions or sleeping etc affect your body's readiness, recovery and stress level. Simply put, the higher your HRV is, the better.\n\n***Requires an HRV capable Apple Watch with watchOS 6 or later***\nHRV Tracker for Watch integrates with the Health app and uses data stored in the Health app. To make sure your Apple Watch is capable of recording HRV measurements, please open the Health app on your iPhone to see if any HRV measurements exists. Go to > Health app > Browse > Heart > Hear Rate Variability.\n\n***Get Notified***\nHRV Tracker makes spotting changes in your HRV easy by monitoring your HRV measurements in the background and showing notifications after your HRV drops under or rises above your desired levels. HRV Tracker will monitor changes in individual measurements and also your 24 hour HRV average. You can change the default notification levels directly in your Apple Watch app. Please note that notifications can get postponed for example because of a low battery level.\n\n***Apple Watch for daily tracking***\nBrowse through last seven days of HRV measurements by using the digital crown. See how measurements compare to your seven day period and individual days. By tapping the graph you can toggle through the first values of each day. Use complications on your Apple Watch to stay informed on changes in your HRV. \n\nBesides the automatically recorded HRV measurements you can use the Breathe app on your Apple Watch to record new HRV measurements. Start a Breathe session in the Breathe app and after the session ends a new HRV measurement will be available in HRV Tracker.\n\n***Compare HRV to other key metrics***\nFind possible causes for changes in HRV by using the comparison graphs available on your Apple Watch:\n-Sleep hours: By default HRV Tracker will use sleep data provided by sleep apps that add sleep data to HealthKit. If no sleep data is available HRV Tracker will calculate estimated sleep hours per night (estimated sleep time will only be available in the Apple Watch app)\n-Activity: By default HRV Tracker will use your Active Energy (calories) as the activity metric. In the HRV Tracker Apple Watch app you can choose to use a custom activity score that emphasizes the intensity of daily activity.\n-Daily resting heart rate (RHR).\nToggle between comparison graphs by tapping the upper part of the screen.\n\n***Follow Long-term HRV trend***\nFollow your long-term HRV trend on your iPhone and compare your short term measurements to all-time data.\n-Select week from weekly graph to see daily HRV values of the selected week.\n-Browse through all daily HRV values of the selected day\n-Compare daily HRV averages to other relevant daily metrics: Activity, Sleep (if available in the Health app) and Resting Heart Rate\n\n***Widgets on iPhone***\n-Medium sized widget with chart showing all daily hrv values\n-Multiple small widgets to choose from\n\n***Privacy***\nData read from the Apple HealthKit database is only used to show information related to your Heart Rate Variability. Information read by HRV Tracker is only stored and used locally on your iPhone and Apple Watch. \n\n***How is it measured***\nHeart rate variability measurements used by HRV Tracker are calculated by measuring the variation between individual heartbeats. Your Apple Watch automatically measures your HRV in the background and stores the outcome into HealthKit. HealthKit uses SDNN heart rate variability, which is calculated using the standard deviation of the inter-beat (RR) intervals between normal heartbeats (measured in milliseconds). Besides background measurements generated automatically by your Apple Watch you can use the Breathe app on your Apple Watch to generate new measurements."

You can also view health data in the app, without using complications.\n\n- Support most data types from HealthKit (i.e. data that you can also see in the Health app on your iPhone)\n- Add multiple complication configurations, and set any of them as a complication, support for multiple different complications at the same time\n- Support for all watch faces and complication slots\n- Summary of all configured data when you open the app\n- Set goals, complications can show difference from goal, or percentage completed\n- Configure period for data. E.g. 7 day average Weight, Step Count from last 24 hours, Yesterday walking distance. All data types have many period types to choose from\n- Configure unit\n- Set custom icon, from a selection of more than 100 icons\n- Complication second line can show icon, unit, or can be hidden\n- Set colors, separately for value and icon (only for multicolor watch faces)\n- Option to hide unit\n- Complications update every 20 minutes, if it's not enough you can open the app any time to see the most up-to-date data\n- Standalone watch app means there is no iPhone app, you can configure everything on your watch\n\nPrivacy:\nThe application only stores data needed for your complications, and stores this data locally, on your watch. The app never connects to the internet or any 3rd party service.\n\nTroubleshooting:\n - Application doesn't show on Watch after purchase:\nPlease go to the App Store on your Watch (not iPhone) and find the app here either by searching the name, or by going to Account (at the bottom), Purchased, and download the app from here.\n- Application/complication shows 0 for some data:\na) There is no data in Health for that type and period.\nb) You didn't authorise HealthKit access on the first launch. On your iPhone go to Health app > Account > Privacy > Apps > Health Glance.\nc) New data added on your iPhone takes couple minutes to sync with your watch."

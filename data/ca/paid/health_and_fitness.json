I love that I can track my symptoms and the app will notice patterns AND give me advice and assistance!!”\n \n“My FAVORITE PART is the cycle email tips to my significant other.

      "label": "If you love working out with Apple Watch, but you need more advanced fitness stats, HealthFit is for you.\n\nBy analyzing the workout data stored in Apple Health, HealthFit provides the kind of indispensable tracking and insights you normally only get from premium subscription services. But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance.

HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling.

      "label": "“Overcoming pain based on EMDR” was brought to you by Mark Grant, well known Australian psychologist/researcher and writer. Mark is particularly interested in developing resources that sufferers of pain and stress can use to make a real difference in their suffering. He is motivated to do what works best for his clients rather than what the ‘accepted wisdom’ might say. But he maintains a scientific approach and has conducted several studies regarding the efficacy of EMDR as a treatment for chronic pain. \n\n“Overcoming pain based on EMDR” mobile application is using recent discoveries from brain science to alleviate chronic pain and severe stress. \n\nThe application comprises 3 playlists for controlling pain and associated stress that can maintain pain. \n\nEach playlist is designed with different goals in mind. Where the first playlist called “Mental Healing strategies” is aimed to alleviate mild or moderate chronic pain, the second playlist called “Sensory Healing strategies” will help when you are too tired, sore or distressed to employ the pain pathway strategy from the first playlist. And the last playlist called “Stress Management” is focused on reducing your stressful feelings that can maintain and exacerbate chronic pain. \n\nThe playlists are designed to compliment each other; so if your pain is severe using the strategies in “Sensory Healing strategies” should help bring it under control enough for you to benefit from the tracks in “Mental Healing strategies” and listening to the “Stress Management” tracks regularly, when your pain is tolerable, will bring your overall stress levels down and decrease the pain-related activity in your body and your brain. The tracks in “Mental Healing strategies” and “Stress management” can be listened to anywhere anytime, but the tracks in “Sensory Healing strategies” require external materials and preparation.\n\nOne of the key elements of this app is bilateral stimulation (bls), which is derived from EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). In conjunction with focused attention bls uses sensory stimulation to change physical emotional and cognitive processes associated with chronic pain (as well as trauma and stress). \n\nFor best results you should listen to the tracks that incorporate bls with headphones or hear-buds. You can use the app anytime anywhere but a quiet environment when you don’t feel too overwhelmed by stress or physical discomfort is best. \n\nIf you don’t get the response you expect when listening to the tracks never force yourself or get frustrated, just relax and trust that the relief you are seeking will happen sooner or later.\n\nWhile every effort has been made to provide a genuinely useful resource this app should not be considered a substitute for professional advice or treatment. In addition to standard medical care you should at the consider seeking psychotherapy, improving your diet, exercising regularly etc. \nFor curious minds there’s a number of articles presented in the application where you can read more about both EMDR and chronic pain and bilateral stimulation healing effect. \nYou can also read more about chronic pain and how to overcome it from the Mark Grant’s book called “Change Your Brain Change Your Pain” which you can also order by following the link in “Overcoming pain based on EMDR” placed under “Other Resources” section."

You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

      "label": "WHAT IS CLOCK YOURSELF? \n\nClock Yourself challenges you to think on your feet.  \n\nIt involves exercise for your body and your brain, at the same time.  \nEvery challenge will stimulate your brain in a different way. \n\nYou don't have to master one challenge before you can explore another challenge.  \n\nSome call this an exercise app. \nSome call this a brain games app.  \nWhy can’t it be both?! \n\n\n \nWHO CAN USE CLOCK YOURSELF? \n\nEveryone! \n\nClock Yourself exercises involve taking one step in all directions on a circle visualised beneath your feet. It’s perfect for exercise at home.  \n\nAthletes often modify Clock Yourself exercises outdoors for sport-specific agility drills, by visualising a much larger circle and running between the coordinates.  \n\nSimilarly, people who are unable to walk can modify Clock Yourself to practise reaching with their arms, or wheelchair agility! \n\nIf you think you’re too slow to use Clock Yourself, you’re probably wrong.  \nIf you think you’re too fit to use Clock Yourself, you’re definitely wrong! \n\n\n\n\nWHY DID WE MAKE CLOCK YOURSELF?\n\nThe Clock Yourself concept originated in neurological rehabilitation. Now anyone can use it to harness their neuroplasticity.  \n\nIt was developed by Australian physiotherapist @MegLowryPT and software developer Dave Wallace. \n\n\n \nWe had 5 goals: \n\n1. Make it fun - Clock Yourself exercises are so entertaining that you’ll show your friends at parties! \n\n2. Make it versatile  - Both the stepping speed and the cognitive complexity are in your control.  \n\n3. Make it evidence based - This is a volitional step training method. Volitional stepping trains faster steps in all directions to improve your chances of catching yourself during a fall.  \n\n4. Make it portable - There is no need to set up mats, wires or sensors. It also works offline. It only requires internet for your initial download from the App Store.  \n\n5. Make it affordable - This is a once off purchase for pocket change. It has no recurring subscriptions and no advertisements.  \n\n\n\nIS CLOCK YOURSELF AVAILABLE IN OTHER LANGUAGES? \n\nYes and no. \n\nAt this stage, all of the buttons and instructions are in English only.  \n\nHowever, if you click the Options button within each challenge (except for the Simple Colours challenge) you can choose to play the audio prompts in six other languages. \n\nMandarin \nJapanese \nFrench  \nGerman \nSpanish \nDutch  \n\nWhat are you waiting for?  Go ahead and Clock Yourself!\n\n“A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new” - Albert Einstein"

The DQS Mobile app was designed to make it as easy as possible to calculate a Diet Quality Score each day.\n\nAs you eat throughout the day, enter the servings of each category of food that you consume. Tap a box to consume one serving of that category, tap it again and it will become a half serving, and one more tap will set it back to zero for that box. You can tap the category name to view an explanation of what foods fall under that category. Your total DQS score for the day is shown in the upper right corner of the page.  DQS data is saved for each day you track it. \n\nYou can also log your weight and body fat % on the bottom of the Tracking page. We recommend you log your weight no more than once per week.\n\nThe Graphs page lets you see how you are doing with your Diet Quality Score over time. You can view your data over the last week, month or year. When viewing yearly data, it is displayed as 52 week-long averages. You can view graphs showing your total DQS, your weight, or your DQS score by specific category.\n\nYou can set a target weight, body fat % and a target DQS score on the Profile page."

This application may have utility in clinical and research settings\". -J Phys Ther Sci. 2018 Jan; 30(1): 31–36.\n \nThis easy to use HIPAA compliant application is made for Chiropractors, Physical and Massage Therapists, and Fitness Professionals who wish to objectively and quickly evaluate the posture, movement, and body composition of existing or prospective patients at a health/spinal screening or any patient/client encounter. PostureScreen with its’ upgrade modules, can accurately assess the status of patients/clients and be used for prescribing corrective exercises according to the screening results. The solution encompasses analysis of Posture analysis, Body Composition analysis (both 2D and 3D analysis available) and Movement Screens (such as SquatScreen and PushUp Screen) that drive proper quantifiable objective measurement and documentation with uniform assessments. Once the analysis and exercise selection is performed, the client will receive a secure email with links to their private exercise portal to view not only still images but streaming video of their corrective protocols. Findings from the assessments are generated as both objective reports in PDF format as well as annotated jpg images, both which can be uploaded into 3rd party management software and EHRs. \n \nFEATURES:\n• Computer Vision Ai Assisted Assessments for Supported Devices\n• 1-View Quick Screen, 2-View Posture Assessments, 4-View Posture & Seated Assessment\n• Patient/Client Friendly Educational Posture and Body Composition Reports & Trend progress reports\n• Movement Screen: SquatScreen, Push-up Screen analysis links to possible underactive and overactive muscle groups with auto-exercise correctives suggestions (WebExercises Account Required)\n• Movement Screen comparison videos - side by side video analysis with annotations of overhead squat and pushup.\n• Video capture + annotation tools.\n• LeanScreen 2D Photographic Body composition analysis - uses proprietary photographic anthropometric measuring techniques. Calculate Body Fat percentage, BMI, BMR, Waist to Hip Ratio\n• LeanScreen 3D - Capture and analyze your client in true 3D! This provides same measurements of LeanScreen 2D but adds circumferential measurements of your client! (Structure Sensor Required)\n• WebExercises Platform integration for \"Suggested Exercises\" correctives based on findings (WebExercises Account Required!)\n• Pain Diagram \n• Customize email templates and PDF document text\n• SyncScreen HIPAA Compliant Cloud Service multi-device backup and Sync (subscription)\n \n*LeanScreen, SquatScreen, Comparison Module, Edit Report, SyncScreen, demographic export, pain diagram, SitScreen, 3D analysis are UPGRADE modules. App uses credits for assessments if not under subscription, the initial download comes with 25 credits. You will need to purchase additional credits or use subscription when you run out of credits. 3D Module is currently iPad only and requires Structure Sensor. You must have WebExercises account for Exercises Prescriptions.  Computer Vision Assisted Digitization only available under Unlimited Subscription for devices on iOS15 or later. \n\nPrivacy: http://postureanalysis.com/privacy-policy/\nTerms of Use: https://www.postureanalysis.com/end-user-license-agreement.html"

      "label": "Harness your innate survival responses to reverse anxiety and tension and feel more confident, naturally. Based on the popular CD of the same name, Calm and Confident is for anyone who is struggling with too much stress and not enough confidence. As the name suggests, this app is designed to help you feel both calm and confident. The app comprises innovative 10 guided meditations based on trauma therapy principles. Two of the central sessions are the 19 and 27 minute respectively Calm and Confident sessions. These transformative sessions incorporate focused attention, sensory stimulation, relaxation and re-connection with personal resources to change how you feel about yourself. Another session (‘Healing Anxiety’) addresses the role that childhood emotional neglect plays in maintaining anxiety.  Other sessions are designed to stimulate increased self-awareness, emotional regulation and security through various combinations of auditory, visual and mental stimuli.\n\nFeeling calm is essential for health and wellbeing, but without confidence it's just a nice feeling. Confidence is the end-product of feeling calm; it means experiencing yourself as connected, self-aware, energized, whole, and capable. Confidence is feeling okay about your feelings, needs and wants - it’s about feeling able to become the best version of yourself – not necessarily perfect, but the best ‘you’. As Lao Tzu said, ‘Health is the greatest possession. Contentment is the greatest treasure. Confidence is the greatest friend.’ Calm and Confident will help you to find your inner friend.\n\nBased on recent discoveries regarding brain structure and functioning, Calm and Confident uses applied neuroscience to teach you how to communicate more effectively with your nervous system to effect change. The deepest learning comes from experience, activities which stimulate sensory-emotional learning. This is different to  the ‘2+2 = 4’ kind of learning you got in school – it’s the learning that comes from doing something which changes how you feel about yourself – leading to new connections, new neural pathways. This kind of learning takes you from ‘I’m worthless’ to ‘I’m okay’; from ‘I can’t’ to ‘I can.’\n\nThe secret to achieving such confidence (when stress is getting in the way) is focused attention + bilateral stimulation (BLS), a unique combination which stimulates an in-built activation-deactivation circuit in your nervous system. BLS enables you to ‘hijack’ your own fight-flight response and transform anxiety and tension into relaxation and calm, naturally and effortlessly. It does this by harnessing your brain’s innate information processing capabilities. When your brain detects a stimuli such as BLS it‘s threat systems get activated while it figures out what’s going on. After a few seconds, once your brain recognizes there is no threat (no sabre-toothed tiger), it returns to normal levels of arousal, bringing your body with it. This happens naturally and quickly, without your having to try.\n\nThe resulting feelings of relaxation not only reduce stress – they also facilitate increased confidence. When your nervous system is in a relaxed state it is more receptive to the true real-life affirmations embedded in the tracks on this app, resulting a more positive self-state. The amazing part is that this all happens as naturally as you might experience the pleasure that comes from watching a sunset or walking on a beach. This effect has been confirmed by research. \n\nBilateral stimulation is a treatment element of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) EMDR, the revolutionary treatment for PTSD. The method seems to resolve trauma-related memories and feelings more rapidly and effectively than traditional methods.\n\nThe app can be used for emotional ‘first-aid’, as an adjunct to psychotherapy and as part of long-term efforts to feel more confident. You can learn to feel different - you know much more than you think."

      "label": "The first app dedicated to training men how to last longer in bed, through two simple exercises you can do anywhere!\n\nStamena trains your “PC muscle,” which makes it easy to stop yourself ejaculating, delays the onset of ejaculation, and even lets you have non-ejaculatory orgasms!\n\nOther kegel apps, built for women, ignore the most important exercise for male sexual stamina: the reverse kegel! \n\nReverse kegels train your PC muscles to relax, making sure that you can slow yourself down during sex. Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

      "label": "The Healing Your Thoughts App improves your state of health and well being by assisting you to transform your negative thoughts that arise throughout the day. It is important to break the habit of dropping into defeatist thoughts and attitudes and learn how to stop yourself from entering into a negative loop that blocks you from achieving your desired outcomes.\n\nThe Healing Your Thoughts App helps to shift the way you think throughout the day and will help to uplift you during challenging times. You are not denying any feelings you are experiencing. Rather it is a process of rephrasing your thoughts to change your train of thought which will lead you to a positive outcome.\n\nYou can program the app for the interval of when you would like to receive an alert of bells, a Tibetan bowl, or chimes being played. When you hear the alert you will read the message that asks you to reflect on: “What are you thinking about right now?” Your thoughts and words are seeds that when planted into your inner garden will grow into plants that do impact your life. It is important to cultivate a deep and rich inner garden to create true joy and health in your life.\n\nOnce you receive the alert go into the Library and tap on the category “word”, “phrase”, “blessing”, or “photo”. A word, phrase, blessing, or photo will appear that will inspire you to stop your current thinking and transmute/transform any negative thinking into positive thoughts. This will also help to shift your attitude and even create an inner smile.\n\nYou can use the words, phrases, blessings, or photos provided. Or you can upload your own.\n\nThe result will be that you will experience feeling more uplifted. In this way you feed yourself with love and light. This will improve your life, giving you more energy, and help you to be more creative in your life and in your work. You will be able to radiate love and light towards yourself, your loved ones, friends, co-workers, and into the world."

Don't depend on other apps that might lose your data—Health Data Importer is battle-tested with thousands of users and supports all versions of Apple's Health XML format. Start fresh without a backup when you get your new device and easily import your existing health data. Health Data Importer imports all Health data except Activity Summaries, Stand Hours, Exercise Time, and Nike Fuel data (these are API limitations).\n\nIf you ever have wanted to bring all of your health data onto a new phone without having to do a full iCloud restore, this is the app for you.\n\nTo see how easy it is, just watch the preview video (no sound). Note: while we use iCloud Drive in the preview video, iCloud Drive does not need to be enabled in order to perform an import. Just send your import to yourself in Apple mail and open it with Health Data Importer.\n\nHealth Data Importer integrates with the HealthKit framework and Health.app to import your Health XML exports.\n\n◆ Testimonials ◆\n\n“Health Importer is the app I wish I had when I moved from the iPhone 6 Plus to the 6s Plus last year. [...]  Health Importer worked perfectly in my tests and I'm going to use it again as soon as I switch to an iPhone 7 Plus.” - Federico Viticci, Macstories\n\n“Health Data Importer does exactly what the name suggests. Download the app, then load it up on your fresh new iPhone. It will scan your iCloud backups for any health data, then import all of it over to your new phone.” - Thorin Klosowski, Lifehacker\n\n“I believe Health Data Importer to be the best way to move your Health data between two iPhones. It is simple, quick, and very reliable” - Sébastian Page, iDownloadBlog\n\n◆ Features ◆\n\n‣ Import multiple sources (Apple Watch, iPhone, or from third-party apps).\n‣ Fast, quick, efficient, and battle-tested—import all your health data in just a few seconds.\n‣ Supports all versions of Health apps XML exports.\n\n◆ Help and Support ◆\n\nIf you run into an issue, please email our team at support@lionheartsw.com. We've helped many customers import their data successfully and will try our best to help you too.\n\n◆ Health XML Splitter ◆\n\nHealth Data Importer has trouble handling large exports, so we've written a macOS tool, called Health XML Splitter, to help you split them up into smaller pieces. Health XML Splitter is available for free on the Mac App Store.\n\nHealth Data Importer's privacy policy: https://lionheartsw.com/software/health-importer/privacy.html\n\nHealth Data Importer's terms of use: https://lionheartsw.com/software/health-importer/terms.html"

Go to > Health app > Browse > Heart > Hear Rate Variability.\n\n***Get Notified***\nHRV Tracker makes spotting changes in your HRV easy by monitoring your HRV measurements in the background and showing notifications after your HRV drops under or rises above your desired levels. HRV Tracker will monitor changes in individual measurements and also your 24 hour HRV average. You can change the default notification levels directly in your Apple Watch app. Please note that notifications can get postponed for example because of a low battery level.\n\n***Apple Watch for daily tracking***\nBrowse through last seven days of HRV measurements by using the digital crown. See how measurements compare to your seven day period and individual days. By tapping the graph you can toggle through the first values of each day. Use complications on your Apple Watch to stay informed on changes in your HRV. \n\nBesides the automatically recorded HRV measurements you can use the Breathe app on your Apple Watch to record new HRV measurements. Start a Breathe session in the Breathe app and after the session ends a new HRV measurement will be available in HRV Tracker.\n\n***Compare HRV to other key metrics***\nFind possible causes for changes in HRV by using the comparison graphs available on your Apple Watch:\n-Sleep hours: By default HRV Tracker will use sleep data provided by sleep apps that add sleep data to HealthKit. If no sleep data is available HRV Tracker will calculate estimated sleep hours per night (estimated sleep time will only be available in the Apple Watch app)\n-Activity: By default HRV Tracker will use your Active Energy (calories) as the activity metric. In the HRV Tracker Apple Watch app you can choose to use a custom activity score that emphasizes the intensity of daily activity.\n-Daily resting heart rate (RHR).\nToggle between comparison graphs by tapping the upper part of the screen.\n\n***Follow Long-term HRV trend***\nFollow your long-term HRV trend on your iPhone and compare your short term measurements to all-time data.\n-Select week from weekly graph to see daily HRV values of the selected week.\n-Browse through all daily HRV values of the selected day\n-Compare daily HRV averages to other relevant daily metrics: Activity, Sleep (if available in the Health app) and Resting Heart Rate\n\n***Widgets on iPhone***\n-Medium sized widget with chart showing all daily hrv values\n-Multiple small widgets to choose from\n\n***Privacy***\nData read from the Apple HealthKit database is only used to show information related to your Heart Rate Variability. Information read by HRV Tracker is only stored and used locally on your iPhone and Apple Watch. \n\n***How is it measured***\nHeart rate variability measurements used by HRV Tracker are calculated by measuring the variation between individual heartbeats. Your Apple Watch automatically measures your HRV in the background and stores the outcome into HealthKit. HealthKit uses SDNN heart rate variability, which is calculated using the standard deviation of the inter-beat (RR) intervals between normal heartbeats (measured in milliseconds). Besides background measurements generated automatically by your Apple Watch you can use the Breathe app on your Apple Watch to generate new measurements."

      "label": "Anxiety Release shows you how to release anxious thoughts and feelings naturally, by harnessing the power of your brain. It does this by combining guided instructions and focused attention with bilateral brain stimulation. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a revolutionary treatment which is based on the use of sensory stimulation to alter anxiety-provoking memories and responses. Over 30 randomized controlled studies of EMDR attest to the efficacy of this process. \n\nBecause bilateral stimulation appeals to the unconscious, sensing part of the brain, there is no need for effortful thinking or struggling with feelings.  All you have to do is LISTEN and your brain will do the rest! The App consists of;\n1 x brain training session\n2 x guided anxiety management sessions\n1 x pure bilateral stimulation session (audio & visual)\n1 x safe place exercise\nProgress Log function\nPowerful Bls brain visual \nThis App is suitable for both clinicians and clients\n\nCaution: Persons suffering with complex PTSD or mental health problems, multiple psychological trauma or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without medical supervision."

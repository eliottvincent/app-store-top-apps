This sleepmatic sounds machine is created using an ancient but doctor-tested and approved technique to help soothe your fussy baby calm with a shusher sound in cradle. \r\n\r\nA simple baby shusher with soothing sounds for baby that works on a single click, making calming sounds like baby lullaby that would work instantly and can be played for hours, recommended by parents, baby photographers, and doctors dealing with babies.\r\n\r\nBy creating calm sounds, safely stop the baby from crying with a rhythmic “shush” sound that engages a baby's natural calming reflex by reminding them of still being in the womb. The shush baby app helps to soothe baby calm and increase the baby sleep timer.\r\n\r\nThe amazing Sound Equalizer allows the app to \"listen\" to your baby crying or not every three minutes and automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby cry volume till baby calms down (so when the baby is wailing, shush is loud; when baby goes quiet, volume settles into a soothing background shush sound to relax baby).\r\n\r\nA newborn sleep magic baby sound machine that works best for a newborn baby to calm down quickly and manage baby sleeping patterns. A sleep aid that creates calming sounds for babies in the form of a shhh sound sleeper that will stop your baby crying, calms down easily, and put baby to sleep. \r\n\r\nThis shhh app calm baby instantly by creating a shusher sound, helping the baby relax in minutes using calming sounds for kids.  This sleepmatic app works like magic for the crying baby and helps parenting so much easier as baby calmer. \r\n\r\nAfter more than two years of testing and research with real moms and real babies, having sudden and long crying baby issues, we came up with the following very valuable feature list of baby soothing sound.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Safe and easy to use baby calming sounds machine. \r\n- Much more effective than simple lullabies or standard white noise.\r\n- Perfectly works for hours in the background and when the phone is locked\r\n- Adjustable Shush baby sound Timer Options (from 15 minutes to 8 hours of continuous shushing!)\r\n- Automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby crying volume.\r\n- Shush sounds played in low light “dark mode” ( night mode) to avoid extra mobile light as baby sleeps.\r\n- Work in other Apps on your Phone while still using the Baby Shusher App.\r\n\r\n*Note: Turn your phone on silent/mute to let the app do its magic.*\r\n \r\n \r\nWhat Real Moms are Saying About the Baby Shusher:\r\n\r\n“I wish I would have known about this sooner.

      "label": "The Healing Your Thoughts App improves your state of health and well being by assisting you to transform your negative thoughts that arise throughout the day. It is important to break the habit of dropping into defeatist thoughts and attitudes and learn how to stop yourself from entering into a negative loop that blocks you from achieving your desired outcomes.\n\nThe Healing Your Thoughts App helps to shift the way you think throughout the day and will help to uplift you during challenging times. You are not denying any feelings you are experiencing. Rather it is a process of rephrasing your thoughts to change your train of thought which will lead you to a positive outcome.\n\nYou can program the app for the interval of when you would like to receive an alert of bells, a Tibetan bowl, or chimes being played. When you hear the alert you will read the message that asks you to reflect on: “What are you thinking about right now?” Your thoughts and words are seeds that when planted into your inner garden will grow into plants that do impact your life. It is important to cultivate a deep and rich inner garden to create true joy and health in your life.\n\nOnce you receive the alert go into the Library and tap on the category “word”, “phrase”, “blessing”, or “photo”. A word, phrase, blessing, or photo will appear that will inspire you to stop your current thinking and transmute/transform any negative thinking into positive thoughts. This will also help to shift your attitude and even create an inner smile.\n\nYou can use the words, phrases, blessings, or photos provided. Or you can upload your own.\n\nThe result will be that you will experience feeling more uplifted. In this way you feed yourself with love and light. This will improve your life, giving you more energy, and help you to be more creative in your life and in your work. You will be able to radiate love and light towards yourself, your loved ones, friends, co-workers, and into the world."

They will be automatically placed in your AM and/or PM routine as recommended.\n\n\n• ADD CUSTOM PRODUCTS\n\nYou can add custom skincare products from other brands by selecting the option in the top-right menu in the Routine section or from the Custom tab in the Products section.\n\n\n• USE YOUR ROUTINE FOR LAYERING ADVICE\n\nThe products are listed in the recommended layering order, along with advice for when and how to use each product.\n\n\n• KEEP TRACK OF USAGE TO AVOID CONFLICTS\n\nEach morning and evening, check each product off your list to keep track of which treatments you have used. This will allow the app to prevent any conflicts by showing you which products should be avoided.\n\n\n• TRACK YOUR SKIN'S PROGRESS\n\nAny time you notice your skin is looking particularly good or bad, you can make a note of it by pressing on the face icon next to the morning or evening routine. You can also add a comment to note down more details for your own record and add photos to track your progress.\n\n\n• ADD PHOTOS\n\nYou can add photos of your skin to your diary tracker and also add photos of custom products.\n\n\n• REMINDERS & TIMERS\n\nYou can set up notifications to remind you about your daily skin regimen. You can also set timers for products which require a specific wait time. Both can be found in the Settings.\n\n\n\n*** Advanced App Customization ***\n\n• RE-ORDER YOUR ROUTINE\n\nIf you don't wish to follow the recommended layering order, you can choose to re-order the products to fully customize your routine by selecting the option from the top right menu (with 3 dots) of the Routine section. You can also change the order of the layer steps, for instance DECIEM recommends oils before moisturizers but some users prefer the other way around.\n\n\n• USE CONFLICTING PRODUCTS\n\nWhen we recommend not using a product due to conflicts with other products or because you've reached the usage limit, you can choose to ignore the warning and use it anyway. You will then have the option to permanently ignore conflicts on that specific product.\n\n\n• SCHEDULE PRODUCTS\n\nYou can choose specific days of the week for a product if you wish. For instance, you may wish to make it so that the \"AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution\" only appears in your routine on Tuesdays and Fridays.\nYou can also choose dates of the month, e.g. the 1st and 15th of every month.\nAnother useful option is to schedule products for every X days, so you could choose every 2 days to alternate.\n\n\n\n*** Recommended for skin concerns... ***\n\n• Dry & Dehydrated Skin: Achieve plump, healthy-looking hydrated skin.\n• Acne-Prone Skin: Reduce inflammation to help support clear skin.\n• Blemishes & Congestion: Reduce inflammation and brighten the skin.\n• Sensitive Skin: Keep your skin moisturized with this gentle routine.\n• Mature Skin & Wrinkles: Promote youthful skin and reduce the signs of aging.\n• Pigmentation Problems: Gently exfoliate and brighten skin tone.\n• Oily Skin: Rebalance your skin for a healthy, fresh look.\n\n\nPlease note, Skincare Routine (previously known as \"Skincare Regimen Organizer\") has no connection with DECIEM, The Ordinary or any other skincare brand."

Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

      "label": "Anxiety Release shows you how to release anxious thoughts and feelings naturally, by harnessing the power of your brain. It does this by combining guided instructions and focused attention with bilateral brain stimulation. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a revolutionary treatment which is based on the use of sensory stimulation to alter anxiety-provoking memories and responses. Over 30 randomized controlled studies of EMDR attest to the efficacy of this process. \n\nBecause bilateral stimulation appeals to the unconscious, sensing part of the brain, there is no need for effortful thinking or struggling with feelings.  All you have to do is LISTEN and your brain will do the rest! The App consists of;\n1 x brain training session\n2 x guided anxiety management sessions\n1 x pure bilateral stimulation session (audio & visual)\n1 x safe place exercise\nProgress Log function\nPowerful Bls brain visual \nThis App is suitable for both clinicians and clients\n\nCaution: Persons suffering with complex PTSD or mental health problems, multiple psychological trauma or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without medical supervision."

      "label": "DBT Diary Card is the only DBT iPhone app designed and created by a licensed and DBT intensively trained psychologist.\n\nHighlights of version 3.0:\n\n+ graphing data across time\n+ on device PDF viewing\n+ daily reminders\n+ Password locking to prevent others from seeing your diary cards.\n\nRead what our actual users say:\n\n\"***** Best DBT app available!!!\nSimply put, this is the most helpful DBT or CBT app available. I bought a new iPhone to be able to use it. DBT skills are priceless. I had tried every, other DBT and CBT app. This one follows the traditional DBT program exactly, and is the only Diary Card. Before I had this app, I'd seldom fill in my diary card. Now that I have it, I don't have to keep track of paper, and I rarely miss a day. I can fill in my Diary Card discreetly, from anywhere, anytime, and send it directly to my DBT coach. I no longer have to worry about someone coming across my Diary Cards. You can brush up on skills, use it for distress tolerance suggestions, tailor it to your needs, and even journal. I appreciate that I can add personal goals to my diary. Thank you for this app!\" - iTunes US Review\n\n\"***** I am in IRL-DBT and this app is the perfect complement. Oh. I love that the app is so flexible, that you can make it kind of your own, and the layout is so nice, simple, yet beautiful. For me, a true life-saver! Genius! Without a doubt the best app in my IPhone... Get it now!\" - iTunes Sweden Review\n\n\"***** Perfect! Worth the money!\" - iTunes US Review\n\nAs an educated consumer, it's important to know to whom you're listening. DBT Diary Card was created by a Ph.D. psychologist trained directly by Dr. Marsha Linehan and at the Duke University Medical Center; we are experts in DBT, providing consultation to many in our community. And now we're giving it to you!\n\nA DBT app can have 3 parts: \n\n- A reference manual\n- A behavior tracker\n- A skills coach\n\nDBT Diary Card has all 3 of these parts and utilizes the iOS platform in ways that the other apps available don't and can't.\n\n+ PDF generation\n+ Notification Pane support\n+ Password protection\n+ Advanced text editing\n+ Media playback\n\nWhat DBT Diary Card has to offer:\n\n- Skills. LOTS of them. Every DBT skill you've ever heard about in a group is in here. It can be your quick reference to your skills so that you don't have to carry around your book or binder. Every skill is described in readable language to help you understand them easily and it's all just a quick tap away.\n\n- Emotions. All the \"basic\" emotions are presented, again with descriptions and explanations a quick tap away.\n\n- Behaviors. The most troublesome are pre-loaded.\n\n- Coaching. If you know you need to use a skill but can't think of which one or can't remember how to choose, use the app. The coaching can be your virtual therapist. \n\n- Complete customizability. Are you working on something different or do you have a different understanding of a particular skill or emotion? Change it. It's that easy. You are not wedded to the way it's presented in the app. It's all completely customizable.\n\n- 911 skills.  Put your emergency skills a tap away. You can call directly from the app, listen to your distress tolerance music, remember what apps help in the moment. \n\n- Email. You can email your therapist your diary card on a weekly basis automatically, you can do it manually whenever you'd like or you can have the app remind you.\n\n* Telephony features require an iPhone and voice service."

      "label": "WHAT IS CLOCK YOURSELF? \n\nClock Yourself challenges you to think on your feet.  \n\nIt involves exercise for your body and your brain, at the same time.  \nEvery challenge will stimulate your brain in a different way. \n\nYou don't have to master one challenge before you can explore another challenge.  \n\nSome call this an exercise app. \nSome call this a brain games app.  \nWhy can’t it be both?! \n\n\n \nWHO CAN USE CLOCK YOURSELF? \n\nEveryone! \n\nClock Yourself exercises involve taking one step in all directions on a circle visualised beneath your feet. It’s perfect for exercise at home.  \n\nAthletes often modify Clock Yourself exercises outdoors for sport-specific agility drills, by visualising a much larger circle and running between the coordinates.  \n\nSimilarly, people who are unable to walk can modify Clock Yourself to practise reaching with their arms, or wheelchair agility! \n\nIf you think you’re too slow to use Clock Yourself, you’re probably wrong.  \nIf you think you’re too fit to use Clock Yourself, you’re definitely wrong! \n\n\n\n\nWHY DID WE MAKE CLOCK YOURSELF?\n\nThe Clock Yourself concept originated in neurological rehabilitation. Now anyone can use it to harness their neuroplasticity.  \n\nIt was developed by Australian physiotherapist @MegLowryPT and software developer Dave Wallace. \n\n\n \nWe had 5 goals: \n\n1. Make it fun - Clock Yourself exercises are so entertaining that you’ll show your friends at parties! \n\n2. Make it versatile  - Both the stepping speed and the cognitive complexity are in your control.  \n\n3. Make it evidence based - This is a volitional step training method. Volitional stepping trains faster steps in all directions to improve your chances of catching yourself during a fall.  \n\n4. Make it portable - There is no need to set up mats, wires or sensors. It also works offline. It only requires internet for your initial download from the App Store.  \n\n5. Make it affordable - This is a once off purchase for pocket change. It has no recurring subscriptions and no advertisements.  \n\n\n\nIS CLOCK YOURSELF AVAILABLE IN OTHER LANGUAGES? \n\nYes and no. \n\nAt this stage, all of the buttons and instructions are in English only.  \n\nHowever, if you click the Options button within each challenge (except for the Simple Colours challenge) you can choose to play the audio prompts in six other languages. \n\nMandarin \nJapanese \nFrench  \nGerman \nSpanish \nDutch  \n\nWhat are you waiting for?  Go ahead and Clock Yourself!\n\n“A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new” - Albert Einstein"

Sedona Arizona has 100+ trails covering forests, streams and red rock grandeur so you’ll need a guide.  Sedona Hiking can be that guide.  We supply trail descriptions, directions to the trail head, points of interest and the ability to follow your progress in real time with your GPS.  Following the trails has never been easier.  Now you can concentrate on enjoying the beauty of Sedona and not map reading or deciphering stacks of rocks.   Load the Trail information into your iPhone or iPad (with GPS) device and “Take a Hike”!  The trail maps and points of interest are preloaded so you don’t need cell service.  Visit www.SedonaHikingApp.com for trail listings and hike highlights with pictures from the trails. \nHere’s how it works: After you decide on the trails you’d like to experience you download the trails onto your iPhone or iPad (with a network connection) and select them as you do the hike.  Everything you need is in each hike package.\n\n1. Highlights and features of the selected hiking trail.\n\n2. Length and difficulty rating of the trail.\n\n3. A detailed description of the trail and what you’ll encounter and experience on the hike.\n\n4. Directions to the trail head or live directions and map if you so desire and have network connection.\n\n5. A trail map on screen that allows you to follow your progress and see your location in real time via GPS so you can be confident you’re on the trail.\n\n6. There are trail markers for intersections to watch for and pictures of what is ahead on the trail so you don’t miss out on sights that might be slightly off the trail.\n\nWe have over 400 trail miles of Sedona beauty! \n\n** You DO need a good network connection to download the trails.  If you experience trouble please email us, we can help.\n\n**  Be sure to give the app permission for location services!  This is in the Privacy section of the Settings app.  The poor review we received is the result of this setting NOT being on.  Please email us before posting a poor review.  We can help.\n\nThis really is hiking for everyone.\n\nAll of our trails are hiked by us, tracks are recorded by us and verified by us, not downloaded from random hike web sites or crowd sourced.\n\nThe app will show your location in real-time to keep you on the trail!"

      "label": "L'apps Check-in CNV vous aide dans les moments où vous avez besoin de connexion avec vous-même ou avec une autre personne. Le modèle de la Communication NonViolente vous aide à prendre conscience, pas à pas, de ce que vous avez observé, de ce que vous ressentez, de ce dont vous avez besoin et de ce que vous pourriez faire pour atteindre ce but. \n\nLa connexion à soi-même est LA clé pour gérer de façon efficace tous les stimuli qui nous arrivent dans la vie quotidienne. Peu importe que ces stimuli appartiennent à la sphère professionnelle ou privée, que nous en éprouvions du plaisir ou du désagrément. \n\nDonc, que votre directeur vous confie tellement de tâches que vous sentez le stress monter, que quelqu'un vous dise: \"Je suis comme cela, c'est ainsi…\", ou qu'un automobiliste se rabatte d'une façon telle que vous êtes obligé de freiner.\n\nDans toutes ces situations, la connexion à vous-même est essentielle pour transformer la lutte et le stress en harmonie et en calme intérieur. \n\nUn Check-in, c'est s'arrêter pour être présent à ce qui est vivant en vous en ce moment et, de cette façon, créer la connexion à vous-même. L'intention des créateurs de l'apps \"Check-in\" est de contribuer à votre connexion à vous-même en vous soutenant dans les moments où: \n- Vous voulez sortir d'un cercle vicieux de pensées incessantes et tracassantes\n- Vous voulez de la clarté sur la raison pour laquelle quelque chose vous touche et sur ce que vous pouvez y faire, vous-même\n- Vous voulez traduire vos jugements sur vous-même et sur d'autres en sentiments et besoins qui créent un espace, une ouverture \n\nA l'aide du modèle de Communication NonViolente (CNV), des couleurs des Pistes de Danse CNV et d'images du projet Giraffentraum (Rêve Girafe), l'apps iCheck-in CNV vous fait prendre conscience pas à pas de ce que vous observez, ce que vous ressentez face à cela, quel besoin est satisfait ou non, et ce que vous pourriez faire dans cette situation. \n\nLes touches suivantes vous aident dans ce processus:  \n-Appuyez (à répétition) sur O pour votre Observation,\n-Appuyez (à répétition) sur S pour votre Sentiment,\n-Appuyez (à répétition) sur B pour votre Besoin, \n-Appuyez (à répétition) sur D pour une Demande \n\nDans ces listes, vous pouvez faire votre sélection en appuyant plusieurs fois sur les touches OSBD ou en faisant tourner la molette de défilement. La phrase que vous composez ainsi pas à pas est continuellement mise à jour dans la fenêtre, de sorte qu'elle est toujours actuelle. \n\nEn pratique, cela peut par exemple ressembler à ceci:\n- O: Quand je remarque que je pense tout le temps à l'entretien d'embauche de demain, \n- S: Je me sens incertain, \n- B: Parce que mon besoin de confiance en mes capacités n'est pas satisfait \n- D: Veux-tu, chaque fois que ces pensées te viennent à l'esprit, prendre le temps de considérer l'expérience professionnelle que tu as acquise au cours de ces dernières années? \n\nAppuyez sur Save (Enregistrer) pour conserver la phrase. Ici, il vous est aussi possible de poster la phrase comme tweet (non-violent) sur Twitter ou comme mise à jour du statut/message partagé (favorisant la connexion) sur LinkedIn.\n\nLes touches au-dessous de l'écran: \n- Appuyez sur Mail pour envoyer par mail votre demande de connexion (phrase composée par vous-même au format CNV) à vous-même ou à quelqu'un d'autre. Un mail s'ouvre et vous pouvez encore adapter le texte et éventuellement le copier dans votre agenda pour vous l'envoyer à vous-même chaque jour à un moment déterminé. \n- Appuyez sur Log (Journal) pour retourner aux pages précédentes et relire ce dont vous aviez besoin et ce qui vous aidait auparavant."

The average American eats five or more teaspoons of salt each day. This is about 20 times as much as the body needs. In fact, your body needs only 1/4 teaspoon of salt every day. Sodium is found naturally in foods, but a lot of it is added during processing and preparation. Many foods that do not taste salty may still be high in sodium. Large amounts of sodium can be hidden in canned, processed and convenience foods. And sodium can be found in many foods that are served at fast food restaurants.\n\nSodium controls fluid balance in our bodies and maintains blood volume and blood pressure. Eating too much sodium may raise blood pressure and cause fluid retention, which could lead to swelling of the legs and feet or other health issues.\n\nWhen limiting sodium in your diet, a common target is to eat less than 2,000 milligrams of sodium per day.\n\n\nABOUT THIS APP\n========================\n\nLow Sodium Recipes Plus+ is an application containing over 400 recipes of low-sodium diet recipe that can be cooked or prepared at home easily.  For each recipe included in this App, a photo, an ingredient list, detailed nutritional information and a step by step cooking direction is provided.  This App is an excellent app for anyone who wishes to become healthier by eliminating the intake of sodium into the body, or anyone who is recommended by their family doctor to cut down on sodium consumption.\n\n** Disclaimer: This App is for reference only, please always consult your family doctor and/or physician if you have questions about your health.  \n\nThe application is optimized for iPad/iPad2/The New iPad/iPad mini, iPhone 3GS/4/4S/5/5S/5C/6/6+ & iPod Touch.\n\n\n\nFEATURES\n========================\n\nThis application has the following features:\n\n* All Items View to preview all recipes in alphabetical order with thumbnails\n* Ability to BOOKMARK selected recipes for easier reference\n* Add a CUSTOM NOTE to any recipe\n* iCloud synchronized Bookmarks and Custom Notes\n* EMAIL any items to yourself & friends\n* A recipe SEARCH engine\n* Enter a RANDOM entry when shaking the device (if you cannot make up your mind)\n* OFFLINE browsing\n\n========================\n\nThis application is brought to you by abecook.com"

You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

This app calculates the weights you should use, based on your one rep max, for the 3-week Smolov Jr. and 13-week Full Smolov Squat protocols. The app also makes it easy to keep track of where you are in the cycle.\r\n\r\nThis Russian squat cycle has also been used by many for other lifts such as the bench press, shoulder press and deadlift with big jumps in strength. Smolov isn't for new lifters, but if you have some experience under your belt (like with 5/3/1, starting strength, 20 squat, etc.), then this may be a great lifting protocol for you."

You follow the same instruction and in the same time as if attending our actual class.\n\nLying on the floor, we strengthen the abdominals with 5 progressive core practices, comfortably lengthen the hamstrings, quads, adductors and psoas, explore simple range-of-motion of the hips, relax in a gentle spinal rotation, and practice hip and spinal extension. By the end, with increased space and improved support, like our students, you'll feel relief from chronic pain and discomfort.\n\nUS App  Store (1/26/17)\n***** \"Love it and I can feel the difference\"\n\"I've been using it for 2 weeks and can feel the difference. My wife does too. It's a basic app but the content is excellent.\"\n\nBeyond the mechanics, we set the rhythm to achieve a deep internal focus, mindful movement, and awareness to remain well within one's comfort zone, all hallmarks of yoga. We also relax between practices to consciously observe and release protective holding pattens to enhance benefit.\n\nUK App Store (10/20/16)\n***** \"Sam\"\n\"Brilliant app changed my life...I can't recommend this app highly enough which I do to everyone I talk to about back pain.\"\n\nOBJECTIVES:\n\n•\tFocused breathing to lengthen the lumbar spine\n•\tAbdominal strengthening\n•\tLeg strengthening & stretching\n•\tHip opening & extension\n•\tHip flexor stretching\n•\tSpinal flexion & extension\n•\tDeep guided relaxation\n\nCanada App Store (7/1/16)\n*****\"Excellent app, exercises are very easy to follow\"\n\"Worth the price!\"\n\n6 ADDITIONAL CLASSES\n\nThe '7 Classes' app reuses all 28 practices of the \"Full Back Class\" to formulate 6 additional classes:\n\n•\tThe Full Back Class (66 min.)\n•\tModified classes:\n                for lordosis* (54 min.)\n                for sciatica* (58 min.)\n                for SI joint* (52 min.)\n•\tMaintenance Program (34 min.)\n•\tCrisis Management (7 min.) - after injury when inflammation has subsided\n•\tOn-the-go (11 min.) - for holiday travel\n\n*The modified classes remove contraindicated practices of the full back class and are not intended as a treatment for said condition.\n\nLuxembourg App Store (6/8/16)\n*****\"...even the 11 min (\"On-the-go\") class can make a difference...\"\n\n(screen grabs & more reviews at www.yoga.lu/pages/58)\n\nThe app costs just one-third the price of a single class at our centers.\n\nFurther testimonials from among our centers' students (www.yoga.lu/styles/3):\n\n\"I had almost resigned about my worsening back pain. When I started the lower back yoga, the effect was immediate, and for the last year, having followed the classes regularly, my back has been better than in 20 years. I even started skiing again.\" ~ Jonas Winnerlov, 50\n\n\"Since I am doing my (your) practices, I feel much stronger and far more stabilised and am able to do walks of 7-8 kms (a year ago I would not have though this possible).\" ~ Nicole Mahowald, 74\n\n\"I am feeling much better today! It’s incredible how a few gentle movements can make the difference.\" ~ Olivia Roland, 26\n\nFEEDBACK LINK\n\nWe've added a feedback link on the app to answer questions and to hear how it's going. We wish to hear from you.\n\nBest wishes and have a great class!\n\nYouTube channel: Fred Bender's Lower Back Yoga\nFacebook: Fred Bender's Lower Back Yoga\nSupport - lowerbackyoga.com/support"

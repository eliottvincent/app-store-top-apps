We will try to fix it once iOS system allows it.\n\nNote about Athan :\n-----------------\nSalatuk remind you that it's time for prayer with a \"4 takbeerats\" instead of full Athan. Because of technical limitations, it's possible to play full Athan only if the app is open. \n\nAlso, if you have problems to hear the notifications, please make sure to enable the following parameters in your device :\n\n1) Settings>Sounds>Alerts \n2) Settings>Notifications>Salatuk \n3) Your phone is not on mute and volume is correct\n\nNote about Prayers times :\n-----------------------------------\nPlease note that we pay attention to ensure that the prayer times of Salatuk are accurate.

In this case, please refer to the official islamic institutions or mosques in your country and adjust manually the prayer times in the application settings.\n\nSalatuk supports currently 3 languages : Arabic, English and French.\n\nTips for a better usage\n-----------------------------\n\n1- In order to refresh the prayer alarms, make sure to open the application once a week. Please do so also when you change your location or timing (summer time).\n\n2- The prayer alarms corresponds to 2 or 4 Takbeerats.

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

      "label": "Apple Watch, Nest Thermostat, and Siri. Together at last.\n\n＊ The app has Siri Voice shortcuts for seamless Siri control of your Nest, from the iPhone, Watch, iPad, and HomePod. It fully supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\n＊ The app lets you monitor and control HomeKit thermostats like Ecobee, and functions largely the same with them as it does with Nest, except for the Siri Shortcuts functionality which is not needed with HomeKit. It lets you see your thermostat info on the Watch complications, and control it using the iOS widget.\n_____________\n\n• Using Siri voice shortcuts you can control many aspects of your Nest, such as instant activation of heating or cooling, setting the temperature by saying how many degrees you want to set, increasing/decreasing the temperature, and setting the Home/Away state. Thanks to Thermo Watch, It's all finally just one casual \"Hey Siri\" away, all with informative visual and verbal feedback.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Thermo Watch complication to open the app. Spin the Digital Crown, or Swipe up/down to adjust the temperature. You can start adjusting the moment the app opens.\n• On your iOS device you can see the thermostat info on the home screen widget, you can swipe to the widget panel to adjust the temperature on the interactive widget, or you can just open the app. Again, you can start adjusting the moment the controls appear.\n• From your Apple TV, open the app, and swipe up/down on the remote to change the temperate.\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nThe app will let you know with a chime and a tap, that the thermostat has received and applied your command.\n\nMonitor your Thermostats and Home/Away status right from the watch face, using complications that update in the background, without having to launch the app.\n\nYou can use Siri on your iPhone, Watch, iPad, or HomePod to control any of your thermostats. Record phrases that make most sense to you, such as \"Start Heating\" or \"Make it Cooler\". If you have multiple thermostats you can control them individually, by saying for example \"Start Heating Upstairs\" or \"Start Cooling the Living Room\".\n\nVisit https://thermowatch.net/siri website for the detailed instructions of Siri operation.\n\nSet Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nThe app supports multiple thermostats in multiple homes - just swipe left and right on your Watch screen to access them, or see them all at the same time in the iOS Widget and the app. Fahrenheit and Celsius are both supported.\n\nBeyond that, you can press the Watch screen firmly for additional functions, like switching to a heating or cooling mode, setting the away status, choosing the active temperature sensor, or turning the fan on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nThermo Watch does not collect any of your data. Your login information, thermostat settings, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Thermo Watch does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

By starting the slot machine, the first partner sets all three reels in motion. After the reels come to a halt, he/she can already look forward to the sweet prize - a random erotic experience being the combination of the activity, at which bodypart to be performed, and for how long. The partners take turns and so after the activity is over the other partner pushes the SPIN button and awaits his/her erotic price.\n \nBut be careful, because it is not always clear who is going to please whom. Each turn is a thrilling experience right to the last moment thanks to the negative time values on the time limit reel. When the negative time limit appears, the partner who spun the reels will treat his/her partner.\n \nIn this game, you can either use the provided slot machines or create your own. You can change the slot machines during the game to accommodate your taste for the softer or more daring tasks.   \n \nFor the quick start, there are five predefined erotic slot machines available, carefully created to avoid unreal combinations. You can adjust each slot machine to suit your preferences, and also to create your own.  There are many possibilities to think of and it’s up to you and your imagination which stimulating combinations you will create.\n \nThis erotic game is suitable for all couples regardless of their sexual orientation. Thus, each couple can spice-up their love life.  \n \nPleasure Machine is a game with erotic content and is for adults only. PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL IF YOU’RE UNDER 18.\n\nGame is also translated in Slovak, Czech and Polish language. You can set those languages directly in the game global settings."

From Polynesian (Tahitian, Samoan, Tongan, etc.) tatau. In Marquesan, tatu.\" Before the importation of the Polynesian word, the practice of tattooing had been described in the West as pricking, painting, or staining. Sailors on the voyage later introduced both the word and reintroduced the concept of tattooing to Europe.\n\nThis is not to be confused with the origins of the word for the military drumbeat — see military tattoo. In this case, the English word tattoo is derived from the Dutch word taptoe (OED).\n\nThe first written reference to the word tattoo (or tatau), appears in the journal of Joseph Banks (24 February 1743 – 19 June 1820), the naturalist aboard Captain Cook's ship the HMS Endeavour: \"I shall now mention the way they mark themselves indelibly, each of them is so marked by their humor or disposition\".\n\nThe word \"tattoo\" was brought to Europe by the explorer James Cook, when he returned in 1771 from his first voyage to Tahiti and New Zealand. In his narrative of the voyage, he refers to an operation called \"tattaw\". Before this it had been described as scarring, painting, or staining\n\nTattoo enthusiasts may refer to tattoos as \"ink\", \"pieces\", \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"tats\", or \"work\"; to the creators as \"tattoo artists\", \"tattooers\", or \"tattooists\"; and to places where they work as \"tattoo shops\", \"tattoo studios\", or \"tattoo parlors\".\n\n\nA tattooed man's back, Japan, c. 1875\nUsage of the terms \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"pieces\", and work\" is gaining greater support,[citation needed] with mainstream art galleries holding exhibitions of both conventional and custom tattoo designs. Beyond Skin, at the Museum of Croydon, is an example of this as it challenges the stereotypical view of tattoos and who has them. Copyrighted tattoo designs that are mass-produced and sent to tattoo artists are known as \"flash\", a notable instance of industrial design. Flash sheets are prominently displayed in many tattoo parlors for the purpose of providing both inspiration and ready-made tattoo images to customers.\n\nThe Japanese word irezumi means \"insertion of ink\" and can mean tattoos using tebori, the traditional Japanese hand method, a Western-style machine, or for that matter, any method of tattooing using insertion of ink. The most common word used for traditional Japanese tattoo designs is Horimono. Japanese may use the word \"tattoo\" to mean non-Japanese styles of tattooing."

Its full-screen appearance integrates with the iPhone/iPad device body and blends into your living space ambience, as if it were a minimalist home decor item.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Switch between 12/24 hour clock\n- Switch between portrait and landscape mode\n- Option to show seconds when tapping screen\n- Brightness/dimness control inside the app\n- Show/hide background tiles\n- Enlarge/reduce to any size\n\nNOTES:\n- Your device’s Auto-Lock is disabled while this clock is active in the foreground.\n- This app does not start automatically like the Mac screensaver.\n- You cannot replace your device’s Lock Screen with this clock."

He believes passionately that once the physical body dies, our spirit lives on. He has dedicated his life to his own spiritual development and teaching, as well as offering peace and comfort during times of loss and bereavement. “To see a group of students walk out of one of my workshops inspired, awakened, motivated, and energized is all the gratitude that I need,” John says. “If I somehow help them to start their own journey, then I’ve done my job.” \n\nAuthor of the bestsellers Power of the Soul, Born Knowing, Psychic Navigator, and 101 Ways to Jump-Start Your Intuition, John also hosted his own weekly radio show on Hay House Radio, Spirit Connections. He has become a familiar face on TV on programs such as the A&E special Mediums—We See Dead People, as well as appearing as a psychic authority on the History Channel’s Psychic History. John’s story was originally profiled on CBS’s Unsolved Mysteries. \n\nFor further information about John, to find out about his series of workshops and other events, or to sign up for his free email newsletter, visit: www.johnholland.com"

      "label": "Nothing is more exhausting than endlessly working on “yourself.” When you offer your whole Being fully to Love, self-acceptance arises spontaneously. May I rest in our Oneness, dear Divine!\n\nIf you read the lines above and think, Easier said than done, this oracle deck is for you. In 52 beautifully illustrated cards, beloved spiritual teacher and author Tosha Silver uses her accessible, slightly quirky style to convey her key teaching messages of Surrender and Offering to Divine Will.\n\nThese messages, familiar to readers of Tosha’s highly acclaimed books (Outrageous Openness and Change Me Prayers), are, at their essence, about releasing attachment to ego-defined outcomes. Each card addresses a particular situation—Aging, Ambition, Money, Regrets, Solitude, Travel, Truth—with a comment or invocation that encourages you to offer your pain around this situation to the Divine, and to call in Divine Will for the highest outcome. Intentionally non-prescriptive, the deck can be used in a variety of ways: as an oracle where the Divine guides you to a specific card; to carry or put on an altar as a reminder to reflect on a specific issue; or in any other way you are drawn to use it.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Browse The Wild Offering Oracle cards anywhere, anytime on your iOS device*\n- Save cards to review at any time*\n- Email cards to yourself or share with a friend*\n\nAbout the Author:\nTosha Silver - Graduated from Yale with a degree in English-Literature but along the way fell madly in love with yogic philosophy. For the past 30 years, she has taught people around the world ways to align with Inner Love. She's known for finding fresh, humurous, and practical ways of teaching while avoiding cliche's and dogma. Tosha is the author of Outrageous Openness and Change Me Prayers. She lives near San Francisco, where she runs an online forum that engages these ideas, called Living Outrageous Openness: Think Like a Goddess.\nwebsite: www.toshasilver.com\n\nIllustrator Katie Daisy -Found her voice and honed her skills at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design, graduating in 2009 and subsequently beginning an adventurous career as a freelance illustrator and licensed artist.

      "label": "The VisTimer was developed to provide a gentle implementation of time imposed limits.  It utilizes an animated shrinking pie chart to depict elapsed time.  Visual thinkers, especially when they are children, have difficulty conceptualizing time.  Being able to see the changing pie chart as time passes makes it easier to understand time and duration.  It is easy to explain to a child that when the circle is completely gone, an activity is finished or a task must be completed.  There is an Early Warning preference setting to indicate the timer is approaching completion.  This provides a gentle reminder to prepare and set expectations.  Even the color of the pie chart can be customized to a calming favorite color.  Sometimes allowing a child to participate in selecting these preferences creates a sense of ownership and commitment.  The VisTimer can also operate in Lock Mode, where all settings are locked after the timer is started.  This imparts it with a higher sense of authority and detaches its consequences from you.\n\nThe low stress animated circle combined with restful colors and gentle sounds also make it ideal for timing relaxation activities such as meditation and yoga."

So, what else could I do but build her a replacement. \n\nAlong the way, we added some features that we think that people raising chickens (and other poultry) might find useful. \n\nThere are three parts to the app:\n\nThe \"Harvest\" tab is designed to be used on a daily basis when you go out and find the latest batch of eggs waiting for you to collect. Sometimes environmental factors such as light or stress can affect egg production. By tracking the egg counts, you can watch for these trends.\n\nThe \"Flock\" tab is for keeping tabs on the members of your flock. If you're like us, sometimes it's hard to keep track of who's who in the coop, so adding a picture and a name goes a long way. For the breeders out there, we added a family tree graph. We haven't done this ourselves yet, so any feedback is welcome.\n\nThe \"Finances\" tab gives you the ability to see (if you want to) just how much your feathered friends are costing you in feed and other expenses. Or, if you sell your eggs or meat, how much money they are making you."

BARRY FITZGERALD & ROBB DEMAREST FROM GHOST HUNTERS INTERNATIONAL.\n\nI am so happy to announce the release of the Sv-1 SpiritVox for iOS!\n\nThere are 2 channels of random noise. Channel 1 is the ORIGINAL SV-1 SpiritVox sound & Channel B, the NEW SpiritVox Random carrier signal. The NEW \"Noise Blend\" feature allows you to blend the 2 signals any way you wish for more ways to experiment.\n\nThis version of the SV-1 iVox also features REAL TIME RECORDING. Meaning you can use headphones, ear buds or an external speaker and listen to what you are recording as it is being written to disc! This method when used with a speaker is the heart of my \"ECHOVOX\" system.\n\nI am now recommending leaving wifi on and using headphones due to the overwhelming amount of reports of this being effective by SpiritVox users.\n\nI hope you enjoy this new version of the SV-1. \n\n*******\nHardware \"Spirit boxes\" can cost hundreds of dollars and are difficult to build yourself. They are also open to radio interference and random phonetic sounds. The SV-1 SpiritVox is capable of producing results you can be confident in for a FRACTION of a hardware device! This is one tool your research group cannot afford to go without!\n\nSpiritVox on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/user/bigbeardaudio/videos\n\n*For best results turn your devices volume to 10, place on a hard surface with your device speaker facing down and prop the device up 1/2 to 1 inch above the surface. External speakers are recommended if you are using a phone without a loud speaker. Tablet speakers have been found to work very well and seem to be loud enough on their own.\n\nSpiritVox is trusted and used by over 400 Paranormal Research teams around the world! Including North London Paranormal, Paranormal Moms, Ghost Night Events UK and more!\n\n\nQuestions? Got results you would like to share?

Walking with Jesus through his Passion and Crucifixion is harrowing, and knowing that doing so can help unborn children gives it a purpose and a tenderness I haven’t often found in this devotion.\nThe app is easy to use and has beautiful graphics and images for each station.\nI think, in fact, that I may find myself learning the Stations and growing in my love of this devotion thanks to this app. I also look forward to sharing it with my children–my seven-year-old will be able to read most, if not all, of it, and I can see it being a great family prayer opportunity.\"\n\nhttp://catholicmom.com/2012/05/29/stations-for-the-unborn-app/\n\nPosted on May 29, 2012 by Sarah Reinhard\n\niPhone & iPod Touch release of \"The Way of the Cross of the Unborn\" dedicated to Our Lady of Guadalupe, Patroness of the Unborn. This devotion received an imprimatur on November 30, 1983, from the Most Reverend John L Morkovsky, Bishop of Galveston-Houston who believed the work to be divinely inspired. We hope you are inspired when you follow these beautiful meditations."

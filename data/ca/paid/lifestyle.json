When a response is detected by the app the words will show visually in the text box along with audible speech.\n\nWhen you have finished your session just click stop. You can also look back at the responses you received during your session by clicking on the folder button (this only works when the scanner is \"Stopped\").\n\nThe EMF Meter only works if your device has a Magnetometer Sensor. If not then the EMF Meter won't be displayed. Please check the compatibility of your phone / tablet.\n\n** Disclaimer **\nUse at your own risk.

      "label": "The FOUNDATION FOR INNER PEACE, original publisher of \"A Course in Miracles,\" has joined with CDE Solutions to produce this app as an aid to those working on their daily lessons from the Workbook of the Course. -- NOW AVAILABLE IN 5 LANGUAGES: English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish. As a student of the Course have you ever spent time studying your lesson in the morning only to forget to review it at the suggested time intervals during the day? Have you ever wished that you had reminders, preset at the required time intervals, to jog your memory? Have you ever remembered to review a lesson but forgot what words to use? If so, then this app is for you!\n\nIn addition to providing convenient access to the full text of the 365 daily lessons from the Course's \"Workbook for Students,\" THIS APP HAS BUILT-IN REMINDER ALERTS which have been preset with specific text to be remembered for the day and the time intervals as suggested within the lessons of the Workbook. For lessons that have no suggested time intervals, you can select a time interval of your choice. You can even override Course specified intervals to time intervals of your choice that fit in with your daily schedule. The app is simple to use. To begin you would select the lesson you are currently working on from a rotating \"wheel,\" then when the wheel stops on your lesson of the day you click on \"Full Text\" and you are presented with the full text of the lesson. Once your beginning lesson has been selected you will be presented with the same lesson when you return the next day. This allows you review the previous lesson, or move on to your daily lesson. The complete Workbook, including Introductions, can be accessed from the wheel. During the day, shortened text (the words suggested within the Workbook lesson to be used as the reminder that day) is presented when the reminder alert is sounded. These words can be changed to whatever words you would prefer to use instead. In addition, you can choose what sound you’d like to hear as a reminder, when you want the reminder to start, and when you want it to end.\n\nYou purchase the app ONLY ONCE for all devices.\n\nAbout \"A Course in Miracles\":\n\nThe Course’s teaching is based on the practice of forgiveness as the key to inner peace and the remembrance of God. While the app contains the text of the complete \"Workbook for Students\", it represents only part of the Course, a unique self-study metaphysical thought system.\n\nPublished in one volume, \"A Course in Miracles\" consists of three separate sections: \"Text\", \"Workbook for Students\" and the \"Manual for Teachers\". The \"Text\" section of the Course sets forth the theoretical concepts of the Course's thought system and thus provides the necessary framework to clarify the meaning of the \"Workbook\" exercises. It is therefore important to undertake the lessons in this app in conjunction with the writings within \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\n\"A Course in Miracles\" was received in its entirety over a period of seven years by psychologist Dr. Helen Schucman through an inspired process she described as scribing. In 1975 the Foundation for Inner Peace, co-publisher of this app, was chosen by Dr. Schucman to be the publisher of the only original edition of \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\nThe \"Workbook for Students\", contained in this app, includes 365 lessons which are designed to train your mind in a systematic way to a different perception of everyone and everything in the world. As stated in the Introduction to the Workbook: “The exercises are very simple. They do not require a great deal of time, and it does not matter where you do them. They need no preparation.” You are asked only not to undertake to do more than one exercise a day. You might however choose to remain with a particularly appealing lesson for more than one day."

On Mac, Fliqlo has long been popular as a screensaver module with the same design since its first release in 2002, and this iOS/iPadOS app is also made with exactly the same design. With its large, highly visible font, you can check the time even from a distance. Also, in everyday life and at work, its modest matt black presence does not distract you or disrupt your productivity, even when using the app for extended periods of time. Its full-screen appearance integrates with the iPhone/iPad device body and blends into your living space ambience, as if it were a minimalist home decor item.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Switch between 12/24 hour clock\n- Switch between portrait and landscape mode\n- Option to show seconds when tapping screen\n- Brightness/dimness control inside the app\n- Show/hide background tiles\n- Enlarge/reduce to any size\n\nNOTES:\n- Your device’s Auto-Lock is disabled while this clock is active in the foreground.\n- This app does not start automatically like the Mac screensaver.\n- You cannot replace your device’s Lock Screen with this clock."

Useful when waiting for that package to arrive.\n• On your iOS device you can swipe to the widget panel to see what's on all of your cameras.\n• View the continuously updated Live Feed from the camera in the watch app, the iOS widget, or the iOS app. The feed updates with a new image approximately every second on the iOS and two seconds on the Watch - may be faster or slower, depending on your network speed.\n• Use the digital crown on the Watch to zoom in and out, or tap the screen to toggle zoom levels.\n• Use the pinch gesture on the camera views in the iOS app to zoom in and out. Single tap toggles the zoom level in the iOS app and the iOS widget.\n• Turn the device to landscape mode to increase the camera views sizes.\n• Double tap on the Live Feed view in the iOS app or the widget to launch the Nest app.\n• Set Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nWatch Face Complications can display the following:\n• Snapshot from the camera of your choice that updates periodically.\n• Status of all the cameras - if the camera icon is green, it means that all your cameras are online and streaming. If it's dimmed, it means that some cameras are off.\n\nYou can long-press the Watch screen for additional functions, like setting the home/away status, or turning the camera streaming on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nPlease Note: Watch Cam does not collect any of your data. Your login information, camera feeds, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Watch Cam does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

      "label": "Susan Miller’s Moonlight App features:\n\n• Know the times Moon is Void of Course at your current location and as you travel. \n\n• Explains the 8 phases of the moon (new moon, quarter moon, full moon, balsamic moon and, so forth), what each phase means, and how to take advantage of each phase by timing your actions accordingly.\n\n• It takes the moon 2.5 days to travel through one sign, so the app’s simple calendar reveals which zodiac sign the moon is traveling in for each day and the exact time it changes signs. Some signs that the moon travels through are especially favorable for certain actions—find out the details.\n\n• This app has no subscription—it is a one-time purchase. You get all the daily information you need through 2050.\n\nYou have heard the buzz on social media about “moon void of course” or a “void moon” (both have the same meaning). You may be curious about whether you should pay attention to when the moon is void of course. By knowing when a void moon is upcoming, you can schedule actions to avoid those periods to create the most successful outcome possible. It is an app you will use quite a bit—you will want to check it every morning. \n\nSome days the moon never goes void, other days the moon will go void for a few minutes, and still other days the moon will be void for several hours—possibly for the entire day or, in rare cases, for several days. Every day is unique, so the void is never repeated in the same way, the reason you need Susan’s Moonlight app. \n\nIf you schedule a meeting when the moon is void, it will either be cancelled, or the meeting will come to nothing. Things will go on as they have before with no change. You should not schedule a first date or a wedding during a moon void period, nor should you sign a contract, have a job interview, or meet with the press during a void moon, as examples. It would not be a good idea to buy an airline ticket during a void moon, for you may have to exchange it later. If your action is vital, avoid the void. \n\nThis is an aspect that affects everyone uniformly, similar to Mercury retrograde.\n\nWith Susan Miller’s new appealing app, Moonlight, void of course periods are easy to find, understand, and navigate. The information is written in Susan Miller’s signature warm, optimistic style, and she uses no astro-babble language to confuse you. Until now, knowing when the moon is void required looking up the moon’s void of course periods on tables that are listed by Greenwich Mean Time and converting to your location. With Moonlight, the answer is a snap on Susan Miller’s app.\n\nWhat is the moon void of course, and when does it happen?\n\nThe void of course period of the moon begins when the moon has finished meeting with the other planets and has made her last EXACT major aspect to a planet or the Sun. Just as importantly, the moon must still be moving within the same zodiac sign as she was when she started receiving the planets. Once she has met with them all and is finished, the moon will go void of course. \n\nTo be precise, the moon may make an aspect to another planet. It could be a conjunction, square, trine, sextile, or opposition. These are the aspects that were outlined by the ancient Egyptian astrologer Ptolemy. Ptolemy is considered the father of the Western astrology we use today, and we call these aforementioned aspects “Ptolemaic” aspects. You need not be concerned about knowing what these aspects mean—Susan Miller does the work for you.\n\nAfter the moon has communicated with other planets each month, the moon rests, and as said, that ushers in the void period. As she rests, the moon cannot lend any of her considerable powers to you. That’s not good for any of us. We need all the help we can get from the graceful moon on a daily basis."

      "label": "Ravit is a fun app that enables you to discover inspirational patterns and yarns, update your projects and stash and browse and post to Ravelry forums from anywhere. It's super quick, and it's friendly. Ravelry on mobile has never been easier.\n\nFIND INSPIRATIONAL PATTERNS\nIf you’re not sure what you’d like to make next, Ravit lets you easily browse patterns, favorite them, download and view pattern PDFs, view project photos and browse a designer’s other patterns and pattern suggestions. \n\nAnd if you want to narrow your search, choose from dozens of filters including craft, availability, category, attributes, needles, weight and more. You can even combine multiple options with AND, NOT or OR. It's powerful, but easy.\n\nThere's so many beautiful patterns on Ravelry, and Ravit helps you find them easily.\n\nTAKE RAVELRY TO YOUR YARN STORE\nFind out which yarns you’ll need for a project. Check what yardage you need. Look in your stash to see if you’ve already got a yarn, or one that’s similar. And because Ravit is designed to work nicely on your iPhone or iPad with readable text and buttons you can tap, you won't be squinting as you find all the info you need when you're at your LYS.\n\n+ Search all yarns by keyword, filter by fiber, weight, attributes and many others, and sort by options including 'Most projects' and 'Highest rating'. Quickly view pattern suggestions and projects for a yarn.\n\n+ Access your stash offline. No wireless or cell signal in your yarn store? No problem! Your stash is cached on your device so you can search, sort and view your stash offline.\n\nSNAP, EDIT AND UPLOAD ON THE SPOT\nPerhaps you're making a project on the train to work, or relaxed on the couch at home - whenever you are inspired to share your WIPs, Ravit makes it easy to snap photos, enhance with powerful photo filters, and upload to Ravelry, all from the one app.\n\n+ Powerful Photo Editing Tools - enhance, crop, and adjust your photos before your upload and show your work in it's best possible light. You can remove blemishes, improve color balance, sharpen images and access many other pro editing tools all from within the app.\n\n+ Optimized for Ravelry - before images are uploaded, they're resized optimally for Ravelry, so you'll upload smaller photos (up to 10x smaller!) more quickly and using less data.\n\n+ More than just photos - you can update notes for your Projects, Queued Projects and Stash, as well as most of the other info such as yarns, yardage, skeins, colorways, and color for your stash, and progress, link to stash, rating, craft, and tags amongst others for your projects.\n\nIT'S ALL THE LITTLE THINGS...\nSo why use Ravit? It's all the the little, sometimes hidden touches which make Ravit shine. Here's a few of them.\n\n+ It's quick - if you tap on something, you go right there. \n\n+ Infinite scroll - smooth, continuous scrolling as you browse to find inspiration.\n\n+ Offline - whether you're commuting underground, or you're off-grid, Ravit lets you access your Projects and Stash offline.\n\n+ Clean, uncluttered interface - we want your work and the beauty of Ravelry.com to shine. \n\n+ Use up to 50%* less data in Ravit compared with your web browser. \n\n+ Squint less - The text in Ravit isn't made super small, and we're fully Dynamic Type compatible, so if you change the font size on your device, it'll change in Ravit.\n\n* Based on tests of browsing patterns, projects, stash and yarns on Ravit and Safari on the same device - YYMV! (Your Yardage May Vary)\n\nTHIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING\nRavit has many features already, but we are constantly enhancing and adding more features. We have an active group on Ravelry and we'd love to hear what you'd like to see next - join in the discussion at http://www.ravelry.com/groups/ravit\n\nRavit is not affiliated with ravelry.com. It is an independent app, developed by a husband and wife team. You can read more about why we made Ravit at http://www.enhancient.com/ravit\n\nDownload Ravit now and hop on to Ravelry."

      "label": "Apple Watch, Nest Thermostat, and Siri. Together at last.\n\n＊ The app has Siri Voice shortcuts for seamless Siri control of your Nest, from the iPhone, Watch, iPad, and HomePod. It fully supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\n＊ The app lets you monitor and control HomeKit thermostats like Ecobee, and functions largely the same with them as it does with Nest, except for the Siri Shortcuts functionality which is not needed with HomeKit. It lets you see your thermostat info on the Watch complications, and control it using the iOS widget.\n_____________\n\n• Using Siri voice shortcuts you can control many aspects of your Nest, such as instant activation of heating or cooling, setting the temperature by saying how many degrees you want to set, increasing/decreasing the temperature, and setting the Home/Away state. Thanks to Thermo Watch, It's all finally just one casual \"Hey Siri\" away, all with informative visual and verbal feedback.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Thermo Watch complication to open the app. Spin the Digital Crown, or Swipe up/down to adjust the temperature. You can start adjusting the moment the app opens.\n• On your iOS device you can see the thermostat info on the home screen widget, you can swipe to the widget panel to adjust the temperature on the interactive widget, or you can just open the app. Again, you can start adjusting the moment the controls appear.\n• From your Apple TV, open the app, and swipe up/down on the remote to change the temperate.\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nThe app will let you know with a chime and a tap, that the thermostat has received and applied your command.\n\nMonitor your Thermostats and Home/Away status right from the watch face, using complications that update in the background, without having to launch the app.\n\nYou can use Siri on your iPhone, Watch, iPad, or HomePod to control any of your thermostats. Record phrases that make most sense to you, such as \"Start Heating\" or \"Make it Cooler\". If you have multiple thermostats you can control them individually, by saying for example \"Start Heating Upstairs\" or \"Start Cooling the Living Room\".\n\nVisit https://thermowatch.net/siri website for the detailed instructions of Siri operation.\n\nSet Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nThe app supports multiple thermostats in multiple homes - just swipe left and right on your Watch screen to access them, or see them all at the same time in the iOS Widget and the app. Fahrenheit and Celsius are both supported.\n\nBeyond that, you can press the Watch screen firmly for additional functions, like switching to a heating or cooling mode, setting the away status, choosing the active temperature sensor, or turning the fan on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nThermo Watch does not collect any of your data. Your login information, thermostat settings, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Thermo Watch does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

By starting the slot machine, the first partner sets all three reels in motion. After the reels come to a halt, he/she can already look forward to the sweet prize - a random erotic experience being the combination of the activity, at which bodypart to be performed, and for how long. The partners take turns and so after the activity is over the other partner pushes the SPIN button and awaits his/her erotic price.\n \nBut be careful, because it is not always clear who is going to please whom. Each turn is a thrilling experience right to the last moment thanks to the negative time values on the time limit reel. When the negative time limit appears, the partner who spun the reels will treat his/her partner.\n \nIn this game, you can either use the provided slot machines or create your own. You can change the slot machines during the game to accommodate your taste for the softer or more daring tasks.   \n \nFor the quick start, there are five predefined erotic slot machines available, carefully created to avoid unreal combinations. You can adjust each slot machine to suit your preferences, and also to create your own.  There are many possibilities to think of and it’s up to you and your imagination which stimulating combinations you will create.\n \nThis erotic game is suitable for all couples regardless of their sexual orientation. Thus, each couple can spice-up their love life.  \n \nPleasure Machine is a game with erotic content and is for adults only. PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL IF YOU’RE UNDER 18.\n\nGame is also translated in Slovak, Czech and Polish language. You can set those languages directly in the game global settings."

      "label": "NEWS:\nFamily Tracker was used to locate a missing child - see news report on: http://www.reuters.com/article/net-us-app-missing-idUSBRE8460GZ20120507\n\n***SUPPORT NOTICE**** \nWe do help everyone who contacts us via our iphone@logsat.com email address, but unfortunately most users give bad ratings without ever contacting us for support. Please do contact us if you have any issues, we're always there to help! \n*************** \n\nFamily Tracker allows you to track your wife, husband, children and fiancée. You can now find out where they are, at anytime, as long as they have their phones with them. Family Tracker is available for other platforms as well, so you can track (and be tracked by) other devices as well - check our website for more details. \n\nPlease note that starting with the new iOS4 and supported hardware, Family Tracker runs in the background at all times, and, unlike previous versions of Family Tracker, user intervention is **NOT** needed for you to track them. Family Tracker runs at all times, continuously updating the GPS location of the device. Even if the iPhone is rebooted, Family Tracker will automatically resume tracking and updating its position! \n\nSo how does this work? \n\nSimple. Install Family Tracker on the iPhone/iPad you want to track. From then on, you can use either a web browser or via the Family Tracker app itself installed on your own iPhone/iPad to locate your family member. \n\nIf the device you wish to track does not support multitasking (for example, older iPhones 3G, iPads), you can still use Family Tracker to locate the family member. Using the web or your own iPhone, you will be able to \"ping\" the other iPhone. This is done by sending the other iPhone a (free) “Apple Push Notification” which will cause an alert to sound on your family member’s iPhone, even if the phone in is stand-by, just as would happen if the iPhone receives an SMS. As soon as this alert is acknowledged, their GPS position will be recorded, and their location will be updated on a map. If you are using an iPhone yourself to track them, you will be sent a Push Notification to inform you that the family member has accepted your \"ping\". These notifications will be automatically re-sent every 60 seconds until they are acknowledged. If the recipient is trying to ignore them or does not hear them, this repetition will help acknowledging them. \n\nFamily Tracker does not need to know your iPhone cell number to function, as it does not send SMS messages for notifications. Your email address is instead used to send free Apple Push Notifications to the iPhones being tracked. These notifications are free, specific to our Family Tracker application, and work anywhere in the world as long as the iPhone and/or iTouch being tracked has internet access via the cellular network or WiFi. \n\nNotice: ***Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.*** For this reason, we strongly recommend users to configure Family Tracker to use the \"Driving Only\" accuracy in the GPS setting. This special mode updates the GPS location only when a significant location change occurs, which results in a tremendous gain in battery life.\n\nAdditional pro features, such as the ability to see the past locations for the previous 2 weeks, and the ability to set geofences so you are alerted when users that you track enter or leave certain areas are available via an optional iTunes subscription.\nSubscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions are available for either $1.99/month, or $5.99/3 months, or $9.99/6 months or $19.99/year. Privacy policy & terms of use: http://logsat.com/family-tracker-privacy.asp"

      "label": "*************************\nSalatuk is your Muslim Prayers Companion.\n\nBy locating you automatically, this application gives you the appropriate prayer times as well as the direction of the Qibla. \n\nThe Salatuk algorithm supports many calculation methods adopted by most Muslim countries. Depending on your location, the application choose the appropriate calculation method and Fiqhi school. \n\nFor an accurate location, please ensure that your location settings and your Internet connection or your GPS are enabled!\n\nNote about App features :\n-------------------------------\nIf you are familiar with Salatuk in other platforms please note that this version DOESN'T SUPPORT some features like \"Turn Phone to Silent after Athan\". Other features like \"Full Athan\" and \"Custom Athan\" are supported only when the app is ope. This is because of technical limitations. We will try to fix it once iOS system allows it.\n\nNote about Athan :\n-----------------\nSalatuk remind you that it's time for prayer with a \"4 takbeerats\" instead of full Athan. Because of technical limitations, it's possible to play full Athan only if the app is open. \n\nAlso, if you have problems to hear the notifications, please make sure to enable the following parameters in your device :\n\n1) Settings>Sounds>Alerts \n2) Settings>Notifications>Salatuk \n3) Your phone is not on mute and volume is correct\n\nNote about Prayers times :\n-----------------------------------\nPlease note that we pay attention to ensure that the prayer times of Salatuk are accurate. However, in some countries those times may be not exact. In this case, please refer to the official islamic institutions or mosques in your country and adjust manually the prayer times in the application settings.\n\nSalatuk supports currently 3 languages : Arabic, English and French.\n\nTips for a better usage\n-----------------------------\n\n1- In order to refresh the prayer alarms, make sure to open the application once a week. Please do so also when you change your location or timing (summer time).\n\n2- The prayer alarms corresponds to 2 or 4 Takbeerats. If you want to hear the complete Athan you should open the app at the moment of the Athan.\n\n**********************************************************************************\n\nتطبيق صلاتك رفيقك للحفاظ على صلاتك.\nعن طريق تحديد موقعك  تلقائيا، بإمكان هذا التطبيق أن يعلمك بأوقات الصلاة وكذلك تحديد اتجاه القبلة. تطبيق صلاتك يستعمل عددا مهما من الطرق الحسابية  المعتمدة في أغلب العالم الإسلامي. اعتمادا على موقعك، يختار التطبيق طريقة الحساب والمدرسة الفقهية المناسبة. \n\nحول خصائص التطبيق \n---------------------\nإذا كنت ممن يستعمل صلاتك على أنظمة أخرى، المرجو الانتباه إلى أن هذه النسخة لا تحتوي على بعض الخصائص مثل \"التحويل إلى الصامت\" كما أن بعض الخصائص الأخرى مثل \"الأذان الكامل\" و\"إضافة أذان من الذاكرة\" لا تشتغل إلا إذا كان التطبيق مفتوحا. يرجع ذلك إلى بعض القيود التقنية الموجودة حاليا في نظام أبل وسنحاول دعمها حالما ترفع هذه القيود.\n\n\nحول سماع الأذان \n---------------\nمن ناحية  أخرى إذا كان عندك مشكل في سماع التنبيهات، المرجو التاكد من أن الإعدادات التالية مفعلة في هاتفك : \n1) الإعدادات > الأصوات > تنبيهات التذكير\n2) الإعدادات >التنبيهات > صلاتك   \n3) هاتفك ليس في الوضع الصامت والصوت في مستوى جيد\n\nحول مواقيت الصلاة:\n-----------------\nننوه إلى أنه رغم المجهودات لتدقيق مواقيت الصلاة التي يقوم بها فريق صلاتك، إلا أنه في بعض البلدان قد تكون المواقيت غير مضبوطة بشكل تام، في هذه الحالة نرجو منكم الاعتماد على المواقيت الرسمية في بلدكم أو المسجد القريب منكم، مع العلم أنه يمكنكم تعديل الأوقات يدويا في نافذة الإعدادات.\n\nنصائح من أجل استعمال أفضل \n-------------------------\n\n1- حتى يتم تحديث إشعارات الأذان إحرص على فتح التطبيق مرة كل أسبوع على الأقل أو عندما تغير مكانك أو يتغير التوقيت في بلدك (التوقيت الصيفي)\n\n2- تطبيق صلاتك يشعرك بدخول وقت الصلاة على شكل تكبيرتين أو 4 تكبيرات. إذا أردت أن تستمع إلى الأذان كاملا المرجو أن تفتح التطبيق أثناء الأذان."

Joy and inner peace are always there within us.\r\n \r\nA Course in Miracles is a non-dualistic study program, often quoted by famous teachers such as Marianne Williamson and Eckhart Tolle. The Course is designed to bring a consistent state of happiness and peace to the student through the application of its principles. Each lesson opens new realms of understanding and new pearls of wisdom as one listens and continues the daily Course Work. \r\n \r\nThe teaching can be summed up in this Course passage:\r\n\r\nNothing real can be threatened.\r\nNothing unreal exists.\r\nHerein lies the peace of God.\r\n \r\nIn the 365 daily lessons in the Course, one learns how to clear the egoic debris from the mind and trust in Spirit. One learns to let go of judgment which would distract from the beauty of Truth that reveals itself in each person and in each moment. This is when the miraculous reveals itself. It is a subtle, gentle and profound process, rooted in Christian mysticism but containing elements of psychology and other non-dualistic teachings such as Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism.\r\n \r\nThe goal is not to deny any reality in the world, but to understand the mistaken perception so it may be dissolved.\r\n \r\nThis app has many intuitive features that allow one to study and practice this profound wisdom with ease. Simply navigate to your day's lesson to listen while walking, resting... wherever and whenever is best for you. The entire coursework is also onscreen if you wish to read along with the narration. The app facilitates audio or written annotations and even the opportunity to connect to ACIM communities. \r\n \r\nFeatures:\r\n \r\n* High-quality recordings \r\n* 365 beautifully narrated lessons (plus Introductions and Epilogue)\r\n* Professional, user-friendly design \r\n* Practice reminders can be set throughout the day at any intervals \r\n* Affirmations or notes can be recorded easily within each lesson\r\n* Daily lesson view allows you to jump to your current daily lesson instantly\r\n* Search for a lesson by keyword or phrase\r\n* Backwards and Forwards functions facilitate finding the exact spot you wish to hear in the lesson for review or further contemplation\r\n* Easy scroll view to quickly find any lesson or introduction in the Workbook\r\n* Free access to Facebook study group for support and community\r\n* No wi-fi or cellular connection needed to play audio lessons so you can take it with you anywhere you roam... just like a book!"

But with these Abraham-Hicks words fresh in your mind, your every life experience will now be more meaningful to you. And since nothing is more imporant than feeling good, nothing is more valuable than these processes that will allow more of your natural Well-being to flow.\nHave fun with these cards. Let these words inspire thoughts that will attract to you more of that which evokes your greatest joy.\"\n\nFEATURES:\n- Browse The Teachings of Abraham Well-Being Cards anywhere, anytime on your iOS device*\n- Save cards to review at any time*\n- Email cards to yourself or share with a friend*\n\nAbout the Author:\nExcited about the clarity and practicality of the translated word from the Beings who call themselves Abraham, Esther and Jerry Hicks began disclosing their amazing Abraham experience to a handful of close business associates in 1986.\nRecognizing the practical results being received by themselves and by those people who were asking practical questions and then applying Abraham’s answers to their own situations, Esther and Jerry made a deliberate decision to allow the teachings of Abraham to become available to an ever-widening circle of seekers of how to live a happier life.\n\nUsing their San Antonio, Texas, conference center as their base, Jerry and Esther have traveled to approximately 50 cities a year since 1989, presenting interactive Law of Attraction workshops to those leaders who gather to participate in this expanding stream of progressive thought. And although worldwide attention has been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading Edge thinkers and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham’s Law of Attraction concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures, and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person to person—as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences.\n\nIn November 2011, Jerry made his transition into Non-Physical, and now Esther continues to conduct the Abraham workshops with the help of her physical friends and co-workers and, of course, with the Non-Physical help of Abraham and Jerry.\nPeople are able to access Abraham directly by attending the seminars in person or by participating in the online live streaming of most events. There is also an extensive YouTube library of Abraham videos.\nAbraham—a group of uplifting Non-Physical teachers—present their Broader Perspective through Esther Hicks. And as they speak to our level of comprehension through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant, yet comprehensively simple essays in print and in sound, they guide us to a clear connection with our loving Inner Being, and to uplifting self-empowerment from our Total Self.\n\nOfficial Hay House licensed App: www.HayHouse.com®"

      "label": "Can’t get enough of Bedroom Battle? Then you’ll love this expansion that contains a total of 100 new sexy challenges and 50 game-related actions.\n\nThe basic concept of this expansion is very simple: Each time you win a SMALL or HOT reward card in Bedroom Battle you also get to spin a wheel of fortune in the app, and hopefully win an extra reward in addition to the reward you select on the reward card.\n\nWhen you spin the wheel there are three possible outcomes: \n\nPINK - You get to select ONE of two random rewards. It can either be something related to the game or something a bit more naughty.\n\nYELLOW - You get to select ONE of two seriously sexy rewards. How sexy they are depends on if you've won a small or hot reward card in the game.\n\nWHITE - This is the one you don't want to win, as it means you have to choose ONE of two random PENALTIES instead of rewards.\n\nJust like in the base game all challenges in the app are designed to work for everyone – regardless of gender or sexual preference.\n\nPlease note that this app is an expansion for owners of the physical card game Bedroom Battle and NOT a stand-alone game. \n\nYou can learn more about Bedroom Battle and watch a video describing how to play here: www.tingletouch.com/bedroombattle"

We created \"Thankful\" with our brother before his 7-year cancer battle ended. During his battle, he and his family wanted everyone to remember to be thankful for what is still good in the world, and to count all of the blessings we all have.\n\n“Everybody has trials. Everybody has tragedies,” his wife says. “That’s why we come to this earth, and we came to a place where we realized we weren’t being picked on, that this was just the deal. …And so we found something that worked for us, and that was to count our blessings and to notice what was good. …It helped us be able to enjoy each other instead of being weighed down by all the fear, it helped lift us up.”\n\nWe hope that \"Thankful\" reminds you to be #thankful, and also helps you to remember all of the many blessings in your life - no matter how seemingly small.\n\n\nTHANK YOU\n\n+ We are always #thankful for our brother and our family, and we are absolutely #thankful for you!\n\n+ If you encounter any issues or require assistance, or if you would like to help us improve Thankful, please contact support at support@eddystreetproductions.com, at http://www.eddystreetproductions.com/thankful, or @TheThankfulApp @EddyStreetPro"

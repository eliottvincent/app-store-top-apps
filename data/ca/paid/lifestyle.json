Our algorithm analyses your voice and compares it with data from over 150 celebrities to let you understand your voice and learn how to improve it.\n\nThe Standard version of the app gives you a full analysis of your voice in terms of depth and variety and calculates a set of celebrity matches to give you a grounding of what your results mean.\n\nThe Pro version helps you improve your voice. Currently this includes an on-the-fly pitch tracker - so you can practise different ways of speaking and immediately see their effect - as well as unlimited archive space, celebrity comparison graphs, and a charting tool so you can track your progress over time.\n\nWe’re working to expand Vocular to other areas too. We want to cover things like smoothness, nasality, vocal fry, even creating a rating of how attractive your voice currently is, based on the latest research. If you want to get the most out of your vocal chords, this is the app for you."

But with these Abraham-Hicks words fresh in your mind, your every life experience will now be more meaningful to you. And since nothing is more imporant than feeling good, nothing is more valuable than these processes that will allow more of your natural Well-being to flow.\nHave fun with these cards. Let these words inspire thoughts that will attract to you more of that which evokes your greatest joy.\"\n\nFEATURES:\n- Browse The Teachings of Abraham Well-Being Cards anywhere, anytime on your iOS device*\n- Save cards to review at any time*\n- Email cards to yourself or share with a friend*\n\nAbout the Author:\nExcited about the clarity and practicality of the translated word from the Beings who call themselves Abraham, Esther and Jerry Hicks began disclosing their amazing Abraham experience to a handful of close business associates in 1986.\nRecognizing the practical results being received by themselves and by those people who were asking practical questions and then applying Abraham’s answers to their own situations, Esther and Jerry made a deliberate decision to allow the teachings of Abraham to become available to an ever-widening circle of seekers of how to live a happier life.\n\nUsing their San Antonio, Texas, conference center as their base, Jerry and Esther have traveled to approximately 50 cities a year since 1989, presenting interactive Law of Attraction workshops to those leaders who gather to participate in this expanding stream of progressive thought. And although worldwide attention has been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading Edge thinkers and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham’s Law of Attraction concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures, and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person to person—as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences.\n\nIn November 2011, Jerry made his transition into Non-Physical, and now Esther continues to conduct the Abraham workshops with the help of her physical friends and co-workers and, of course, with the Non-Physical help of Abraham and Jerry.\nPeople are able to access Abraham directly by attending the seminars in person or by participating in the online live streaming of most events. There is also an extensive YouTube library of Abraham videos.\nAbraham—a group of uplifting Non-Physical teachers—present their Broader Perspective through Esther Hicks. And as they speak to our level of comprehension through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant, yet comprehensively simple essays in print and in sound, they guide us to a clear connection with our loving Inner Being, and to uplifting self-empowerment from our Total Self.\n\nOfficial Hay House licensed App: www.HayHouse.com®"

      "label": "Apple Watch, Nest Thermostat, and Siri. Together at last.\n\n＊ The app has Siri Voice shortcuts for seamless Siri control of your Nest, from the iPhone, Watch, iPad, and HomePod. It fully supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\n＊ The app lets you monitor and control HomeKit thermostats like Ecobee, and functions largely the same with them as it does with Nest, except for the Siri Shortcuts functionality which is not needed with HomeKit. It lets you see your thermostat info on the Watch complications, and control it using the iOS widget.\n_____________\n\n• Using Siri voice shortcuts you can control many aspects of your Nest, such as instant activation of heating or cooling, setting the temperature by saying how many degrees you want to set, increasing/decreasing the temperature, and setting the Home/Away state. Thanks to Thermo Watch, It's all finally just one casual \"Hey Siri\" away, all with informative visual and verbal feedback.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Thermo Watch complication to open the app. Spin the Digital Crown, or Swipe up/down to adjust the temperature. You can start adjusting the moment the app opens.\n• On your iOS device you can see the thermostat info on the home screen widget, you can swipe to the widget panel to adjust the temperature on the interactive widget, or you can just open the app. Again, you can start adjusting the moment the controls appear.\n• From your Apple TV, open the app, and swipe up/down on the remote to change the temperate.\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nThe app will let you know with a chime and a tap, that the thermostat has received and applied your command.\n\nMonitor your Thermostats and Home/Away status right from the watch face, using complications that update in the background, without having to launch the app.\n\nYou can use Siri on your iPhone, Watch, iPad, or HomePod to control any of your thermostats. Record phrases that make most sense to you, such as \"Start Heating\" or \"Make it Cooler\". If you have multiple thermostats you can control them individually, by saying for example \"Start Heating Upstairs\" or \"Start Cooling the Living Room\".\n\nVisit https://thermowatch.net/siri website for the detailed instructions of Siri operation.\n\nSet Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nThe app supports multiple thermostats in multiple homes - just swipe left and right on your Watch screen to access them, or see them all at the same time in the iOS Widget and the app. Fahrenheit and Celsius are both supported.\n\nBeyond that, you can press the Watch screen firmly for additional functions, like switching to a heating or cooling mode, setting the away status, choosing the active temperature sensor, or turning the fan on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nThermo Watch does not collect any of your data. Your login information, thermostat settings, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Thermo Watch does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

      "label": "You've found Drum Journey, the first app for shamanic journeying. \n\nShamanic journeying, as you probably already know, is a kind of insight meditation.  It’s a spiritual practice that combines visualization with acoustic accompaniment, usually fast drumming or rattling. \n\nDrum Journey works like a timer; dial in the journey duration, set your options, and tap Start.  Included in the app are several professionally-produced drum and rattle tracks, and you can also import your own from iTunes.\n\nFeatures:\n- flexible journey duration, from 5 minutes to an hour\n- choice of drumming styles (single, double, or with rattle)\n- adjustable tempo (slow, normal, and fast)\n- adjustable instrument volumes\n- high quality drumming tracks\n- works with AirPlay\n- Optimized graphics for iPhone Retina screens\n- light up the globe; share your location with other Drum Journey users\n\nFor centuries, shamans have used journeying to gain insight and clarity.  I was inspired to create this app while participating in the three year program of the Foundation for Shamanic Studies.\n\nNote: This app does not teach shamanic journey practices. Visit the Mindful Bear website for links to shamanic educators, books, and practitioners."

Each rune is masterfully written and clearly communicated with powerful descriptions that allow the essence of the runes to be learned with ease. Working with this specific app is my morning ritual and a favorite way to start the day. I often use it for a quick guide to the day or when I'm searching for a specific answer to a question. The potential for the different layouts and the ability to read the meanings separately makes this app a must have for those into these sacred oracle stones.\"\n\nCeline Germain\nwww.forthebodyandspirit.com\n\n\"Runic Oracle is by far my favourite rune app!  Even though I have actual runes, I find myself turning to the app instead. I love the options for different spreads, and the descriptions for each rune are fantastic! Runic Oracle is eerily accurate.\"\n\nStacey Jenkins\nwww.everyonedreams.ca\n\nAt major turning points in our lives, we often benefit from advice to encourage us, warn of possible pitfalls, and show us the way of good fortune. Some people say that the world is so mysterious, that when something very important is happening for us, everything around us speaks about it, if only we could hear. We can even open any book at random and receive the advice we need from wherever our eye falls.\n\nBut isn't it better to use a vehicle especially designed for this purpose, one which has been used for divination for many centuries? Through divination, the will of the Divine, or perhaps something deeply hidden inside us, speaks the truth which we need to hear at the time.\n\nThis program has been carefully devised to make it conform with traditional Runic Divination. The Runic Oracle has been used successfully for many years, and has consistently worked well. The important point to remember when using it is that, somehow, it is deeply connected with our inner selves. If you approach the Oracle seriously and sincerely, its advice will be revealing. If you treat it like a joke, you'll get a joke response."

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

From Polynesian (Tahitian, Samoan, Tongan, etc.) tatau. In Marquesan, tatu.\" Before the importation of the Polynesian word, the practice of tattooing had been described in the West as pricking, painting, or staining. Sailors on the voyage later introduced both the word and reintroduced the concept of tattooing to Europe.\n\nThis is not to be confused with the origins of the word for the military drumbeat — see military tattoo. In this case, the English word tattoo is derived from the Dutch word taptoe (OED).\n\nThe first written reference to the word tattoo (or tatau), appears in the journal of Joseph Banks (24 February 1743 – 19 June 1820), the naturalist aboard Captain Cook's ship the HMS Endeavour: \"I shall now mention the way they mark themselves indelibly, each of them is so marked by their humor or disposition\".\n\nThe word \"tattoo\" was brought to Europe by the explorer James Cook, when he returned in 1771 from his first voyage to Tahiti and New Zealand. In his narrative of the voyage, he refers to an operation called \"tattaw\". Before this it had been described as scarring, painting, or staining\n\nTattoo enthusiasts may refer to tattoos as \"ink\", \"pieces\", \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"tats\", or \"work\"; to the creators as \"tattoo artists\", \"tattooers\", or \"tattooists\"; and to places where they work as \"tattoo shops\", \"tattoo studios\", or \"tattoo parlors\".\n\n\nA tattooed man's back, Japan, c. 1875\nUsage of the terms \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"pieces\", and work\" is gaining greater support,[citation needed] with mainstream art galleries holding exhibitions of both conventional and custom tattoo designs. Beyond Skin, at the Museum of Croydon, is an example of this as it challenges the stereotypical view of tattoos and who has them. Copyrighted tattoo designs that are mass-produced and sent to tattoo artists are known as \"flash\", a notable instance of industrial design. Flash sheets are prominently displayed in many tattoo parlors for the purpose of providing both inspiration and ready-made tattoo images to customers.\n\nThe Japanese word irezumi means \"insertion of ink\" and can mean tattoos using tebori, the traditional Japanese hand method, a Western-style machine, or for that matter, any method of tattooing using insertion of ink. The most common word used for traditional Japanese tattoo designs is Horimono. Japanese may use the word \"tattoo\" to mean non-Japanese styles of tattooing."

Also included are the Revised Common Lectionary readings for Holy days.\n\nThe app provides liturgies Morning, Midday, Evening, and Close of Day Prayer, selecting the appropriate service and lectionary readings based on the time and date settings of your iPhone or iPad. The calendar tool allows users to find psalms, readings, and prayers for other dates. Use the clock icon to select Morning, Midday, Evening, or Close of Day Prayer, overriding current time of day. \n\nThe “advanced features” menu allows users to toggle on/off various options and select between two versions of the Lord’s Prayer. \n\nA brief tutorial provides information about the practice of Daily Prayer and instruction on using the app.\n\nAlso available is a Company of Pastors (In-App Purchase) that adds daily readings, including readings from the Book of Confessions. These readings use a proprietary eight-week psalm cycle, with all 150 psalms represented. This psalm cycle replaces the regular daily lectionary psalms, but the advanced settings menu allows users to toggle between the two options. Readings from the Book of Confessions follow a two year cycle."

It can either be something related to the game or something a bit more naughty.\n\nYELLOW - You get to select ONE of two seriously sexy rewards. How sexy they are depends on if you've won a small or hot reward card in the game.\n\nWHITE - This is the one you don't want to win, as it means you have to choose ONE of two random PENALTIES instead of rewards.\n\nJust like in the base game all challenges in the app are designed to work for everyone – regardless of gender or sexual preference.\n\nPlease note that this app is an expansion for owners of the physical card game Bedroom Battle and NOT a stand-alone game. \n\nYou can learn more about Bedroom Battle and watch a video describing how to play here: www.tingletouch.com/bedroombattle"

PredictBGL for pets helps owners record this information and email it to their cat or dog’s vet.\n\nRecords symptoms\n- Select and record the symptoms your pet has experienced during the day. They are presented as 'feelings' that distinguishes between hypoglycemic (low blood sugar) and hyperglycemic (high blood sugar) symptoms\n- Receive a special warning for hypoglycemic symptoms\n\nAvoid fits from low blood sugars\nThe app integrates with Health so that the activity of the owner can estimated and the effect of insulin can be more accurately assessed. It's very difficult to estimate the activity level of a pet, and using the owner's phone is a solution to this issue. The integration with Apple Health can help avoid these.\n\nProduces the Blood Glucose Curve\nThe vet may ask the owner to perform a Blood Glucose Curve on a regular basis. PredictBGL for pets shows you the blood glucose curve, and you can easily see if the expected blood sugars are above or below it. The results can be sent to the vet for interpretation to adapt the insulin dose and type. Or, save money and time by doing this yourself!\n- Choose blood glucose unit: mg/dL (range 0-500), mmol/L (range 0-30)\n- Record data (times of the blood samples & blood glucose values). \n- Watch the predicted Blood Glucose Curve on the Dashboard in real time\n\nRecords actual food consumption \n- Estimate and record the amount of food leftovers of each meal \n- Watch the actual food intake curve on the Dashboard\n\nHelps contact the attending veterinarian\n- Call your vet or send him/her an email with the app\n- Upon request, send to your vet a report of all monitoring information\n\nWe're always working to make PredictBGL for Pets better! Have a problem, criticism, question, suggestion, or praise? It’s all super important to us, and we'd love to hear from you.\nReach out to us at:\n\n• predictbgl.com\n• support@managebgl.com?subject=Pets\n• twitter.com/predictbgl\n• facebook.com/predictbgl"

By starting the slot machine, the first partner sets all three reels in motion. After the reels come to a halt, he/she can already look forward to the sweet prize - a random erotic experience being the combination of the activity, at which bodypart to be performed, and for how long. The partners take turns and so after the activity is over the other partner pushes the SPIN button and awaits his/her erotic price.\n \nBut be careful, because it is not always clear who is going to please whom. Each turn is a thrilling experience right to the last moment thanks to the negative time values on the time limit reel. When the negative time limit appears, the partner who spun the reels will treat his/her partner.\n \nIn this game, you can either use the provided slot machines or create your own. You can change the slot machines during the game to accommodate your taste for the softer or more daring tasks.   \n \nFor the quick start, there are five predefined erotic slot machines available, carefully created to avoid unreal combinations. You can adjust each slot machine to suit your preferences, and also to create your own.  There are many possibilities to think of and it’s up to you and your imagination which stimulating combinations you will create.\n \nThis erotic game is suitable for all couples regardless of their sexual orientation. Thus, each couple can spice-up their love life.  \n \nPleasure Machine is a game with erotic content and is for adults only. PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL IF YOU’RE UNDER 18.\n\nGame is also translated in Slovak, Czech and Polish language. You can set those languages directly in the game global settings."

Add Shortcuts as icons on your home screen or widgets for quick access to your car's stats or to control it.\n- Fully functional Apple Watch app with vehicle stats complications\n- Opens, connects, and issues commands faster than other Tesla apps\n- Queued commands. You can close the app after issuing a few commands even if your car is asleep and it'll still do them.\n- View your battery stats such as the current/total usable kWh of your car compared to the stated capacity, how much phantom drain your car currently has, and a history of your car's range vs its odometer/time.\n- Display battery/power usage even when not charging\n- No phantom drain or background usage. This app doesn't use your car's batteries when the app isn't in use.\n- See the total miles/kWh added from the last charge session\n- Estimated range is displayed (this estimates your battery range based on your past 30 miles of usage)\n- Consolidated stats and commands into one screen for quicker access to information.

With six children between them they have first-hand experience of the power that self-hypnosis and positive affirmations have on pregnancy and birth. They believe that women deserve positive, empowered birth experiences and have created this app to equip them with the skills to achieve this. The effectiveness of hypnosis and relaxation on positive birth outcomes (shorter labour, lower rates of medical intervention, less medication use) is well documented in a number of research studies. \n\niHypnobirth teaches you that birth does not have to be full of fear, instead it will equip you with tools that can create a positive birthing experience, helping you to prepare both physically and emotionally.\n\nBy listening to the relaxation and positive affirmations regularly during pregnancy, this app will enable you to practice deep relaxation, effective breathing and positive visualisations to help you to have a calm, controlled, and empowered birth experience. If you learn to condition your body now it will be much easier to slip into a relaxed state during your labour and birth - and even after your baby is born these techniques will serve you well.\n\nBenefits of using hypnotherapy for birth \n\n-Positive approach birth\n-Calmer pregnancy\n-Creates feeling of empowerment \n-Reduce anxiety \n-Helps bonding with baby  \n-Reduces labour pains* \n-Shorter labour* \n-Less likely to have c-section* \n-Less likely to have pain relief* \n\n\n* Statistics from the American HypnoBirthing Institute 2008"

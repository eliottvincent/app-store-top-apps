The Monash University FODMAP diet works by swapping foods high in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs), with low FODMAP alternatives. Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

Each AE term is defined and accompanied by a grading scale that indicates the severity of the adverse event. All AE terms are organized by the System Organ Classes (SOCs) defined by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).\n\nAdverse events are common phenomena affecting patients being treated for cancer.

      "label": "The \"Voice Meter Pro\" app for the iPad, iPhone and iPod touch, is a simple, but effective app that helps children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD's), voice disorders, or any other child (or adult) monitor the volume of their own voice in a Fun and Engaging way.\n\nChildren with Asperger’s and other ASD’s often have difficulties producing the appropriate voice volume in different settings.  Some children on the autism spectrum speak too quietly.  Others speak too loudly.  Still others do not compensate adequately for the social milieu or ambient noise level. \n\nUnderstanding abstract concepts, such as the volume of one’s voice, can be difficult for children with ASD's.  It’s well understood that adding a visual component to the otherwise abstract concept can often be very helpful for individuals with ASD.\n\nOK so how does the app work?\n\nWell….if a child is talking to quietly a blue background with a cartoon character struggling to hear is displayed. If a child is talking too loudly the background changes to red and the character puts it’s fingers in its ears. If the volume level is acceptable a green background with a smiling happy character is displayed.\n\n• The on screen “volume thermometer” dynamically displays the volume level as it changes. \n\n• There’s a \"Sensitivity\" slider so the adult can adjust the volume sensitivity to suit both the user and the environment.\n\n• There’s also a \"Dampening\" slider. This helps avoid the meter bouncing around in between words by introducing a slight delay before any movement is shown on the “volume\" thermometer.\n\n• To give the user total control over the app the Upper and Lower limits of the \"Green\" (acceptable volume area) can now be adjusted by the user.\n\n• For convenience the app works in both portrait and landscape modes on all the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad.\n\n•  the iPhone version of the app has a switch to enable the iPhone to vibrate should the upper threshold level be exceeded for longer than 4 seconds.\n\nWe want to make this app the very best it can be and to this end we have included a feedback form inside the app for users to submit any issues or suggestions as to how it can be improved. \n\nWhy not download the app and give it a try?...... you might find it a very useful tool."

Covering over 80 muscles with more than 150 trigger points.\n\nMyofascial trigger points are one of the most common sources of pain, and are often overlooked by health professionals. \n\nThis app strives to help you find the source of pain via intuitive interface: tap the body where your pain is and see which trigger points refer pain to that area. Over 50 distinct pain areas are covered.\n\nYou can also find trigger points by by tapping a muscle on the muscle model, by choosing a muscle from the alphabetized list, or by using the search bar. If you don't know exactly what you're looking for, you can search using keywords such as \"elbow\", which will show the muscles of the elbow as well as any pain areas or conditions related to the elbow (e.g. \"lateral elbow pain\", \"tennis elbow\").\n\nTrigger points can cause or mimic a variety of conditions such as \"Tendinitis\" and \"Tennis Elbow\". More than 40 conditions are covered. Choose a condition and see a list of muscles whose trigger points can cause or mimic that condition.\n\nIn each trigger point illustration, an \"x\" marks the location of the point, while the area of referred pain is colored in blue.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: this app does not include treatment information; its aim is to help find the source of specific pain. Once you've identified a trigger point please consult a massage therapist or otherwise trained professional. There are also myriad self-treatment resources available both in book and video format should you choose to treat yourself.\n\n4520c652df"

Using this app is the equivalent to spending hours with the world’s most experienced doctors teaching you about your calcium, parathyroid, osteoporosis, and vitamin D issues. Your tests results are analyzed to determine if a problem exists, what risks are associated, and what to do about it. Beautiful graphs make understanding these problems simple!\n\nBlood tests and bone density scans can be difficult to interpret—even many doctors do not diagnose calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid problems correctly or timely. Hyperparathyroidism is a disease that affects 1 in 800 people and 1 in 250 women over 50 and is very often overlooked while patients suffer from chronic fatigue, memory loss, depression, osteoporosis, bone pain and many other symptoms. Calcium Pro is a powerful software program that will analyze your calcium health and provide you guidance about the status of your bones, kidneys, parathyroid glands, vitamin D, and other related health issues.\n\nYou start by entering your test results for calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D. Then we look at your bone density (osteoporosis levels). CalciumPro will analyze and graph your tests making them easy to understand. It will let you know the status of your parathyroid glands and your chance of having hyperparathyroidism. Suggested next steps are given. Tracking tools will show your calcium and vitamin D levels over time, and will show if your bones are losing density (worsening osteoporosis), or gaining bone density. There are important learning tools on every page, and an extensive video and reading library at the end. The app will provide guidance about talking to your physician regarding the possible need for surgery and other important steps.\n\nA Risk Assessment Tool shows your relative risk for conditions associated with high blood calcium: Osteoporosis, Heart Disease, Heart Arrhythmias and Palpitations, High Blood Pressure, Kidney Stones and Kidney Failure, GERD, several Cancers, and others. Watch your risk assessment graphs change as you address your calcium problems. \n\nThis app was developed by doctors at the Norman Parathyroid Center, the world’s leading parathyroid and calcium treatment center using over 4,000,000 data points from over 30,000 patients. Let the world’s leading doctors help you understand these problems so you and your doctor can make important, informed decisions. Take control of your own health!"

      "label": "* The world's number 1 DAF app is used by thousands of people in over one hundred countries. *\n\nDAF Professional has been created to help people who stammer or have a neurological disease such as Parkinson's Disease. It helps people to slow their rate of speech which makes it clearer to others.\n\nDAF Professional is an easy to use professional speech therapy tool which could make a huge difference to you or someone you know.\n\nDAF Professional has been designed and tested by a certified and practicing Speech and Language Therapist (MSc, PGDip, BAHons, HPC registered and member of RCSLT). DAF Professional delivers incredibly low latency feedback even when running in the background.\n\nDelayed Auditory Feedback (DAF) is a well established speech and language therapy tool which helps people to speak more slowly. However, until recently, devices have been cumbersome to carry around, difficult to adjust, very expensive and therefore not widely used.\n\nDAF was originally developed for people who stammer, but has since been shown to work with people with other speech difficulties, such as those with Parkinson's Disease (Downie et al., 1981; Dagenaise, Outhwood & Lee, 1998; Lowit et al., 2006 and most recentely Lowit et al., 2010).\n\nIt works by enabling someone to hear his or her own speech in an altered manner. This disruption to the normal auditory feedback loop causes the speaker to slow down. Research has shown that DAF will be of benefit to approximately a third of people who have a stammer or Parkinson's. Clinical research has not been carried out as yet on other client groups however DAF may well be of benefit to people with other medical speech conditions.\n\nWhen using Bluetooth devices there is an additional delay of 60ms added to the feedback system.\n\nIf you do use a Bluetooth headset you may find you need to turn the bluetooth device on after opening the app to enable it.\n\nDAF Professional works when put in the background or the screen is turned off. Like all apps of this type, it can NOT work during phone calls or with other media apps playing at the same time.\n\nIf you wish to provide any feedback we would be delighted to hear from you. Please email us at support@speechtools.co.\n\nOur lead Speech and Language Therapist is Samantha Brady who qualified as a Speech and Language Therapist in 2001 (PGDip, City University) and gained her Masters in Speech and Language Therapy in 2006 (MSc, City University). She has a wealth of experience of working as a Speech and Language Therapist in a variety of settings and her area of clinical expertise is adult neurology and voice. Samantha is a member of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT), HPC Registered (SL10250) and Lee Silverman Voice Treatment Certified (LSVT).\n\nDAF Professional is fully GDPR compliant and will not collect any of your data without first asking for your consent."

      "label": "Dr. Goniometer is a tool whereby physiatrists, orthopaedists and physiotherapists can measure the movement angles of their patient’s articulations and store all related data.\nIt is the only tool supported scientifically by comparative studies on real cases, as mentioned hereunder.\n\nThe tool enables the management of patient records, measurement of patient articulation angles and storage of all related information to build up historical data bases for each articulation and movement.\n\nMeasurement is by photographing the articulation and identifying the pictures taken with three separate markers. Picture taking is supported with perpendicular reference to ground level, iPhone alignment identification and patient central position referencing. These data come from Medical Literature suggestions for completing this type of reliable measurement (Cf. for instance, Dunlevy C. et al. \"Procedural considerations for photographic-based joint angle measurements\", Physiother. Res. Int. 2005; 10(4): 190-200).\n\nDr. Goniometer has been used in recent studies – the publication of which is currently under way – that have identified reliability and measurement errors comparable to those of professional measurement tools (such as the Universal Goniometer, Isokinetic Tools Goniometer and the like).\nThe study \"A new iPhone-based Goniometer (Dr. Goniometer): a Validation Study\", in particular, reports that various measurements on several patients were made simultaneously with professional tools and Dr. Goniometer. Measurements with the latter were repeated by different physiatrists and physiotherapists and results indicate comparable measurement errors for the Dr. Goniometer and other tools.\n\nIn addition to the above, further features are also available through in-app purchase to:\n- computer browse all Dr. Goniometer data (such as patient records, measurements, photos and the like) and print any patient articulation record;\n- backup all Dr. Goniometer data on the computer;\n- use a previously created back-up to restore all Dr. Goniometer data on any iPhone (as in the event of iPhone replacement or application re-installation, for instance).\n- export all measures in a Excel file through iTunes File Sharing, connecting your iphone and PC through the USB cable.\n\nAll the above features are available with no additional computer software required, just a common Internet browser; any operating system is supported, whether Microsoft, Apple, or others.\nThe iPhone and PC used must be on the same WiFi network for computer and Dr. Goniometer connection. Should no WiFi connection be available, if the iPhone is be connected to a mobile network and the PC to the Internet, the iPhone and computer connection will be based on the settings of the mobile network in use.\n\nDr. Goniometer ensures constant measurement tool availability and access to patient data bases. New measurements can always be made at each patient visit, with no need for constant patient record updating as completed measurements are stored automatically on the iPhone or PC used and are retrievable whenever needed."

Instead of relying on products that require you to press a button when you need help (think \"I've fallen and I can't get up\" commercial), isn't it better if someone is notified when you DON'T press a button? Introducing the EyeOn App.   \n\n* You can set your own schedule for the app to \"check-in\". You can set the days of the week, time of day…as many (or as few) as desired. For example, the app can ask if you are ok every hour, only in the mornings/evenings, or every other day.  \n\n* You will receive a push notification at the scheduled time(s). This notification will ask if you are ok.  If you would rather receive a Text Message (SMS) check-in, please visit www.eyeonapp.com for details and pricing (US only).\n\n* If you press \"OK\", then the alert is reset for the next scheduled time.\n\n* If you fail to respond, then the app notifies up to 3 contacts by email.  For Text Message (SMS) alerts to your contacts, please visit www.eyeonapp.com for more details and pricing (Worldwide numbers allowed).\n\n* The contacts get a message stating that you have not responded and your last known location (location in email only).  You can customize the email sent to your contacts to provide specific instructions.\n\n* Reminders can also be scheduled.  They are just that - a custom reminder.  No response is required and we don't notify your contacts if you don't respond to a Reminder.\n\n* Pause feature - you can pause the service for hours, days, or weeks if you don't want to be checked on during a movie, vacation, etc.  This also works to skip the next check-in or check-in early.\n\nWhen first installing, you will be prompted to complete the names, mobile phone numbers, and emails of the user and for each contact. Then simply set a schedule for check-in times.\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\nPush Notifications - on the initial setup you will be asked to allow EyeOn App to use Push Notifications. This is mandatory for the app to function, unless you opt for the Text Message (SMS) check-in (visit www.eyeonapp.com for more details).\n\nLocation - although this is not mandatory, we can provide your location inside the alert email to your care providers if you do not respond. It will be the location where you were the last time you opened the app (keeping constant location would reduce battery life). You will need to give EyeOn App permission to use your Location.\n\nTimezones/Time Changes - EyeOn App adjusts for timezones and time changes when the app is opened. If you travel to a different timezone or have a time change, please open the app once for it to automatically correct to the new time.\n\nCancelation of Service - if you do decide to discontinue use of the service, please simply delete any Notifications you scheduled. If you delete the app without deleting the Notifications, it could take up to 24 hours for your account to be disabled and your contacts may receive false alerts during that time."

Why not be able to choose based on how you are holding the phone and what else you are doing at the same time?\n    • Use the numeric entry pad (0 3 3 0 2 0 0 8) and immediately see the results, OR\n    • Spin the date wheel at the bottom of the screen and tap Next.\n\n 3) Thorough results: All the information you would expect from a classic wheel, plus more:\n   • Estimated Due Date\n   • LMP Date\n   • Conception Date\n   • 1st Trimester End Date\n   • 2nd Trimester End Date\n   • Gestational Age\n   • Conceptional Age\n   • Expected Fetal Length based on standard fetal growth curves\n   • Expected Fetal Weight based on standard fetal growth curves (\"How much does my baby weigh, doctor?\")\n\nResults are relative to 'today' by default; this can be quickly changed to reflect any date by tapping the 'today' button and selecting a new date.\n\n 4) Accurate results: Perfect OB Wheel provides exact dates and accounts for all calendar variance, including leap years. \n\n 5) Persistence: Perfect OB Wheel remembers the date and date type you last used and restores them when launched to streamline your workflow.\n\n 6) Perfect OB Tracker upgrade: Available as an in-app purchase update, the Perfect OB Tracker lets you track any number of pregnancies, with at-a-glance due date and gestational age and one-tap access to all the data Perfect OB Wheel provides.  A  picture and text notes can be kept on each patient. Postpartum tracking is also available. Passcode locking is available for HIPAA compliance."

It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

Having trouble explaining the exact course of the fever to the pediatrician? Keep track of body temperatures and medication for your whole family with Feevy.\n\n\nTEMPERATURE, MEDICATION AND NOTES\nWith Feevy you can not only record temperature measurements, but also track medications and enter text notes. This way, you can verify if medication was effective and capture additional information, e.g. regarding the patient’s condition. Be perfectly prepared for your next visit to the doctor!\n\nBEAUTIFUL CHARTS\nEntering data is worthless if you can’t analyze it later. Feevy comes with a beautiful and very detailed interactive chart, which makes it easy to get a quick overview, as well as to analyze temperature curves in more detail. You can freely zoom and pan it to see all the details you need.\n\nPRINT AND SHARE YOUR DATA\nOf course you can also print and export your data. This way you can bring your fever curve with you to the doctor or even send it via e-mail. The PDF contains all measurements, medications and notes, as well as a full-page chart showing the temperature curve.\n\nTRACK MULTIPLE PEOPLE\nFeevy lets you track the fever curves for multiple people. It is perfect for keeping track of your children's conditions and illnesses. To represent your family with some personality, Feevy comes with a set of cute profile icons to choose from.\n\nSYNC WITH FAMILY MEMBERS\nEspecially if you use Feevy to track your kids' illnesses, you will appreciate its sync functionality. No matter who measures the temperature or administers medication, both parents will always see the same data on their devices.\n\nUNIVERSAL APP\nFeevy supports both iPhone and iPad, including iPad multitasking (Slide Over and Split View). Use your iPhone while on the go or to quickly enter a new measurement, and use the iPad to have a detailed look at the charts.\n\n\nFeedback is always welcome: feedback@feevyapp.com or via Twitter @feevyapp.\n\n\nIMPORTANT\nIn case of fever and sickness, please always consult your doctor. Using this app to track body temperature and symptoms is not a substitute for a visit to the doctor!\n\nOF COURSE YOU CANNOT MEASURE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE WITH THIS APP! You can only record, visualize and archive the measurements obtained with a fever thermometer."

That’s not all, though. Just look at some of the other features you get!\n\n* Attractive, easy to navigate interface\n* Look up certain selected terms in Wikipedia, Google, or Google images\n * Pictures in each section help to illustrate physical exam maneuvers\n * Includes \"Clinical Correlates\" which highlight the significance of certain physical exam findings\n * \"Presentation Tips\" included to help you describe your findings \n* Includes descriptions of special tests that are not usually performed in a routine physical exam\n * Content and images added and updated regularly \n\nForget carrying those heavy textbooks everywhere you go. Sometimes, all you need is your iDevice and Physical Exam Essentials.\n\nDownload this amazingly helpful application now. You and your patients will be glad that you did."

      "label": "Biochemic Tissue Salts mobile app is an easy to use app which provides details on 12 tissue salts covering its Introduction, Common Name, Preparation, Ailments from, Constitution, Miasms, Key Symptoms, Mind Symptoms, Modalities, Clinical conditions, Therapeutics, Self Assessing Questions in details. It is a handy tool to learn Biochemic Cell Salts in details and apply them in your practice.\n\nThe Biochemic Tissue Salts also known as Biochemic Cell Salts or Schuessler Tissue Salts. This Biochemic system of medicine is a simple and rational science of therapeutics gifted to us by Dr. Schussler from Germany. The Biochemic system of medicine derives its name from the Greek word 'Bios' meaning 'Life' and 'Chemistry' meaning 'a branch of natural science dealing with the composition of substances and their properties and reactions'. Hence in the most literal sense, 'Biochemistry' means 'Chemistry of Life'. \n\nIt is a unique branch of therapeutics that is based on the Law of Deficiency. Professor Moleschott, of Rome says, \"The structure and vitality of the organs depend upon the presence of the necessary quantities of inorganic constituents.\" \n\nThe principle of this valuable science is based on the concept that deficiency of inorganic salts causes disharmony in the functioning of a cell, which when supplemented in requisite proportion, restores this disharmonious functioning. Thus the Biochemic system of medicines assist the body's natural efforts towards cure by supplementing these salts that are deficient in certain tissues.\n\nThe App has in-depth explanation of below twelve tissue salts :\n\n1. Calcarea Fluor (Fluoride of Lime or Calcium) CaF2\n\n2. Calcarea Phos (Phosphate of Lime or Calcium) Ca3 (PO4) 2\n\n3. Calcarea Sulph (Sulphate of Lime or Calcium) CaSO4 12H2O\n\n4. Ferrum Phos (Phosphate of Iron) FE (PO4) 2\n\n5. Kali Mur (Chloride of Potash) KCl\n\n6. Kali Phos (Phosphate of Potash) K2HPO4\n\n7. Kali Sulph (Sulphate of Potash) K2SO4\n\n8. Magnesia Phos (Phosphate of Magnesia) MgHPO4 7H2O\n\n9. Natrum Mur (Chloride of Soda or Sodium, common salt) Nacl\n\n10. Natrum Phos (Phosphate of Soda or Sodium) Na2HPO4 12H2O\n\n11. Natrum Sulph (Sulphate of Soda or Sodium) Na2SO4\n\n12. Silicea (Silica or Silicon dioxide) SiO2\n\nIn order to ease the study of the twelve Biochemic remedies every remedy is explained further in the remedy section and is listed in a certain format as follows :\n\nIntroduction\n\nSynonyms\n\nCommon Name\n\nChemical Properties\n\nPreparation\n\nPhysiochemical data\n\nCurative action\n\nAilments from\n\nConstitution\n\nDiathesis\n\nMiasms\n\nThermal Modality\n\nGeneral Indications\n\nKey Symptoms\n\nMind\n\nModalities\n\nParticular Indications\n\nClinical conditions\n\nComparison with other remedies (Biochemic and Homeopathic)\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nTherapeutics\n\nGlossary\n\nSynopsis\n\nSelf Assessing Questions"

By using the DAF we will improve our fluency immediately.\n\nThis is because by listening to our voice we will set the right breathing and the right time, overcoming those obstacles that we would normally have encountered.\n\nTo use the DAF you need to have headphones and set the delay between 50 ms and 75 ms.\n\nFor those who use bluetooth headphones, there is already a delay, because the bluetooth signal takes longer to arrive than headphones with cable. Setting the delay to 0 ms will still have the delay between 50 ms and 75 ms.\n\nThe DAF is very suitable for those who want to practice speak exercises, to reduce stuttering by up to 80% instantly, or those who simply want to prepare for a speech.\n\nTo use the DAF it is necessary to be equipped with wired or bluetooth headphones with microphone."

In just ONE app there is 1) a gestational age calculator, 2) an ultrasound biometric calculator, 3) a fetal weight calculator, 4) a list of key weeks and trimesters, 5) an age-adjusted risk table for trisomy 21 and aneuploidy, 6) a BMI calculator, and NOW 7) an Apple Watch app is included with your purchase!\n\nThe OB Wheel Pro 7 is a state-of-the-art gestational age calculator (also known as an obstetric or pregnancy wheel) that is used every day by doctors, obstetricians, midwives, nurses, and pregnant women. The OB Wheel Pro 7 is a professional tool that replaces the need for multiple apps and it greatly enhances the functionality of those worn-out cardboard wheels without compromise. \n\nThe OB Wheel Pro 7 accurately determines the estimated delivery date (EDD), or due date, of a pregnancy based on the first day of a woman's last menstrual period (LMP), or from the date of conception, or from a known gestational age (GA) on a known date, e.g. from an ultrasound measurement, or from fetal biometry like Crown-Rump Length (CRL), Femur Length (FL), and BiParietal Diameter (BPD). Additionally, for appropriate gestational ages, The The OB Wheel Pro 7 estimates fetal weight and displays the number of days completed and remaining. \n\nThe OB Wheel Pro 7, besides calculating GA from fetal ultrasound biometrics, enables clinicians to also calculate Estimated Fetal Weight (EFW) from FL, BPD, Head Circumference (HC), and Abdominal Circumference (AC) using the most appropriate published reference formula using the maximum and most appropriate parameters.\n\nPrenatal care providers know that there are key gestational ages where testing or interventions are needed. The OB Wheel Pro 7 lets providers see at a glance when these items should be scheduled.\n\nFEATURES\n• Includes Apple Watch app! \n• Gestational Age Calculator from LMP, EDD, Conception Date for any reference date\n• Gestational Age calculated from specific date and gestational age (e.g. ultrasound)\n• Gestational Age Calculator using fetal biometrics (CRL, FL, BPD)\n• Fetal Weight Calculator using HC, AC, FL, BPD\n• Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator\n• Age-Adjusted Risk Table for Trisomy 21 and aneuploidy\n• List of key completed weeks during pregnancy\n• Pregnancy days completed and remaining, and dates for each trimester\n• Remembers last-used EDD\n\n\nPRO TIPS: \n• To enter Gestational Age, CRL, FL, or BPD for a specific date (like for an ultrasound exam), tap \"Today\", enter the desired date, then tap on the button displaying the gestational age to change that button to display options for entering a specific GA, CRL, FL, and BPD. \n• When using the GA calculator, double-tap a date to change the value to the current date.\n• When using the EFW calculator, double-tap a value to clear the value of the selected parameter."

      "label": "Taking the deaf world by storm and featured in the news, Deafwake was created by a deaf person and is designed to ensure everyone can get up when they’re supposed to. Removing the risk of sleeping in and being late for meetings, it allows deaf individuals or heavy sleepers to be on time, every time. \n\nDeaf Wake, an LED / Vibration / Visual based alarm app for people who are deaf, hearing Impaired or just want a really cool alarm clock.\n\nThis deaf app will be your best friend as well as your worse enemy (if you don't like being woken up) It is designed to utilise all the senses of your iPhone. It has a flashing screen, it vibrates, it uses the camera flash and is loud.\n\nThe app has hit all four corners of the globe, including the UK, USA, Australia, Germany, Ireland, Denmark, Canada, Norway, Switzerland, and Mexico. And with more than 1,000 downloads on the App Store, and over 500,000 Facebook users reached, the app has proven to be a huge hit with those who struggle daily with the realities of being deaf or hard of hearing. \n\nSee video of app in action - https://www.facebook.com/deafwake/#\n\n*********************\n\nThe App has an easy interface where you can select the camera flash, have a flashing screen, have it vibrate or use sound. You may select one or two or even use all the senses of your iPhone.\n\nNot all senses may be appropriate for every scenario for an example during a work meeting you may not want the phone to rudely interrupt you by sound or vibration. A discreet flashing screen telling you that your child needs to be picked up from nursery may be more appropriate.\n\n*********************\n\nBe Alert /////\nNever be late again. Never burn the Sunday roast. Never miss meetings. All because you didn't hear the phone (or didn't feel it vibrating)\n\nChoose Your Senses /////\nChoose the flashing screen. Just have the phone vibrate. Set the camera flash. Be alerted by sound. Or have all four turned on.\n\nDescriptive Alarms /////\nUniquely give each alarm setting a description. A description could be 'Make your partner a cup of tea to get out of the doghouse'\n\nMade By A Deaf Person /////\nAn app designed by a hearing impaired person with deaf people in mind (or just plain heavy sleepers)\n\nApple Watch /////\nThe App is also designed to work with the Apple Watch. You can use the Apple Watch to also set your alarms as well as other features.\n\nChoose Clock Interfaces /////\nChoose from a selection of two clock faces. Simply swipe left or right. You may prefer an easier analogue clock.\n\n*********************\n\nNo longer do you have to put the phone under your pillow or in your pocket in order to (hopefully) be woken up. At night put the iPhone at the side of the bed and let it flash to wake you up (using the flashing screen and camera flash). Put the iPhone on the kitchen table whilst chopping carrots to remind you to take the roast out of the oven. Settle down, watch a movie and let the App tell you when its time to go to bed.\n\n*********************\n\nAs a long life deaf person I have been frustrated with the lack of innovation designed for deaf people in technology. One problem I have had is a suitable alarm clock or timer that appropriately notifies me. This App was born out of frustration and was initially just developed for my own personal use.\n\nSteven Mifsud\nDeafWake Designer \n\n*********************\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK - https://www.facebook.com/deafwake\n\nWhat are you waiting for!\n\nGet this superb app today\n\nFor less than a price of coffee, download this App today and be amazed! Tell your friends and family, please do be sure to leave a review on the Apple AppStore.\n\nNOTE - App must be running. Set the alarm and put the phone facedown (so screen goes black), upright or in your pocket etc. Don't turn phone off via the switch or home button as it is not possible to bypass the notification system when the iPhone is locked. This is the same for ALL Apps and other alarm clocks.\n\n*********************"

Arend, MA, CCC-SLP\n\n\nApp Authors: Yvette McCoy, MS, CCC-SLP, BCS-S; Tiffani Wallace, MA, CCC-SLP, BCS-S; Rinki Varindani Desai, MS, CCC-SLP\n\nNOTE: This app is intended for use by trained dysphagia clinicians and students only. It is NOT a tool for people with swallowing disorders to self-diagnose or set their own therapy program. Please ensure you are a healthcare professional (speech-language pathologist, occupational therapist, dietician, etc.) licensed to provide dysphagia assessment and treatment before downloading or using this app."

      "label": "****Thank you for making us a TOP 25 App in US, UK and Canada App Store category specific rankings!****\n\nSeasonal affective disorder, or SAD, is a kind of depression that appears at certain times of the year. Light therapy is one of the potential treatments for this condition. Almost 80% of the people who try light therapy find it beneficial. This app converts your apple device into a light box.\n\nWhy you SHOULD NOT download this App:\n1. If you are looking for a SAD Light Box App that generates an intensity of 10,000 Lux\n2. If you are looking for a quick fix and can not commit to consistent morning exposure sessions for at least 2 weeks\n3. If you will get turned off by the simplicity of this app and the solution to Seasonal Affective Disorder\n\nWhy you SHOULD download this App:\n1. If you want to try a cheap yet effective alternative to a traditional Light box which uses lower intensity BLUE LIGHT (approx. 100 to 575 Lux) and is backed by research (Google research paper: The effects of low-intensity narrow-band blue-light treatment compared to bright white-light treatment in sub-syndromal seasonal affective disorder by NCBI, US National Library of Medicine)\n2. If you would rather be intelligent and try something for a fiver rather than spend a few hundred dollars on a conventional light box\n3. If you are able to consistently commit to regular morning exposure sessions for at least 2 weeks \n4. If you would be happy with a REALLY SIMPLE APP that transforms your Apple device into a Light box and is more portable and user friendly\n5. If the weather is making you sad :( and you would rather be happy :)\n     \nThis app can also help you:\n1. Determine if you are suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)/ Cabin Fever/ Winter Blues/ Seasonal Depression with help of a short scored test\n2. Create your own unique shade of Blue / White / any other color light that works best for you\n3. Use the app as a Dawn Simulator (set alarm)\n4. Set timer for your light box to time your morning exposure sessions\n5. Shop for other products to help with SAD\n6. Listen to the Radio in the background\n\nUV Rating: The UV emission from your Apple Device is 0, hence this app does not have a UV rating. \n\nSome other activities you might want to try to deal with symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder are:\n• End your morning shower with a cold shower\n• Try to arrange the spaces you spend time in to maximize sunlight exposure\n• Keep curtains open during the day\n• Trim tree branches or hedges that may be blocking some of the light from getting into your home\n• Move furniture so that you sit near a window or, if you exercise indoors, set up your exercise equipment by a window\n• Install skylights and add lamps\n• Build physical activity into your lifestyle preferably before SAD symptoms take hold. Physical activity relieves stress, builds energy and increases both your physical and mental well-being and resilience\n• Make a habit of taking a daily noon-hour walk, particularly if you commute to school or work in the dark hours of the day\n• Meditate at least 20 min a day (focus on your breathing)\n• Try High intensity training if you are fit enough and have less time\n• Maintain good sleep hygiene\n• When all else fails, try a winter vacation in sunny climates—if the pocket and work schedule allow. Keep in mind that the symptoms will recur after you return home\n\nREFUND POLICY: If you consistently use the App for 14 days and show us that you genuinely tried but did not get any results, WE WILL REFUND 100% OF YOUR MONEY. *Subject to terms and conditions of Apple Inc. and the Apple App Store.\n\nSmile, because somewhere far away, we are cheering for you :)\n\n*THIS APP MUST NOT BE USED TO SUBSTITUTE ANY MEDICATION/ MEDICAL DEVICE. THE CREATORS/ PUBLISHERS OF THIS APP WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE RESULTING AS A USE OF THIS APP. PLEASE CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES. NO PART OF THIS DESCRIPTION OR APP MUST BE CONSIDERED AS MEDICAL ADVICE*"

      "label": "《神农本草经》系统地总结了古代医家等各方面的用药经验，对已经掌握的药物知识进行了一次全面而系统的整理。全书共计收录了365种药物，正好与一年365日相合，这倒并非巧合，而是作者有意为之的结果。事实上，当时掌握的药物数量已经远超此数，但由于受到术数思想的影响，所以从中选取了365种药物，“法三百六十五度，一度应一日，以成一岁”。\n《神农本草经》不止进行了药物的搜集工作，还有意识地对所收药物进行了分门别类工作，将365种药物按照上、中、下分为三类，这被称为“三品分类法”。分类的依据主要是药物的性能功效。\n《本经·序录》中即言：“上药一百二十种为君，主养命以应天，无毒，久服不伤人，”如人参、甘草、地黄、大枣等；“中药一百二十种为臣，主养性以应人，无毒有毒，斟酌其宜。”，需判别药性来使用，如百合、当归、龙眼、黄连、麻黄、白芷、黄芩等；“下药一百二十五种为佐使，主治病以应地，多毒，不可久服。”，如大黄、乌头、甘遂、巴豆等。\n《神农本草经》中也蕴含着丰富而深刻的药物理论，由此奠定了药物学的理论构架。此部分内容主要见于序录部分，相当于全书总论，虽然文字并不长，只有十三条，但已经涵盖了药物学的各个方面。\n以药物配伍为例，《神农本草经》中提出了君臣佐使的组方原则。所谓君臣佐使，本为社会中的不同阶层成员，有不同的职能与等级，药物学将其借用来说明药物在配伍中的不同角色，如上品药为君药，中品药为臣药，而下品药为佐使药。在组方时，应该充分考虑药物的特性，方中既要有君药、臣药，还要有起协助作用的佐使之药。其比例可按照一君、二臣、三佐、五使或一君、三臣、九佐使的原则来处理。\n在药物配伍中，两味或两味以上的药物用在一个方剂中，相互之间会产生不同的反应：有的药物共同使用能发挥更大的功效，有的两药相遇一方会减小另一方的药性；有的药可以制约另一种药物的毒性；有的两种药品本身均无毒，但如果两药相遇则会产生很大的毒性，不能同用等。《神农本草经》中共总结了七种关系，包括单行、相须、相使、相畏、相恶、相反、相杀等，认为对此“七情”要“合和视之”，这便是“七情合和”的配伍原则。\n《神农本草经》中对于所收录的各种药物的功效和主治疾病都进行了简要的记载与描述，这无疑是早期临床药学宝贵经验的总结。长期临床实践和现代研究都证明《神农本草经》中对于所载药物的功效认识大部分是正确的，其中许多药物至今仍然在临床广泛应用，比如人参补益、黄连止痢、麻黄定喘、常山截疟、大黄泻下等。而且各种药物主治疾病的种类也非常广泛，约有170余种，包括了内、外、妇、儿、五官等科疾病。此外，《神农本草经》中对于药物的性味、产地与采制、炮制方法，乃至用药原则和服药方法等都有涉及，极大地丰富了药物学的知识体系。"

      "label": "Anyone who snores at night is usually exhausted and not well rested the next morning. But not only that, the (spouse) partner is also prevented from sleeping because of the noise. \n\nMost of the time you will be confronted with the words: \"I have to fall asleep before you, otherwise you will start snoring and I won't be able to sleep.\" \n\nSnoring can thus become a real test of patience and there are even said to be cases where partners are no longer (able to) sleep in the same room.\n\nAlthough the number of men who snore is higher, there are also many women who snore. Therefore, this problem affects all genders.\n\nThere are several possible remedies on the market. But not all of them deliver what they promise, are expensive or very unwieldy.\n\nThis Anti-Snore-App is an anti-snoring solution that works through a completely \"natural\" concept. \n\nIn the past, did your partner, with a (gentle) nudge, make you change your sleeping position to stop snoring?\n\nThis practice is a common method between many couples in bed to stop the other from snoring. \n\nThis approach often serves its purpose. However, it is usually the case that both are awake at night and then have to fall asleep again. \n\nOur Anti-Snore-App automatically fulfills exactly this purpose without anyone having to wake up for it.  \n\nAfter a short orientation period, our Silent Night app promises you: \n\n- restful and regenerative sleep for everyone involved\n- reduced disturbance of the partner's rest\n- improved oxygen intake due to the shifting of the body\n\nOur app uses state-of-the-art algorithms from the field of machine learning. We use it to evaluate your current sleeping sounds and provide you with unconscious assistance through vibrations. \n\nOf course, your data remains completely recorded on the device and will be deleted immediately after evaluation. This means that not only your restful sleep but also the protection of your data is in the forefront.\n\nLikewise, all processes operate directly on the device, data and radio connections can be independently deactivated by you (recommended!) overnight.\n\n----\nDisclaimer for medical services\n\nThis Anti-Snore-App is not a medical device and is not intended to replace professional medical advice and/or diagnoses. The Anti-Snore-App is not intended to diagnose or treat respiratory failure or other diseases/medical conditions. Please consult a licensed physician before making any decisions or taking any actions that may affect your health, safety and well-being. Do not ignore professional advice based on things you have seen, heard or read on the app, website or social media. Always consult a healthcare professional if you have questions or concerns about your snoring or overall health."

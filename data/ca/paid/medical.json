      "label": "Researchers at Monash University have developed the low FODMAP diet and a corresponding app to assist in the management of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The Monash University FODMAP diet works by swapping foods high in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs), with low FODMAP alternatives. Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

It helps patients receive the care and measures your acuity and volume against other facilities with reliability.  The CTAS is used in many countries around the world for setting patient priority.\n\nThe Canadian Triage & Acuity Scale (CTAS) is a tool that enables Emergency Departments (ED) to:\n\n•Prioritize patient care requirements\n•Examine patient care processes, workload, and resource requirements relative to case mix and community needs\n\nThe CTAS allows ED nurses and physicians to:\n•Triage patients according the type and severity of their presenting signs and symptoms\n•Ensure that the sickest patients are seen first when ED capacity has been exceeded due to visit rates or reduced access to other services\n•Ensure that a patient's need for care is reassessed while in the ED\n\nThe CTAS allows ED managers to:\n•Measure the case mix (volume and acuity) of patients who visit the ED\n•Determine whether the ED has an operational plan and the resources to meet patient needs\n•Assess the ED's role within the hospital and health care region\n\nThe triage level assigned using the CTAS criteria is a mandatory data element to be used in all Canadian Hospital Emergency Departments for reporting to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI).\n\nTraining in the use of the CTAS in the clinical context is recommended before using this application to assist in clinical decision-making."

      "label": "Designed by a pediatrician, BiliCalc uses the American Academy of Pediatrics 2004 \"Management of Hyperbilirubinemia in Infants Greater than 35 Weeks of Age\" to calculate the threshold for starting phototherapy based on the patient's age, bilirubin level, and neurotoxicity risk. Values are now displayed on the phototherapy nomogram. In addition, it will also tell you the patient's risk zone using the Bhutani Nomogram.\n\nAllows direct age input and includes the option to calculate age from birth and lab sample times. The app has a direct link to source journal articles, nomograms, and a list of the neurotoxicity risk factors. Supports US and SI units (mg/dL and µmol/L).\n\nApp Feature Summary\n-Calculates phototherapy threshold for newborns 35 weeks and older\n-Displays values on phototherapy nomogram\n-Suggests time frame for followup bilirubin levels based on patient risk zone \n-Direct links to reference journal articles\n\n**********************************\nFrequently Asked Questions\n**********************************\n1. I think the graph is backwards. Why is low risk on top and high risk on bottom?\n\nThe graph is directly from the 2004 AAP Hyperbilirubinemia Guidelines. The degree of \"risk\" refers to the infant's risk for developing neurotoxicity. This is different than the Bhutani Nomogram in which \"risk\" refers to the risk for development of severe hyperbilirubinemia. The threshold for treatment (when a data point lies above one of the lines on the graph) of the infant is different based on the predisposing factors (divided into the three risk categories). Babies who are \"low neurotoxicity risk,\" can tolerate higher levels of bilirubin than a baby with medium or high risk. Therefore, a high risk baby will be treated at lower bilirubin levels than a low risk baby. The graph is correct in having low risk on top since a higher value is needed to pass the threshold for treatment (phototherapy). Please see the graph here for verification as well: http://bit.ly/AppPWU. Please email if you have further questions.\n\n******************************************\nIntended for use by pediatricians, neonatologists, physicians, medical students, and pediatric nurses who treat newborn infants in the hospital and as outpatients.\n\nBiliCalc should be used only as a reference aid.

      "label": "Simple, fast, yet more thorough than any other pregnancy wheel available for the iPhone, Perfect OB Wheel is better than just a replacement for your trusty paper wheel.\n\nHere's why Perfect OB Wheel is your best choice of gestational calculator:\n\n 1) Input flexibility: Start with one of:\n    • Last menstrual period (LMP)\n    • Conception date\n    • Estimated date of confinement/delivery (EDC)\n    • Ultrasound dating: Number of weeks and days gestation as of a given date (\"X Weeks\").\n\n 2) Input speed: Other wheels for the iPhone make you conform to them for entering your patient's information. Why not be able to choose based on how you are holding the phone and what else you are doing at the same time?\n    • Use the numeric entry pad (0 3 3 0 2 0 0 8) and immediately see the results, OR\n    • Spin the date wheel at the bottom of the screen and tap Next.\n\n 3) Thorough results: All the information you would expect from a classic wheel, plus more:\n   • Estimated Due Date\n   • LMP Date\n   • Conception Date\n   • 1st Trimester End Date\n   • 2nd Trimester End Date\n   • Gestational Age\n   • Conceptional Age\n   • Expected Fetal Length based on standard fetal growth curves\n   • Expected Fetal Weight based on standard fetal growth curves (\"How much does my baby weigh, doctor?\")\n\nResults are relative to 'today' by default; this can be quickly changed to reflect any date by tapping the 'today' button and selecting a new date.\n\n 4) Accurate results: Perfect OB Wheel provides exact dates and accounts for all calendar variance, including leap years. \n\n 5) Persistence: Perfect OB Wheel remembers the date and date type you last used and restores them when launched to streamline your workflow.\n\n 6) Perfect OB Tracker upgrade: Available as an in-app purchase update, the Perfect OB Tracker lets you track any number of pregnancies, with at-a-glance due date and gestational age and one-tap access to all the data Perfect OB Wheel provides.  A  picture and text notes can be kept on each patient. Postpartum tracking is also available. Passcode locking is available for HIPAA compliance."

      "label": "Meet Freya, your virtual birth partner from The Positive Birth Company! Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth.

Covering over 80 muscles with more than 150 trigger points.\n\nMyofascial trigger points are one of the most common sources of pain, and are often overlooked by health professionals. \n\nThis app strives to help you find the source of pain via intuitive interface: tap the body where your pain is and see which trigger points refer pain to that area. Over 50 distinct pain areas are covered.\n\nYou can also find trigger points by by tapping a muscle on the muscle model, by choosing a muscle from the alphabetized list, or by using the search bar. If you don't know exactly what you're looking for, you can search using keywords such as \"elbow\", which will show the muscles of the elbow as well as any pain areas or conditions related to the elbow (e.g. \"lateral elbow pain\", \"tennis elbow\").\n\nTrigger points can cause or mimic a variety of conditions such as \"Tendinitis\" and \"Tennis Elbow\". More than 40 conditions are covered. Choose a condition and see a list of muscles whose trigger points can cause or mimic that condition.\n\nIn each trigger point illustration, an \"x\" marks the location of the point, while the area of referred pain is colored in blue.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: this app does not include treatment information; its aim is to help find the source of specific pain. Once you've identified a trigger point please consult a massage therapist or otherwise trained professional. There are also myriad self-treatment resources available both in book and video format should you choose to treat yourself.\n\n4520c652df"

We’ve taken all the content from our original Pedi STAT application and carefully selected components that are unique to providers in EMS.  We’ve solicited feedback from leaders in out of hospital care, including paramedics, EMTs, air medical flight crews, and medical directors. We’ve condensed the content to be applicable to those providing care outside the hospital, including first responders, firefighters, EMTs, Paramedics, and Critical Care Transport providers.\n\nMedication dosing and pediatric equipment sizes are easily and rapidly accessed, and accurately calculated based on provider input of either weight, length, age, or Broselow / Pediatape weight estimates.  We are attempting to eliminate medical errors by calculating not only the correct pediatric medication dose, but also the volume to be administered for patient specific conditions.  We have also included algorithms and medical calculators to assist providers in multiple areas, including managing pediatric cardiac arrest, burn size estimation and fluid resuscitation, and Glasgow Coma Scale.\n\nCaring for pediatric patients is associated with a large number of challenges, the most important being selecting the correct equipment and medications, and then dosing the medications correctly.  Our goal is to eliminate these challenges as much as possible, and allow the provider to concentrate on what is most important, the patient.\n\nSuggestions for improvements or additions are always welcome:  Pedi-STAT.com"

      "label": "FlashRX is a flashcard and quiz-based educational tool for healthcare students and professionals to learn the top 250 medications in the outpatient setting (also known as the Top 200 Drugs or Top 300 Drugs).  Instead of complicated, bloated drug cards, FlashRX’s drug database focuses on simple, usable information to develop your core knowledge base.\n\nThe emphasis on concise, practical knowledge will improve learning and comprehension of the top 250 drugs.  This is a learning tool – NOT a drug reference.  This app is not a comprehensive resource for drug information.\n\nThis app is perfect for pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, physician assistants, nurses, nursing students, physicians, medical students, and other healthcare professionals.  The drug database is designed to aid in studying for both students in school and those preparing for standardized exams (eg, NAPLEX, BCPS, PTCB, ExCPT, PANCE/PANRE, NCLEX, USMLE, COMLEX).\n\n== FEATURES ==\n• Beautiful, intuitive flashcard and quiz modes to optimize your learning strategy\n• Flashcards and quiz content are fully customizable – test yourself on brand/generic names, drug classes, indications, adverse effects, and even typical dose ranges\n• Quiz mode includes a selection algorithm to randomly identify intelligent distractor answers to keep you on your toes\n• An adaptive (Leitner) learning mode so that your time is focused on drug cards that you haven’t yet mastered\n\n== DRUG DATABASE ==\n• Includes information on 250 of the most common outpatient medications based on net sales, total prescriptions, and unique or emerging therapeutic classes\n• Audio pronunciations of both the brand and generic names at any time throughout the app\n• Each drug entry includes its brand name, generic name, generic pronunciation, drug class, indications, adverse effects, and typical dosing\n• The drug database is completely customizable – add or remove drugs, change drug entries, and even record your own pronunciation\n• \"Group\" drugs into therapeutic classes or your own custom drug lists.  These groups can be hidden or shown to focus your studying\n\n== ADAPTIVE LEARNING STATISTICS ==\n• Both flashcard and quiz modes utilize an adaptive learning algorithm to keep track of which drug facts you know well, and which need more review\n• Track your learning progress by viewing your statistics at the end of each flashcard or quiz session, or access the dedicated Adaptive Learning Statistics page for your learning overview\n\n== AUTHOR INFORMATION == \nThis app and all of its content was created by Sean P. Kane, PharmD, BCPS – a clinical pharmacist, associate professor, and author of the popular evidence-based website, ClinCalc.com.  The drug list and drug information closely mirrors the popular video-based course series The Top 250 Drugs (https://top250drugs.com)."

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

It has a beautiful clean interface that’s super simple to use. It’s a completely new baby tracking experience. \n\n“Simple equals better. And better equals good.

See daily, weekly and monthly increases or decreases in activity. Understand your baby better and keep on top of things.\n\nKEEP IN SYNC\nInvite your partner or a caregiver to share in the tracking or to review progress. And if you have multiple devices of your own, sync between these too. Running timers started on one device can be stopped from another device too enabling you to easily share tracking.\n\nAT-A-GLANCE BABY STATUS\nAt the top of the screen you’ll quickly see when your baby last fed, slept and was changed or go to the log screen for detailed history.\n\nFURTHER DETAILS:\n\n+ Nursing - pause or switch sides with a single tap. See which side you last fed on.\n+ Bottle - record amount as well as time feeding, and if it’s formula or EBM. \n+ Pumping - record amounts and time for each side, or just record totals if you prefer\n+ Sleep - record time, and easily adjust start and end-times as you need\n+ Diaper - record wet, dirty or both\n+ Night mode provides a low-contrast background and can be easily switched on or off\n+ Simultaneous timer support  - e.g. sleep and feeding - we know both can happen at once!\n+ Manually add activities later if you forgot, or edit existing ones even if they’re running - e.g. if you forgot to start the sleep timer when putting baby down, just start the timer and adjust the start time earlier and the timer will automatically update. \n+ Add notes to activities, for example where you fed or whether baby was settled. You can even add notes while the timer is running  - you don’t need to wait for it to finish.\n+ Statistics - detailed stats including totals, averages per day, average length and interval. For nursing there is a breakdown for left and right sides, and for diapers a wet and dirty breakdown.\n+ Switch activities on or off so your interface isn’t cluttered with activities you don’t use\n+ Support for tracking twins or for your other little ones all from the one app. You can switch babies with a single swipe.\n+ Supports optimal layout for iPhone4s through to iPhone 7 Plus \n+ Data backed up automatically and securely   \n+ Get a full CSV export activities by contacting support\n+ Responsive and caring support -  we really want you to help you\n+ It’s all there - no extra purchases required to unlock features\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions we would love to hear from you - please contact us at help@babytimeapp.com or visit our community at http://help.babytimeapp.com.\n \nDownload BabyTime now for a completely new baby tracking experience."

Up to 10-times zoom and with an integrated light, it makes it easy and comfortable for you to see even in poor lighting conditions.\n\nPlease note the mode of operation:\nThe magnifying glass uses your cell phone's integrated camera. Hold it at least 5cm away from the object you want to enlarge and allow the camera to focus on it first (image is brought into focus). Then slowly move the slide switch to enlarge. If the camera does not focus properly, please increase the distance to the object and make a control for the automatic focus (focus not locked) and lighting conditions. Click once for full screen view and then once more for normal. In the full screen view, you can even zoom by spreading the image with your fingers. Clicking the red button will create a snapshot of the zoomed image. It is then saved to your photo album.\nTip: No fast movements!"

L’application est un recueil des notes ayant servi à l’étude de l’examen du Collège Royal des résidents de l’Université Laval. \n\nVous y retrouverez tout le matériel nécessaire à une prise en charge optimale de vos patients, synthétisé afin de permettre une consultation rapide.\n\n- Les chirurgiens établis pourront parfaire leurs connaissances.\n- Pour les résidents, l’application deviendra vite un outil d’étude incontournable.\n- Les étudiants en médecine avec un intérêt en chirurgie auront accès au même niveau de connaissances que le reste de l’équipe de soins.\n\nL’application permet la prise de notes pour y ajouter des commentaires et des conduites locales. \n\nL’application continuera d’être améliorée. Les figures seront éventuellement remplacées et les quelques termes anglais traduits. \n\nLes auteurs savent que la médecine évolue rapidement et mettent tous les efforts pour que le contenu reste actuel et pertinent. En respect avec la collégialité qui régit la pratique médicale, une adresse courriel est disponible pour permettre aux lecteurs de communiquer avec les auteurs à propos de changements nouveaux et importants de la pratique chirurgicale. Ceci permet d’améliorer collectivement notre savoir."

Suitable for training of both medical and surgical cases, cheaper than anything you'll ever buy for use in medical simulation.\n\nSuitable in training of EMS, anesthesia, paramedics, trauma teams, HEMS, or anyone else that use ultrasound in their clinical work.\n\nConnect two devices running the app over WiFi or Bluetooth, using one as a monitor and the other one as a remote held by the simulation observer. Clips are triggered by pushing and holding down a button on the remote in tandem with the simulated exam. \n\nSimulate a full ultrasound examination of pleura, lung base, heart (PLAX, A4C and subcostal view), the three points of the FAST exam, the femoral veins and the aorta.\n\nMake your own case by assigning different pathologies including: pneumothorax, pneumonia, B-lines, pleural effusion, high and low EF, LV & RV infarction, tamponade, endocarditis, cardiac arrest, LUCAS compressions, type A dissection, hydronefrosis, aortic aneurysm, DVT, and free abdominal fluid. Changes can be made on the fly, simulating dynamic course. Save and load cases later for quick changes during your scenario.\n \nCPR mode lets you easily access clips of Compressions, Asystole, Vfib and Normal contractions for training in using ultrasound during CPR pulse checks.\n\nUse the app when training with usual mannequins or even live actors! Can easily be used as an examination tool for basic P.O.C. ultrasound courses. Add a probe to the monitor for improved fidelity!\n\n'Team Mode' enables multiple pairs of devices to stay connected without interference if used in close poximity of each other, 10 different groups can use the app at once.\n\nIt's truly an Awesome Ultrasound Simulator!\n\nUsed all around the globe, by the ATACC course in GB, Care Flight Australia and many others."

      "label": "SRR Counter for Dogs and Cats\n\nCount your pet’s heart rate while they are sleeping. It is a must have if your dog or cat has a heart condition and your vet recommends you track their heart rate on a regular basis.\n\nEASY TO USE\n\nWith the SRR Counter for Dogs and Cats app, you can easily count your pet’s breathing rate for 15 seconds, 30 seconds or 60 seconds. When your pet exhales, tap the Breath button to start the timer. Continue to tap the Breath button each time your pet exhales. Once complete, the number of breaths will display.\n\nCALCULATIONS\n– If you select 15 Seconds, the app will calculate each time you tap times 4.\n\n– If you select 30 Seconds, the app will calculate each time you tap times 2.\n\n– If you select 60 Seconds, the app will display the number of times you tap.\n\nFEATURES\n– The Apple Watch will provide haptic feedback with each tap. This allows you to watch your pet breathing, rather than your watch.\n\n– You will receive a haptic notification when the timer is finished and be presented with the total breath count.\n\n– No audible feedback so you won’t disturb your precious pet at rest! Please set the Apple Watch to silent to fully utilize this feature.\n\nMY STORY\n\nI created this app when my rescue dog, Bizou, went into heart failure at age 13 and was diagnosed with a grade 5 heart murmur. She was on several medications and my vet recommended I begin tracking her breathing to help them in regulating the dosages of her medications. I found it difficult for just 1 person to watch her breathing while also watching a timer to know when to stop counting. My goal was to make this much easier.\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nContact your veterinarian for normal and elevated heart rates for both cats and dogs. If your pet has an elevated heart rate or you have any concerns about his or her health, please immediately contact your vet.\n\nFEEDBACK\n\nPlease send your feedback to support@verkadesg.com. I would love to implement new features based on your ideas!\n\nSee more information at www.verkadesg.com\n\nAll proceeds go to the Humane Society of York County http://humanesocietyofyorkcounty.org"

      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

The guidelines articles, as published in the Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease, as well as the comprehensive risk estimates, can be accessed through https://www.asccp.org/guidelines.  \n\nThese evidence-based management guidelines, initially developed in 2019, came together through a consensus process of 19 organizations. The updated management guidelines aim to:\n • Allow for a more complete and precise estimation of risk\n • Provide more appropriate intervention for high-risk individuals (detect and treat more precancer)\n • Recommend less intervention for low-risk individuals (decrease testing and treatment that won’t prevent cancer and may cause reproductive harm)\n • Allow for the future addition of new risk modifiers and screening and management technologies\n\nSee https://www.asccp.org/UserGuide for tips on using the app."

      "label": "\"The middle jiao and food has always been of central importance in the Chinese quest for health.  Hopefully all practitioners realise the potential of this area and view the legacy of traditional information available from China with respect and awe; this app is a good avenue to access some of this information.\"\n\nPeter Torssell\nJournal of Chinese Medicine\nFebruary 2014\n\n\"People who practice medicine must first thoroughly understand the source of the disorder and know what has been violated. Then, use food to treat it, and if food will not cure it, afterwards apply herbal medicine.\"\n\nSun Simiao (Tang Dynasty)\n\n\nThe Chinese Nutritional Strategies (CNS) app is a tool designed to allow practitioners of Chinese medicine convenient and complete access to centuries of nutritional insights. \n\nThe heart of the CNS app is the database of more than 300 common foods, along with their temperature, flavor, actions, indications, notes, seasonal recommendations, and differential diagnosis categories. The database is searchable by any of these criteria and sorting through it allows the practitioner to compile a list of recommended foods, and then share those recommendations via email or as a hard copy with the patient.\n\nIn addition, all aspects of the database may be altered by the practitioner. For example, this is the data set for watermelon:\n\n=======\n\nTemperature: Cold\nFlavor: Sweet\n\nActions: Enters the heart, stomach and urinary bladder channels, clears heat from heart, stomach and urinary bladder, relieves summer heat, augments yin fluids, drains damp, moistens the intestines\n\nIndications: Thirst, mouth sores, palpitations, overheated during the summer with inability to urinate, edema\n\nNotes: \"Nature's Bai Hu Tang\" - Chinese medical saying\n\nWood (Spring): Avoid\nFire (Summer): Moderation\nEarth (Late Summer): Seek out\nMetal (Fall): Seek out\nWater (Winter): Avoid\n\nLu Qi Deficiency: Contraindicated\nKid Yang Deficiency: Contraindicated\nUrinary Bladder Damp Cold: Contraindicated \nUrinary Bladder Damp Heat: Indicated\nHeart Yang Deficiency: Contraindicated\nHeart Fire: Indicated\nSpleen Qi Deficiency: Contraindicated\nSpleen Yang Deficiency: Contraindicated\nStomach Fire: Indicated\nStomach Qi Deficiency with Cold: Contraindicated\nStomach Food Stagnation: Contraindicated\n\n=======\n\nAny of the above characteristics may be altered and saved to the database. For example, the Chinese dietary tradition that you follow may consider watermelon to have a neutral temperature and be indicated for cough. Simply change these characteristics in the database and any future searches for neutral temperature foods or cough will include watermelon in the results.\n\nAn especially unique feature for the CNS app is the seasonal recommendations feature which addresses the \"When\" of prescribing Chinese nutrition. Again using the watermelon example, if the practitioner diagnoses urinary bladder damp heat and has the seasonal recommendation feature switched on in the winter then watermelon will be moved from the seek out to the avoid category. This seasonal recommendation feature allows the practitioner to emphasize the local climate and growing seasons when dispensing dietary advice.\n\nCompiled, edited, and translated by Toby Daly, PhD, LAc. Toby Daly received his undergraduate degree in Food Science from the California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo. He began studying Chinese medicine in 1997 with Sunim Doam a Korean monk trained in the Saam tradition. He earned his master’s degree in Traditional Chinese Medicine in 2001 upon completion of Chinese medical training in San Francisco as well as China. During his four years of training in San Francisco, he interned with the prominent San Francisco acupuncturist Dr. Angela Wu famous for her treatment of infertility with Chinese medicine. He has recently completed his PhD in Classical Chinese Medicine under the guidance of 88th generation Daoist priest Jeffery Yuen."

Developed by a team of psychologists and therapists from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, ZeroPhobia offers an evidence-based treatment program. All you need is your smartphone, a virtual reality viewer (e.g., Google Cardboard), some time, and a little dedication. Our goal is to make evidence-based treatment simple, accessible, and affordable.\n\nWhat you will get\n\nZeroPhobia is a complete treatment program to help you overcome your fear of flying. Six modules provide you with information about the nature of your fear, relaxation exercises, setting goals, getting through difficult moments, tackling negative thoughts, and practicing with challenging situations. Besides the modules, seven virtual reality levels allow you to practice with handling your fear during check-in, waiting for your flight, take off, turbulence, and landing. Tara, ZeroPhobia’s virtual therapist, guides you through every step of the way.\n\nFor whom?\n\nZeroPhobia is intended for anyone who suffers from fear of flying and wants to do something about it. You can follow ZeroPhobia by yourself, in your own time, and from the comfort of your own home. \n\nResearch and scientific background\n\nZeroPhobia is based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). This type of therapy is very effective in treating fears, like fear of flying. The effectiveness of ZeroPhobia has been tested by a team of researchers from VU University Amsterdam. In total, 153 people suffering from fear of flying recently participated in this randomized controlled trial. See our website (https://www.zerophobia.app/science/) for more information about our research.\n\nMedical Disclaimer\n\nZeroPhobia is intended for information and skill development purposes only. ZeroPhobia is not intended to replace personal consultation with a qualified healthcare professional or to provide medical treatment or advice. If you need more help than this program can offer, contact your doctor or an institution for professional healthcare in your area. You should always obtain professional or medical advice, appropriate to your own circumstances, with any questions you may have regarding a health or medical condition. ZeroPhobia cannot be used for diagnosis. People seeking a diagnosis for fear of heights or another mental condition should consult a medical practitioner or mental health professional. Consult your doctor or therapist before using this ZeroPhobia if you suffer from a heart condition, mood disorder, epilepsy, or a psychiatric or neurological condition."

The app will remind you to take your daily dose at a personally configurable time.\n \nTap on your daily dose to confirm you've taken the blood thinner medication. The timestamp of confirmation is stored in the app. That way, you'll never forget if and at what time you've taken your medication.\n \nThe app can also record the INR measurements of your blood and visualizes the evolution of your INR in time. The app also reminds you when a new INR measurement is planned.\n\nDose and INR data can be exported or imported for backup purposes, or if you want to discuss this with your medical expert."

The Monash University FODMAP diet works by swapping foods high in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs), with low FODMAP alternatives. Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

It helps patients receive the care and measures your acuity and volume against other facilities with reliability.  The CTAS is used in many countries around the world for setting patient priority.\n\nThe Canadian Triage & Acuity Scale (CTAS) is a tool that enables Emergency Departments (ED) to:\n\n•Prioritize patient care requirements\n•Examine patient care processes, workload, and resource requirements relative to case mix and community needs\n\nThe CTAS allows ED nurses and physicians to:\n•Triage patients according the type and severity of their presenting signs and symptoms\n•Ensure that the sickest patients are seen first when ED capacity has been exceeded due to visit rates or reduced access to other services\n•Ensure that a patient's need for care is reassessed while in the ED\n\nThe CTAS allows ED managers to:\n•Measure the case mix (volume and acuity) of patients who visit the ED\n•Determine whether the ED has an operational plan and the resources to meet patient needs\n•Assess the ED's role within the hospital and health care region\n\nThe triage level assigned using the CTAS criteria is a mandatory data element to be used in all Canadian Hospital Emergency Departments for reporting to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI).\n\nTraining in the use of the CTAS in the clinical context is recommended before using this application to assist in clinical decision-making."

      "label": "Simple, fast, yet more thorough than any other pregnancy wheel available for the iPhone, Perfect OB Wheel is better than just a replacement for your trusty paper wheel.\n\nHere's why Perfect OB Wheel is your best choice of gestational calculator:\n\n 1) Input flexibility: Start with one of:\n    • Last menstrual period (LMP)\n    • Conception date\n    • Estimated date of confinement/delivery (EDC)\n    • Ultrasound dating: Number of weeks and days gestation as of a given date (\"X Weeks\").\n\n 2) Input speed: Other wheels for the iPhone make you conform to them for entering your patient's information. Why not be able to choose based on how you are holding the phone and what else you are doing at the same time?\n    • Use the numeric entry pad (0 3 3 0 2 0 0 8) and immediately see the results, OR\n    • Spin the date wheel at the bottom of the screen and tap Next.\n\n 3) Thorough results: All the information you would expect from a classic wheel, plus more:\n   • Estimated Due Date\n   • LMP Date\n   • Conception Date\n   • 1st Trimester End Date\n   • 2nd Trimester End Date\n   • Gestational Age\n   • Conceptional Age\n   • Expected Fetal Length based on standard fetal growth curves\n   • Expected Fetal Weight based on standard fetal growth curves (\"How much does my baby weigh, doctor?\")\n\nResults are relative to 'today' by default; this can be quickly changed to reflect any date by tapping the 'today' button and selecting a new date.\n\n 4) Accurate results: Perfect OB Wheel provides exact dates and accounts for all calendar variance, including leap years. \n\n 5) Persistence: Perfect OB Wheel remembers the date and date type you last used and restores them when launched to streamline your workflow.\n\n 6) Perfect OB Tracker upgrade: Available as an in-app purchase update, the Perfect OB Tracker lets you track any number of pregnancies, with at-a-glance due date and gestational age and one-tap access to all the data Perfect OB Wheel provides.  A  picture and text notes can be kept on each patient. Postpartum tracking is also available. Passcode locking is available for HIPAA compliance."

      "label": "Meet Freya, your virtual birth partner from The Positive Birth Company! Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

The application has a suggested standard solution based on the schemes most used in intensive care services and allows editing and saving your favorite solutions.\n\nThe application also allows the creation of new solutions from the ampoules available in its service, the calculation of the dosage in mL/hour and the possibility of converting the infused speed into an infused concentration and vice versa. In addition, it is possible to view the therapeutic range individually for the patient's weight as guided by some medical bibliographies and the adjustment of this range by the user depending on the objective and clinical judgment. Thus, the application increases patient safety when prescribing these drugs reducing the risk of calculation errors by the professional.\n\nThe application also has messages to warn about photosensitive solutions and medications that must be diluted in a specific medium such as physiological solution or glucose solution, thus preventing changes in their therapeutic properties.\n\n\nThe application is available in english, portuguese and spanish."

The DST very effectively detects early dementia stages, and can reliably distinguish between the different dementia severity levels. It is therefore suitable for dementia screening, as well as for severity monitoring / therapy control over time.\n\nAdditional functions include:\n- a reminder to redo the test after 3-6 months, for medical monitoring \n- continued engagement for prevention, through regular Dementia News \n- tracking of the dementia risk over time, visualized in a graphic\n- option to e-mail and/or print the test results (e.g., for discussion with a physician) \n\nTo date, there is no effective treatment for advanced dementia stages. Therefore, effective screening is essential to begin treatment before the brain damages become irreversible. Because for early dementia stages, there are already effective treatment options that can significantly delay or even prevent the progression of the disease. \n\nWith special tests, dementia can be detected 18 years prior to the first symptoms. The Dementia Screening Test (DST) is the only such test which has been certified by Health Authorities as a Medical Device for dementia screening.\n\nThe good news is: for most people the test can give the all-clear!\n \nThe DST in short:\n- Easy to perform, also for medical laypersons.\n- Reliable: more than 96% sensitivity proven in clinical trials, probably the highest value worldwide for such tests.\n- Safe: no registration required, no storage of personal data, works without internet connection, no advertising.\n- Recognized as a medical device by Health Authorities.\n- Works with all dementia subtypes (Alzheimer's dementia, vascular dementia, fronto-temporal dementia, Lewy-body dementia, secondary dementia, hybrids / other forms).\n- Engaging: provides you with the latest research results on a regular basis, and reminds to retake the test regularly.\n- Documents changes in dementia risk over time.\n- Supports research and public awareness for dementia patients and relatives.\n\nTake the test now, and become a superager!"

We’ve been there;  At 3 AM, you don’t feel like going through a textbook or a long UpToDate article; you just want to get things done.\n\n\n**************** \nREVIEWS \n\n\"If you have ever needed a quick reference to learn on the fly or been stumped by a late night call while cross-covering and you are willing to spend a few dollars to avoid that feeling, you should consider this app.\"\n\niMedicalApps.com\n\n\n“It has all those handy little things that drug guides and medical references just don’t capture concisely.”\n“I would pay at least double the cost for this handy little reference.”\n\nDr Jessica Otte, drottematic blog\n\n**************** \n**************** \n\n\nAUDIENCE\njunior residents, interns and medical students\n\n\nINTRO\nIn medical school, we learn a lot about diseases and the basis for their management.  However, we are traditionally less exposed to apparently easy problems like pain, nausea or hypokalemia.  Quite often, those issues are brought to the attention of the nursing staff in the evening.  At that time, the treating team is away and you're on call, running all over the hospital.  \n\nMD on Call gives you tips on how to QUICKLY assess and manage (acutely) common problems so you can go on assessing the next patient, or to your room to get some well deserved sleep.  -- it is NOT meant to replace a textbook --\n \n\n\nFEATURES\nMD on call is divided into 5 main sections:\n\n• Issues •  26 frequent on call situations (including management of some specific conditions)\n\nAbdominal Pain*\nAcute Coronary Syndrome*\nAgitation / Violence\nAnaphylaxis\nBleeding\nBradycardia*\nChest Pain\nConstipation\nDeath (Pronouncing)\nDecreased LOC\nDysuria / UTI*\nDyspnea\nFever\nFebrile neutropenia\nHeadache\nHypertension\nHypotension\nInsomnia\nMeningitis\nNausea / Vomiting\nPain\nPalliation\nPneumonia\nSeizure\nTachycardia\nWound Dehiscence\nWound Infection\n\n• Labs •  Common electrolytes abnormalities (including management)\n\nHypo Ca, K, Mg, Na, PO4, glycemia\nHyper Ca, K, Na, glycemia\n\n• ECG •  Normal and abnormal ECG values, now with examples\n\n• Misc •  Suggestions on how to write orders for admission, \"comfort measures only\", \"on call\" notes, OR and procedure notes.  \nTransfusions:  general information and common reactions\nMisc:  CSF values, opioid conversion...\n\n• Lines and Tubes • How to manage common problems, such as a blocked NG tube.\n\n• Search •  Search using acronyms or keywords\n\n\n****************\n\nFeedback is more than welcome :  visit the website for more details\n\n**************** \n\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThis publication (application) is to be used as a guide only.

      "label": "Designed by a pediatrician, BiliCalc uses the American Academy of Pediatrics 2004 \"Management of Hyperbilirubinemia in Infants Greater than 35 Weeks of Age\" to calculate the threshold for starting phototherapy based on the patient's age, bilirubin level, and neurotoxicity risk. Values are now displayed on the phototherapy nomogram. In addition, it will also tell you the patient's risk zone using the Bhutani Nomogram.\n\nAllows direct age input and includes the option to calculate age from birth and lab sample times. The app has a direct link to source journal articles, nomograms, and a list of the neurotoxicity risk factors. Supports US and SI units (mg/dL and µmol/L).\n\nApp Feature Summary\n-Calculates phototherapy threshold for newborns 35 weeks and older\n-Displays values on phototherapy nomogram\n-Suggests time frame for followup bilirubin levels based on patient risk zone \n-Direct links to reference journal articles\n\n**********************************\nFrequently Asked Questions\n**********************************\n1. I think the graph is backwards. Why is low risk on top and high risk on bottom?\n\nThe graph is directly from the 2004 AAP Hyperbilirubinemia Guidelines. The degree of \"risk\" refers to the infant's risk for developing neurotoxicity. This is different than the Bhutani Nomogram in which \"risk\" refers to the risk for development of severe hyperbilirubinemia. The threshold for treatment (when a data point lies above one of the lines on the graph) of the infant is different based on the predisposing factors (divided into the three risk categories). Babies who are \"low neurotoxicity risk,\" can tolerate higher levels of bilirubin than a baby with medium or high risk. Therefore, a high risk baby will be treated at lower bilirubin levels than a low risk baby. The graph is correct in having low risk on top since a higher value is needed to pass the threshold for treatment (phototherapy). Please see the graph here for verification as well: http://bit.ly/AppPWU. Please email if you have further questions.\n\n******************************************\nIntended for use by pediatricians, neonatologists, physicians, medical students, and pediatric nurses who treat newborn infants in the hospital and as outpatients.\n\nBiliCalc should be used only as a reference aid. The information contained in the app should not be used as a substitute for the exercise of professional clinical judgement.

Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

However, the interpretation of respiratory function tests, especially spirometry tests, is considered suboptimal in primary care.\r\n\r\nA team from the Quebec Heart and Lung Institute affiliated with Laval University (IUCPQ-UL) developed an interactive mobile application called SPIRO© to facilitate the interpretation of spirometry tests.\r\n\r\nThe SPIRO© app guides healthcare professionals and medical students in interpreting spirometry tests by entering basic data from a spirometry report (FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC). The software gives a diagnostic suggestion to the user based on pre-set intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being a resource for educational material (explanatory video, questionnaires, documents related to respiratory health guidelines), the SPIRO© application guides the user in applying the guidelines in respiratory health by providing the necessary references (scientific articles, respiratory health guidelines) to develop a treatment plan.\r\n\r\nThe app allows:\r\n- Optimizing interpretation of spirometry;\r\n- Obtaining a diagnostic suggestion;\r\n- Obtaining a treatment suggestion according to respiratory guidelines;\r\n- Getting quick access to respiratory health guidelines;\r\n- Facilitating the work of health professionals;\r\n- Carrying out better follow-up of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma;\r\n- Obtaining continuing education through specific and relevant educational material. \r\n\r\nThis tool was developed by the Chair in Knowledge Translation, Education and Prevention in Respiratory and Cardiovascular Health affiliated with Laval University in collaboration with the IUCPQ-UL."

Everything that exists has a mathematical signature, even our DNA.  Trinfinity8 incorporates the most sophisticated technology that sends billions of bits of information to the body to help effect positive vibrational and consciousness change that is in alignment with nature.  (Ear buds must be worn to experience the full benefit of the algorithms delivered sub-audibly with the music.)\n\nTrinfinity8™ Energy On-The-Go uses uniquely designed geometric fractal images to amplify the algorithms.  Quantum physicists are discovering that enlightenment is the charge you attract when your thought patterns get fractal.  A fractal is a geometric shape that can be split into billions of parts, each of which contains an exact copy of the whole.  The Science of Fractal allows phase conjugation and a unified field for waves of people.  Holy men call this ONENESS.\n\nFeatures 4 basic programs:\n\nBalance Energy:  Helps cleanse and balance the body’s electrical meridians for optimum energy availability and use.\n\nI Feel Good:  Helps increase endorphins and opening one’s heart to love, forgiveness, happiness, joy, positive change and good fortune.\n\nLibido Boost – Male:  Helps increase male desire, arousal, stamina, energy, erotic activation and loving regulation with one’s partner.  Enhances overall life-force.\n\nLibido Boost – Female:  Helps increase female desire, arousal, stamina, energy, erotic activation and loving regulation with one’s partner.  Enhances overall life-force.\n\nDIRECTIONS:  The algorithms are delivered through earphones sub-audibly with the music.  EAR BUDS MUST BE WORN to experience full benefit.  Place finger on screen to start program.  Release finger to stop.  A 3-minute program is recommended.  It is not advised to do more than 6 minutes on any program, as some users may be sensitive to subtle energy effects and feel light-headed.

      "label": "An amazing dog health monitor app that allows you to listen to your dog's heartbeat (using just your iPhone microphone), then record and share with your Vet. Whether it is a Black Labrador or a Daschund,  Snoopy will work with any breed of dog. No Accessories required. Designed to help dog breeds who may be prone to dog heart murmurs.\n\nHowever, we strongly recommend using Airpods or bluetooth headphones for listening to and recording your dog's heartbeat.\n\n\"Yes, it works. Very cool.\" Craig Laws, Beta Tester and his Border Collie, Storm. \n\n\nHELPING DOG HEART MURMURS / CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE (CHF)\nOver 60% of all dogs who are 5 years old or more have a dog heart murmur. Snoopy helps track and monitor your dog's health by regularly recording their heart rate and rhythm. Ideal for those at risk of dog heart murmur.\n\n- Irregular heartbeat or racing pulse\n- Hacking, persistent cough\n- Excessive panting even when resting\n- Lack of energy or appetite\n- Collapsing or fainting\n- Gums and/or tongue are bluish in color\n- Severe water retention\n\nSnoopy allows you to:\n- Listen to, record and share your dog's heartbeat\n- Log data about your dog over time\n- Share data and recordings with your vet for them to check your dog remotely\n\nDeveloped with pet owners like you in mind: A trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record the dog heart beat regularly to share with your vet online - thus saving on expensive trips.\n\nThe quality of the recordings are unrivalled. Snoopy has been extensively tested on various dog breeds of all shapes and sizes from border collies to black labradors and spaniels, including those with congestive heart failure and using cardalis app.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Mike and his dog, Freddie.\n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work on all dog breeds?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the dog's heartbeat sounds and, using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear. It takes time, technique and patience.\n\nThe app will work on all breeds including puppy heart rates! Ideal for owners concerned about their dog's heart health or dogs with CHF (congestive heart failure) or using cardalis.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Snoopy. If you are struggling DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use your phone's internal microphone to attempt to listen to and record your dog's heart rate. We recommend the use of Bluetooth headphones for better sound and generally dog's prefer this but it isn't required to use the app.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Snoopy Dog Heartbeat has been precisely engineered to listen to dog heartbeat sounds, then record and amplify them. \n2. It works best when the dog is lying down and with Airpods or Bluetooth headphones.\n3. Wet your dog's hair around the heart to ensure a good connection with the skin. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room.\n4. Our simple recording management makes it easy.\n5. Take a dog selfie if you wish and share.\n6. Track and monitor your dog's health weekly.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nYou can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email to send over to your vet.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Snoopy to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super-sensitive in the heartbeat range. Snoopy doesn't fake the heartbeat. \n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13, 13 Max, 12, 12 Max, X, Xs, XR, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+. We don't support iPad. Use the device on Airplane mode.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo. Under no circumstances is Snoopy a substitute for veterinary consultation. Please consult a professional for any advice. \n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/snoopydoghealth\n\nDog heart murmurs can be found in all breeds of dog."

Covering over 80 muscles with more than 150 trigger points.\n\nMyofascial trigger points are one of the most common sources of pain, and are often overlooked by health professionals. \n\nThis app strives to help you find the source of pain via intuitive interface: tap the body where your pain is and see which trigger points refer pain to that area. Over 50 distinct pain areas are covered.\n\nYou can also find trigger points by by tapping a muscle on the muscle model, by choosing a muscle from the alphabetized list, or by using the search bar. If you don't know exactly what you're looking for, you can search using keywords such as \"elbow\", which will show the muscles of the elbow as well as any pain areas or conditions related to the elbow (e.g. \"lateral elbow pain\", \"tennis elbow\").\n\nTrigger points can cause or mimic a variety of conditions such as \"Tendinitis\" and \"Tennis Elbow\". More than 40 conditions are covered. Choose a condition and see a list of muscles whose trigger points can cause or mimic that condition.\n\nIn each trigger point illustration, an \"x\" marks the location of the point, while the area of referred pain is colored in blue.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: this app does not include treatment information; its aim is to help find the source of specific pain. Once you've identified a trigger point please consult a massage therapist or otherwise trained professional. There are also myriad self-treatment resources available both in book and video format should you choose to treat yourself.\n\n4520c652df"

      "label": "Focus Builder is optimized for use on an iPad.\n\nEye movements are a very powerful way to exercise the brain and to create long-term change in the brain, known as plasticity.  The “Focus Builder” app contains a variety of exercises which challenge users to voluntarily move their eyes in various patterns, speeds and directions, which have been proven to activate specific parts of the brain depending on which eye movement is performed.\n\nThis app is specifically designed for doctors that specialize in Functional Neurology and their patients.  There is currently no app available that can provide these specific exercises.  For best results, patients should consult a Functional Neurologist to determine how to use this app according to their needs and obtain the most therapeutic value.\n\nThere are 3 types of eye movements that can have profound therapeutic benefits and all three are available in this app.  \n1.Pursuits (slow eye movements):  Smooth pursuit eye movements allow the eyes to closely follow a moving object.  Most people are unable to initiate pursuit without a moving visual signal. The pursuit of targets moving with velocities of greater than 30°/s tend to require catch-up saccades.\n2.Saccades (fast eye movements):  Saccades are quick, simultaneous movements of both eyes in the same direction.  Initiated cortically by the frontal eye fields (FEF), or subcortically by the superior colliculus, saccades serve as a mechanism for fixation, rapid eye movement, and the fast phase of optokinetic nystagmus.\n3.Anti-saccades (look away):  The anti-saccade task has emerged as an important task for investigating the flexible control that we have over behavior. In this task, participants must suppress the reflexive urge to look at a visual target that appears suddenly in the peripheral visual field and must instead look away from the target in the opposite direction. A crucial step involved in performing this task is the top-down inhibition of a reflexive, automatic saccade. Patients diagnosed with various neurological and/or psychiatric disorders that affect the frontal lobes or basal ganglia find it difficult to suppress the automatic pro-saccade, revealing a deficit in top-down inhibition.\n\nThe areas of the brain that are activated by these eye movements are too numerous to list, but to name a few, I have listed some of the functions that can improve with these eye exercises.\n1.Executive function/behavior\n2.Attention\n3.Concentration\n4.Impulse control\n5.Social behavior\n6.Motivation\n7.Goal directed behavior"

      "label": "Anyone who snores at night is usually exhausted and not well rested the next morning. But not only that, the (spouse) partner is also prevented from sleeping because of the noise. \n\nMost of the time you will be confronted with the words: \"I have to fall asleep before you, otherwise you will start snoring and I won't be able to sleep.\" \n\nSnoring can thus become a real test of patience and there are even said to be cases where partners are no longer (able to) sleep in the same room.\n\nAlthough the number of men who snore is higher, there are also many women who snore. Therefore, this problem affects all genders.\n\nThere are several possible remedies on the market. But not all of them deliver what they promise, are expensive or very unwieldy.\n\nThis Anti-Snore-App is an anti-snoring solution that works through a completely \"natural\" concept. \n\nIn the past, did your partner, with a (gentle) nudge, make you change your sleeping position to stop snoring?\n\nThis practice is a common method between many couples in bed to stop the other from snoring. \n\nThis approach often serves its purpose. However, it is usually the case that both are awake at night and then have to fall asleep again. \n\nOur Anti-Snore-App automatically fulfills exactly this purpose without anyone having to wake up for it.  \n\nAfter a short orientation period, our Silent Night app promises you: \n\n- restful and regenerative sleep for everyone involved\n- reduced disturbance of the partner's rest\n- improved oxygen intake due to the shifting of the body\n\nOur app uses state-of-the-art algorithms from the field of machine learning. We use it to evaluate your current sleeping sounds and provide you with unconscious assistance through vibrations. \n\nOf course, your data remains completely recorded on the device and will be deleted immediately after evaluation. This means that not only your restful sleep but also the protection of your data is in the forefront.\n\nLikewise, all processes operate directly on the device, data and radio connections can be independently deactivated by you (recommended!) overnight.\n\n----\nDisclaimer for medical services\n\nThis Anti-Snore-App is not a medical device and is not intended to replace professional medical advice and/or diagnoses. The Anti-Snore-App is not intended to diagnose or treat respiratory failure or other diseases/medical conditions.

In contrast, in a matter of seconds this application will generate results for the following:\n\n1) Acid-Base Status\n2) Individual Ion’s Effect on Base Excess\n3) Apparent Strong Ion Difference\n4) Effective Strong Ion Difference\n5) Strong Ion Gap\n6) Gamblegram\n7) Anion Gap\n8) Corrected Anion Gap\n9) Osmolar Gap\n\n\nThis application improves patient care by enabling the healthcare professional to quickly identify an acid-base disorder and initiate timely therapy directed towards the underlying cause.

      "label": "What is iBP?\n\niBP is a blood pressure tracking and analysis tool. Please note, it is not possible to measure your blood pressure by touching the screen. A separate device is required.\n\nWhat kind of analysis does iBP provide?\n\niBP uses color icons to indicate when your blood pressure values are normal, high, or hypertension. It also provides interactive graphs that allow you to display your values by weeks, months, year and time of day. The graphs display lows, highs, averages, and trend lines using statistical analysis.\n\nWhy iBP vs. other blood pressure apps?\n\niBP is a universal app designed to work on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, which means you only pay for the app once and you get all versions! iBP is the only blood pressure app with a built in transfer capability to sync all your iOS devices.\n\nWhat are the key features?\n\n* Reads and writes Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data (details below)\n* Easy data input using dials instead of keyboard\n* Transfer capability to sync all of your iOS devices\n* Calculates Mean Arterial Pressure and Pulse Pressure\n* Track one personal item (blood glucose, stress level, medication dosage, exercise time)\n* Backup / Restore capability\n* Multiple users\n* Multiple email addresses (you and doctor)\n* Multiple email formats (PDF, HTML, CSV, Plain Text)\n* Passcode to protect your data\n* Touch Id for passcode on devices that support it\n* Snapshot of the graphs can be saved\n* User configurable color ranges\n* Weight units (lb or kg)\n* Withings Blood Pressure Monitor & Wireless Scale\n\nApple Health\niBP is now able to read and write Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data. If your blood pressure monitor (i.e., Omron, iHealth, Withings) adds data to Apple Health then you can easily import that data into this app. If you manually input your data into this app, then it will write that data to Apple Health.\n\nWithings + iBP = No more data entry!\niBP can retrieve your blood pressure and weight data directly from your Withings account.  The Blood Pressure Monitor and wireless Body Scale automatically record and send the data to your account.  There is no data entry required and you can view the data anywhere using a web browser or a variety of mobile apps.\n\n\nDisclaimer: iBP is intended to be used as a means to collect data to be shared with your doctor. This application is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. We assume no liability for any personal harm or injury sustained as a result of using this application."

      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

Click “…More” to learn why you should download this App today!\n\n***** An Essential medical app\n“As a third year, this has become one of my essential apps that is on the homepage of my iPhone. Along with epocrates, eyechart, and imurmur, I use this multiple times a week. It’s comprehensive and simple to navigate! A must buy!”\n- doc someday \n\n***** Ultimate quick and dirty\n“Great for medical students or anyone who might need to brush up on a comprehensive physical exam. Complete with pictures of normals and detailed instructions, you will never go into an OSCE or examine a patient without knowing what to do. Great app!”\n- Rob Kaye \n\nMaybe you’re in medical school with exams coming up. After gallons of coffee and many sleepless nights spent pouring over notes and textbooks, you still wonder if you’re going to make it.\n\nPreparing for a career in medicine requires learning a daunting amount of information and technique. When facing an important test of your knowledge and abilities, like the physical examination of a patient, nerves can derail all of your memorization and confidence, in a hurry.\n\nYou know the material; you just need a little last minute boost and memory jogger to quell the stage fright. That’s where Physical Exam Essentials comes to the rescue. \n\nThis application lets you look up selected terms, view illustrations of physical exam maneuvers, read the Clinical Correlates to discover the significance of certain findings and find descriptions of special tests. Physical Exam Essentials even offers a guide for describing your findings.\n\nPhysical Exam Essentials is not a comprehensive medical reference. Rather, it is a handy overview resource that is perfect for medical students, pre-meds, health professionals and anyone who practices or has an interest in medicine.

That’s not all, though. Just look at some of the other features you get!\n\n* Attractive, easy to navigate interface\n* Look up certain selected terms in Wikipedia, Google, or Google images\n * Pictures in each section help to illustrate physical exam maneuvers\n * Includes \"Clinical Correlates\" which highlight the significance of certain physical exam findings\n * \"Presentation Tips\" included to help you describe your findings \n* Includes descriptions of special tests that are not usually performed in a routine physical exam\n * Content and images added and updated regularly \n\nForget carrying those heavy textbooks everywhere you go. Sometimes, all you need is your iDevice and Physical Exam Essentials.\n\nDownload this amazingly helpful application now. You and your patients will be glad that you did."

      "label": "mnemonic, noun: a short rhyme, phrase, or other mental technique for making information easier to memorize [from Greek mnēmonikos, \"relating to memory\"]. Med Mnemonics is a unique learning tool with over 1900 of them.\n\nMnemonics got me through medical school and the USLME steps.  Wherever you are within the allied health professions - medical school, nursing school, NP school, PA school, residency, and beyond - you can improve your knowledge base in the short and long term with these key associative memory aids.\n\nMedical Mnemonics puts 1796 clever acronyms, rhymes, and memory tricks on your iPhone or iPod Touch, covering topics ranging from Anatomy and Biochemistry to Pharmacology and Surgery.\n\nThe database is fully searchable and can be quickly filtered by discipline and by system. Create a Favorites list, and search and filter it similarly.\n\nThe best mnemonics can be those you make yourself. Add your own mnemonics to the database, where they'll appear seamlessly alongside those which come with the program.  Submit them instantaneously to the Medical Mnemonics server for review by an MD (that's me!) and inclusion in the next version.\n\nYou can email any mnemonic to a colleague from within Medical Mnemonics. He or she can view it within the email or add it to their own copy of Medical Mnemonics with a single click.\n\nUpdates will be free for life and will include new mnemonics submitted by users (that's you!) and added as we all continue learning together.\n\nEvery mnemonic is physician-reviewed, but we're only human. If you find a mistake, email us; we will pay a $5 bounty per substantive mistake found to the first reporter of that mistake!"

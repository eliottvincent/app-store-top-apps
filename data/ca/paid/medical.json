      "label": "Researchers at Monash University have developed the low FODMAP diet and a corresponding app to assist in the management of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The Monash University FODMAP diet works by swapping foods high in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs), with low FODMAP alternatives. Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

Includes an overview of normal swallow function, and links to other educational resources. \n\nAnimations are of adult physiology and include:\n\n• Normal Swallow, Lateral View\n• Normal Swallow, A/P View\n• Example of Penetration with Aspiration\n• Impairment of Anterior Hyoid Excursion\n• Impairment of Bolus Hold \n• Impairment of Bolus Transport\n• Impairment of Epiglottic Movement\n• Impairment of Esophageal Clearance\n• Impairment of Initiation of Pharyngeal Swallow\n• Impairment of Laryngeal Elevation\n• Impairment of Laryngeal Vestibular Closure\n• Impairment of Lip Closure\n• Impairment of Mastication\n• Impairment of PES Opening\n• Impairment of Pharyngeal Contraction\n• Impairment of Pharyngeal Stripping Wave\n• Impairment of Soft Palate Elevation\n• Impairment of Tongue Base Retraction\n\n\nUser Notes: \n\n• Animations depict adult physiology, including normal swallow. \n\n• Animations do not include narration. Visual tool only. \n\n• The animations included in this app accurately represent the anatomy and physiology of normal and impaired swallowing function. They were developed in conjunction with the evidence-based \"Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile,\" or MBSImP.\n\n• Rarely does one physiologic swallow impairment exist alone. This app highlights primary impairments, but co-existing impairments typically occur and the examples shown here are no exception.  \n\n• Available for iPhone and iPad."

In addition, it will also tell you the patient's risk zone using the Bhutani Nomogram.\n\nAllows direct age input and includes the option to calculate age from birth and lab sample times. The app has a direct link to source journal articles, nomograms, and a list of the neurotoxicity risk factors. Supports US and SI units (mg/dL and µmol/L).\n\nApp Feature Summary\n-Calculates phototherapy threshold for newborns 35 weeks and older\n-Displays values on phototherapy nomogram\n-Suggests time frame for followup bilirubin levels based on patient risk zone \n-Direct links to reference journal articles\n\n**********************************\nFrequently Asked Questions\n**********************************\n1. I think the graph is backwards. Why is low risk on top and high risk on bottom?\n\nThe graph is directly from the 2004 AAP Hyperbilirubinemia Guidelines. The degree of \"risk\" refers to the infant's risk for developing neurotoxicity. This is different than the Bhutani Nomogram in which \"risk\" refers to the risk for development of severe hyperbilirubinemia. The threshold for treatment (when a data point lies above one of the lines on the graph) of the infant is different based on the predisposing factors (divided into the three risk categories). Babies who are \"low neurotoxicity risk,\" can tolerate higher levels of bilirubin than a baby with medium or high risk. Therefore, a high risk baby will be treated at lower bilirubin levels than a low risk baby. The graph is correct in having low risk on top since a higher value is needed to pass the threshold for treatment (phototherapy). Please see the graph here for verification as well: http://bit.ly/AppPWU. Please email if you have further questions.\n\n******************************************\nIntended for use by pediatricians, neonatologists, physicians, medical students, and pediatric nurses who treat newborn infants in the hospital and as outpatients.\n\nBiliCalc should be used only as a reference aid. The information contained in the app should not be used as a substitute for the exercise of professional clinical judgement.

HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

The guidelines articles, as published in the Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease, as well as the comprehensive risk estimates, can be accessed through https://www.asccp.org/guidelines.  \n\nThese evidence-based management guidelines, initially developed in 2019, came together through a consensus process of 19 organizations. The updated management guidelines aim to:\n • Allow for a more complete and precise estimation of risk\n • Provide more appropriate intervention for high-risk individuals (detect and treat more precancer)\n • Recommend less intervention for low-risk individuals (decrease testing and treatment that won’t prevent cancer and may cause reproductive harm)\n • Allow for the future addition of new risk modifiers and screening and management technologies\n\nSee https://www.asccp.org/UserGuide for tips on using the app."

We’ve taken all the content from our original Pedi STAT application and carefully selected components that are unique to providers in EMS.  We’ve solicited feedback from leaders in out of hospital care, including paramedics, EMTs, air medical flight crews, and medical directors. We’ve condensed the content to be applicable to those providing care outside the hospital, including first responders, firefighters, EMTs, Paramedics, and Critical Care Transport providers.\n\nMedication dosing and pediatric equipment sizes are easily and rapidly accessed, and accurately calculated based on provider input of either weight, length, age, or Broselow / Pediatape weight estimates.  We are attempting to eliminate medical errors by calculating not only the correct pediatric medication dose, but also the volume to be administered for patient specific conditions.  We have also included algorithms and medical calculators to assist providers in multiple areas, including managing pediatric cardiac arrest, burn size estimation and fluid resuscitation, and Glasgow Coma Scale.\n\nCaring for pediatric patients is associated with a large number of challenges, the most important being selecting the correct equipment and medications, and then dosing the medications correctly.  Our goal is to eliminate these challenges as much as possible, and allow the provider to concentrate on what is most important, the patient.\n\nSuggestions for improvements or additions are always welcome:  Pedi-STAT.com"

Why not be able to choose based on how you are holding the phone and what else you are doing at the same time?\n    • Use the numeric entry pad (0 3 3 0 2 0 0 8) and immediately see the results, OR\n    • Spin the date wheel at the bottom of the screen and tap Next.\n\n 3) Thorough results: All the information you would expect from a classic wheel, plus more:\n   • Estimated Due Date\n   • LMP Date\n   • Conception Date\n   • 1st Trimester End Date\n   • 2nd Trimester End Date\n   • Gestational Age\n   • Conceptional Age\n   • Expected Fetal Length based on standard fetal growth curves\n   • Expected Fetal Weight based on standard fetal growth curves (\"How much does my baby weigh, doctor?\")\n\nResults are relative to 'today' by default; this can be quickly changed to reflect any date by tapping the 'today' button and selecting a new date.\n\n 4) Accurate results: Perfect OB Wheel provides exact dates and accounts for all calendar variance, including leap years. \n\n 5) Persistence: Perfect OB Wheel remembers the date and date type you last used and restores them when launched to streamline your workflow.\n\n 6) Perfect OB Tracker upgrade: Available as an in-app purchase update, the Perfect OB Tracker lets you track any number of pregnancies, with at-a-glance due date and gestational age and one-tap access to all the data Perfect OB Wheel provides.  A  picture and text notes can be kept on each patient. Postpartum tracking is also available. Passcode locking is available for HIPAA compliance."

Over 50 distinct pain areas are covered.\n\nYou can also find trigger points by by tapping a muscle on the muscle model, by choosing a muscle from the alphabetized list, or by using the search bar. If you don't know exactly what you're looking for, you can search using keywords such as \"elbow\", which will show the muscles of the elbow as well as any pain areas or conditions related to the elbow (e.g. \"lateral elbow pain\", \"tennis elbow\").\n\nTrigger points can cause or mimic a variety of conditions such as \"Tendinitis\" and \"Tennis Elbow\". More than 40 conditions are covered. Choose a condition and see a list of muscles whose trigger points can cause or mimic that condition.\n\nIn each trigger point illustration, an \"x\" marks the location of the point, while the area of referred pain is colored in blue.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: this app does not include treatment information; its aim is to help find the source of specific pain. Once you've identified a trigger point please consult a massage therapist or otherwise trained professional.

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

      "label": "* The world's number 1 DAF app is used by thousands of people in over one hundred countries. *\n\nDAF Professional has been created to help people who stammer or have a neurological disease such as Parkinson's Disease. It helps people to slow their rate of speech which makes it clearer to others.\n\nDAF Professional is an easy to use professional speech therapy tool which could make a huge difference to you or someone you know.\n\nDAF Professional has been designed and tested by a certified and practicing Speech and Language Therapist (MSc, PGDip, BAHons, HPC registered and member of RCSLT). DAF Professional delivers incredibly low latency feedback even when running in the background.\n\nDelayed Auditory Feedback (DAF) is a well established speech and language therapy tool which helps people to speak more slowly. However, until recently, devices have been cumbersome to carry around, difficult to adjust, very expensive and therefore not widely used.\n\nDAF was originally developed for people who stammer, but has since been shown to work with people with other speech difficulties, such as those with Parkinson's Disease (Downie et al., 1981; Dagenaise, Outhwood & Lee, 1998; Lowit et al., 2006 and most recentely Lowit et al., 2010).\n\nIt works by enabling someone to hear his or her own speech in an altered manner. This disruption to the normal auditory feedback loop causes the speaker to slow down. Research has shown that DAF will be of benefit to approximately a third of people who have a stammer or Parkinson's. Clinical research has not been carried out as yet on other client groups however DAF may well be of benefit to people with other medical speech conditions.\n\nWhen using Bluetooth devices there is an additional delay of 60ms added to the feedback system.\n\nIf you do use a Bluetooth headset you may find you need to turn the bluetooth device on after opening the app to enable it.\n\nDAF Professional works when put in the background or the screen is turned off. Like all apps of this type, it can NOT work during phone calls or with other media apps playing at the same time.\n\nIf you wish to provide any feedback we would be delighted to hear from you. Please email us at support@speechtools.co.\n\nOur lead Speech and Language Therapist is Samantha Brady who qualified as a Speech and Language Therapist in 2001 (PGDip, City University) and gained her Masters in Speech and Language Therapy in 2006 (MSc, City University). She has a wealth of experience of working as a Speech and Language Therapist in a variety of settings and her area of clinical expertise is adult neurology and voice. Samantha is a member of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT), HPC Registered (SL10250) and Lee Silverman Voice Treatment Certified (LSVT).\n\nDAF Professional is fully GDPR compliant and will not collect any of your data without first asking for your consent."

Having trouble explaining the exact course of the fever to the pediatrician? Keep track of body temperatures and medication for your whole family with Feevy.\n\n\nTEMPERATURE, MEDICATION AND NOTES\nWith Feevy you can not only record temperature measurements, but also track medications and enter text notes. This way, you can verify if medication was effective and capture additional information, e.g. regarding the patient’s condition. Be perfectly prepared for your next visit to the doctor!\n\nBEAUTIFUL CHARTS\nEntering data is worthless if you can’t analyze it later. Feevy comes with a beautiful and very detailed interactive chart, which makes it easy to get a quick overview, as well as to analyze temperature curves in more detail. You can freely zoom and pan it to see all the details you need.\n\nPRINT AND SHARE YOUR DATA\nOf course you can also print and export your data. This way you can bring your fever curve with you to the doctor or even send it via e-mail. The PDF contains all measurements, medications and notes, as well as a full-page chart showing the temperature curve.\n\nTRACK MULTIPLE PEOPLE\nFeevy lets you track the fever curves for multiple people. It is perfect for keeping track of your children's conditions and illnesses. To represent your family with some personality, Feevy comes with a set of cute profile icons to choose from.\n\nSYNC WITH FAMILY MEMBERS\nEspecially if you use Feevy to track your kids' illnesses, you will appreciate its sync functionality. No matter who measures the temperature or administers medication, both parents will always see the same data on their devices.\n\nUNIVERSAL APP\nFeevy supports both iPhone and iPad, including iPad multitasking (Slide Over and Split View). Use your iPhone while on the go or to quickly enter a new measurement, and use the iPad to have a detailed look at the charts.\n\n\nFeedback is always welcome: feedback@feevyapp.com or via Twitter @feevyapp.\n\n\nIMPORTANT\nIn case of fever and sickness, please always consult your doctor. Using this app to track body temperature and symptoms is not a substitute for a visit to the doctor!\n\nOF COURSE YOU CANNOT MEASURE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE WITH THIS APP! You can only record, visualize and archive the measurements obtained with a fever thermometer."

It helps patients receive the care and measures your acuity and volume against other facilities with reliability.  The CTAS is used in many countries around the world for setting patient priority.\n\nThe Canadian Triage & Acuity Scale (CTAS) is a tool that enables Emergency Departments (ED) to:\n\n•Prioritize patient care requirements\n•Examine patient care processes, workload, and resource requirements relative to case mix and community needs\n\nThe CTAS allows ED nurses and physicians to:\n•Triage patients according the type and severity of their presenting signs and symptoms\n•Ensure that the sickest patients are seen first when ED capacity has been exceeded due to visit rates or reduced access to other services\n•Ensure that a patient's need for care is reassessed while in the ED\n\nThe CTAS allows ED managers to:\n•Measure the case mix (volume and acuity) of patients who visit the ED\n•Determine whether the ED has an operational plan and the resources to meet patient needs\n•Assess the ED's role within the hospital and health care region\n\nThe triage level assigned using the CTAS criteria is a mandatory data element to be used in all Canadian Hospital Emergency Departments for reporting to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI).\n\nTraining in the use of the CTAS in the clinical context is recommended before using this application to assist in clinical decision-making."

The video includes an overview of relevant cardiac anatomy, a step by step presentation of all Transducer Positions, and the sequential transducer movements to acquire standard echo images needed to complete a Transthoracic Echocardiographic Study.\n\nThe cardiac anatomy section visualizes relationships of the heart, ribs, axis of the heart, planes of the heart and aorta, chambers, valves and annuli, and blood flow through the heart.\n\nThe transducer position menu allows the user to view the anatomical landmarks and the transducer positions for left parasternal, apical, subcostal, suprasternal and right parasternal image acquisition.\n\nThe views and imaging menu allows the user to navigate from a particular transducer position menu, such as left parasternal long to specific images acquired within that window, such as PLAX high depth, PLAX low depth, and PLAX Zoom of the Aortic and Mitral Valves. Each animated loop shows a finder image in the upper left that depicts the transducer position, an illustration of the sectional anatomy of the heart on the left, and the echo image with labels on the right."

The model is based on data derived from women found to have at least one adnexal tumor that was judged not to be physiological, underwent a standardized ultrasound examination, and was later selected for surgery. \n\nThe ADNEX model contains nine predictors: age, serum CA-125 (U/ml), type of center (oncology vs other), maximum lesion diameter, proportion of solid tissue, number of papillary projections, the presence of >10 cyst locules, acoustic shadows, and ascites. An oncology center is defined as a tertiary referral center with a specific gynecological oncological unit. \n\nThe model was developed by clinicians and statisticians from the International Ovarian Tumour Analysis (IOTA) group, and is based on clinical and ultrasound data from almost 6000 women recruited at 24 centers in 10 countries (Italy, Belgium, Sweden, Czech Republic, Poland, France, UK, China, Spain, and Canada).\n\nA full description of model development and validation is given in Van Calster B, Van Hoorde K, Valentin L, Testa AC, Fischerova D, Van Holsbeke C, Savelli L, Franchi D, Epstein E, Kaijser J, Van Belle V, Czekierdowski A, Guerriero S, Fruscio R, Lanzani C, Scala F, Bourne T, Timmerman D.

      "label": "MediSOS is a medical emergency siren for iPhone & Apple Watch - you never know when you might need it.\n\nIf you get into difficulty and need to attract nearby attention in the event of a medical emergency, you can rely on MediSOS to be there to inform first responders about your medical details. Using the iPhone or Apple Watch app, you can start the medical emergency siren which will then allow first responders to view your medical conditions, medication, general details and much more. The siren can even be started from a Widget or Apple Watch Complication for quick access.\n\n\nMediSOS contains these great features:\n\nMEDICAL SIREN\n\nActivate the MediSOS emergency siren if you find yourself in a medical emergency and need to attract the attention of people nearby so you can get help. The siren can be activated by pressing the big SOS button in the app or via the Widget and Apple Watch Complication. To prevent accidentally activating the alarm, there is a 5-second countdown before the siren activates. The siren can be stopped when viewing the medical ID when first responders get to you.\n\n\nMEDICAL ID\n\nMediSOS has been designed for your iPhone and Apple Watch so all of your medical details are within easy reach. You’ll be able to view personal details, medical conditions, allergies & reactions, medication and emergency contacts from the alarm screen.\n\n\nAPPLE WATCH\n\nIf you find yourself in a situation where your iPhone is not within easy reach, you can use the Apple Watch app to activate the siren which will play on the Apple Watch speaker.\n\n\nWIDGETS\n\nFrom your Home Screen or Lock Screen, you can use the Widget to activate the medical emergency siren.\n\n\nEMERGENCY CONTACTS\n\nIf you’ve chosen to add emergency contacts to the app, you’ll be able to call them with just a tap from the alarm screen in the app.\n\n\nCUSTOMIZATION\n\nMediSOS supports the ability to choose from one of four siren sounds, all of which are great at attracting attention when you need it most.\n\n\nSTORED SECURELY\n\nAll medical ID data is stored securely on your own private iCloud account using the secure Keychain functionality. No data ever leaves your device.\n\n\nSYNC\n\nMediSOS was designed to work with the MediWidget and MediWear apps so you’re able to enter your medical ID once and use it everywhere. Syncing is done automatically through the shared Keychain and enables you to pick and choose which medical ID apps you’d like from the MediApps bundle.\n\nYou can find out more about these apps here:\n\nMediWidget: https://apps.apple.com/app/id1078072349\n\nMediWear: https://apps.apple.com/app/id1080197914\n\nMediApps Bundle: https://apps.apple.com/app-bundle/id1081291209\n\n\nGet in contact:\n\nEmail: support@adamfoot.dev\nTwitter: @adamfootdev\nWebsite: https://adamfoot.dev\n\n\nPlease note, an Apple Watch is required for some functionality of this app."

      "label": "Objective measurement of respiratory function is of primary importance in the assessment of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. However, the interpretation of respiratory function tests, especially spirometry tests, is considered suboptimal in primary care.\r\n\r\nA team from the Quebec Heart and Lung Institute affiliated with Laval University (IUCPQ-UL) developed an interactive mobile application called SPIRO© to facilitate the interpretation of spirometry tests.\r\n\r\nThe SPIRO© app guides healthcare professionals and medical students in interpreting spirometry tests by entering basic data from a spirometry report (FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC). The software gives a diagnostic suggestion to the user based on pre-set intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being a resource for educational material (explanatory video, questionnaires, documents related to respiratory health guidelines), the SPIRO© application guides the user in applying the guidelines in respiratory health by providing the necessary references (scientific articles, respiratory health guidelines) to develop a treatment plan.\r\n\r\nThe app allows:\r\n- Optimizing interpretation of spirometry;\r\n- Obtaining a diagnostic suggestion;\r\n- Obtaining a treatment suggestion according to respiratory guidelines;\r\n- Getting quick access to respiratory health guidelines;\r\n- Facilitating the work of health professionals;\r\n- Carrying out better follow-up of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma;\r\n- Obtaining continuing education through specific and relevant educational material. \r\n\r\nThis tool was developed by the Chair in Knowledge Translation, Education and Prevention in Respiratory and Cardiovascular Health affiliated with Laval University in collaboration with the IUCPQ-UL."

A separate device is required.\n\nWhat kind of analysis does iBP provide?\n\niBP uses color icons to indicate when your blood pressure values are normal, high, or hypertension. It also provides interactive graphs that allow you to display your values by weeks, months, year and time of day. The graphs display lows, highs, averages, and trend lines using statistical analysis.\n\nWhy iBP vs. other blood pressure apps?\n\niBP is a universal app designed to work on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, which means you only pay for the app once and you get all versions! iBP is the only blood pressure app with a built in transfer capability to sync all your iOS devices.\n\nWhat are the key features?\n\n* Reads and writes Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data (details below)\n* Easy data input using dials instead of keyboard\n* Transfer capability to sync all of your iOS devices\n* Calculates Mean Arterial Pressure and Pulse Pressure\n* Track one personal item (blood glucose, stress level, medication dosage, exercise time)\n* Backup / Restore capability\n* Multiple users\n* Multiple email addresses (you and doctor)\n* Multiple email formats (PDF, HTML, CSV, Plain Text)\n* Passcode to protect your data\n* Touch Id for passcode on devices that support it\n* Snapshot of the graphs can be saved\n* User configurable color ranges\n* Weight units (lb or kg)\n* Withings Blood Pressure Monitor & Wireless Scale\n\nApple Health\niBP is now able to read and write Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data. If your blood pressure monitor (i.e., Omron, iHealth, Withings) adds data to Apple Health then you can easily import that data into this app. If you manually input your data into this app, then it will write that data to Apple Health.\n\nWithings + iBP = No more data entry!\niBP can retrieve your blood pressure and weight data directly from your Withings account.  The Blood Pressure Monitor and wireless Body Scale automatically record and send the data to your account.  There is no data entry required and you can view the data anywhere using a web browser or a variety of mobile apps.\n\n\nDisclaimer: iBP is intended to be used as a means to collect data to be shared with your doctor. This application is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. We assume no liability for any personal harm or injury sustained as a result of using this application."

      "label": "\"The middle jiao and food has always been of central importance in the Chinese quest for health.  Hopefully all practitioners realise the potential of this area and view the legacy of traditional information available from China with respect and awe; this app is a good avenue to access some of this information.\"\n\nPeter Torssell\nJournal of Chinese Medicine\nFebruary 2014\n\n\"People who practice medicine must first thoroughly understand the source of the disorder and know what has been violated. Then, use food to treat it, and if food will not cure it, afterwards apply herbal medicine.\"\n\nSun Simiao (Tang Dynasty)\n\n\nThe Chinese Nutritional Strategies (CNS) app is a tool designed to allow practitioners of Chinese medicine convenient and complete access to centuries of nutritional insights. \n\nThe heart of the CNS app is the database of more than 300 common foods, along with their temperature, flavor, actions, indications, notes, seasonal recommendations, and differential diagnosis categories. The database is searchable by any of these criteria and sorting through it allows the practitioner to compile a list of recommended foods, and then share those recommendations via email or as a hard copy with the patient.\n\nIn addition, all aspects of the database may be altered by the practitioner. For example, this is the data set for watermelon:\n\n=======\n\nTemperature: Cold\nFlavor: Sweet\n\nActions: Enters the heart, stomach and urinary bladder channels, clears heat from heart, stomach and urinary bladder, relieves summer heat, augments yin fluids, drains damp, moistens the intestines\n\nIndications: Thirst, mouth sores, palpitations, overheated during the summer with inability to urinate, edema\n\nNotes: \"Nature's Bai Hu Tang\" - Chinese medical saying\n\nWood (Spring): Avoid\nFire (Summer): Moderation\nEarth (Late Summer): Seek out\nMetal (Fall): Seek out\nWater (Winter): Avoid\n\nLu Qi Deficiency: Contraindicated\nKid Yang Deficiency: Contraindicated\nUrinary Bladder Damp Cold: Contraindicated \nUrinary Bladder Damp Heat: Indicated\nHeart Yang Deficiency: Contraindicated\nHeart Fire: Indicated\nSpleen Qi Deficiency: Contraindicated\nSpleen Yang Deficiency: Contraindicated\nStomach Fire: Indicated\nStomach Qi Deficiency with Cold: Contraindicated\nStomach Food Stagnation: Contraindicated\n\n=======\n\nAny of the above characteristics may be altered and saved to the database. For example, the Chinese dietary tradition that you follow may consider watermelon to have a neutral temperature and be indicated for cough. Simply change these characteristics in the database and any future searches for neutral temperature foods or cough will include watermelon in the results.\n\nAn especially unique feature for the CNS app is the seasonal recommendations feature which addresses the \"When\" of prescribing Chinese nutrition. Again using the watermelon example, if the practitioner diagnoses urinary bladder damp heat and has the seasonal recommendation feature switched on in the winter then watermelon will be moved from the seek out to the avoid category. This seasonal recommendation feature allows the practitioner to emphasize the local climate and growing seasons when dispensing dietary advice.\n\nCompiled, edited, and translated by Toby Daly, PhD, LAc. Toby Daly received his undergraduate degree in Food Science from the California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo. He began studying Chinese medicine in 1997 with Sunim Doam a Korean monk trained in the Saam tradition. He earned his master’s degree in Traditional Chinese Medicine in 2001 upon completion of Chinese medical training in San Francisco as well as China. During his four years of training in San Francisco, he interned with the prominent San Francisco acupuncturist Dr. Angela Wu famous for her treatment of infertility with Chinese medicine. He has recently completed his PhD in Classical Chinese Medicine under the guidance of 88th generation Daoist priest Jeffery Yuen."

      "label": "SRR Counter for Dogs and Cats\n\nCount your pet’s heart rate while they are sleeping. It is a must have if your dog or cat has a heart condition and your vet recommends you track their heart rate on a regular basis.\n\nEASY TO USE\n\nWith the SRR Counter for Dogs and Cats app, you can easily count your pet’s breathing rate for 15 seconds, 30 seconds or 60 seconds. When your pet exhales, tap the Breath button to start the timer. Continue to tap the Breath button each time your pet exhales. Once complete, the number of breaths will display.\n\nCALCULATIONS\n– If you select 15 Seconds, the app will calculate each time you tap times 4.\n\n– If you select 30 Seconds, the app will calculate each time you tap times 2.\n\n– If you select 60 Seconds, the app will display the number of times you tap.\n\nFEATURES\n– The Apple Watch will provide haptic feedback with each tap. This allows you to watch your pet breathing, rather than your watch.\n\n– You will receive a haptic notification when the timer is finished and be presented with the total breath count.\n\n– No audible feedback so you won’t disturb your precious pet at rest! Please set the Apple Watch to silent to fully utilize this feature.\n\nMY STORY\n\nI created this app when my rescue dog, Bizou, went into heart failure at age 13 and was diagnosed with a grade 5 heart murmur. She was on several medications and my vet recommended I begin tracking her breathing to help them in regulating the dosages of her medications. I found it difficult for just 1 person to watch her breathing while also watching a timer to know when to stop counting. My goal was to make this much easier.\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nContact your veterinarian for normal and elevated heart rates for both cats and dogs. If your pet has an elevated heart rate or you have any concerns about his or her health, please immediately contact your vet.\n\nFEEDBACK\n\nPlease send your feedback to support@verkadesg.com. I would love to implement new features based on your ideas!\n\nSee more information at www.verkadesg.com\n\nAll proceeds go to the Humane Society of York County http://humanesocietyofyorkcounty.org"

Just download this app.\n\n\nDo not mistake this app for other color blind apps. Color De Blind not only shows you what it is like to be color blind, but it also modifies live video to help color blind people see the real world in ways they haven't before.\n\n\nColor De Blind harnesses the graphics processor within your cell phone to run advanced color manipulation algorithms. These algorithms have existed on computers for some time, but have had limited utility to color blind people in the real world. Now, Color De Blind allows you to go anywhere your iPhone can go while experiencing colors in live, full-motion video.\n\n\nRunning these algorithms is no easy task, but finally the iPhone is able to make sense of a colorful, yet confusing environment. For every pixel your camera can see, the algorithms have to do 30 to 40 advanced algebraic problems. Just imagine taking 40 math tests for each one of the millions of pixels from your camera. Then imagine that Color De Blind is doing all those tests 30 times per second to show you a live video. \n\n\n\"This app will change the lives of color blind people in ways that no medical advancement has ever been able to. It's convenient, practical, and more importantly, useful to people who had previously been unable to distinguish between various colors. Aside from it's medical implications, it's also really helpful in showing people who are not color blind how debilitating and frustrating the condition can be.\" -Samantha Harris, M.D. \n\n\n\"Holy crap.

      "label": "Anyone who snores at night is usually exhausted and not well rested the next morning. But not only that, the (spouse) partner is also prevented from sleeping because of the noise. \n\nMost of the time you will be confronted with the words: \"I have to fall asleep before you, otherwise you will start snoring and I won't be able to sleep.\" \n\nSnoring can thus become a real test of patience and there are even said to be cases where partners are no longer (able to) sleep in the same room.\n\nAlthough the number of men who snore is higher, there are also many women who snore. Therefore, this problem affects all genders.\n\nThere are several possible remedies on the market. But not all of them deliver what they promise, are expensive or very unwieldy.\n\nThis Anti-Snore-App is an anti-snoring solution that works through a completely \"natural\" concept. \n\nIn the past, did your partner, with a (gentle) nudge, make you change your sleeping position to stop snoring?\n\nThis practice is a common method between many couples in bed to stop the other from snoring. \n\nThis approach often serves its purpose. However, it is usually the case that both are awake at night and then have to fall asleep again. \n\nOur Anti-Snore-App automatically fulfills exactly this purpose without anyone having to wake up for it.  \n\nAfter a short orientation period, our Silent Night app promises you: \n\n- restful and regenerative sleep for everyone involved\n- reduced disturbance of the partner's rest\n- improved oxygen intake due to the shifting of the body\n\nOur app uses state-of-the-art algorithms from the field of machine learning. We use it to evaluate your current sleeping sounds and provide you with unconscious assistance through vibrations. \n\nOf course, your data remains completely recorded on the device and will be deleted immediately after evaluation. This means that not only your restful sleep but also the protection of your data is in the forefront.\n\nLikewise, all processes operate directly on the device, data and radio connections can be independently deactivated by you (recommended!) overnight.\n\n----\nDisclaimer for medical services\n\nThis Anti-Snore-App is not a medical device and is not intended to replace professional medical advice and/or diagnoses. The Anti-Snore-App is not intended to diagnose or treat respiratory failure or other diseases/medical conditions. Please consult a licensed physician before making any decisions or taking any actions that may affect your health, safety and well-being. Do not ignore professional advice based on things you have seen, heard or read on the app, website or social media. Always consult a healthcare professional if you have questions or concerns about your snoring or overall health."

Running timers started on one device can be stopped from another device too enabling you to easily share tracking.\n\nAT-A-GLANCE BABY STATUS\nAt the top of the screen you’ll quickly see when your baby last fed, slept and was changed or go to the log screen for detailed history.\n\nFURTHER DETAILS:\n\n+ Nursing - pause or switch sides with a single tap. See which side you last fed on.\n+ Bottle - record amount as well as time feeding, and if it’s formula or EBM. \n+ Pumping - record amounts and time for each side, or just record totals if you prefer\n+ Sleep - record time, and easily adjust start and end-times as you need\n+ Diaper - record wet, dirty or both\n+ Night mode provides a low-contrast background and can be easily switched on or off\n+ Simultaneous timer support  - e.g. sleep and feeding - we know both can happen at once!\n+ Manually add activities later if you forgot, or edit existing ones even if they’re running - e.g. if you forgot to start the sleep timer when putting baby down, just start the timer and adjust the start time earlier and the timer will automatically update. \n+ Add notes to activities, for example where you fed or whether baby was settled. You can even add notes while the timer is running  - you don’t need to wait for it to finish.\n+ Statistics - detailed stats including totals, averages per day, average length and interval. For nursing there is a breakdown for left and right sides, and for diapers a wet and dirty breakdown.\n+ Switch activities on or off so your interface isn’t cluttered with activities you don’t use\n+ Support for tracking twins or for your other little ones all from the one app. You can switch babies with a single swipe.\n+ Supports optimal layout for iPhone4s through to iPhone 7 Plus \n+ Data backed up automatically and securely   \n+ Get a full CSV export activities by contacting support\n+ Responsive and caring support -  we really want you to help you\n+ It’s all there - no extra purchases required to unlock features\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions we would love to hear from you - please contact us at help@babytimeapp.com or visit our community at http://help.babytimeapp.com.\n \nDownload BabyTime now for a completely new baby tracking experience."

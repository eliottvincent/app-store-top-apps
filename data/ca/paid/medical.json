The Monash University FODMAP diet works by swapping foods high in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs), with low FODMAP alternatives. Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

At that time, the treating team is away and you're on call, running all over the hospital.  \n\nMD on Call gives you tips on how to QUICKLY assess and manage (acutely) common problems so you can go on assessing the next patient, or to your room to get some well deserved sleep.  -- it is NOT meant to replace a textbook --\n \n\n\nFEATURES\nMD on call is divided into 5 main sections:\n\n• Issues •  26 frequent on call situations (including management of some specific conditions)\n\nAbdominal Pain*\nAcute Coronary Syndrome*\nAgitation / Violence\nAnaphylaxis\nBleeding\nBradycardia*\nChest Pain\nConstipation\nDeath (Pronouncing)\nDecreased LOC\nDysuria / UTI*\nDyspnea\nFever\nFebrile neutropenia\nHeadache\nHypertension\nHypotension\nInsomnia\nMeningitis\nNausea / Vomiting\nPain\nPalliation\nPneumonia\nSeizure\nTachycardia\nWound Dehiscence\nWound Infection\n\n• Labs •  Common electrolytes abnormalities (including management)\n\nHypo Ca, K, Mg, Na, PO4, glycemia\nHyper Ca, K, Na, glycemia\n\n• ECG •  Normal and abnormal ECG values, now with examples\n\n• Misc •  Suggestions on how to write orders for admission, \"comfort measures only\", \"on call\" notes, OR and procedure notes.  \nTransfusions:  general information and common reactions\nMisc:  CSF values, opioid conversion...\n\n• Lines and Tubes • How to manage common problems, such as a blocked NG tube.\n\n• Search •  Search using acronyms or keywords\n\n\n****************\n\nFeedback is more than welcome :  visit the website for more details\n\n**************** \n\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThis publication (application) is to be used as a guide only.

      "label": "Meet Freya, your virtual birth partner from The Positive Birth Company! Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth.

The guidelines articles, as published in the Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease, as well as the comprehensive risk estimates, can be accessed through https://www.asccp.org/guidelines.  \n\nThese evidence-based management guidelines, initially developed in 2019, came together through a consensus process of 19 organizations. The updated management guidelines aim to:\n • Allow for a more complete and precise estimation of risk\n • Provide more appropriate intervention for high-risk individuals (detect and treat more precancer)\n • Recommend less intervention for low-risk individuals (decrease testing and treatment that won’t prevent cancer and may cause reproductive harm)\n • Allow for the future addition of new risk modifiers and screening and management technologies\n\nSee https://www.asccp.org/UserGuide for tips on using the app."

Based on extensive literature review, Ortho Traumapedia compiles the current standard of care in a high-yield, easy to use format including dozens of original images to help visualize fracture patterns and radiologic findings. \n\nOriginally developed by orthopedic surgeons for orthopedic surgeons, practitioners of all levels and specialties who encounter adult skeletal trauma will find Ortho Traumapedia useful as a condensed reference and educational tool. Whether you’re a primary care or emergency physician, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, resident or medical student, Ortho Traumapedia provides highly pertinent information regarding skeletal trauma right at your fingertips. \n\nOrtho Traumapedia is organized into chapters by bone (for fractures) and joint (for dislocations). Each chapter is divided into four sections: Facts, Imaging, Classification and Treatment: \n\nFacts begins with epidemiology and common injury mechanisms. This is followed by an outline of pertinent anatomy, eponyms and variants. Finally, patient presentation, examination and management tips are presented. \n\nImaging begins with the standard radiographic examinations for each anatomic region. This is followed by injury-specific views, relevant metrics and findings as well as supplemental modalities. \n\nClassification outlines the most common classification systems used to describe the selected injury. \n\nTreatment begins with general treatment principles and reviews treatment in the acute setting. This is followed by standard of care options grouped by injury pattern. Common complications associated with the injury are included at the end of this section. \n\nSimply select the bone or joint you’re interested in from the main menu and navigate between the four sections with the buttons on the bottom of the screen. Return to the main menu by pressing the left arrow in the title bar. There's never been a simpler, more mobile skeletal trauma reference!"

It helps patients receive the care and measures your acuity and volume against other facilities with reliability.  The CTAS is used in many countries around the world for setting patient priority.\n\nThe Canadian Triage & Acuity Scale (CTAS) is a tool that enables Emergency Departments (ED) to:\n\n•Prioritize patient care requirements\n•Examine patient care processes, workload, and resource requirements relative to case mix and community needs\n\nThe CTAS allows ED nurses and physicians to:\n•Triage patients according the type and severity of their presenting signs and symptoms\n•Ensure that the sickest patients are seen first when ED capacity has been exceeded due to visit rates or reduced access to other services\n•Ensure that a patient's need for care is reassessed while in the ED\n\nThe CTAS allows ED managers to:\n•Measure the case mix (volume and acuity) of patients who visit the ED\n•Determine whether the ED has an operational plan and the resources to meet patient needs\n•Assess the ED's role within the hospital and health care region\n\nThe triage level assigned using the CTAS criteria is a mandatory data element to be used in all Canadian Hospital Emergency Departments for reporting to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI).\n\nTraining in the use of the CTAS in the clinical context is recommended before using this application to assist in clinical decision-making."

      "label": "Simple, fast, yet more thorough than any other pregnancy wheel available for the iPhone, Perfect OB Wheel is better than just a replacement for your trusty paper wheel.\n\nHere's why Perfect OB Wheel is your best choice of gestational calculator:\n\n 1) Input flexibility: Start with one of:\n    • Last menstrual period (LMP)\n    • Conception date\n    • Estimated date of confinement/delivery (EDC)\n    • Ultrasound dating: Number of weeks and days gestation as of a given date (\"X Weeks\").\n\n 2) Input speed: Other wheels for the iPhone make you conform to them for entering your patient's information. Why not be able to choose based on how you are holding the phone and what else you are doing at the same time?\n    • Use the numeric entry pad (0 3 3 0 2 0 0 8) and immediately see the results, OR\n    • Spin the date wheel at the bottom of the screen and tap Next.\n\n 3) Thorough results: All the information you would expect from a classic wheel, plus more:\n   • Estimated Due Date\n   • LMP Date\n   • Conception Date\n   • 1st Trimester End Date\n   • 2nd Trimester End Date\n   • Gestational Age\n   • Conceptional Age\n   • Expected Fetal Length based on standard fetal growth curves\n   • Expected Fetal Weight based on standard fetal growth curves (\"How much does my baby weigh, doctor?\")\n\nResults are relative to 'today' by default; this can be quickly changed to reflect any date by tapping the 'today' button and selecting a new date.\n\n 4) Accurate results: Perfect OB Wheel provides exact dates and accounts for all calendar variance, including leap years. \n\n 5) Persistence: Perfect OB Wheel remembers the date and date type you last used and restores them when launched to streamline your workflow.\n\n 6) Perfect OB Tracker upgrade: Available as an in-app purchase update, the Perfect OB Tracker lets you track any number of pregnancies, with at-a-glance due date and gestational age and one-tap access to all the data Perfect OB Wheel provides.  A  picture and text notes can be kept on each patient. Postpartum tracking is also available. Passcode locking is available for HIPAA compliance."

D’autres options thérapeutiques peuvent être efficaces et ne sont pas nécessairement mentionnées dans cette application.\n\nL’équipe de production désire toutefois mettre en garde tout médecin de conserver un jugement critique et de ne pas hésiter de consulter un collègue expert pour toute situation clinique ou thérapeutique avec laquelle il ne sent pas à l’aise.\n\nNous vous rappelons également que tout médecin est responsable de l’acte qu’il pose et par conséquent, il doit utiliser cette application à titre indicatif seulement."

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

Particularly so in Emergencies. This app contains ECGs of all types of cardiac arrhythmias for immediate reference. To avoid confusion all the ECGs are taken from rhythm strip (lead II), as we look for rhythm only in these ECGs. If you have any issues, please notify me to the mail id provided.\n\nThis app is intended for medics who already have some basic knowledge about ECG and its terminology. Its main purpose is to provide reference ECGs of arrhythmias in emergency situation or rapid revision of the topic for those preparing for exams. Do not expect detailed explanation for the ECGs. There are totally 46 ECGs related to conduction abnormalities.\n\nHope this app will be helpful to you. And please do leave a rating in the store!   \n\nNote: The app looks better in landscape. Keep your mobile in autorotation mode."

      "label": "The VBAC Calculator is a convenient tool for predicting  the success rate of a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC). The app consists of 3 calculators which use patient-specific data in order to generate a predictive score.\n\nThe \"Standard\" calculator uses the widely-used predictive model published in Grobman, William A., et al., “Development of a nomogram for prediction of vaginal birth after cesarean delivery,” Obstetrics & Gynecology, volume 109(4), pp. 806-812, 2007. This predictive model uses pre-pregnancy BMI and prior medical history to predict VBAC success rates. It can be used at any time during the term of pregnancy during a clinical visit.\n\nThe \"Standard + Admission Factors\" calculator is a variant of the 2007 Grobman prediction method as found in the following publication: Grobman William A., et al., “Does information available at the time of admission for delivery improve prediction of successful birth after cesarean?” American Journal of Perinatology, volume 26(10), pp.693-701, 2009. This model uses additional information at time of hospital admission to predict VBAC success rates.\n\nLastly, the \"Simple\" calculator also uses information at time of admission (same as the \"Standard + Admissions Factors\" calculator). The source for this predictive calculator is: Metz, Tori D., et al., “Simple, validated vaginal birth after cesarean delivery prediction model for use at the time of admission,” Obstetrics & Gynecology, volume 122(3), pp.571-578, 2013. This is a straight-forward prediction method that combines BMI and age information with the well-known Bishop Score calculation to determine VBAC success.\n\nPlease note that is app is provided solely for educational purposes and should not be used in lieu of sound, professional medical guidance."

      "label": "****Thank you for making us a TOP 25 App in US, UK and Canada App Store category specific rankings!****\n\nSeasonal affective disorder, or SAD, is a kind of depression that appears at certain times of the year. Light therapy is one of the potential treatments for this condition. Almost 80% of the people who try light therapy find it beneficial. This app converts your apple device into a light box.\n\nWhy you SHOULD NOT download this App:\n1. If you are looking for a SAD Light Box App that generates an intensity of 10,000 Lux\n2. If you are looking for a quick fix and can not commit to consistent morning exposure sessions for at least 2 weeks\n3. If you will get turned off by the simplicity of this app and the solution to Seasonal Affective Disorder\n\nWhy you SHOULD download this App:\n1. If you want to try a cheap yet effective alternative to a traditional Light box which uses lower intensity BLUE LIGHT (approx. 100 to 575 Lux) and is backed by research (Google research paper: The effects of low-intensity narrow-band blue-light treatment compared to bright white-light treatment in sub-syndromal seasonal affective disorder by NCBI, US National Library of Medicine)\n2. If you would rather be intelligent and try something for a fiver rather than spend a few hundred dollars on a conventional light box\n3. If you are able to consistently commit to regular morning exposure sessions for at least 2 weeks \n4. If you would be happy with a REALLY SIMPLE APP that transforms your Apple device into a Light box and is more portable and user friendly\n5. If the weather is making you sad :( and you would rather be happy :)\n     \nThis app can also help you:\n1. Determine if you are suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)/ Cabin Fever/ Winter Blues/ Seasonal Depression with help of a short scored test\n2. Create your own unique shade of Blue / White / any other color light that works best for you\n3. Use the app as a Dawn Simulator (set alarm)\n4. Set timer for your light box to time your morning exposure sessions\n5. Shop for other products to help with SAD\n6. Listen to the Radio in the background\n\nUV Rating: The UV emission from your Apple Device is 0, hence this app does not have a UV rating. \n\nSome other activities you might want to try to deal with symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder are:\n• End your morning shower with a cold shower\n• Try to arrange the spaces you spend time in to maximize sunlight exposure\n• Keep curtains open during the day\n• Trim tree branches or hedges that may be blocking some of the light from getting into your home\n• Move furniture so that you sit near a window or, if you exercise indoors, set up your exercise equipment by a window\n• Install skylights and add lamps\n• Build physical activity into your lifestyle preferably before SAD symptoms take hold. Physical activity relieves stress, builds energy and increases both your physical and mental well-being and resilience\n• Make a habit of taking a daily noon-hour walk, particularly if you commute to school or work in the dark hours of the day\n• Meditate at least 20 min a day (focus on your breathing)\n• Try High intensity training if you are fit enough and have less time\n• Maintain good sleep hygiene\n• When all else fails, try a winter vacation in sunny climates—if the pocket and work schedule allow. Keep in mind that the symptoms will recur after you return home\n\nREFUND POLICY: If you consistently use the App for 14 days and show us that you genuinely tried but did not get any results, WE WILL REFUND 100% OF YOUR MONEY. *Subject to terms and conditions of Apple Inc. and the Apple App Store.\n\nSmile, because somewhere far away, we are cheering for you :)\n\n*THIS APP MUST NOT BE USED TO SUBSTITUTE ANY MEDICATION/ MEDICAL DEVICE. THE CREATORS/ PUBLISHERS OF THIS APP WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE RESULTING AS A USE OF THIS APP. PLEASE CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES. NO PART OF THIS DESCRIPTION OR APP MUST BE CONSIDERED AS MEDICAL ADVICE*"

CARMA is an invaluable, portable tool for healthcare professionals in the resuscitation of patients experiencing cardiopulmonary arrest.\n \nCARMA includes an audible CPR metronome which defaults to 100 beats/minute, and timers for Epinephrine, Amniodarone and code duration. The duration timer prompts the leader to reevaluate every 30 minutes. Each timer has a unique vibrate feature when it completes its  cycle. All of CARMA's timer durations, rates and audible features are configurable through CARMA's preferences menu.\n\nCARMA also features a logging process that automatically tracks all activities within a session.  They include timer starts and stops, H's and T's selections, rhythm, medication and non-drug intervention selections.  Each event is time stamped for easy review.  In addition, the session log can be easily emailed for archiving purposes.  In conformance with HIPAA requirements, no patient information is stored in the log and the log does not reside in the physical space of the mobile device.  Once the application exits or is reset, the log is deleted.\n \nCARMA is an  ACLS tool which gives healthcare providers the ability to better manage cardio-pulmonary events. It guides the provider through ACLS protocols in real time at the bedside utilizing the 2014 American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, leading to better outcomes.\n \n\nFor more information visit\nwww.carmaforlife.com"

The app determines the name of a color using the color information of a photo or the setting of a color slider.\n\nTake a picture of the object whose color you want to know. Touch the object and the matching color name will be determined and displayed. Or use color sliders for red, green, and blue to create or try out colors. For each color you select in the color slider, the color name is determined and displayed. To take a photo you can use the camera in the menu below or you can take the photo with your Apple Camera and then open it from an album. Any photo can be used to identify the name of a color. \n\nYou can switch the zoom mode on and off with a long press gesture. The zoom mode can also be activated with the magnifying glass icon at the bottom right. If the color whose name you want to know is covered by parts of the menu, you can hide all control elements. To do this, touch the determined color name at the top right next to the color field. The app can be used in portrait and landscape format.\n\nThe default settings of the app are opened with the gray icon at the bottom left. Here you can find the options Adopt result, Color values and Measuring area. Adopt result means the determined color value is adopted in the color slider. If this option is switched off, the last saved value is used in the color slider. With the Color values option, you can display the color values for red, green and blue in addition to the determined color name. It is better to switch this option off for small displays. Measuring area controls the number of pixels used to calculate the color name. The medium setting 7 x 7 often gives a good result.\n\nYou can activate the color slider for red, green and blue with the color field at the top left. If the color slider is active, you can save the current color with the plus icon at the bottom right. The color is displayed in a list. The color you select in this list will be applied to the color slider.\n\nThe naming of colors is a complex process that is influenced by general and individual color perception, experience and the current lighting situation. For this reason, a percentage value is calculated for each color name, which indicates how reliable the result is.\n\nThe app is intended as an aid for color-blind people. The app is not a photo or graphic app. Liability for the correctness of all color names determined with the app is not accepted."

      "label": "ECG or Electrocardiography is one of the most useful clinical tools ever developed in the field of medicine. Learning about ECG is vital for almost every healthcare worker including paramedics, emergency staff, physicians, medical students, residents, and nurses. There are already tons of ECG resources to learn from but repetition is the key and this is the reason I came up with the idea of developing 'ECG Stat'. The app is very simple to use. It contains multiple categories ranging from ECG basics including ECG waveforms, intervals, segments to complicated ECG disease manifestations that users can access within seconds. I'm a strong advocate of visual learning and this is the reason I made sure to visualize every ECG feature in this app. If you search for 'Right bundle branch block', the app will quickly show you the core ECG changes seen in RBBB along with a visualization of those changes.\n\nImagine yourself in a clinical setting where you're trying to recall the features of left atrial enlargement. Instead of googling for changes and then scrolling through thousands of images and search results, you can use the ECG Stat app to quickly look up the core ECG features seen in left atrial enlargement along with waveform changes! I have used multiple sources to create this app which is mentioned in the about section. The app is meant to be used by healthcare workers only. It's an educational tool and discrepancies can be seen. If you do find a mistake, you can easily report it through the contact form. The app is for educational purposes only and should not be solely relied on when it comes to patient care. I have strived to ensure that information contained in the app is accurate and personally created and reviewed all the images."

      "label": "Objective measurement of respiratory function is of primary importance in the assessment of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. However, the interpretation of respiratory function tests, especially spirometry tests, is considered suboptimal in primary care.\r\n\r\nA team from the Quebec Heart and Lung Institute affiliated with Laval University (IUCPQ-UL) developed an interactive mobile application called SPIRO© to facilitate the interpretation of spirometry tests.\r\n\r\nThe SPIRO© app guides healthcare professionals and medical students in interpreting spirometry tests by entering basic data from a spirometry report (FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC). The software gives a diagnostic suggestion to the user based on pre-set intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being a resource for educational material (explanatory video, questionnaires, documents related to respiratory health guidelines), the SPIRO© application guides the user in applying the guidelines in respiratory health by providing the necessary references (scientific articles, respiratory health guidelines) to develop a treatment plan.\r\n\r\nThe app allows:\r\n- Optimizing interpretation of spirometry;\r\n- Obtaining a diagnostic suggestion;\r\n- Obtaining a treatment suggestion according to respiratory guidelines;\r\n- Getting quick access to respiratory health guidelines;\r\n- Facilitating the work of health professionals;\r\n- Carrying out better follow-up of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma;\r\n- Obtaining continuing education through specific and relevant educational material. \r\n\r\nThis tool was developed by the Chair in Knowledge Translation, Education and Prevention in Respiratory and Cardiovascular Health affiliated with Laval University in collaboration with the IUCPQ-UL."

      "label": "CTC-AE+ is a browsable reference to the CTC-AE list of adverse event (AE) terms commonly encountered in oncology, plus a portable Adverse Event Logger to keep track of all adverse events during a clinical study.\n\nThe  CTC-AE 4 and CTC-AE  5 have been developed from the earlier vocabulary known as CTC (Common Toxicity Criteria). Each AE term is defined and accompanied by a grading scale that indicates the severity of the adverse event. All AE terms are organized by the System Organ Classes (SOCs) defined by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).\n\nAdverse events are common phenomena affecting patients being treated for cancer. With the availability of new agents and the multimodality interventions, it is critical to monitor systematically the AEs that are linked to oncology research.\nCTCAE is fundamentally intended to be an agreed upon terminology for the designation, reporting, and grading of AEs that occur in oncology research.\n\n########################\nCTC-AE serves several purposes\n########################\n\n- To standardize AE reporting within the NCI oncology research community, across groups and modalities.\n- To facilitate the evaluation of new cancer therapies, treatment modalities, and supportive measures.\n- To aid in AE recognition and severity grading.\n- To monitor safety data and for regulatory reporting.\n- To define oncology research protocol parameters (e.g., eligibility criteria; dose-limiting toxicity; maximum tolerated dose; dose modification).\n\n########################\nKARNOFSKY and ECOG\n########################\n\nAdditionally, CTC-AE+ now includes the two most common performance scores. As a reference and as a guided algorithm when necessary to add the event to the patient's record.\n\n########################\nADVERSE EVENT LOGGER\n########################\n\nThe Adverse Event Logger is a structured local database to help the investigator to keep track of all the adverse events related to the patients participating in a clinical trial.\n\nIt is possible to track multiple clinical studies, multiple patients per clinical trial and multiple events per patient. Events can be selected from the CTC-AE 4 and CTC-AE 5 databases, from Karnofsky and ECOG score tables or can be entered as customized events.\n\nFor convenience, all data can be exported as an excel CSV file to be imported into other analysis software.\n\n########################\nIMPORTANT NOTE\n########################\n\nThis application is strictly EU GDPR compliant and no clinical study or patient information is saved outside the device or uploaded to any remote cloud resources."

      "label": "The OB Wheel Pro 7 is the most complete, powerful, and easiest-to-use tool for healthcare professionals providing prenatal care. In just ONE app there is 1) a gestational age calculator, 2) an ultrasound biometric calculator, 3) a fetal weight calculator, 4) a list of key weeks and trimesters, 5) an age-adjusted risk table for trisomy 21 and aneuploidy, 6) a BMI calculator, and NOW 7) an Apple Watch app is included with your purchase!\n\nThe OB Wheel Pro 7 is a state-of-the-art gestational age calculator (also known as an obstetric or pregnancy wheel) that is used every day by doctors, obstetricians, midwives, nurses, and pregnant women. The OB Wheel Pro 7 is a professional tool that replaces the need for multiple apps and it greatly enhances the functionality of those worn-out cardboard wheels without compromise. \n\nThe OB Wheel Pro 7 accurately determines the estimated delivery date (EDD), or due date, of a pregnancy based on the first day of a woman's last menstrual period (LMP), or from the date of conception, or from a known gestational age (GA) on a known date, e.g. from an ultrasound measurement, or from fetal biometry like Crown-Rump Length (CRL), Femur Length (FL), and BiParietal Diameter (BPD). Additionally, for appropriate gestational ages, The The OB Wheel Pro 7 estimates fetal weight and displays the number of days completed and remaining. \n\nThe OB Wheel Pro 7, besides calculating GA from fetal ultrasound biometrics, enables clinicians to also calculate Estimated Fetal Weight (EFW) from FL, BPD, Head Circumference (HC), and Abdominal Circumference (AC) using the most appropriate published reference formula using the maximum and most appropriate parameters.\n\nPrenatal care providers know that there are key gestational ages where testing or interventions are needed. The OB Wheel Pro 7 lets providers see at a glance when these items should be scheduled.\n\nFEATURES\n• Includes Apple Watch app! \n• Gestational Age Calculator from LMP, EDD, Conception Date for any reference date\n• Gestational Age calculated from specific date and gestational age (e.g. ultrasound)\n• Gestational Age Calculator using fetal biometrics (CRL, FL, BPD)\n• Fetal Weight Calculator using HC, AC, FL, BPD\n• Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator\n• Age-Adjusted Risk Table for Trisomy 21 and aneuploidy\n• List of key completed weeks during pregnancy\n• Pregnancy days completed and remaining, and dates for each trimester\n• Remembers last-used EDD\n\n\nPRO TIPS: \n• To enter Gestational Age, CRL, FL, or BPD for a specific date (like for an ultrasound exam), tap \"Today\", enter the desired date, then tap on the button displaying the gestational age to change that button to display options for entering a specific GA, CRL, FL, and BPD. \n• When using the GA calculator, double-tap a date to change the value to the current date.\n• When using the EFW calculator, double-tap a value to clear the value of the selected parameter."

Clinicians can use a Cone Beam CT volume to view patient’s head in 3 dimensions using multi-planar reformatted views (MPR), known as: axial, coronal, and sagittal. The volumetric data set has no magnification and no superimposition. \n\nCBCT has become “the standard of care” for implant placement. CBCT is used for detection of vertical root fractures and periapical pathology, 3D cephalometric analysis, oral surgery planning, and pathology diagnosis.\n\nCBCT app allows clinicians, residents, and dental students to learn anatomical landmarks as if they were looking at a CBCT data set through the CBCT viewing software but with all the landmarks visible and animated through all MPR views.\n\nThe level of interactivity and visualization is unprecedented. This amazing app covers hundreds of anatomical landmarks visible on CBCT data sets from small to medium to large field of views (FOVs). It also allows you to test your knowledge through the quiz mode, which is very cool. You can also search for a landmark or pick it up from an alphabetical list and the app fly you there. \n\nCBCT is the coolest app to learn anatomy on Cone Beam CT, designed and tested by oral and maxillofacial radiologists to ensure highest quality learning and user experience.\n\nFeatures:\n- 3 high quality data sets from CBCT Carestream Dental and Sirona, in small, medium, and large field of views (FOV).\n- Axial, coronal and sagittal view planes.\n- Two finger scrolling to navigate through the data sets.\n- Two finger pinch in and out for zooming.\n- Quiz mode. Tap ‘?’ to reveal the answer.\n- Search mode: pick from a list or start typing in the search field.\n- Thumbnail references to aid you in orientation while navigating.\n- iPhone optimized layout, iPad-optimized layout both in portrait and landscape."

      "label": "Anyone who snores at night is usually exhausted and not well rested the next morning. But not only that, the (spouse) partner is also prevented from sleeping because of the noise. \n\nMost of the time you will be confronted with the words: \"I have to fall asleep before you, otherwise you will start snoring and I won't be able to sleep.\" \n\nSnoring can thus become a real test of patience and there are even said to be cases where partners are no longer (able to) sleep in the same room.\n\nAlthough the number of men who snore is higher, there are also many women who snore. Therefore, this problem affects all genders.\n\nThere are several possible remedies on the market. But not all of them deliver what they promise, are expensive or very unwieldy.\n\nThis Anti-Snore-App is an anti-snoring solution that works through a completely \"natural\" concept. \n\nIn the past, did your partner, with a (gentle) nudge, make you change your sleeping position to stop snoring?\n\nThis practice is a common method between many couples in bed to stop the other from snoring. \n\nThis approach often serves its purpose. However, it is usually the case that both are awake at night and then have to fall asleep again. \n\nOur Anti-Snore-App automatically fulfills exactly this purpose without anyone having to wake up for it.  \n\nAfter a short orientation period, our Silent Night app promises you: \n\n- restful and regenerative sleep for everyone involved\n- reduced disturbance of the partner's rest\n- improved oxygen intake due to the shifting of the body\n\nOur app uses state-of-the-art algorithms from the field of machine learning. We use it to evaluate your current sleeping sounds and provide you with unconscious assistance through vibrations. \n\nOf course, your data remains completely recorded on the device and will be deleted immediately after evaluation. This means that not only your restful sleep but also the protection of your data is in the forefront.\n\nLikewise, all processes operate directly on the device, data and radio connections can be independently deactivated by you (recommended!) overnight.\n\n----\nDisclaimer for medical services\n\nThis Anti-Snore-App is not a medical device and is not intended to replace professional medical advice and/or diagnoses. The Anti-Snore-App is not intended to diagnose or treat respiratory failure or other diseases/medical conditions. Please consult a licensed physician before making any decisions or taking any actions that may affect your health, safety and well-being. Do not ignore professional advice based on things you have seen, heard or read on the app, website or social media. Always consult a healthcare professional if you have questions or concerns about your snoring or overall health."

      "label": "Ratio S/Z is an app designed by Andreu Sauca, an experienced speech therapist and phoniatrician. It has been conceived as a tool for the evaluation and the monitoring of voice rehabilitation.\n\nPurpose:\n\nThe app registers the maximum expiration and phonation time and the calculation of the phonation quotient (or ratio S/Z) by using the highest of the three values in each.\n\nThe ratio S/Z test is a crucial part in every protocol of voice exploration. There might be different professional purposes for taking the test. In addition to the exploration purpose, the ratio S/Z can be used as a re-evaluation in case of being monitoring or before being discharged. In some cases, it can also be prescribed as a training for different objectives (this app can be used both by the speech therapist and by the patient) or as a screening tool to detect voice problems among some collectives such as teachers.\n\nProcedure:\n\nWith the aid of the chronometers integrated in the ratio S/Z, the professional registers three samples of the highest time taken in the production of the [s] and other three samples on the highest time production of the [z]. Each chronometer shows the obtained values and highlights the highest one in blue. Automatically, the app uses these values to calculate the S/Z quotient, which appears in green or in red to indicate whether it is pathological or not. The interpretation of results varies according to some parameters (age and gender) is accessible through a specific button.\n\nAs the age and sex of the patient can vary the interpretation of the results, a button allows the selection of which kind of patient is undergoing the test. This will give us not only a more accurate result, but it will also evaluate the phonation time length, this is a novelty of this app. \n\nCharacteristics:\n\n-Careful design to enable an easy access and a right understanding of the results.\n-Two chronometers with three partial storing boxes each individually resettable.\n-Selection of the type of patient according to age and gender.\n-Resounding examples of the requested sound.\n-Color code to identify the result fields and buttons.\n-Start, stop and reset buttons for each chronometer.\n-Informative window about the test.\n-Help window to ease the interpretation of results, adapted to it.\n-Export your results to pdf.\n-Languages: Spanish, Catalan, Italian and English. More soon."

The application has a suggested standard solution based on the schemes most used in intensive care services and allows editing and saving your favorite solutions.\n\nThe application also allows the creation of new solutions from the ampoules available in its service, the calculation of the dosage in mL/hour and the possibility of converting the infused speed into an infused concentration and vice versa. In addition, it is possible to view the therapeutic range individually for the patient's weight as guided by some medical bibliographies and the adjustment of this range by the user depending on the objective and clinical judgment. Thus, the application increases patient safety when prescribing these drugs reducing the risk of calculation errors by the professional.\n\nThe application also has messages to warn about photosensitive solutions and medications that must be diluted in a specific medium such as physiological solution or glucose solution, thus preventing changes in their therapeutic properties.\n\n\nThe application is available in english, portuguese and spanish."

All content of your daily logs will be stored on your iCloud, in order to have all data available on any device, connected with your Apple ID.\n\nThanks to the progress bar, you always see how much Phe/Protein you can still eat.\n\nWith DietAssistant it is possible to calculate your daily Phe or Protein consumption. You can change your calculation mode from Phe to Protein and vice versa anytime in the app's settings.\n\nYou can access past days and edit them in the calendar. Edited days are marked in the calendar, if you exceed your phe level/protein level the according day will be marked red, otherwise it will be marked green.\n\nWith DietAssistant it is possible to export your daily log to PDF and share with your doctor or print it.\n\nWith more than 1300 foods and products from many popular manufacturers DietAssistant offers you a huge selection, which can be supplemented by your own products.\n\nFor the supplement of the food database with own products you don't even have to know the Phenylalanine content, it is enough if you enter the protein content, so that DietAssistant can calculate the Phenylalanine content related to 100 grams for you.\n\nStore and edit your blood values and have them displayed in a chart to monitor and track your diet.\n\nJust create and edit reminders so you never forget to take your amino acids.\n\nOf course, I am always happy about feedback and suggestions for improvement. If you want you can rate this app or send me an email to info.dietassistant@gmail.com.\n\nIcons by icons8.de"

      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

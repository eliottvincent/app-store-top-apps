The Monash University FODMAP diet works by swapping foods high in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs), with low FODMAP alternatives. Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

      "label": "Designed by a pediatrician, BiliCalc uses the American Academy of Pediatrics 2004 \"Management of Hyperbilirubinemia in Infants Greater than 35 Weeks of Age\" to calculate the threshold for starting phototherapy based on the patient's age, bilirubin level, and neurotoxicity risk. Values are now displayed on the phototherapy nomogram. In addition, it will also tell you the patient's risk zone using the Bhutani Nomogram.\n\nAllows direct age input and includes the option to calculate age from birth and lab sample times. The app has a direct link to source journal articles, nomograms, and a list of the neurotoxicity risk factors. Supports US and SI units (mg/dL and µmol/L).\n\nApp Feature Summary\n-Calculates phototherapy threshold for newborns 35 weeks and older\n-Displays values on phototherapy nomogram\n-Suggests time frame for followup bilirubin levels based on patient risk zone \n-Direct links to reference journal articles\n\n**********************************\nFrequently Asked Questions\n**********************************\n1. I think the graph is backwards. Why is low risk on top and high risk on bottom?\n\nThe graph is directly from the 2004 AAP Hyperbilirubinemia Guidelines. The degree of \"risk\" refers to the infant's risk for developing neurotoxicity. This is different than the Bhutani Nomogram in which \"risk\" refers to the risk for development of severe hyperbilirubinemia. The threshold for treatment (when a data point lies above one of the lines on the graph) of the infant is different based on the predisposing factors (divided into the three risk categories). Babies who are \"low neurotoxicity risk,\" can tolerate higher levels of bilirubin than a baby with medium or high risk. Therefore, a high risk baby will be treated at lower bilirubin levels than a low risk baby. The graph is correct in having low risk on top since a higher value is needed to pass the threshold for treatment (phototherapy). Please see the graph here for verification as well: http://bit.ly/AppPWU. Please email if you have further questions.\n\n******************************************\nIntended for use by pediatricians, neonatologists, physicians, medical students, and pediatric nurses who treat newborn infants in the hospital and as outpatients.\n\nBiliCalc should be used only as a reference aid. The information contained in the app should not be used as a substitute for the exercise of professional clinical judgement.

(Non-English and French Devices will show the English Version only).  Proceeds from the sale of this App supports future development of the CTAS and its educational materials.\n\nThis application walks the user through patient complaints in assisting nurses and physicians to assign acuity levels using the complaint oriented triage lists and modifiers.

It helps patients receive the care and measures your acuity and volume against other facilities with reliability.  The CTAS is used in many countries around the world for setting patient priority.\n\nThe Canadian Triage & Acuity Scale (CTAS) is a tool that enables Emergency Departments (ED) to:\n\n•Prioritize patient care requirements\n•Examine patient care processes, workload, and resource requirements relative to case mix and community needs\n\nThe CTAS allows ED nurses and physicians to:\n•Triage patients according the type and severity of their presenting signs and symptoms\n•Ensure that the sickest patients are seen first when ED capacity has been exceeded due to visit rates or reduced access to other services\n•Ensure that a patient's need for care is reassessed while in the ED\n\nThe CTAS allows ED managers to:\n•Measure the case mix (volume and acuity) of patients who visit the ED\n•Determine whether the ED has an operational plan and the resources to meet patient needs\n•Assess the ED's role within the hospital and health care region\n\nThe triage level assigned using the CTAS criteria is a mandatory data element to be used in all Canadian Hospital Emergency Departments for reporting to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI).\n\nTraining in the use of the CTAS in the clinical context is recommended before using this application to assist in clinical decision-making."

      "label": "Meet Freya, your virtual birth partner from The Positive Birth Company! Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

      "label": "What is iBP?\n\niBP is a blood pressure tracking and analysis tool. Please note, it is not possible to measure your blood pressure by touching the screen. A separate device is required.\n\nWhat kind of analysis does iBP provide?\n\niBP uses color icons to indicate when your blood pressure values are normal, high, or hypertension. It also provides interactive graphs that allow you to display your values by weeks, months, year and time of day. The graphs display lows, highs, averages, and trend lines using statistical analysis.\n\nWhy iBP vs. other blood pressure apps?\n\niBP is a universal app designed to work on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, which means you only pay for the app once and you get all versions! iBP is the only blood pressure app with a built in transfer capability to sync all your iOS devices.\n\nWhat are the key features?\n\n* Reads and writes Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data (details below)\n* Easy data input using dials instead of keyboard\n* Transfer capability to sync all of your iOS devices\n* Calculates Mean Arterial Pressure and Pulse Pressure\n* Track one personal item (blood glucose, stress level, medication dosage, exercise time)\n* Backup / Restore capability\n* Multiple users\n* Multiple email addresses (you and doctor)\n* Multiple email formats (PDF, HTML, CSV, Plain Text)\n* Passcode to protect your data\n* Touch Id for passcode on devices that support it\n* Snapshot of the graphs can be saved\n* User configurable color ranges\n* Weight units (lb or kg)\n* Withings Blood Pressure Monitor & Wireless Scale\n\nApple Health\niBP is now able to read and write Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data. If your blood pressure monitor (i.e., Omron, iHealth, Withings) adds data to Apple Health then you can easily import that data into this app. If you manually input your data into this app, then it will write that data to Apple Health.\n\nWithings + iBP = No more data entry!\niBP can retrieve your blood pressure and weight data directly from your Withings account.  The Blood Pressure Monitor and wireless Body Scale automatically record and send the data to your account.  There is no data entry required and you can view the data anywhere using a web browser or a variety of mobile apps.\n\n\nDisclaimer: iBP is intended to be used as a means to collect data to be shared with your doctor. This application is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Why not be able to choose based on how you are holding the phone and what else you are doing at the same time?\n    • Use the numeric entry pad (0 3 3 0 2 0 0 8) and immediately see the results, OR\n    • Spin the date wheel at the bottom of the screen and tap Next.\n\n 3) Thorough results: All the information you would expect from a classic wheel, plus more:\n   • Estimated Due Date\n   • LMP Date\n   • Conception Date\n   • 1st Trimester End Date\n   • 2nd Trimester End Date\n   • Gestational Age\n   • Conceptional Age\n   • Expected Fetal Length based on standard fetal growth curves\n   • Expected Fetal Weight based on standard fetal growth curves (\"How much does my baby weigh, doctor?\")\n\nResults are relative to 'today' by default; this can be quickly changed to reflect any date by tapping the 'today' button and selecting a new date.\n\n 4) Accurate results: Perfect OB Wheel provides exact dates and accounts for all calendar variance, including leap years. \n\n 5) Persistence: Perfect OB Wheel remembers the date and date type you last used and restores them when launched to streamline your workflow.\n\n 6) Perfect OB Tracker upgrade: Available as an in-app purchase update, the Perfect OB Tracker lets you track any number of pregnancies, with at-a-glance due date and gestational age and one-tap access to all the data Perfect OB Wheel provides.  A  picture and text notes can be kept on each patient. Postpartum tracking is also available. Passcode locking is available for HIPAA compliance."

Clips are triggered by pushing and holding down a button on the remote in tandem with the simulated exam. \n\nSimulate a full ultrasound examination of pleura, lung base, heart (PLAX, A4C and subcostal view), the three points of the FAST exam, the femoral veins and the aorta.\n\nMake your own case by assigning different pathologies including: pneumothorax, pneumonia, B-lines, pleural effusion, high and low EF, LV & RV infarction, tamponade, endocarditis, cardiac arrest, LUCAS compressions, type A dissection, hydronefrosis, aortic aneurysm, DVT, and free abdominal fluid. Changes can be made on the fly, simulating dynamic course. Save and load cases later for quick changes during your scenario.\n \nCPR mode lets you easily access clips of Compressions, Asystole, Vfib and Normal contractions for training in using ultrasound during CPR pulse checks.\n\nUse the app when training with usual mannequins or even live actors! Can easily be used as an examination tool for basic P.O.C. ultrasound courses. Add a probe to the monitor for improved fidelity!\n\n'Team Mode' enables multiple pairs of devices to stay connected without interference if used in close poximity of each other, 10 different groups can use the app at once.\n\nIt's truly an Awesome Ultrasound Simulator!\n\nUsed all around the globe, by the ATACC course in GB, Care Flight Australia and many others."

The app's efficacy is supported by independent research studies, including a 2016 study by Huntington University published in the Journal of Hand Therapy.\n\n• Increases coordination and motor control in the hands and fingers\n\n• Works for kids and adults\n\n• Automatically creates performance and usage reports that can be emailed\n\n• Speeds recovery from injuries and stroke\n\n• Designed in consultation with Occupational Therapists\n\n• Turns the iPad into a therapeutic tool\n \nFor best therapeutic results the exercises should be done on a regular basis in short sessions. The exercises are designed to be repeatable and engaging.\n\nThe automatic tracking and reporting feature makes it easy for parents, teachers and occupational therapists to identify time on task and progress.  You can email the progress reports right from the app itself.\n\nMulti-user tracking is available as an in-app purchase. (Note to Volume Purchase Program customers: Consider buying Dexteria VPP instead. It includes multi-user tracking and you will pay a lower net cost than if you buy Dexteria and upgrade each copy via the in-app purchase. Just search \"Dexteria VPP\" in the app store.)\n\n                    *****\n\"Very impressed with this app. I've been looking for something like this for a very long time.\"  - from Apps for Children with Special Needs\n\n\"For occupational therapists, the one huge benefit is the ability to track the child's progress.\" - from YourTherapySource.com\n\nEditor's Choice Award from Children's Technology Review\n\n\"Outstanding app and I highly recommend it. Children are very motivated to use it. I’m a Pediatric Occupational Therapist and I use it to work on fine motor integration, fine motor precision, hand exercises, handwriting, writing speed, etc.\"  - Authentic app store review\n                    *****\n\n\n\nATTENTION LICENSED OTs: If you are a licensed OT and have comments about Dexteria, please submit a review and tell us what we did right and where we can improve. We will respond to your comments in the form of free upgrades with product improvements. You can influence the evolution of Dexteria!\n\n\nWe're serious about your privacy. This app does not track or share your personal information with us or anyone else. There is no user id tracking software, and no advertisements.  In summary, we have no idea who you are! :-)"

      "label": "FlashRX is a flashcard and quiz-based educational tool for healthcare students and professionals to learn the top 250 medications in the outpatient setting (also known as the Top 200 Drugs or Top 300 Drugs).  Instead of complicated, bloated drug cards, FlashRX’s drug database focuses on simple, usable information to develop your core knowledge base.\n\nThe emphasis on concise, practical knowledge will improve learning and comprehension of the top 250 drugs.  This is a learning tool – NOT a drug reference.  This app is not a comprehensive resource for drug information.\n\nThis app is perfect for pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, physician assistants, nurses, nursing students, physicians, medical students, and other healthcare professionals.  The drug database is designed to aid in studying for both students in school and those preparing for standardized exams (eg, NAPLEX, BCPS, PTCB, ExCPT, PANCE/PANRE, NCLEX, USMLE, COMLEX).\n\n== FEATURES ==\n• Beautiful, intuitive flashcard and quiz modes to optimize your learning strategy\n• Flashcards and quiz content are fully customizable – test yourself on brand/generic names, drug classes, indications, adverse effects, and even typical dose ranges\n• Quiz mode includes a selection algorithm to randomly identify intelligent distractor answers to keep you on your toes\n• An adaptive (Leitner) learning mode so that your time is focused on drug cards that you haven’t yet mastered\n\n== DRUG DATABASE ==\n• Includes information on 250 of the most common outpatient medications based on net sales, total prescriptions, and unique or emerging therapeutic classes\n• Audio pronunciations of both the brand and generic names at any time throughout the app\n• Each drug entry includes its brand name, generic name, generic pronunciation, drug class, indications, adverse effects, and typical dosing\n• The drug database is completely customizable – add or remove drugs, change drug entries, and even record your own pronunciation\n• \"Group\" drugs into therapeutic classes or your own custom drug lists.  These groups can be hidden or shown to focus your studying\n\n== ADAPTIVE LEARNING STATISTICS ==\n• Both flashcard and quiz modes utilize an adaptive learning algorithm to keep track of which drug facts you know well, and which need more review\n• Track your learning progress by viewing your statistics at the end of each flashcard or quiz session, or access the dedicated Adaptive Learning Statistics page for your learning overview\n\n== AUTHOR INFORMATION == \nThis app and all of its content was created by Sean P. Kane, PharmD, BCPS – a clinical pharmacist, associate professor, and author of the popular evidence-based website, ClinCalc.com.  The drug list and drug information closely mirrors the popular video-based course series The Top 250 Drugs (https://top250drugs.com)."

      "label": "WHY DID WE MAKE THIS?\nYou hurt. Your pain is chronic and complicated. You can’t remember everything. You want your doctors to understand, but you don’t know how to explain what you feel.\n\nPAIN IS LIFE-CHANGING. HELP IS HERE.\nNanolume® developed the Pain Tracker & Diary to help you record the daily textures, intensities, and locations of what you feel, so you and your care team can better understand what you are suffering with and follow how your pain responds to medications and treatments.\n\nTRACK IT BETTER. TREAT IT BETTER.\nPain is a complex experience. It often includes multiple pain types (layers), each with its own unique texture, intensity, location, and surface area.\n\nBy keeping a diary that integrates complex information, you can show your doctors what you are experiencing to help them make a better diagnosis, choose more appropriate medications and treatments, and monitor if your treatments are beneficial. In addition, by keeping such an integrated record, trends might emerge that would otherwise go unnoticed.  \n\nPAIN IS DIFFERENT.\nPain is a subjective (not objective) sensation that you cannot measure. Its assessment relies on each person’s ability to communicate what they feel. Nanolume® developed this digital diary to help you record what you feel every day. \n\nINCLUDED FEATURES.\nFor each diary entry you create:\n• Choose a Pain Type. Choose from a list of predefined pain types or create a customized pain type. Next, tap the icon of the pain type you feel is most intense (you can come back and add more types later).\n• Select the Intensity. Select the intensity of your pain type using a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS).\n• Draw an Outline. Use your finger to draw an “outline” of the type of pain you are experiencing on the front and back sides of a generalized map of your body.\n• Calculated Surface Areas. The app displays the percent [%] of your body surface affected by each (or all) of the pain types you draw.\n• Zoom. Need to see a larger image of your hand or foot? Double-tap: \"once\" to zoom x2; \"twice\" to zoom x4; \"a third time\" to restore the image to its original size.  We also offer pinch-to-zoom.\n• Notes. Tap the “Notepad” icon located in the top-left corner of each opened diary entry to record any details of your medications or treatment results.\n• Tap \"Add Pain.\" Choose another pain type (layer) to draw.\n• Save Your Diary Entry. Tap \"Done\" to create a snapshot of all the pain type layers you drew. The app attaches the date and time your entry was saved.\n• Open a Saved Entry. Tap on the date and time of the entry you want to review. Look at the intensity, location, and surface area of each distinct pain type you experienced (by touching the icon of the pain type you want to see) or see all the pain types at once and see how they overlap (tap the \"All Layers\" icon). Swipe the picture left or right to check how your other saved pain entries compare over time.\n• Charts. View a summary of your data in \"Charts.\"\n• Forget to Save an Entry? Go back and recreate a \"pain picture\" from the past; then, use the \"Calendar\" icon to backdate the recreated entry.\n• Calendar Backdating. Touch the \"Calendar\" icon to backdate any pain-picture you draw to create a record of what you remember from the past.\n• Copy/Edit. Copy or edit a copy of a previous entry.\n• CSV Export. Email or save a numeric file of your data, then open that data in a spreadsheet.\n• Interactive Summary & Animation. Play an animation of your data to see how each or all of your pain types change within any period you choose by selecting the corresponding start/stop dates.\n• PDF Export. Export your charts, drawings, and notes as a PDF file.\n\nPRIVACY IS IMPORTANT.\nYour data is stored on your device only and is not collected or stored by Nanolume® LLC.

The Visual Vertical application for iphone and ipad changes all that. With just your iphone, some bluetack and a bucket (yes really, a bucket!) you can take accurate readings in just a few minutes, for a tiny fraction of the normal cost.\n\nThis version of the app includes the ability to take multiple readings of the eyes and produces averaged results, as well as containing the ability to do single, one off readings."

      "label": "Writing Therapy is a unique app for spelling practice for adults with brain injury or stroke as well as ESL speakers or children learning to spell. \n\n** Try it for FREE in Language Therapy Lite or purchase at a discount in the Language Therapy 4-in-1 app! ** \n\nWith 4 modes and 3 levels of difficulty in each, users have access to 12 different exercises to practice writing over 500 words + unlimited custom words! \n\n* Fill-in-the-Blank \n* Copy \n* Spell What You See \n* Spell What You Hear \n\nUnlike other learn-to-spell apps, Writing Therapy allows users to select and rearrange letter tiles until they are satisfied, choosing when to submit an answer, rather than letters only fitting into the correct spot. Writing Therapy also has a built-in cueing hierarchy to give \"hints\" on each level, making the exercise one step easier to allow success on each trial. A virtual set of letter tiles makes therapy go faster with more repetitions in less time. \n\nYou can add your own words and pictures to create completely customized spelling lists! Learn to spell names, places, or words related to each user's needs. \n\nThis app features clear photographs, iconic graphics, and a clear male voice in 5 languages. Users will benefit from the trial-and-error format and self-selected cues for learning these common words with graduated activities that will grow with them as they develop or improve. \n\nSettings allow limiting the length of the words, selecting capital or lowercase letters, designating which of 12 categories are presented, and choosing how letters are selected. For users with difficulty dragging, an alternative tapping access method is available. Speech-Language Pathologists, family members, and teachers can recommend the appropriate modes and levels for each user and receive e-mailed reports of results (ready for professional progress notes). \n\nWriting Therapy is another powerful app in Tactus Therapy Solutions' professionally-designed Language Therapy suite of speech-language therapy apps. It is the perfect companion to Comprehension Therapy, Naming Therapy, and Reading Therapy. \n\nOur customers love this app! Read what they have to say: \n\n\"I really like that this app can be used by both children and adults. I love the great real-life photographs used instead of cartoon pictures or line drawings. The functional, categorized vocabulary you use in your apps is appreciated!! I especially like the feature allowing older students/clients the opportunity to analyze their responses prior to submitted them. This app has great control over the length of the words selected, the voice quality is good, and clinicians will appreciate the data reporting! Great job!\" \n\n\"Great app, highly engaging! I used this app with two of my aphasia clients- one in her 30s and one in his 50s. Both found it engaging and wanted to continue to use the app throughout their session. I like the different levels of difficulty and the hints (which both of my clients appreciated as well). Great app!\" \n\n\"Beautifully done! A child or an adult can use this; the very nice part is that it isn't childish as many learn to spell apps are, which I absolutely love. My favorite part is the fact that words can actually be misspelled which allows the user to decide for themselves if it is correct or not BEFORE hitting the check button. So the target word is actually learned rather than just swiping letters until they all go into the correct slot. Love this app!\""

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

      "label": "- A \"must have\" orthopedic app pick by Orthopedics Today\n\n- Rated a \"Top App\" by TopOrthoApps.com\n\n- An MDLinx Editor's Pick\n\nOrtho Traumapedia is designed to provide quick access to information important to the treatment of adult skeletal trauma. Based on extensive literature review, Ortho Traumapedia compiles the current standard of care in a high-yield, easy to use format including dozens of original images to help visualize fracture patterns and radiologic findings. \n\nOriginally developed by orthopedic surgeons for orthopedic surgeons, practitioners of all levels and specialties who encounter adult skeletal trauma will find Ortho Traumapedia useful as a condensed reference and educational tool. Whether you’re a primary care or emergency physician, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, resident or medical student, Ortho Traumapedia provides highly pertinent information regarding skeletal trauma right at your fingertips. \n\nOrtho Traumapedia is organized into chapters by bone (for fractures) and joint (for dislocations). Each chapter is divided into four sections: Facts, Imaging, Classification and Treatment: \n\nFacts begins with epidemiology and common injury mechanisms. This is followed by an outline of pertinent anatomy, eponyms and variants. Finally, patient presentation, examination and management tips are presented. \n\nImaging begins with the standard radiographic examinations for each anatomic region. This is followed by injury-specific views, relevant metrics and findings as well as supplemental modalities. \n\nClassification outlines the most common classification systems used to describe the selected injury. \n\nTreatment begins with general treatment principles and reviews treatment in the acute setting. This is followed by standard of care options grouped by injury pattern. Common complications associated with the injury are included at the end of this section. \n\nSimply select the bone or joint you’re interested in from the main menu and navigate between the four sections with the buttons on the bottom of the screen. Return to the main menu by pressing the left arrow in the title bar. There's never been a simpler, more mobile skeletal trauma reference!"

Keep track of body temperatures and medication for your whole family with Feevy.\n\n\nTEMPERATURE, MEDICATION AND NOTES\nWith Feevy you can not only record temperature measurements, but also track medications and enter text notes. This way, you can verify if medication was effective and capture additional information, e.g. regarding the patient’s condition. Be perfectly prepared for your next visit to the doctor!\n\nBEAUTIFUL CHARTS\nEntering data is worthless if you can’t analyze it later. Feevy comes with a beautiful and very detailed interactive chart, which makes it easy to get a quick overview, as well as to analyze temperature curves in more detail. You can freely zoom and pan it to see all the details you need.\n\nPRINT AND SHARE YOUR DATA\nOf course you can also print and export your data. This way you can bring your fever curve with you to the doctor or even send it via e-mail. The PDF contains all measurements, medications and notes, as well as a full-page chart showing the temperature curve.\n\nTRACK MULTIPLE PEOPLE\nFeevy lets you track the fever curves for multiple people. It is perfect for keeping track of your children's conditions and illnesses. To represent your family with some personality, Feevy comes with a set of cute profile icons to choose from.\n\nSYNC WITH FAMILY MEMBERS\nEspecially if you use Feevy to track your kids' illnesses, you will appreciate its sync functionality. No matter who measures the temperature or administers medication, both parents will always see the same data on their devices.\n\nUNIVERSAL APP\nFeevy supports both iPhone and iPad, including iPad multitasking (Slide Over and Split View). Use your iPhone while on the go or to quickly enter a new measurement, and use the iPad to have a detailed look at the charts.\n\n\nFeedback is always welcome: feedback@feevyapp.com or via Twitter @feevyapp.\n\n\nIMPORTANT\nIn case of fever and sickness, please always consult your doctor. Using this app to track body temperature and symptoms is not a substitute for a visit to the doctor!\n\nOF COURSE YOU CANNOT MEASURE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE WITH THIS APP! You can only record, visualize and archive the measurements obtained with a fever thermometer."

      "label": "The \"Voice Meter Pro\" app for the iPad, iPhone and iPod touch, is a simple, but effective app that helps children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD's), voice disorders, or any other child (or adult) monitor the volume of their own voice in a Fun and Engaging way.\n\nChildren with Asperger’s and other ASD’s often have difficulties producing the appropriate voice volume in different settings.  Some children on the autism spectrum speak too quietly.  Others speak too loudly.  Still others do not compensate adequately for the social milieu or ambient noise level. \n\nUnderstanding abstract concepts, such as the volume of one’s voice, can be difficult for children with ASD's.  It’s well understood that adding a visual component to the otherwise abstract concept can often be very helpful for individuals with ASD.\n\nOK so how does the app work?\n\nWell….if a child is talking to quietly a blue background with a cartoon character struggling to hear is displayed. If a child is talking too loudly the background changes to red and the character puts it’s fingers in its ears. If the volume level is acceptable a green background with a smiling happy character is displayed.\n\n• The on screen “volume thermometer” dynamically displays the volume level as it changes. \n\n• There’s a \"Sensitivity\" slider so the adult can adjust the volume sensitivity to suit both the user and the environment.\n\n• There’s also a \"Dampening\" slider. This helps avoid the meter bouncing around in between words by introducing a slight delay before any movement is shown on the “volume\" thermometer.\n\n• To give the user total control over the app the Upper and Lower limits of the \"Green\" (acceptable volume area) can now be adjusted by the user.\n\n• For convenience the app works in both portrait and landscape modes on all the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad.\n\n•  the iPhone version of the app has a switch to enable the iPhone to vibrate should the upper threshold level be exceeded for longer than 4 seconds.\n\nWe want to make this app the very best it can be and to this end we have included a feedback form inside the app for users to submit any issues or suggestions as to how it can be improved. \n\nWhy not download the app and give it a try?...... you might find it a very useful tool."

      "label": "The Special Operations Forces Medical Handbook (SOFMHB) offers the user the most incredible single-source resource of medical information written in plain straight-forward language. Anyone who anticipates being in a situation where medical care would be difficult to procure, i.e. a long hunt, a sailing trip, volunteer mission abroad or possible future disruption to local emergency services, would do well to include this reference with their gear.\n\nFull of practical information about coping with any kind of medical emergency in less than optimum situations, this quick reference guide is packed with the diagnostic and treatment info you need to stay alive and well where there is no doctor, dentist or professional medical help.\n\nThis latest digital edition of the Special Forces Medical Handbook is the work of over 130 contributors and 57 reviewers from both the military and civilian practice. The handbook is now the unified reference for the standard of health care delivery under adverse and general field conditions for combat medics in all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces.\n\nThis manual is not a first aid book. Although written for special operations medical personnel, remote-duty paramedics, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and civilians dealing with medical issues in primitive or austere conditions will all find the manual very useful. It emphasizes acute care in all its forms: gynaecology, general medicine, paediatrics, dentistry, poisonings, infestations, parasitic infections, diseases and infections, environmental exposure (hyper and hypothermia, high altitude, aerospace, and dive medicine), veterinary medicine, sanitation practice and much much more. \n\nTreatment protocols are organized by symptoms and affected organ system. Topics are covered in a consistent subjective/objective/assessment/plan (SOAP) format.  It is organized according to symptoms, organ systems, specialty areas, operational environments and procedures. Diagnoses are made easier with information on the distinctive features of each illness. Questions are listed to quickly obtain an accurate patient history and perform a complete physical examination. Each procedure is organized by What, When, What You Need, What to Do and What Not to Do. \n\nQuotes about the SOFMHB : \n- \"I am a volunteer that does wilderness medicine and relief work in the third world. This book has everything and more that you would ever need to use. This is not just for conflict medicine though that is well covered.\"\n\n- \"A concise read for viral, bacterial, and parasitic diseases, with pictures, charts and graphic instructions for many conditions, every medical personnel working outside major metropolitan areas should have one. This is one publication that will definitely save lives and improve badly needed medical aid for the sick. Every field hospital can use the information contained in this book.\"\n\n- \"This is the most comprehensive and detailed medical guide out today. If you have a medical background of an EMT or greater, you'll appreciate this manual. Great reference to add to a preparedness library or for your remote camping or hunting location. If it's not in this book, then there's a chance you don't need to know it. If you must buy only one medical reference book this is the one!!\"\n\n- \"I recommend this book to anyone who travels outside of the country on mission trips or if your going camping or to the battlefield. This books covers everything from triage to paediatrics.\"\n\nISBN: 9780160867194\n\nKey Features of this app:\n* Content is based on the 2010 SOFMHB Second Edition - Digital Version\n* Heavily illustrated with anatomical drawings and full color images in context\n* Easy to use interactive table of contents navigation\n* Advanced search capabilities\n* Bookmark any subject\n* Easy Navigation: Swipe left/right to view to the next/previous subject\n* 250 Microscopic Images\n* Over 160 Color Illustrations & Diagrams\n* Over 400 Clinical Images\n* Hyperlinked References"

Insert the daily dose of your blood thinner medication (Warfarin, Coumadin, Marcoumar, Sintrom, Marevan, Falithrom, ...) for a certain period of time. You can add one dose at a time or multiple doses in bulk, according to a dose scheme. Doses can be expressed as an amount of pills or in milligrams. The app will remind you to take your daily dose at a personally configurable time.\n \nTap on your daily dose to confirm you've taken the blood thinner medication. The timestamp of confirmation is stored in the app. That way, you'll never forget if and at what time you've taken your medication.\n \nThe app can also record the INR measurements of your blood and visualizes the evolution of your INR in time. The app also reminds you when a new INR measurement is planned.\n\nDose and INR data can be exported or imported for backup purposes, or if you want to discuss this with your medical expert."

Cardiac Trials is a must-have for clinicians in-training: fellows, residents, students, but can be used and studied at any level. Constantly updated, Cardiac Trials strives to reflect both historical and the most up-to-date clinical trials published to date within the field of cardiology."

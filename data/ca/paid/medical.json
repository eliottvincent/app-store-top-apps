Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

(Non-English and French Devices will show the English Version only).  Proceeds from the sale of this App supports future development of the CTAS and its educational materials.\n\nThis application walks the user through patient complaints in assisting nurses and physicians to assign acuity levels using the complaint oriented triage lists and modifiers.  All lists and modifier definitions and data are within the application and therefore no data connection is required.\n\nBy using the official application, nurses and physicians can be assured that they are using the most current and accurate scale as developed and revised by the National Working Group.\n\nTriage accurately! It helps patients receive the care and measures your acuity and volume against other facilities with reliability.  The CTAS is used in many countries around the world for setting patient priority.\n\nThe Canadian Triage & Acuity Scale (CTAS) is a tool that enables Emergency Departments (ED) to:\n\n•Prioritize patient care requirements\n•Examine patient care processes, workload, and resource requirements relative to case mix and community needs\n\nThe CTAS allows ED nurses and physicians to:\n•Triage patients according the type and severity of their presenting signs and symptoms\n•Ensure that the sickest patients are seen first when ED capacity has been exceeded due to visit rates or reduced access to other services\n•Ensure that a patient's need for care is reassessed while in the ED\n\nThe CTAS allows ED managers to:\n•Measure the case mix (volume and acuity) of patients who visit the ED\n•Determine whether the ED has an operational plan and the resources to meet patient needs\n•Assess the ED's role within the hospital and health care region\n\nThe triage level assigned using the CTAS criteria is a mandatory data element to be used in all Canadian Hospital Emergency Departments for reporting to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI).\n\nTraining in the use of the CTAS in the clinical context is recommended before using this application to assist in clinical decision-making."

Why not be able to choose based on how you are holding the phone and what else you are doing at the same time?\n    • Use the numeric entry pad (0 3 3 0 2 0 0 8) and immediately see the results, OR\n    • Spin the date wheel at the bottom of the screen and tap Next.\n\n 3) Thorough results: All the information you would expect from a classic wheel, plus more:\n   • Estimated Due Date\n   • LMP Date\n   • Conception Date\n   • 1st Trimester End Date\n   • 2nd Trimester End Date\n   • Gestational Age\n   • Conceptional Age\n   • Expected Fetal Length based on standard fetal growth curves\n   • Expected Fetal Weight based on standard fetal growth curves (\"How much does my baby weigh, doctor?\")\n\nResults are relative to 'today' by default; this can be quickly changed to reflect any date by tapping the 'today' button and selecting a new date.\n\n 4) Accurate results: Perfect OB Wheel provides exact dates and accounts for all calendar variance, including leap years. \n\n 5) Persistence: Perfect OB Wheel remembers the date and date type you last used and restores them when launched to streamline your workflow.\n\n 6) Perfect OB Tracker upgrade: Available as an in-app purchase update, the Perfect OB Tracker lets you track any number of pregnancies, with at-a-glance due date and gestational age and one-tap access to all the data Perfect OB Wheel provides.  A  picture and text notes can be kept on each patient. Postpartum tracking is also available. Passcode locking is available for HIPAA compliance."

When your pet exhales, tap the Breath button to start the timer. Continue to tap the Breath button each time your pet exhales. Once complete, the number of breaths will display.\n\nCALCULATIONS\n– If you select 15 Seconds, the app will calculate each time you tap times 4.\n\n– If you select 30 Seconds, the app will calculate each time you tap times 2.\n\n– If you select 60 Seconds, the app will display the number of times you tap.\n\nFEATURES\n– The Apple Watch will provide haptic feedback with each tap. This allows you to watch your pet breathing, rather than your watch.\n\n– You will receive a haptic notification when the timer is finished and be presented with the total breath count.\n\n– No audible feedback so you won’t disturb your precious pet at rest! Please set the Apple Watch to silent to fully utilize this feature.\n\nMY STORY\n\nI created this app when my rescue dog, Bizou, went into heart failure at age 13 and was diagnosed with a grade 5 heart murmur. She was on several medications and my vet recommended I begin tracking her breathing to help them in regulating the dosages of her medications. I found it difficult for just 1 person to watch her breathing while also watching a timer to know when to stop counting. My goal was to make this much easier.\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nContact your veterinarian for normal and elevated heart rates for both cats and dogs. If your pet has an elevated heart rate or you have any concerns about his or her health, please immediately contact your vet.\n\nFEEDBACK\n\nPlease send your feedback to support@verkadesg.com. I would love to implement new features based on your ideas!\n\nSee more information at www.verkadesg.com\n\nAll proceeds go to the Humane Society of York County http://humanesocietyofyorkcounty.org"

      "label": "Designed by a pediatrician, BiliCalc uses the American Academy of Pediatrics 2004 \"Management of Hyperbilirubinemia in Infants Greater than 35 Weeks of Age\" to calculate the threshold for starting phototherapy based on the patient's age, bilirubin level, and neurotoxicity risk. Values are now displayed on the phototherapy nomogram. In addition, it will also tell you the patient's risk zone using the Bhutani Nomogram.\n\nAllows direct age input and includes the option to calculate age from birth and lab sample times. The app has a direct link to source journal articles, nomograms, and a list of the neurotoxicity risk factors. Supports US and SI units (mg/dL and µmol/L).\n\nApp Feature Summary\n-Calculates phototherapy threshold for newborns 35 weeks and older\n-Displays values on phototherapy nomogram\n-Suggests time frame for followup bilirubin levels based on patient risk zone \n-Direct links to reference journal articles\n\n**********************************\nFrequently Asked Questions\n**********************************\n1. I think the graph is backwards. Why is low risk on top and high risk on bottom?\n\nThe graph is directly from the 2004 AAP Hyperbilirubinemia Guidelines. The degree of \"risk\" refers to the infant's risk for developing neurotoxicity. This is different than the Bhutani Nomogram in which \"risk\" refers to the risk for development of severe hyperbilirubinemia. The threshold for treatment (when a data point lies above one of the lines on the graph) of the infant is different based on the predisposing factors (divided into the three risk categories). Babies who are \"low neurotoxicity risk,\" can tolerate higher levels of bilirubin than a baby with medium or high risk. Therefore, a high risk baby will be treated at lower bilirubin levels than a low risk baby. The graph is correct in having low risk on top since a higher value is needed to pass the threshold for treatment (phototherapy). Please see the graph here for verification as well: http://bit.ly/AppPWU. Please email if you have further questions.\n\n******************************************\nIntended for use by pediatricians, neonatologists, physicians, medical students, and pediatric nurses who treat newborn infants in the hospital and as outpatients.\n\nBiliCalc should be used only as a reference aid. The information contained in the app should not be used as a substitute for the exercise of professional clinical judgement. Please contact the developer if you find any errors.\n\nKeywords: bilitool, bilitool.org, jaundice, hyperbiliubinemia"

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

We’ve taken all the content from our original Pedi STAT application and carefully selected components that are unique to providers in EMS.  We’ve solicited feedback from leaders in out of hospital care, including paramedics, EMTs, air medical flight crews, and medical directors. We’ve condensed the content to be applicable to those providing care outside the hospital, including first responders, firefighters, EMTs, Paramedics, and Critical Care Transport providers.\n\nMedication dosing and pediatric equipment sizes are easily and rapidly accessed, and accurately calculated based on provider input of either weight, length, age, or Broselow / Pediatape weight estimates.  We are attempting to eliminate medical errors by calculating not only the correct pediatric medication dose, but also the volume to be administered for patient specific conditions.  We have also included algorithms and medical calculators to assist providers in multiple areas, including managing pediatric cardiac arrest, burn size estimation and fluid resuscitation, and Glasgow Coma Scale.\n\nCaring for pediatric patients is associated with a large number of challenges, the most important being selecting the correct equipment and medications, and then dosing the medications correctly.  Our goal is to eliminate these challenges as much as possible, and allow the provider to concentrate on what is most important, the patient.\n\nSuggestions for improvements or additions are always welcome:  Pedi-STAT.com"

      "label": "What is iBP?\n\niBP is a blood pressure tracking and analysis tool. Please note, it is not possible to measure your blood pressure by touching the screen. A separate device is required.\n\nWhat kind of analysis does iBP provide?\n\niBP uses color icons to indicate when your blood pressure values are normal, high, or hypertension. It also provides interactive graphs that allow you to display your values by weeks, months, year and time of day. The graphs display lows, highs, averages, and trend lines using statistical analysis.\n\nWhy iBP vs. other blood pressure apps?\n\niBP is a universal app designed to work on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, which means you only pay for the app once and you get all versions! iBP is the only blood pressure app with a built in transfer capability to sync all your iOS devices.\n\nWhat are the key features?\n\n* Reads and writes Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data (details below)\n* Easy data input using dials instead of keyboard\n* Transfer capability to sync all of your iOS devices\n* Calculates Mean Arterial Pressure and Pulse Pressure\n* Track one personal item (blood glucose, stress level, medication dosage, exercise time)\n* Backup / Restore capability\n* Multiple users\n* Multiple email addresses (you and doctor)\n* Multiple email formats (PDF, HTML, CSV, Plain Text)\n* Passcode to protect your data\n* Touch Id for passcode on devices that support it\n* Snapshot of the graphs can be saved\n* User configurable color ranges\n* Weight units (lb or kg)\n* Withings Blood Pressure Monitor & Wireless Scale\n\nApple Health\niBP is now able to read and write Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data. If your blood pressure monitor (i.e., Omron, iHealth, Withings) adds data to Apple Health then you can easily import that data into this app. If you manually input your data into this app, then it will write that data to Apple Health.\n\nWithings + iBP = No more data entry!\niBP can retrieve your blood pressure and weight data directly from your Withings account.  The Blood Pressure Monitor and wireless Body Scale automatically record and send the data to your account.  There is no data entry required and you can view the data anywhere using a web browser or a variety of mobile apps.\n\n\nDisclaimer: iBP is intended to be used as a means to collect data to be shared with your doctor. This application is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. We assume no liability for any personal harm or injury sustained as a result of using this application."

The updated management guidelines aim to:\n • Allow for a more complete and precise estimation of risk\n • Provide more appropriate intervention for high-risk individuals (detect and treat more precancer)\n • Recommend less intervention for low-risk individuals (decrease testing and treatment that won’t prevent cancer and may cause reproductive harm)\n • Allow for the future addition of new risk modifiers and screening and management technologies\n\nSee https://www.asccp.org/UserGuide for tips on using the app."

The app's efficacy is supported by independent research studies, including a 2016 study by Huntington University published in the Journal of Hand Therapy.\n\n• Increases coordination and motor control in the hands and fingers\n\n• Works for kids and adults\n\n• Automatically creates performance and usage reports that can be emailed\n\n• Speeds recovery from injuries and stroke\n\n• Designed in consultation with Occupational Therapists\n\n• Turns the iPad into a therapeutic tool\n \nFor best therapeutic results the exercises should be done on a regular basis in short sessions. The exercises are designed to be repeatable and engaging.\n\nThe automatic tracking and reporting feature makes it easy for parents, teachers and occupational therapists to identify time on task and progress.  You can email the progress reports right from the app itself.\n\nMulti-user tracking is available as an in-app purchase. (Note to Volume Purchase Program customers: Consider buying Dexteria VPP instead. It includes multi-user tracking and you will pay a lower net cost than if you buy Dexteria and upgrade each copy via the in-app purchase. Just search \"Dexteria VPP\" in the app store.)\n\n                    *****\n\"Very impressed with this app. I've been looking for something like this for a very long time.\"  - from Apps for Children with Special Needs\n\n\"For occupational therapists, the one huge benefit is the ability to track the child's progress.\" - from YourTherapySource.com\n\nEditor's Choice Award from Children's Technology Review\n\n\"Outstanding app and I highly recommend it. Children are very motivated to use it. I’m a Pediatric Occupational Therapist and I use it to work on fine motor integration, fine motor precision, hand exercises, handwriting, writing speed, etc.\"  - Authentic app store review\n                    *****\n\n\n\nATTENTION LICENSED OTs: If you are a licensed OT and have comments about Dexteria, please submit a review and tell us what we did right and where we can improve. We will respond to your comments in the form of free upgrades with product improvements. You can influence the evolution of Dexteria!\n\n\nWe're serious about your privacy. This app does not track or share your personal information with us or anyone else. There is no user id tracking software, and no advertisements.  In summary, we have no idea who you are! :-)"

The anatomy tab gives an overview of anatomy related to the specific block, it includes schematic diagram’s which can be expanded to full screen. The procedures tab is a full pictorial and text guide to the performance of the specific block, including annotated ultrasound screen captures to help visualise nerves. The tips tab contains useful advice related to the selected block, also included is advice on the use of ultrasound and local anaesthetics.\n\nA must have app for both junior and senior anaesthetic staff as well as practitioners working within regional anaesthesia.\n\nThe blocks are:\n\nInterscalene & Mapping\nSupraclavicular & Mapping\nInfraclavicular\nAxillary x 2 & Mapping\nRadial Nerve & Mapping\nMedian Nerve & Mapping\nUlnar Nerve & Mapping\nTAP\nFemoral Nerve & CPNB\nSaphenous Nerve\nPopliteal Sciatic\nPECS1\nPECS2\nPECS1 and 2 combined\nSerratus anterior\n\nDedicated nerve mapping videos now make orientating yourself with anatomy even easier. Using demonstrator video interlinked with annotated live ultrasound scanning can help you to locate and track nerves and other relevant anatomy. (The nerve mapping videos will be available as online content to cut down on the size of the app, an internet connection will be required to access these.)More blocks will be added to this app, contact us to let us know what you would like to see in future updates.\n\nwww.raguru.com\n\nThis App is exactly what it says it is - it’s a guide. It doesn’t set out to replace a standard text book. It certainly isn’t a substitute for a sound knowledge of anatomy and local anaesthetic pharmacology. It’s more of a guide to the occasional blocker, a refresher to the more experienced, and a teaching aid to the trainer. \n\nWe are a busy hospital with a heavy teaching commitment. Therefore we choose to use nerve stimulation in conjunction with ultrasound as we feel it adds another layer of safety to the patient, and reassurance to the operator."

      "label": "Behaviour of concern is an app designed to keep track of the levels of arousal at different times of the day in order to be able to draw conclusions about the behavioural patterns of violent outbursts and conflicts. The app was developed in collaboration with psychologists who have long experience of using the low arousal approach and working with persons displaying behaviours of concern.\n \nThe Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare recommends the low arousal approach in the treatment of people with inadequate affect regulation, in order to, in the moment, prevent or reduce behaviours of concern. This may involve, for example, people with autism spectrum disorders and ADHD. It can also involve children who are developing, and in their attempts towards independence have difficulties with affect regulation.\n \nThe app can be used by professionals or parents who need help to see patterns in everyday life and by doing that try to create changes that reduce unwanted behaviours and increase positive interactions.\n \nThis is a tool that facilitates tracking of severe behaviours of concern and outbursts that disrupt daily life. Warning behaviours, which are a bit lower in their level of arousal, but still signal that everything is not going smooth, may also be tracked using the app. After a period of use, it will be possible to see if there are days or times of the day where outbreaks and chaos are recurring. If you make changes in everyday routines or in response to a conflict situation, you can, after some time, find out if the changes have had an effect on the amount of outbursts.\n \nBy using the tool, working proactively and managing behaviours of concern using the low arousal approach, we can avoid serious conflicts and dangerous restraints. The low arousal approach is a method that protects the right of children and functionally-challenged individuals not to be subjected to practices that are dangerous or that can be perceived as offensive.\n \nIf you want to learn more about how to understand and deal with behaviours of concern, you can read the literature by among others, psychologist Bo Hejlskov Elvén, about the low arousal approach and behaviour of concern.\n \nThe founders of the website \"Pedagogiskt kapital\", Daniel Elvén and Carita-Li Smyth, together with other psychologists, want to provide different perspectives on how we can solve problems in a way that increases people's experience of participation and security.\n\nIMPORTANT: Handle collected data with care since it can contain personal information."

It is a handy tool to learn Biochemic Cell Salts in details and apply them in your practice.\n\nThe Biochemic Tissue Salts also known as Biochemic Cell Salts or Schuessler Tissue Salts. This Biochemic system of medicine is a simple and rational science of therapeutics gifted to us by Dr. Schussler from Germany. The Biochemic system of medicine derives its name from the Greek word 'Bios' meaning 'Life' and 'Chemistry' meaning 'a branch of natural science dealing with the composition of substances and their properties and reactions'. Hence in the most literal sense, 'Biochemistry' means 'Chemistry of Life'. \n\nIt is a unique branch of therapeutics that is based on the Law of Deficiency. Professor Moleschott, of Rome says, \"The structure and vitality of the organs depend upon the presence of the necessary quantities of inorganic constituents.\" \n\nThe principle of this valuable science is based on the concept that deficiency of inorganic salts causes disharmony in the functioning of a cell, which when supplemented in requisite proportion, restores this disharmonious functioning. Thus the Biochemic system of medicines assist the body's natural efforts towards cure by supplementing these salts that are deficient in certain tissues.\n\nThe App has in-depth explanation of below twelve tissue salts :\n\n1. Calcarea Fluor (Fluoride of Lime or Calcium) CaF2\n\n2. Calcarea Phos (Phosphate of Lime or Calcium) Ca3 (PO4) 2\n\n3. Calcarea Sulph (Sulphate of Lime or Calcium) CaSO4 12H2O\n\n4. Ferrum Phos (Phosphate of Iron) FE (PO4) 2\n\n5. Kali Mur (Chloride of Potash) KCl\n\n6. Kali Phos (Phosphate of Potash) K2HPO4\n\n7. Kali Sulph (Sulphate of Potash) K2SO4\n\n8.

      "label": "Eye color is a physical trait determined by the pairing of genes from both the parents. The baby inherits 50% of eye color genetics material from each of its parents. Genes mutate to give alternative forms called alleles, and each allele slightly differs from the other. There are three pairs of alleles responsible for eye color with each allele giving either brown, green or blue. The brown allele is dominant over green and blue; green is dominant over blue and blue is recessive.\n\nThe newborn's eye color depends on both the parents' eye color and whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. The child may get two dominant alleles from the parents, one dominant one recessive or two recessive alleles.\n\nThe child will have brown eyes if it receives a recessive allele (blue) from one parent and a dominant allele (brown) from the other parent.\nBaby blue eyes depends if it receives blue alleles from both the parents. Since blue is recessive and there is no dominant allele, the child will have blue eyes.\n\nThe child will have green eyes if it receives green alleles from both the parents or one green and one blue allele.\n\nMost of the babies born with blue eyes because the newborns take time for producing the pigment melanin."

The indications are not advice and should not be treated as such. No endorsement of any treatment or medication is implied; in addition to using this application and before any decision to treat hypertension, you should seek informed medical advice. Consult your physician to interpret the data collected.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: This application is intended to keep your blood pressure and weight readings for medical follow-up. In this case, this application is NOT a blood pressure monitor and cannot replace it. This means that you will not be able to measure your blood pressure directly from the application. Use an appropriate medical blood pressure monitor.\r\n\r\nHypertension must be taken very seriously. Beyond a simple risk factor, it is a real chronic disease. Its constant progression is the consequence of the evolution of our lifestyles, in particular a diet too rich in fats and salt, as well as a decrease in physical activity.\r\n\r\nIn addition to monitoring your blood pressure, this application will also allow you to closely monitor your weight. High blood pressure is a well-known cardiovascular risk factor that is often associated with being overweight. Generally, if weight increases, blood pressure increases as well.\r\n\r\nAlthough it cannot be cured, hypertension can be treated very well. Effective treatments now make it possible to live longer and without disabling complications. But only if you know that you have high blood pressure!\r\nTo avoid being one of them, remember to measure your blood pressure regularly, at home or at your doctor's.\r\nIf you are already taking a medication, try to follow it carefully: compliance is essential in controlling your hypertension!\r\nYou should also know that treatment can only be effective if you also follow simple lifestyle rules.\r\nYour involvement in your management and follow-up by your doctor will help you reduce the risks associated with hypertension as much as possible.\r\n\r\nA single reading at your doctor's office does not always reflect reality because blood pressure varies according to your state of fatigue, emotionality, stress... To reduce the risk of error, you can take your blood pressure yourself, with an adapted blood pressure self-monitoring device that you can buy in stores or any pharmacy. (note: this application is not a device to measure your blood pressure; you need an adapted medical blood pressure monitor).\r\n\r\nThe \"Blood Pressure and Weight\" application allows you to better track your hypertension and weight. You can edit a report of your self-measurements (pdf or paper) that you can send to your doctor. The history of measurements will allow your doctor to visualize at a glance the evolution of your hypertension and weight over time.\r\n\r\nFor any suggestion to improve this application, do not hesitate to contact us directly by e-mail: info@datasite.fr"

The software gives a diagnostic suggestion to the user based on pre-set intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being a resource for educational material (explanatory video, questionnaires, documents related to respiratory health guidelines), the SPIRO© application guides the user in applying the guidelines in respiratory health by providing the necessary references (scientific articles, respiratory health guidelines) to develop a treatment plan.\r\n\r\nThe app allows:\r\n- Optimizing interpretation of spirometry;\r\n- Obtaining a diagnostic suggestion;\r\n- Obtaining a treatment suggestion according to respiratory guidelines;\r\n- Getting quick access to respiratory health guidelines;\r\n- Facilitating the work of health professionals;\r\n- Carrying out better follow-up of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma;\r\n- Obtaining continuing education through specific and relevant educational material. \r\n\r\nThis tool was developed by the Chair in Knowledge Translation, Education and Prevention in Respiratory and Cardiovascular Health affiliated with Laval University in collaboration with the IUCPQ-UL."

      "label": "This is the successor the the popular, award-winning, best selling, doctor recommended pain tracking app, My Pain Diary: Chronic Pain & Symptom Tracker.\n\nThis version, My Pain Diary: GOLD EDITION, strikes a delicate balance between ease-of-use and a broad feature-set. This is a truly USEFUL app, and the newest member of the My Pain Diary family, which has helped over 90,000 chronic pain sufferers better manage their pain, improve communication with their doctors, and gain insights that would be hard attain through other means.\n\nUseful and popular features include automatic weather fetching, iCloud sync, basic medication tracking, photo attachments, graphs and PDF doctor's reports.\n\nThis app is highly customizable. Everyone tracks pain differently, and this is a framework that supports just about any tracking strategy.\n\nCreated by a chronic pain patient to track, manage, and report on chronic pain and symptoms, chronic illness, and mental health.\n\nThat means there is no big company with deep pockets supporting this project. I am just one man with a chronic pain condition, a demanding day job, and a young family to care for. I just happen to be formally trained in design, self-taught in programming, experienced at marketing and customer relations, and am a chronic pain patient myself. That's a very rare combination of traits that is hard to come by, so I'm making the most of it, and holding my own against the big players.\n\nEnough about me, back to the app!\n\nFeatures:\n+   iCloud Sync Support\n+   Universal App\n+   Highly Customizable\n+   Easy to use \n+   Track unlimited conditions\n+   Track multiple/unlimited times per day\n+   Add past entries (change entry timestamp)\n+   Edit past entries\n\nANATOMY OF A PAIN DIARY ENTRY\n\nTRACKERS: Trackers can be thought of as labels or folders that categorize and differentiate your entries. These are the key to tracking more than one condition and comparing conditions to each other.\n\nA common strategy is to name the Trackers after the diseases/conditions that you will be tracking. I.e. Migraines, Anxiety, Fibromyalgia, etc. These are just examples. \n\nMETRICS: Each entry is composed of one or more optional pieces of information called 'Metrics'. For example, two commonly used metrics are 'Pain Intensity' and 'Pain Duration'. Metrics are associated with and shared amongst your Trackers. This means that you can set it up to use different metrics for different Trackers, keeping your entry pages clean and the cognitive load low.\n\n -- MEDICATION TRACKING --\n+   Basic medication tracking.\n\n -- IMPORTANT EVENTS --\n+   Record important events that aren't suited for a Pain Diary entry. i.e. Medical Procedures, Therapy Sessions, A slip and fall, etc.\n\n -- HISTORY --\n+    Color-Coded Calendar - Spot patterns and trends at a glance. Calendar days are colored based on the day's highest recorded Intensity.\n+   Fully searchable.\n+   Day View\n\n -- GRAPHS --\n+   Visualize and compare intensity over time with this interactive graph. Plot and compare up to 3 'Trackables' at once and one optional Weather Metric.\n+   Email, print and share a PDF of the Graph.\n\n -- REPORTS --\n+   Create a PDF Report for your Doctors or for archival purposes. Share the Report via email and other standard methods.\n+   Include Graph\n+   Include Pain Scale Descriptions\n+   Include Color-Coded-Calendar\n+   Include Medication Log\n+   Include Important Events\n\n -- TOOLS --\n+   Automatic Weather Fetching\n+   Pain Scale Editor\n+   Units preference - US/Imperial or XUS/Metric\n\n\nWant to see the app in action?

Tinnitus HQ helps you understand and relieve your tinnitus symptoms.\n\nRecent research shows that tinnitus can be treated by listening to sounds that have been filtered to remove your specific tinnitus frequencies.*\n\nWith Tinnitus HQ, you can apply advanced filters to over 500 high-quality sounds to find relief for your symptoms.\n\nSimply apply a bandpass filter to any sound or mix to isolate frequencies in a narrow range. Move this filter up and down the frequency range until it closely matches the ringing frequency in your ears. \n\nAdd a bandstop filter at these frequencies to any sound or mix to create your tinnitus mask.\n\nThe advanced filters can be applied to both ears or just one ear, and different frequency ranges can be used for each ear.\n\nYou can set a wide range of filter widths from 0.1 to 4.0 octaves, down to 1Hz resolution.\n\nAnd you can adjust the volume level in each ear with a single balance control.\n\nWith Tinnitus HQ you can create advanced natural-sounding tinnitus masks to help relieve your tinnitus symptoms. \n\nTinnitus HQ features:\n\n• Over 500 high-quality natural sound recordings\n• Precision bandpass and bandstop filters to identify and mask ringing frequencies\n• Wide frequency range: 128 Hz to 16 kHz\n• Filter widths from 0.1 to 4.0 Octaves, settable to 1Hz resolution\n• Two-ear and single-ear filtering capability\n• Independent Left-Right ear filter frequencies and widths\n• Left-Right ear volume balance control\n• Easy-to-create blended mixes of any 4 sounds\n• Runs in background while using other apps or when the screen is locked\n• Timer with slow audio fade-out\n• Beautiful high-definition images from around the globe\n• Modern easy-to-use interface\n• 15 different natural sound categories, including Rain, Rivers & Streams, Ocean, Lakes, Wind, Water Fountains, Fire, Birds, Crickets & Insects, Cars, Trains, Public Places, Household, Industrial, Soundscapes.\n\nDownload Tinnitus HQ now.\n\n\n* See http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0138595, http://www.pnas.org/content/107/3/1207.full, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2918775/ for descriptions of notched sound therapy and its positive results.\n\n* Please talk with your doctor about ringing in the ears and any other symptoms.

Using this feature, it’s incredibly easy to share pivotal critical care trials with students, residents, and other colleagues.\n\nThe database features 150+ landmark trials related to: ARDS, cardiac arrest, DVT/PE, delirium, glycemic control, heart failure, hemorrhage, meningitis, nephroprotection, nutrition, pneumonia, sedation, seizure, sepsis/shock, spinal cord injury, stroke, and subarachnoid hemorrhage – with more trials and topics to be added on a regular basis!\n\nThis app is designed and maintained by Sean P. Kane, PharmD, BCPS -- a clinical pharmacist specializing in critical care with a background in information technology and application development."

      "label": "The VBAC Calculator is a convenient tool for predicting  the success rate of a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC). The app consists of 3 calculators which use patient-specific data in order to generate a predictive score.\n\nThe \"Standard\" calculator uses the widely-used predictive model published in Grobman, William A., et al., “Development of a nomogram for prediction of vaginal birth after cesarean delivery,” Obstetrics & Gynecology, volume 109(4), pp. 806-812, 2007. This predictive model uses pre-pregnancy BMI and prior medical history to predict VBAC success rates. It can be used at any time during the term of pregnancy during a clinical visit.\n\nThe \"Standard + Admission Factors\" calculator is a variant of the 2007 Grobman prediction method as found in the following publication: Grobman William A., et al., “Does information available at the time of admission for delivery improve prediction of successful birth after cesarean?” American Journal of Perinatology, volume 26(10), pp.693-701, 2009. This model uses additional information at time of hospital admission to predict VBAC success rates.\n\nLastly, the \"Simple\" calculator also uses information at time of admission (same as the \"Standard + Admissions Factors\" calculator). The source for this predictive calculator is: Metz, Tori D., et al., “Simple, validated vaginal birth after cesarean delivery prediction model for use at the time of admission,” Obstetrics & Gynecology, volume 122(3), pp.571-578, 2013. This is a straight-forward prediction method that combines BMI and age information with the well-known Bishop Score calculation to determine VBAC success.\n\nPlease note that is app is provided solely for educational purposes and should not be used in lieu of sound, professional medical guidance."

The included calculations are to be used as a resource with the understanding that the user’s medical knowledge and clinical judgment may supersede the output information.  Like any tool, it is never a substitute for clinical judgment.  Every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of DVM Calc’s content, but all results must be confirmed before use.  By purchasing this application the user releases the designers/developers/sellers from liability.\n\nDesigner: John C. Chandler, DVM, MS, DACVS\nProgrammer: Cody Brown Trumpetfish Productions"

      "label": "EchoLab presents the formulas and algorithms used daily in the adult echocardiography laboratory. Designed by a practicing cardiologist and echocardiographer, EchoLab provides a comprehensive framework for teaching the principles of quantitative echocardiography, or cardiac ultrasound. EchoLab's unique design permits sharing of entered and calculated data between its many formulas, with no need to re-enter data when shifting to a new calculation. Quick Entry views provide immediate access to a wide array of echocardiographic calculations to fuel the Analytic Engine.\n\nUnique to EchoLab among echocardiography applications is the powerful Analytic Engine, which synthesizes results from multiple calculations into a cohesive overview with a comprehensive summary, with integration of ASE/EACVI guidelines. The included companion app for the Apple Watch provides a ready reference when performing or interpreting echocardiograms.\n\nEchoLab displays all data with an assessment of each variable as normal or abnormal by adult criteria. Available with each formula is a graphical display of the corresponding mathematical equation, along with tips for using the calculation and medical literature references with integrated hyperlinks.\n\nCalculations and analyses include:\n\n• Aortic effective regurgitant orifice area\n• Aortic energy loss index\n• Aortic flow acceleration time with ratio to left ventricular ejection time\n• Aortic prosthetic paravalvular regurgitant extent\n• Aortic regurgitant fraction\n• Aortic regurgitant jet width, jet area, pressure half-time, and vena contracta\n• Aortic regurgitation index (for TAVR, from invasive pressure measurements)\n• Aortic root assessment\n• Aortic transvalvular flow rate\n• Aortic valve area (from velocity and velocity-time integrals, including dobutamine stress with projected aortic valve area)\n• Aortic valve resistance\n• Aortic valvulo-arterial impedance (Zva)\n• Body mass index\n• Body surface area\n• Cardiac output and ejection fraction (3D, area-length, Doppler, Dumesnil, Teichholz, simplified Quinones, and Simpson's methods)\n• Diastolic assessment (using either 2009 or 2016 guidelines for analysis)\n• Diastolic stress echocardiography\n• echocardiographic Pulmonary to Left Atrial Ratio (ePLAR)\n• Exercise stress echocardiography\n• Hemodynamic summary\n• Left atrial pressure\n• Left and right atrial volume and index\n• Left ventricular diastolic diameter index\n• Left ventricular dP/dt\n• Left ventricular fractional shortening\n• Left ventricular GLS\n• Left ventricular mass, mass index, and relative wall thickness\n• Left ventricular myocardial performance index\n• Left ventricular stroke work loss\n• Maximum predicted heart rate (for dobutamine and exercise stress)\n• Maximum rate-pressure product (for exercise stress)\n• Mean arterial pressure\n• Mitral effective orifice area (PISA and stroke volume methods)\n• Mitral regurgitant fraction (PISA and stroke volume methods)\n• Mitral regurgitant vena contracta\n• Mitral valve area (continuity, PISA, and pressure half-time methods)\n• Mitral valve resistance\n• Mitral valvuloplasty score\n• Pericardial effusion (size and flow velocity paradoxus)\n• Prosthetic aortic and mitral valve assessment\n• Pulmonary artery systolic pressure (using tricuspid regurgitant velocity, VSD flow velocity, or pulmonary artery acceleration time), diastolic pressure, and mean pressure\n• Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure\n• Pulmonary vascular resistance\n• Right atrial pressure\n• Right ventricular-arterial coupling\n• Right ventricular function: dP/dt, fractional area change, index of myocardial performance, lateral annular plane systolic excursion, size, and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE)\n• Shunt ratio (Qp:Qs)\n• Systemic vascular resistance\n• Tricuspid regurgitant vena contracta\n• Tricuspid valve area (pressure half-time method)\n\nEchoLab is a teaching and reference application, not a tool for clinical diagnosis, clinical decision-making, or echocardiography report generation."

      "label": "An amazing dog health monitor app that allows you to listen to your dog's heartbeat (using just your iPhone microphone), then record and share with your Vet. Whether it is a Black Labrador or a Daschund,  Snoopy will work with any breed of dog. No Accessories required. Designed to help dog breeds who may be prone to dog heart murmurs.\n\nHowever, we strongly recommend using Airpods or bluetooth headphones for listening to and recording your dog's heartbeat.\n\n\"Yes, it works. Very cool.\" Craig Laws, Beta Tester and his Border Collie, Storm. \n\n\nHELPING DOG HEART MURMURS / CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE (CHF)\nOver 60% of all dogs who are 5 years old or more have a dog heart murmur. Snoopy helps track and monitor your dog's health by regularly recording their heart rate and rhythm. Ideal for those at risk of dog heart murmur.\n\n- Irregular heartbeat or racing pulse\n- Hacking, persistent cough\n- Excessive panting even when resting\n- Lack of energy or appetite\n- Collapsing or fainting\n- Gums and/or tongue are bluish in color\n- Severe water retention\n\nSnoopy allows you to:\n- Listen to, record and share your dog's heartbeat\n- Log data about your dog over time\n- Share data and recordings with your vet for them to check your dog remotely\n\nDeveloped with pet owners like you in mind: A trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record the dog heart beat regularly to share with your vet online - thus saving on expensive trips.\n\nThe quality of the recordings are unrivalled. Snoopy has been extensively tested on various dog breeds of all shapes and sizes from border collies to black labradors and spaniels, including those with congestive heart failure and using cardalis app.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Mike and his dog, Freddie.\n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work on all dog breeds?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the dog's heartbeat sounds and, using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear. It takes time, technique and patience.\n\nThe app will work on all breeds including puppy heart rates! Ideal for owners concerned about their dog's heart health or dogs with CHF (congestive heart failure) or using cardalis.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Snoopy. If you are struggling DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use your phone's internal microphone to attempt to listen to and record your dog's heart rate. We recommend the use of Bluetooth headphones for better sound and generally dog's prefer this but it isn't required to use the app.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Snoopy Dog Heartbeat has been precisely engineered to listen to dog heartbeat sounds, then record and amplify them. \n2. It works best when the dog is lying down and with Airpods or Bluetooth headphones.\n3. Wet your dog's hair around the heart to ensure a good connection with the skin. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room.\n4. Our simple recording management makes it easy.\n5. Take a dog selfie if you wish and share.\n6. Track and monitor your dog's health weekly.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nYou can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email to send over to your vet.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Snoopy to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super-sensitive in the heartbeat range. Snoopy doesn't fake the heartbeat. \n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13, 13 Max, 12, 12 Max, X, Xs, XR, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+. We don't support iPad. Use the device on Airplane mode.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo. Under no circumstances is Snoopy a substitute for veterinary consultation. Please consult a professional for any advice. \n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/snoopydoghealth\n\nDog heart murmurs can be found in all breeds of dog."

Tuner T1 Pro also comes with a handy Tone Generator that plays any musical note as reference for tuning. A must-have tool for musicians.\n\n• Simple to use with all the essential features.\n• Live pitch graph displays the exact pitch, note and deviation in realtime.\n• Extremely accurate (can be tuned to an accuracy of ±0.1 cents).\n• Tone generator that can generate reference tones over a note-range of 3 octaves.\n• Ability to set the frequency of A₄ (for tunings where A₄ is not 440 hertz).\n• Option to visualize pitch on piano keys.\r\n• Option to set detection latency - By setting a lower latency value, pitch detection will be faster. This works great for cases like vocal practice. By using a higher latency, pitch detection will not respond to momentary unintended sounds and noise (works great for instrument tuning).\r\n• Smart Detection - Use machine learning to enable pitch detection only when certain instruments or vocal sounds are detected."

You can construct outstanding melodic pads or atonal soundscapes from different kind of built-in or downloaded samples by using all power of multi-layered oscillators, chains of filters and effects, envelope generators and low frequency oscillators. Or you can create your own sound scenes combining oscillators presets from build-in library. Or just use predefined scenes. \n\nVery flexible settings of each module give you a great opportunity for creating unique and colorful sounding from usual instruments or natural samples and adding automated changes and spatial effects for an endless variations. Different ways of assigning screen and MIDI keyboards to the oscillators provide very advanced features to control the sound. The on-screen keyboard is adapted to create special effects and varying the continuous textures and drones.\n\nThe Designer tool uses the neural network to generates new presets based on already existing by adding some random variations and checking the result so that the new preset remains similar to the selected pattern.\n\nKey features:\n\n- Three independent oscillators.\n- Three layers for each oscillator.\n- Six voices for each layer.\n- Six envelope generators.\n- Six low frequency oscillators.\n- Arpeggiator / sequencer for each oscillator.\n- Designer tool for generate scenes and presets.\n- General processing of level, balance, LPF, HPF for each layer.\n- Three slots for filters and effects after each oscillator.\n- Twenty additional selectable filters and effects.\n- Spatial mixer with two different sound space.\n- Screen keyboard adapted for continuous textures and soundscapes.\n- Predefined set of keyboard scales and custom scales.\n- Full screen, double and split features for screen keyboard.\n- Options of screen keyboard for pitch, continuous, modify, velocity.\n- Supports for two virtual and two MIDI keyboards at the same time.\n- Flexible assigning keyboards and controls to the oscillators.\n- Two main effects controls can combine several parameters.\n- Uploading samples thru Dropbox, Web access, clipboard.\n- Auto and manual tuning of samples with frequency analyzer.\n- Set of predefined and ready-to-use scenes and presets. \n- Built-in library of samples of instruments, synths, noises, etc.\n- Possibility to pack and share scenes and samples as single file.\n- Supports loop points and note info in WAV files.\n- Detailed application description (built-in and PDF file).\n- Inter-App audio compatible (with transport and BPM controls).\n- Supports Audiobus 3 with \"State Saving\" and MIDI features.\n- Supports Ableton Link with start / stop sync.\n\nRequirements:\n\nRecommended at least iPhone 6 / iPad Mini 4 / iPad Air 2 and higher.\n \nYou can find more details about SynthScaper on the website:\n\nhttp://motion-soundscape.blogspot.com\n\nOverview and demo video:\n\nPreview - http://youtu.be/qqeWdFVfBCg\nPreview - http://youtu.be/vyKX0ZfJ_n8\nSound design demo - http://youtu.be/oqCz7ALNhOM\nPresets demo - http://youtu.be/-pflmiFtHnc\nPresets demo - http://youtu.be/InWOcfHS6rA"

ZOA includes unique features, such as note values based on the golden ratio for maximum generative fun.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Interact with the Game of Life by touching the grid to toggle cell states\n- Define your musical palette by configuring the grid settings\n- Create a complex dance between four independent voices\n- Free your hands to explore your synthesizers as ZOA plays them for you\n- Includes ten factory presets to give you a feel for what ZOA is capable of\n- Explore a focused, yet deep set of parameters\n    - Grid Settings\n        - Root note\n        - Octave shift\n        - Scale (see below for available scales)\n        - Octave range\n    - Game of Life Settings\n        - Grid size (8x8 and 16x16)\n        - Auto or manual generation advance\n        - Rate of new generations (in beat time from 16 bars to 32nd T)\n        - Auto or manual grid respawn\n    - Voice Settings\n        - Four voices with independent settings\n        - Enable/disable\n        - Rate of play (in beat time from 16 bars to 32nd T)\n            - Includes unique note values based on the Golden Ratio for maximum generative fun!\n        - Length of note (10% to 100%)\n        - Variety of rules for moving through grid (see below for list)\n        - Pitch offset\n        - Unique pattern control for creating rhythms and polymeters, now with step options\n            - Easily add holds, ties, accents (positive and negative!), ratchets, and trig conditions\n        - MIDI velocity and channel\n- Flexible Connectivity\n    - Use in a compatible audio unit host like AUM, or in standalone mode\n    - Control multiple instruments at once with five MIDI outputs\n        - One for all voices together, and one for each voice by itself\n    - Set the key and octave shift on the fly with MIDI input\n    - Sync to the tempo of other devices using Ableton Link or MIDI clock (standalone)\n    - Send MIDI clock to external synths (standalone, experimental feature)\n    - Connect to Bluetooth MIDI devices\n    - Modulate ZOA's parameters in a compatible AUv3 host (audio unit)\n    - Eight unique MIDI CC outputs derived from ZOA’s game of life simulation\n        - Population density, fertility, mortality, stability, and per-voice random\n    - Includes macOS app!\n\n\nIMPORTANT:\nZOA can be used as a standalone app or as an AUv3 plugin. There are some important differences between the two. The standalone app features a simple, toggleable \"Sidekick Synth\" so you can quickly experiment with ZOA. Of course, you can also send MIDI from the standalone app. Meanwhile, the ZOA AUv3 plugin does NOT generate sound. Instead, you use it to send MIDI (note messages) to other apps, plugins, or hardware instruments that do the actual sound generation. AUv3 plugins must be used inside a compatible host. \n\n\nAvailable Scales\n    - Major Pentatonic, Minor Pentatonic, Major, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Minor, Locrian, Blues, Whole Tone, Harmonic Minor, Melodic Minor, Chromatic\n\nAvailable Voice Rules\n    - Up, Down, UpDown, DownUp, First, Last, Random, Walk, Rise, Fall\n\n\nView manual: https://www.audiosymmetric.com/manuals.html\nView tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Uka-nFom-pgTB-DftgDvA"

As a independent developer, I made this app for quality and ease, not for a company or money. The most valuable feature of it is more than 4000 chords would help you to search your curiosity about the chords in detail. Also, I use beautiful UI to not feel boring when you use this app. That, I insist, is the most beautiful app because I made this app for myself at first.\n\n Searching Chord\nIn this app, chord searching following two ways.\nFirst one is usual text searching that you can see in everywhere. The second one is intuitive text searching. The function of the second one is that just for the touching the guitar board, the exact fret and the chord will be searched. The function what you need is in this app clearly. More than 4000 chords, powerful search function. I’ve been trying to satisfy these two functions and I will advance continuously.\n\nFor the beginner,\nOF course here are 28 chords for the beginner. Simply, for the beginner, giving them a motive is more proper work than showing handy functions. Are you sizzling for playing guitar? Do your heart are full of learning a new instrument? Start the app and Grab your guitar! Just one strumming is already a half done. If you need to memorize some chords while you practicing, just remember you are having this app.\n\nThis will be huge help for you."

      "label": "Note reading made fun! Note Rush is a game for practising note reading on the music staff to help you learn to play the piano, keyboard, flute, saxophone, violin... you name it! Note Rush shows you one note at a time in random order then uses the microphone to listen as you play through them like you would with note reading flash cards, only these flash cards check that you're playing the right note! \n\nPlay with a bunch of fun themes and race to earn stars and beat your best time! Note Rush is great for teaching keyboard geography by making sure each note is played in the correct octave. An indispensable music theory must-have for learning sight reading at all levels of music education.\n\n\"Great app for learning notes!\" - App Store Review.\n\n\"So much better than flash cards! My son loves using this app and his note reading has improved tremendously since starting. I'm thankful he can do this on his own and it keeps track of his high scores which is highly motivating for him.\" - App Store Review.\n\n\"A blockbuster hit with teachers and students... I especially like using it at group lessons.\" - Leila Viss, 88pianokeys.me \n\n\"Note Rush has quickly become my favorite app for piano teaching.\" - Joy Morin, colorinmypiano.com\n\n\"Note Rush is a motivating app that engages students to improve quickly with their note reading skills. It is definitely one of my top favorites and will be used often!\" - Jennifer Foxx, musiceducatorresources.com\n\n\"Note Rush is a great way to review notes for the One Minute Club.\" - Susan Paradis, susanparadis.com\n\n*** Having trouble? See noterushapp.com/troubleshooting for help. ***\n\nListens to Your Instrument\n------------------------------\nNote Rush helps students learn a strong association between notes on the page and keys on your instrument by using your device's microphone to detect when you play each note. Works with pianos, keyboards, flutes, violins, you name it! (See Q&A below for more about supported instruments.)\n\nStudent-paced\n------------------\nNote Rush goes as fast or as slow as the student, with no time limits, so is suitable for complete beginners right through to being a fun challenge even for teachers!\n\nGrand Staff Context\n-----------------------\nThe whole grand staff is always visible, showing each note in full context and helping students improve their note recognition across the two staves.\n\nOctave-Sensitive Keyboard Geography\n---------------------------------------------\nIt's a \"B\", but which \"B\"?? Note Rush teaches keyboard geography by making sure you're getting the note in the right octave every time.\n\nGreat for Home Practise\n-------------------------\nStudents will rush to their instrument at home every day with NoteRush, chasing stars and high scores! Unlike flash cards, children can drill note identification at home with no music-reading parent required to check if they're getting them correct - Note Rush checks for you! Play every day and you'll be great at reading piano music in no time.\n\nLevels\n-------\nNote Rush has fifteen built-in Levels, from Middle C-Position right through to the full grand staff with 2 ledger lines above and below. There are Levels for Treble Clef, Bass Clef or full Grand Staff! Or make your own levels to practise reading specific notes, with sharps and flats for an added challenge!\n\nBetter Than Flash Cards!\n-------------------------\nUse Note Rush instead of printed flash cards! Note Rush was designed to replace the cards used in One Minute Club - a challenge you can run in your studio where students have to complete a given level in under a minute. Give it a try!\n\n--\nNote Rush is made by Thomas Grayston, a software developer, pianist, and husband to a piano teacher."

Simply tap a key, and AutoPad will provide a tasteful soundscape that plays for as long as you like. Natural crossfades between keys are handled automatically.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Perform with ease. AutoPad has two modes: Live mode gives you instant access to all twelve keys, and setlist mode lets you build a custom list of songs.\n\n- Set the mood. AutoPad comes with 10 carefully designed pad sounds. Each one creates a unique atmosphere in all 12 keys.\n\n- Expand your library. You can add to the factory sounds by importing your own pads or by purchasing one of the in-app sound packs.*\n\n- Shape your sound. AutoPad's menu gives you control over crossfade time, high-pass and low-pass filters, reverb amount, pan, and volume.\n\n- Easy on storage. AutoPad's seamlessly looped sample-based drones contain just what you need to provide a pleasing atmosphere and don't take up excessive space on your device.\n\n- Stay in sync. AutoPad features a customizable metronome with a dedicated pan control. Keep your band locked in without needing to lug around a tracks rig.\n\n- Deep MIDI Control. AutoPad's MIDI Actions menu makes it easy to customize how AutoPad responds to your MIDI controller.\n\n- Use with other apps. AutoPad comes with a fully-featured AUv3 plugin! Run AutoPad alongside other music apps in your favorite AUv3 host.\n\n- Now on the Mac. AutoPad runs on macOS! You can use AutoPad as a standalone app or as an AUv3 plug-in in a compatible host.

AutoPad also supports Bluetooth MIDI controllers and AirPlay audio. \n\n- Share with friends. Make sure your band is all on the same page by easily sharing setlists with AirDrop.\n\n- Stay organized. AutoPad lets you save and recall setlists with a simple setlist manager.\n\n- Looks great. AutoPad features a dark color scheme that is easy on the eyes and performs well on the stage.\n\n\nNote on use: \n\nAutoPad sounds great in a variety of contexts, but please make sure you understand the intended use before purchase.\n\nAutoPad's sounds are designed to be played softly and continuously behind live musicians. They include the root, fifth, and octave. As such, they can be used in a major or minor context. When using AutoPad in worship music, it is not necessary to change the pad with each chord change. For example, if you have a song in the key of E, you can play a pad in E for the duration of the song.\n\n\nView Manual: https://www.audiosymmetric.com/manuals.html\nView Tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Uka-nFom-pgTB-DftgDvA\n\n\n* While files of any length can be imported into AutoPad, due to realtime memory restrictions, AutoPad loads a 3.5 minute subsection of files longer than four minutes. A short fade is applied to eliminate pops. See manual for details."

Super simple interface with powerful features.” -- J. Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support.

      "label": "Metronome Touch. Style of pendulum.\n\nMetronome Touch is created with one objective: to design a classic metronome with a unique style, so we combined a precise pendulum, perfected accuracy, and realistic interaction. Made of aluminum and glass, Metronome Touch proves a huge statement: It is as exclusive as your device. Launching Metronome Touch, your device will become a metronome.\n\nAnyone can try to make a metronome app, but success only comes when listening to customers. That's why Metronome Touch centers around functions that musicians are looking for: The ability to tap a beat, use customizable presets to save your favorite sets (bpm, time signature and accentuation), and multiple useful ways of adjusting the bpm. Metronome Touch even goes far beyond that: Neither analog nor digital metronomes can synchronize pendulums. But Metronome Touch can. This opens completely new ways when practicing, performing on stage or doing studio recordings.\n\nShould you be teaching students, they can follow your lesson more accurately while concentrating on their own devices synchronized with Metronome Touch. You will gain your student's attention when using this outstanding technology. If you have ever been on stage with bad acoustics, you will love Metronome Touch: It will provide every single band member with a perfect steady and synchronized rhythm on stage. Even when recording a song in separate soundproofed rooms, Metronome Touch keeps you in perfect sync.\n\nEasily adjust Metronome Touch to your likes and needs with the light or dark design - relying on absolute clear vector-based display graphics  - and many well chosen professional metronome sounds.\n\nMetronome Touch is constantly being developed further to ensure the highest customer satisfaction.\n\nFEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY\n\n• Precise engine \nA completely new developed engine makes this app one of the most precise pendulum metronomes available on the App Store. Highest accuracy is supported on all iOS devices.\n\n• Ableton Link synchronization technology\n Metronome Touch was the first metronome worldwide offering pendulum synchronization on iOS devices. You can keep band members‘ metronomes or a whole orchestra in sync.\nAbleton Link provides new ways of practicing together or in a group. \n\n • Memory function\n There is an infinite number of customizable presets to save your favorite sets of bpm, time signature and accentuation.\n\n • Numerical entry\nUsing bpm display let you directly enter tempo values from 20 up to 999 bpm.\n\n• Tap2bpm \nUse the tap field that will interpret your finger taps as bpm.\n\n• Beat count and accentuation\n Choose a beat count from 1 up to 12 beats and free customizable accentuation.\n\n• Styles and sounds\n Customize Metronome Touch to your likes and needs.

Now with Drum Kit Designer feature and detailed online tutorials.\n\nFeatured in Modern Drummer 'New and Notable' - July 2018  \n\n\"an invaluable aid not only for drummers but also studio engineers and producers\" - Sound on Sound Magazine\n\n\"I can’t recommend this app highly enough ... for the money, it is indispensable. It's simple, accurate, looks good, and the tuning information is worth the cost of the app alone.\" - www.mikedolbear.com\n\n“***** I never knew I could have this much fun tuning drums!” – Adamrod (App Store review)\n\n“***** Just tuned my first drum and this app is awesome!” – bburt85 (App Store review)\n\n“***** Buy this app if you are a drummer!!!” Lildrummerboy (App Store review)\n\nThe original and most innovative electronic drum tuning app - iDrumTune Pro brings unrivalled accuracy and features that have never been possible before for assisting with drum tuning. Built by world experts in drums and musical acoustics, and backed up by a detailed online training course on Drum Sound and Drum Tuning.\n\niDrumTune Pro includes the following features:\n\n* Pitch Tuning – to make your drums sing and allow you to play musical phrases around the kit\n\n* Lug Tuning – to ensure that the drumhead is evenly tuned and gives a smooth and warm tone\n\n* Resonant Head Tuning – to allow you to be sure that the two heads are working together and giving rich overtones\n\n* Spectrum Analyzer – so you can really start to understand what frequencies are excited and heard when playing the drums\n\n* Drum Kit Presets – so you can save and load your favourite tunings and share them with the world. Now also includes the interactive Drum Kit Designer feature.\n\n* The Science of Drum Tuning – and extensive manual on the science and art of drum tuning and getting the best out of iDrumTune Pro \n\niDrumTune is the first and by far the most intelligent and accurate system for analyzing drum sounds and assisting tuning – developed by drummers, music producers and acoustics research Professors. iDrumTune provides you with a measurement of the drumhead vibration frequency, much in the same way to an acoustic guitar tuner which measures the vibration frequency of a guitar string. In Pitch Tuning mode, you simply hold the iPhone over the center of a drum, about 2-4 inches away, and strike the drum in the center.\n\nThe iDrumTune readout shows the recorded sound waveform and gives the strongest frequency recorded. There is also a tuning indicator bar which shows the drumhead tuning relative to musical notes, so iDrumTune can be used to ensure that your drums are in key with each other or the song you are playing. A frequency spectrum view also allows more detailed analysis and helps with tuning the drum at the lug positions.\n\niDrumTune provides advanced tuning features including an intelligent filter function, Lug Tuning mode and Resonant Head Tuning mode. The filter allows unwanted frequencies to be ignored by the analysis algorithm, whilst Lug Tuning mode offers the simplest and most innovative method for tuning an even frequency response at the lug positions on the drumhead.\n\nThe Preset Manager allows you to save all your favourite drum tunings and call them up when you are in the middle of the process. Drum kits can also be exported and imported, so you can share your favorite tuning setups and load new ones in from other drummers.\n\nDrum Tuning isn’t easy, and drums don’t respond exactly the same way every time you hit them. For that reason, it's valuable to know a little about the science of drum tuning. iDrumTune includes a comprehensive text on the science of drums and drum tuning in order to help you get the best of iDrumTune and to become an expert drum tuner!\n\nWatch the iDrumTune tutorial videos and read reviews on iDrumTune at www.idrumtune.com"

      "label": "SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps. Studio Six Digital is dedicated to making the iPhone and Touch a professional audio and acoustics test device.\n\nCheck out our full line of professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the professional digital iPhone sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real-time analyzer,  FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the energy-time curve function, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time measurement, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for more great acoustical and audio test apps, have a look at AudioTools, our premier app for audio professionals."

      "label": "Benny Greb, well known for his contributions to the drumming education community, shared the approach that he has taken personally to develop his sense of groove and improve his own timing on his instrument in his course “The Art and Science of Groove”. Now with the Gap Click app, everyone can practice his method easily with a simple-to-use app! \n\nUnlike standard metronomes which simply state the time, Gap Click helps you improve your sense of time. Gap Click is more than a metronome with a focus on improving your ability to keep tempo, become more aware and comfortable with off beat clicks and by that, become bullet proof and accurate with all notes of the subdivision.\n\nGAP CLICK\nBy scrolling through the numbers of bars and patterns you can quickly configure a “gap” of time in which the metronome drops out. When the “one” comes back around, will your playing still be in time? How long of a gap can you play through and still maintain solid tempo?\n\nMOVING CLICK\nNext you can experiment with all kinds of off-beat patterns in the Gap Bar which moves the click from the downbeat position to a different location. Can you still play your instrument and maintain the downbeat internally even when you hear the click sound on an off-beat?\n\nBoth the “click” and the “gap” portion supports a variety of different syncopated patterns allowing you the ability to practice in binary or ternary rhythms - with more or less safety net depending on your settings.\n\nFeatures\n• Ability to choose from a variety of different syncopated patterns and # of measures for both the standard \"click\" as well as the \"gap\"\n• Use the nostalgic click wheel to find the right tempo or tap to set your desired tempo from 10 to 300bpm\n• Standard quarter-note time signatures: 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4\n\nPersonalize\n• See visual feedback for each note or rest that is played\n• Accent beat 1 of each measure or turn accents off for a greater challenge\n• Flash the screen for a visual indication when switching from the \"click\" to the \"gap\"\n• Find your favorite sound from a variety of click samples hand-picked by Benny\n\nBuy Once, Use Forever\n• There are no In-App Purchases - a one time purchase includes all current and future features. \n\nTESTIMONIALS\nWhat professionals are saying about GAP CLICK:\n• \"The skills you can sharpen by using this app are integral for what it takes to be a professional drummer in any genre.\" - Matt Halpern\n• \"When I first opened the app, it made (simple) sense, without a tutorial.\" - Chris Coleman\n• \"This app helps you lock in the pocket on a whole different level.\" - Luke Holland\n• \"The Gap Click app is something that every drummer should have in their toolbox.\" - Jared Falk, Drumeo\n\nWhat our users are saying about GAP CLICK: \n• \"If you think you have good timing, this will really put you in your place.\"\n• \"Gone are the days of programming gap clicks!\"\n• \"I’ve never had so much fun being destroyed in my practice session.\"\n• \"This is by far the best money I’ve ever spent on a practice tool.\"\n\nABOUT BENNY GREB\nBenny Greb is one of the most respected drummers in the world today. Not only has he headlined nearly every major drum festival and toured with his clinics and drum camps worldwide, but he is also recognized as a composer and bandleader in his own band Moving Parts, which won him the renowned “ECHO Jazz” award - the German equivalent to The Grammys in jazz.\n\nBenny Greb published two of the most successful and critically acclaimed educational products, “The Language of Drumming” and “The Art and Science of Groove” and he has helped create many signature products available to drummers today.\n\nFind him online at https://www.bennygreb.de as well as on social media."

Apart from the classic frequency and phase parameters (which make it capable of all of the classic modulation stuff), the waveform can also be shaped by swinging its cycles, bending its curve, squeezing portions of oscillation in the same period of time, scaled and transformed while exceeding its boundaries. An additional Sample and Hold circuit provides quantization for the resulting signal.\n\nA tool you already know, with the most advanced features: simple and powerful.\n\nLFOH! is both an audio processor and a MIDI modulator: while is capable to send its modulation signal out as MIDI CC (according to the MIDI routing flexibility of the app that hosts it), it can also modulate the amplitude of incoming audio. \n\n*** Please note: LFOH! is an Audio Unit extension (AUv3) – it only works in an AUv3 host app like AUM, Drambo, Cubasis, etc... ***"

      "label": "DrumJam is a whole new world of percussion and drums for the iPad, iPhone and iPod touch. Designed by award winning international percussionist Pete Lockett and Sonosaurus LLC, the developer of ThumbJam, this app is a real first for percussion. It's an exciting and powerful tool, opening up the world of rhythm in a completely hands-on and inspiring way. Whether you are a novice just looking for a bit of rhythmic fun, a songwriter or producer looking for a fresh rhythmic idea, a percussion student writing arrangements for a project, a music teacher looking for rhythm ideas to teach, or a drum circle facilitator seeking to expand their repertoire, this app has something for you.\n\nPete Lockett has been top of his game for decades and has performed with the stars, from Peter Gabriel and Bjork to Robert Plant, Dido, Jeff Beck and many more. He has also worked extensively in the film industry, arranging and recording all the ethnic percussion for five Bond 007 films. The app is a direct and personal route to his rhythm factory with all the individual percussion parts recorded by Pete. These are not ineffective sequenced patterns but actual recorded audio waiting to groove with rhythm at multiple tempos through your very own mobile device. \n\nThrough his decades of studio experience Pete has become a master of layering various percussion instruments into mesmerising rhythm fabrics and flowing grooves. Shakers and congas interwoven with Indian ghatam, pop drum set and Arabic req or else a Carnatic kanjira with some Cuban bongos, Latin cowbells, rock drum kit, seed shakes and surdu. There are dozens of different looped instruments to choose from, each with up to 20 different patterns. You can change the levels, alter the pan, mute, solo, and tweak a low-pass filter giving you a great degree of flexibility over each individual part. Or simply press the random button to randomise all (or some) the parts and get some really funky and unexpected changes. It can even automatically randomise periodically for hands-free unpredictability. The excellent time stretch system and multiple-tempo loop recordings mean that you can get great natural sounding audio across a wide tempo range. Change the number of beats to use in the loops to alter time signature.\n\nPick from a wide range of solo instruments where you can jam away over the top of the grooves you create. These include all sorts of ethnic percussion instruments from Kanjira and Ghatam, to Djembe, Bongos, Dube and Cajon, and more. There are also custom drum kits from great drummers such as Johnny Rabb, Russ Miller, KJ Sawka, Dave Langguth, Steve Sidelnyk and Scott Pellegrom. With a detailed and complete range of quantize options performed by simply dragging your fingers around, it is possible for even the absolute novice to get some funky grooves immediately.  \n\nAdditional loops and pad instruments are available for in-app purchase, but rest assured that the base app is loaded with kits and loops!\n\nThere are also incredible filter, pitch bend, delay, reverb, lofi, and distortion effects available for the solo instruments, which really adds a whole new dimension of live performance possibilities. With multiple save and export options, it is possible to record loops or a whole performance to later import into your DAW or other audio app as 44.1kHz 16-bit WAV files. This is great for studio use and can form the basis of a new song idea very easily. \n\nDrumJam supports export via iTunes file sharing, open directly in another app, email, AudioCopy, and export to SoundCloud. There is support for background audio, Audiobus, Inter-app-audio, and a MIDI implementation that supports clock sync in/out, and playing the solo kits externally triggered via MIDI input, or outputting your live pad performance via MIDI output! Also has Ableton Link support!\n\nWhatever you do in music, we are certain there is a use for DrumJam in your world. Give it a try and join forces with an ancient percussive energy."

There's no need to enter the melody for the entire tune. \nYou just enter one motif and Chordana Composer automatically creates a whole tune, so you don't have to spend ages composing the music.\n\nProduct Features\n\n1. Three ways to enter your motif (2-bar melody)　\n\n　A melody that comes to you in the middle of an ordinary day...\nHave you ever thought: “This would make a really great tune.\nBut I need to know how to compose, and it's no good if I can't read music. And that all takes time to learn”?\nChordana Composer will take care of all those concerns.\nJust enter 2 bars of the motif you thought of.\nChordana Composer will automatically make it into an entire tune.\n　You can choose from 3 types of input method.\nIn \"Keyboard input mode\" you use a virtual keyboard, in \"Notation input mode, you paste the notes into a sheet of music, and in \"Microphone input mode\", you just sing the motif into the microphone.\n\n2. Automatic composition by choosing \"Genre\" and \"Concept\"\n\n　Once you've entered the melody using one of the modes above, you're ready for automatic composition.\nChoose whichever combination of \"Genre\", \"Concept\", \"Range of melody movement\" and \"Level of melody tension\" creates a tune that best matches what you've imagined.\n\n3. Your own editing using the Hints function  \n In Notation input mode, you can edit the the created melody yourself.\nIf you enable the Hints function when you're editing the tune, the notation is color coded as a reference for your edits (notes that match the chord, notes in the same scale, notes that increase the tension and other notes you need to be aware of).\n\n4. Using simple steps, you can upload your finished tune as a video to YouTube along with the staff notation, or slideshow of photos. You can also send your tunes as email attachments in AAC or MIDI format, and it's really easy to make your own ringtones*1 too.\n*1: To use your tune as an iPhone ringtone, you need to connect to a Mac or Windows computer and transfer the tune to your iPhone via iTunes."

Swipe to the far right to enable this auto-bump.\n\nDesktop and bedside speaker systems will be much more tantalizing with these throbbing speakers mounted on top. Even blast beats from your home stereo. Corbox can follow along the bumps while charging on the other side of the room if need be.\n\nComes in 4 flavors: classic, sporty yellow, giant speaker and digital levels. Easily swipe left and right to switch up the flavor. Even switch mid-song!\n\nNeed more interactive features? Try tapping out your favorite beat on the screen to watch the speakers bump along with you. This works especially well on the multi-colored level indicator. While you are jamming your taps on the screen please tap safely.\n\nYou may notice some slight speaker movement even when no music is playing. Corbox is sensitive enough to register even the faintest of beats so you can groove on the sly. But don't worry, just pump up the volume when you need it for full-groove action!"

      "label": "Simple mandolin tuner to tune up your mandolin. This is for a standard mandolin, in GDAE tuning.\n\nTuning your mandolin can be a difficult task for you if you are just beginning mandolin. The good news is, the more you do it, the easier it becomes. A nicely tuned mandolin can make your music sound a lot better and help you greatly while you're are just getting the hang of finger placement for notes.\n\nTouch the note for the string you want to tune and then turn the tuning pegs on your mandolin and match it up with the tone that is being played. The thing that is special about mandolins, is that the strings are in pairs of two. Each string in a pair is exactly the same note. The reason why mandolins are like this is because it creates a cool chorus-like effect.\n\nTip: Make several passes tuning each of the strings. For example you might have noticed that if you have tuned all the strings once, and then back to the first one you tuned, it might be off a little bit. This is because you are increasing or decreasing the tension on each of the strings as you tune it and the instrument's body might bend ever so slightly due to this difference in tension. This causes the other strings to slightly change in pitch. So make sure you keep on checking and tuning the strings until all are in tune, so make several passes.\n\nFor more information on how to tune Mandolin visit:\nhttp://www.tuneinstrument.com/how-to.html\n\nAny questions using the App?

      "label": "\"LO‑FI‑AF is a very capable lo‑fi toolkit capable of surgically targeted destruction and it could easily find applications in just about any musical genre\" -SoundOnSound\n\nUnfiltered Audio's lo-fi-af is now available on iOS as a Standalone app or AUv3 plugin!\n\nlo-fi-af takes your sound on a journey of artifacts and noise throughout recorded history, from tape warbles and vinyl noise to MP3 chirps and cell phone speaker chatter. lo-fi-af's many sections and versatile algorithms can place your sound in a different decade, or give it a thoroughly modern spin through compound processing.\n\nThe first section is a convolution reverb preloaded with impulse responses from broken microphones, toy speakers, cell phones, and more. With this section alone, you can place your sound into an entirely different space.\n\nThe Spectral section then splits your sound into thousands of frequencies before reconstructing it with a twist. Here you can reproduce the sound of a pirated MP3 or pitch shift your signal with clean perfection.\n\nYour signal then takes a trip through the digital section. All sorts of hazards are present here, from a skipping CD stutter effect to a multimode bitcrusher.\n\nFinally, the rich, colorful analog section adds that vibe that you crave. A maximizer, a tape saturator, a noise generator, an analog-style filter, a pitch warbler, and a radio demodulator all work together in harmony to toss your sound into the past.\n\nBut wait! That's only one possible signal chain. The Convolution, Spectral, Digital, and Analog sections can be completely rearranged in any order. Dozens of presets will get your started on your sound warping adventure.\n\nAs an AUv3 plugin, lo-fi-af has been tested to work perfectly with Garageband, Drambo, AUM, Cubasis, Beatmaker, Nanostudio, apeMatrix, Loopy Pro, and more! Additionally, with its clear layout and smart resizing, lo-fi-af can be used on tablets and phones with ease.\n\n(Note for Drambo users: Drambo does not yet have automatic Plugin Delay Compensation for managing plugins with latency. As a result, tracks with lo-fi-af will not line up properly with other tracks. An upcoming patch for Drambo will add this feature in.)"

      "label": "Pure Piano is a professional, multi-sampled concert grand piano with a unique Morph Pad that allows you to explore a multitude of sounds ranging from mellow and intimate tones to surreal, cinematic textures. \n\nSimilar to an XY pad in its flat, tactile nature, the Morph Pad offers up nine different core timbres of the piano including percussive, cinematic, bright, and intimate, to name a few. The “pure” piano sits untouched at the heart and center of the space, surrounded by eight more presets for you to explore as you guide your finger seamlessly through the wide-ranging tonal palette of the piano. As you do so, the various timbres blend together allowing you to create your own sounds comprising combinations of neighboring presets for you to save and recall. It doesn’t stop there either. The Morph Pad is linked to the app’s inbuilt EQ, reverb, and delay and so operates as a macro control adding even more to the experience by way of ever-changing texture and atmosphere, all from just one single piano. \n\nPure Piano works as a standalone app or as an AUv3 plug-in within your DAW of choice, and extensive connectivity options allow you to connect to your keyboard controller with ease via USB, direct, or Bluetooth MIDI to experience the sound of a professional grand piano through your headphones or speakers. The app also supports direct connection to your Mac using Inter Device Audio (IDAM). This enables you to easily integrate Pure Piano into your desktop projects by sending MIDI and receiving audio with one single cable, as well as network MIDI and Inter-App Audio for triggering the piano from other apps that you might have installed.   \n\nEquipped with customizable reverb, EQ, and delay, sound creation becomes even more creative. Simply unlink any of the audio effects from the Morph Pad to dial in your own settings. Maybe you want to add a long reverb tail to add some extra atmosphere, tweak the EQ a little or add some delay to a particular sound. It’s up to you. \n\nIf all that isn’t enough, there’s a host of flexible tuning options for when you need them. The stretched, concert piano tuning is how a piano technician would tune the piano for concerts in order to achieve rich tonal chord textures across the entire range. The equal temperament tuning on the other hand is the standard western tuning scheme, best for when layering Pure Piano with other sounds like electric pianos, pads or strings. Also provided is the ability to transpose the piano up or down in either semi-tones or Hz for fine-tune adjustments. \n\nPure Piano is designed and developed by Hamburg-based e-instruments, renowned for their high-end digital recreations of acoustic instruments. \n\nFeature Overview: \n• Interactive Morph Pad - Explore the many timbres of a concert grand\n\n• Nine different sounds - Navigate and blend between nine core sounds\n\n• Studio Quality Audio at Ultra-low Latency\n\n• Extensive Connectivity - Connect via USB, direct, or Bluetooth MIDI. Inter Device Audio (IDAM), Network MIDI, and Inter-App Audio also fully supported\n\n• Standalone and AUv3 plug-in compatible - Plug and play or use within your favourite music production software\n\n• Zynaptiq QREV Reverb - Have fun adding extra atmosphere and depth to your sound\n\n• 3-Band EQ and Delay - Get creative with customizable EQ and Delay, or use the Morph Pad as a macro control\n\n• Save and Load Your Own Presets - Wherever you land on the Morph Pad, if you like the sound you hear – save it and recall it again later\n\n• Flexible Tuning Options - Choose between equal or stretched tuning, and transpose the piano by semitones or Hz\n\n• Customizable velocity curve - Match the response of your keyboard to Pure Piano\n\n• 24-bit, 44.1 kHz\n\n• 1.1GB installation"

      "label": "Brusfri* is a highly advanced audio noise reducer, packed into a simple and straight-forward interface. It is very well suited for cleaning up noisy audio recordings, while retaining sound quality. Unlike many other noise reducers on the market, Brusfri doesn't mess with audio phasing to suppress noise (a technique that often comes with audible side effects). Instead, multiple fine-tuned gates are used to silence unwanted noise.\n\nBrusfri can also be used as a AUv3 plug-in in compatible hosts, for example in GarageBand.\n\n*Brusfri means \"Noise free\" in Swedish.\n\nHere are some examples of sound conditions that Brusfri handles well:\n\n* Guitar amp\n* Noisy vintage gear\n* Boosted pre-amp\n* iPhone/iPad and external mic hiss\n* Room reverb removal\n* Fan noise\n* Background ambiance\n* Mains hum / Electric hum\n\nUsage\n\nIn short, press “Learn” during a couple of seconds of isolated noise to create a \"profile\" for noise. This may be all you need to do.\n\nBrusfri can be used in two ways, either standalone or as a AUv3 plug-in.\n\nStandalone\nImport the audio, either by extracting audio from a video, by importing from iTunes, or by using the “Open In…” option in any other app that can export audio. Press and hold the Learn button (the ear) while playing unwanted noise. (It’s important that the Ear is only fed with isolated noise). When Learn is released, Brusfri will start reducing noise. \n\nAUv3 plug-in\nOpen Brusfri in any AUv3 compatible host.\nFind a region in the recording that only contains noise and play it. \nTap and hold the “LEARN” button for a short while (a second will be enough). When the LEARN button is released, Brusfri will start reducing noise.\n\nThere are a bunch of parameters available that affect the noise reduction algorithm:\n\nATK / THRS / REL (Attack Time / Threshold / Release Time)\nThreshold - basically determines how much noise to be removed. A lower value means more reduction.\nAttack and Release sets the time it will take for the reducer to start working.\n\nLOOKAHEAD\nMakes transient processing a bit smoother.\n\nEDGE\nControls the reduction aggressivity. A lower value gives a smoother reduction.\n\nHPF\nReduces low frequencies.\n\nHIGH\nCompensates high frequencies by boosting them.\n\nMIX\nMixes between dry and noise reduced signal.\n\nNOTE! Brusfri is CPU intensive and iPhone 6 / iPad AIR 2 or better is recommended. When used as an AUv3 plug-in, we highly recommend freezing/bouncing tracks to reduce CPU usage."

      "label": "Grand Finale has been given some much needed love and attention resulting in a major face lift and a some extra horse power under the hood - resulting in Grand Finale 2!  The iOS app now has custom interfaces for iPhone and iPad, and it works both as standalone and as an AUv3 plugin.\n\nGrand Finale 2 is a multi effect audio processing application designed for finalizing complete mixes, stems, voice overs, buses and/or individual audio tracks. The plug-in offers several modules in a pre-routed configuration. Each module has parameters to alter, and most modules offer a set of algorithms to select. These features come together to make Grand Finale a powerful tool for quickly finalizing a track, bus or mix.\n\nUsage:\n\nImport audio files, or extract from a video in the camera roll. Audio can also be imported by using the “Open In..” option in any other app that can export audio.\nUse the playback controls to start and stop playing, and alter the module knobs/options to change how the audio is processed. When satisfied with the result, tap Export to render and save the finalized audio file.\n\nIncluded DSP Modules:\n\nMain bus processing\n\n   • High Pass filter\n\n   • Compressor\n\n   • Multiband Compressor\n\n   • MS Stereo Tool\n\n   • Equalizer\n\n   • Limiter\n\nAdditive/parallel processing\n\n   • Compressor\n\n   • Distortion\n\n\nOther features:\n\n   • Accurate RMS and LUFS metering (tap the meters to swap)\n\n   • 37 professionally made factory presets.\n\n   • Load / Save custom user presets\n\n   • Project manager (load / save full state including audio file data)\n\n   • User manual bundled inside app.\n\n   • Parallel processing is phase linear.\n\n   • Exports to WAV/AIFF/AAC at 16, 24 or 32 bits (sample rate is preserved)\n\n\nListening examples (pre/post) available here: https://soundcloud.com/klevgrandproducts/sets/grand-finale-audio-examples\n \nSaid about Grand Finale:\n\n“The magic behind this plugin is the compressor on the bottom portion, the stereo processor and the incredible EQ section. The bass and treble EQ (in default mode) is the best I've heard by far in a plugin.“ - Robbie Soukiasyan (Skrillex, Tiesto, Usher and more..)\n\n“...and Grand Finale is a genuinely impressive processor for not only the master output, but also mix busses and even individual tracks…” - Computer Music Magazine (CM254)\n\n“Overall, we are impressed by Grand Finale. The plug-in is well thought out and has a very modern, sleek user interface that doesn’t compromise on intuitiveness, metering, or other relevant information and features. Such things help with standing out in the crowded mastering/finalization plug-ins market.” - Gearnews.com"

Three levels of anti-noise settings: The lowest anti-noise ability can realize the short tone detection of 0.1s. The highest anti-noise ability can accurately detect the standard pitch even in the 4 times baseband amplitude murmurs. Default level is II that is the highest level;\n5. Three accuracy options: 0.1 cent, 1 cent and 3 cents. Default option is O that is the best accuracy;\n6. Three input modes: Microphone, Pickup and Bluetooth;\n7. Adjustable A4 calibration in 1 Hz increment;\n8. Tuning frequency range: 23HZ--6400HZ;\n9.

With the most advanced sound tuning technology in the world, this is the first time that our company designs our own brand—tuner app. After testing on hundreds of instruments, we now specially recommend Elegantune, which works perfectly for majority of instruments. \n\nElegantune has been updating and improving for a long time, at first we used and referenced peterson tuner’s strobo mode and other products’ advantages, but we do not have a big success. Under one year’s reforming and improving, the UI and practicality of our products both have a very big promotion.

The purpose of this app is to make it fun and easy for people to learn how to sing these songs in parts again. It’s actually not a hard skill to develop, and with a little effort the tradition can be revitalized before it dies away.\n\nUsing the app is simple:\n- Select a song to practice by choosing it from the menu.\n- Mute or unmute any part by tapping the S (soprano), A (alto), T (tenor), or B (bass).\n- Quickly move forward or backwards through measures in the song by swiping left or right.\n- Adjust the tempo of the song by grabbing the tempo in the corner and expanding it to the left to increase the tempo, or down to decrease the tempo.\n- Pause and unpause by tapping the pause/play button at the top of the screen.\n\nApp Features:\n- Isolate each part (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass) so that you can easily learn a part individually.\n- Mute/unmute each part to listen to the different parts in any combination you like.\n- Follow along with traditional music notation. Helpful for those who already read music, and can help those who don't to quickly learn!\n- Adjust the tempo at any time while practicing.\n- Pause, rewind, and retry a segment you just can’t get.\n- Over 70 total songs included - choose from Amazing Grace and other hymns, Christmas and Easter songs, and patriotic songs!"

It will add that extra shimmer to your sound already when being added to a track flat, without turning any knobs, due to its carefully designed higher harmonic generation algorithm. Now start turning the knobs on any of the five bands and you'll be amazed: it's really possible to add copious amounts of gain without ever sounding harsh, at all. The 6144 has been a not-so-secret weapon for audio engineers in the desktop realm for some years already, and is now finally available as an iOS plugin for use in an Audio Unit or Inter App Audio compatible host."

      "label": "OSCILLOSCOPE & SPECTROGRAM is a powerful audio analyzer app and audio unit plugin\n\nKEY FEATURES\n- Run as both Audio Unit and standalone app\n- View up to three seconds of audio on the screen\n- Pause and scroll horizontally to browse back in time\n- Pinch to zoom in / zoom out\n- See both oscilloscope and spectrogram separately or overlayed together\n- Frequency trigger mode helps identify the precise frequency and MIDI note of sounds in the spectrogram\n- Stereo and mono views\n- Level based trigger mode has lookahead, pause, and zoom\n- XY mode shows stereo correlation\n- Automatically adjusts FFT size to fit zoom setting\n- Bark-frequency scale spectrogram shows nice detail at low and high frequencies\n- When zoomed in, the oscilloscope uses sinc upsampling to show you a close approximation of what actually outputs from your audio interface after digital to analog conversion, rather than just displaying raw audio samples.\n\n\nWHAT DOES THIS APP DO THAT OTHERS DO NOT?\n\n1. Pause Button\n\nWe can't emphasize enough how useful this is. You never have to worry about trying to catch short events that disappear quickly because you can watch the sounds go by slowly at a 3 second viewer scale, then just pause and scroll back if you missed something. When you get to the event you want to see you can pinch to zoom in right down to sub-sample level of detail, then zoom back out when you are done and zoom in on something else. This feature alone makes almost all other oscilloscope apps unnecessary because it means you can easily see ANYTHING that you need to see.\n\n2. Frequency Identification Mode\n\nIn frequency mode, when you touch the frequency scale on the right of the screen a blue line appears on the spectrogram. When you position the line above a specific frequency on the spectrogram, a panel on the left side of the screen displays the octave, note name, and MIDI number. You can then use the frequency timing oscilloscope to lock in on the exact pitch in cents so that you not only know which MIDI note that sound corresponds to but you know exactly how many cents sharp or flat. The ability to simultaneously see the frequency on the spectrogram and confirm it with precision on the oscilloscope allows you to quickly and easily identify musical pitches to a level of accuracy that have not seen anywhere else, not even in desktop software.\n\n3. Trigger with Lookahead\n\nAlmost every oscilloscope has a feature where it re-draws the screen each time the input signal level crosses a specified threshold. This is the main and most basic function of any oscilloscope. However, when setting the trigger at a high level to view the attack section of musical notes or drums, we miss the first part of the note. By using lookahead, this app allows you to see a few milliseconds BEFORE the trigger point so that you can see the whole sound you want to examine.\n\n4. Carefully Designed Spectrogram \n\nIn all spectrum analyzer displays, the upper end of the frequency scale is crowded, meaning that a single pixel corresponds to 10 or 20 frequencies in the frequency analysis. In many other analyzer apps one of two things occur: either 9 out of 10 frequencies in that upper range simply get ignored and disappear from the spectrogram display, or all 10 frequencies combine together to make the pixels in the upper range appear brighter than low frequency sounds of similar volume. This may seem like a technicality until you run a sine sweep or a 20 KHz tone through the analyzer and find that large sections of the input simply aren't displayed on the analyzer screen. Looking at these kinds of test signals on a spectrogram is the primary way that we test and evaluate the quality of audio effect plugins. If a spectrogram is to be of any real use as an analysis tool, it should do this right. Other spectrograms often mess up the lower frequencies too, either by making them take up too much space or by making them very pixelated. This spectrogram carefully avoids these problems."

It's a clever combination of dynamic processors that can be set to provide a gentle transparent signal boost respecting the initial dynamic or significant colorised level maximisation. Thanks to a unique signal path, algorithms and a small set of parameters, FAC Maxima makes a complicated task easy.\n\nIn addition to the classic final stage application, FAC Maxima excels on individual tracks too. With a few changes it's easy to go from the common gain deviation compensation, e.g. for vocals, to drastical audio changes that will bring your audio material to new territories: boost reverb tails, flattenize drums… The applications are various and the possibilities are limitless.\n\n• Get the final touch!\nFAC Maxima definitely makes audio louder and that makes it an effective tool in many mastering engineers’ arsenals.\n\n• Be creative!\nEmphasis subtitle details, sometimes floor contains treasure, you will have a completely new listen to your old tracks! The audio background may indeed contain noise, but sometimes also \"pearls\" that may be revealed.\n\n• Go further!\nTired by the advertisement boost, or important speech level variation in broadcasting? Use FAC Maxima to maintain the level constant. DJ's may also benefit from the effects to normalise in real time the level of the mixed tracks.\n\nAs with all FAC products the interface has a unique sober look and provides a great user experience. FAC Maxima also brings a real-time multi-waveform graph having a 6s buffer of the audio material before and after operations, this will help on setting the right parameters and have a visual feedback."

      "label": "The BLEASS Saturator AUv3 Effect Plugin features a semi-parametric gain drive, 9 different WaveShaper algorithms, a Pre/Post Bitcrusher, and a LFO to bring motion to your saturation!\r\nThis versatile saturation effect processor comes packed with 40 Factory Presets, from classic stereo Drive to crazy metallic bitcrushed Saturations. A clear User Interface guides you through the different stages of sound saturation while offering you a crispy sound design experience through a mesmerizing dynamic WaveShaper Visualizer.\n\nFinally, like all BLEASS Software, this effect has very low CPU usage and highly optimized DSP, is compatible with all Hosts and also available as Standalone Audio Processor.\r\n\r\nBLEASS Saturator is composed of 5 stages:\r\n\r\nThe Input Stage allows you to set the Drive up to 60db. Activate the EQ mode and set the range of the Low and High Band Frequency parameters. \r\nMove the 3 sliders to set Low, Mid & High EQ Gains up to 60db as well. \r\n\r\nThe WaveShaper Stage allows you to choose between 9 different Algorithms, from classic “Hard” and “Soft” Clip up to “Polynomial Order 5”.\r\nA high definition WaveShaper displays the different waveform Algorithms: view in real-time the effects of the Offset, Depth, Period and Strength parameters, which you can set with the four dedicated controls.\r\n\r\nThe Bit Crusher Stage can be set to Off, Pre & Post the WaveShaper stage, which gives a high versatility to your sound waveshaping. Set the Depth and rate amounts of bit reduction, which can be modulated by the LFO.\r\n\r\nThe LFO Stage offers 6 different waveforms, Beat and Sync Free modes, Rate, Offset, Stereo Phase and Amount which you can visualize thanks to the LFO Stereo Meter.\r\nThe 12 Modulation targets are: Drive, High Frequency, Low Frequency, Low Gain, Mid Gain, High Gain, Offset, Depth, Period and Strength, Bit Depth and Bit Rate.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Output Stage protects your ears against high output gains and offers a clear view of Output and Dry/Wet parameters \r\n \r\nCheck out www.bleass.com for video tutorials and more info!\r\n\r\n* PLEASE NOTE: this is an Audio Unit Effect plugin (AUv3) which requires a compatible host such as AUM, Audiobus, GarageBand, Cubasis, BM3 and Auria. You can also use the BLEASS Saturator as a standalone App using headphones, a mic or an external sound card."

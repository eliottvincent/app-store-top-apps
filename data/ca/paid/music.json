Create a new Alarm.\n2. Choose either one song or create a playlist of songs to shuffle.\n3. Lock your screen, relax, and wake up on the right side of the bed!\n\nSupports playing the alarm Bluetooth devices connected to your iOS device.\n\nNotes\n• Click \"Developer Website\" below on this App Store page for the complete FAQ, or email me at iam@willsaid.com\n• A Free Spotify Account works! However, *you need a premium Spotify account to play the entire song in Spotify*\n• The Spotify Mobile App is not needed\n• Internet connectivity is required to find songs and \"set\" an alarm, but not needed when it goes off.\n• Alarms go off for one minute max, but you can always chain multiple alarms together if you are a heavy sleeper. Spotify's API currently only lets the app play 30 seconds of each song, although entire songs are coming soon.\n• As stated above, the app currently plays 30 second snippets of the best parts of songs, which should be more than enough to wake up.\n• Supports Snoozing, Days to Repeat, and the other features you'd expect from an alarm clock\n• The maker of this app is not attached to Spotify in any way. The app simply plays Spotify Content from Spotify's API.\n• Most but not all Spotify songs are currently available on the app. This is outside my control, and up to which artists approve third party app usage of their content. The selection size has improved since Version 1 and is continuing to do so. Artists not on the app include Bob Marley, Ariana Grande, and Frank Ocean. Please email me BEFORE downloading the app if there's a specific song you are looking for and I can quickly check. Email me at iam@willsaid.com and I will get back to you very quickly!"

      "label": "Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers are pleased to announce Bloom: 10 Worlds – a developed, augmented and expanded new edition of 2008’s game-changing original Bloom app, which explored uncharted territory in the realm of applications and was dubbed “The First Great iPhone App” by Gizmodo.\n\nRequiring no musical or technical ability, the egalitarian and user-friendly Bloom app enabled anyone of any age to create music, simply by touching the screen. Part instrument, part composition and part artwork, Bloom’s innovative controls allowed users to create elaborate patterns and unique melodies by simply tapping the screen. A generative music player took over when Bloom was left idle, creating an infinite selection of compositions and their accompanying visualisations.\n\nBloom: 10 Worlds is a reimagining of the original – not simply a remaster. If the original Bloom was a single, then this would be an album. The widely broadened palette of sounds and images can be experienced via 10 new ‘worlds’, each exploring a new direction for Bloom. The first world the user encounters is an echo of the original app, with circles appearing where the user taps. Each subsequent world unlocks automatically, introducing new combinations of sounds, shapes, colours and rules of behaviour.\n\n\nPraise for the original Bloom\n\n“The very first iPhone apps were universally dull. And then Bloom came out. It was immediately obvious that something special was happening. The app was interesting on an artistic level – one that made you reconsider the relationship between technology and music. It raised the bar for musical iPhone apps.” Gizmodo\n\n“Hypnotic and ludicrously addictive.” The Guardian\n\n“A relaxing alternative to just about anything else you can do with an iPhone.” Wired\n\nEno began collaborating with musician / software designer Peter Chilvers on Will Wright’s computer game Spore. Their shared interest in generative music rapidly lead to the development of a prototype for Bloom in 2008. In the intervening decade, they experimented further with the field, expanding their catalogue of apps with Trope, Scape and Reflection. In that time Chilvers has also acted as an engineer and technical advisor to Eno on a number of other projects. A series of multi-speaker installations around the world laid the groundwork for 2016’s The Ship, and they premiered Bloom: Open Space, a mixed reality installation in Amsterdam in 2018.\n\nIn addition to his work with Eno, Chilvers co-founded the Burning Shed label and online store, toured with Underworld’s Karl Hyde as keyboardist and musical director, and has recorded instrumental albums and collaborations with vocalist Tim Bowness."

Minimise the friction for endless bouncing motion, as an innovative substitute for traditional LFOs and modulation. There was never a better reason for using a touchscreen for music.\n\nShimmer Feedback effect\nLike a shimmer reverb, except it feeds the processed audio back into the grain engine. This lets you create an endless loop of pitch-shifting spaciousness, turning even the simplest of sounds into massive woolly mammoths. \n\n- 3 Voice grain engine, each with an independent playhead\n- Filter inspired by the Oberheim Xpander, including its resonant Phase filter\n- Kinetic sliders and pads for playful interaction with the sound\n- Universal design (iPhone and iPad; iPad Air 2 or higher recommended)\n- Custom scales, unquantised mode and even Scala-import for microtonal experiments\n- Use WAVs (or other audio files), record audio or load the app as a live-processing audio effect\n- Real world tested as an instrument in numerous live performances by Hainbach\n- Offers light mode and dark mode UI"

Note Rush teaches keyboard geography by making sure you're getting the note in the right octave every time.\n\nGreat for Home Practise\n-------------------------\nStudents will rush to their instrument at home every day with NoteRush, chasing stars and high scores! Unlike flash cards, children can drill note identification at home with no music-reading parent required to check if they're getting them correct - Note Rush checks for you! Play every day and you'll be great at reading piano music in no time.\n\nLevels\n-------\nNote Rush has fifteen built-in Levels, from Middle C-Position right through to the full grand staff with 2 ledger lines above and below. There are Levels for Treble Clef, Bass Clef or full Grand Staff! Or make your own levels to practise reading specific notes, with sharps and flats for an added challenge!\n\nBetter Than Flash Cards!\n-------------------------\nUse Note Rush instead of printed flash cards! Note Rush was designed to replace the cards used in One Minute Club - a challenge you can run in your studio where students have to complete a given level in under a minute. Give it a try!\n\n--\nNote Rush is made by Thomas Grayston, a software developer, pianist, and husband to a piano teacher."

      "label": "Visualize the fretboard, master scales and play through changes like a pro with intervallic functions! \n\n\n‣ Solo is a revolutionary practice tool designed by world renowned fusion guitarists Tom Quayle and David Beebee.\n\n‣ One of the biggest barriers to improvising on guitar is finding and mapping out the relevant chord tones and scales all over on the fretboard in real time.\n\n\nSolo is a highly focussed app for developing your note finding and visualization ability on the guitar. There is no time-based pressure and Solo reduces the cognitive load of having to choose which ‘notes/intervals’ to play. As you get quicker at finding these ‘notes’ you will conversely get better at choosing them whilst improvising. Players of all ability levels will reap huge benefits from practicing with Solo.\n\n\n‣ Using common progressions, Solo presents you with one chord symbol or scale at a time and asks you to find and play a series of notes based on their intervallic function.\n\n‣ Solo listens to the notes you play, analyzes them in real time, and doesn’t move on until you’ve correctly found each note by its intervallic function in the specified order.\n\n‣ This process builds strong fretboard visualization for the most powerful, efficient and malleable way to KNOW your way around the fretboard no matter how difficult the chord changes are. \n\n\nAs a unique and powerful ear training tool, Solo also develops your ability to not only visualize what you’re playing, but hear it in real time too.\n\nIf you know your note names but struggle to learn new scales, play through chord changes or find yourself stuck in pattern based playing, practicing diligently with Solo will be transformational for your knowledge of the fretboard and subsequently your ability to outline harmony when you improvise. \n\n\n‣ CHANGES PLAYING TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions over a series of chord changes based on common and popular chord progressions. Solo is programmed with all the knowledge behind the scenes to understand jazz and popular music harmony and will always pick appropriate intervallic functions based on the harmony of the progression. \n \n‣ SCALE TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions within scales on the fretboard. Solo includes all the modes of the Major, Melodic Minor, Harmonic Minor and Harmonic Major scales, plus pentatonic and symmetrical scales. Seeing and finding scale tones as intervallic functions will transform your ability to manipulate and improvise with scales in real time.    \n\n‣ TUTORIALS\nSolo also includes video tutorials to get you started with intervallic functions, how to find them on the fretboard, using Solo for ear training and how to get the most from your practice time with the app.\n\n\nNo registration or account required."

      "label": "The Bagpipe Tuner App allows precision tuning of Highland bagpipes. Simply sound a note and start tuning. It's easy and accurate.\n\nBagpipe Tuner App for Highland Bagpipes accurately detects your pipe chanter notes, drones and displays the note, frequency and pitch position. Detection is via the inbuilt microphone, or in noisy environments an external microphone like the HBT clip mic can be attached. \n\nBagpipe Tuner features both digital and analog style meters, waveform input monitor and auto gain limiter. Simply press the Learn button and start tuning, or turn horizontal to access a larger meter display.\n\nUsing a Bagpipe Tuner can really make tuning less stressful, listening more pleasant and playing more enjoyable. You can quickly check your pipes at anytime to maintain good tone– before a gig, practising or competition. And, non-pipers can easily use it to help out with tuning.\n\nWhy a Bagpipe Tuner? Highland bagpipes are incredibly hard to tune and unlike standard chromatic instruments, the intervals between each note continue to vary. Bagpipe Tuner correctly displays the scale and takes the guesswork out of using a chromatic tuner. \n\nBagpipe Tuner compliments the standalone BLAIR tuners and Bluetooth clip. \n\nFeatures:\n• Auto detection and display of notes and drones\n• Analog style meter\n• Large horizontal display\n• Frequency display meter\n• Input waveform meter\n• Frequency position bar\n• Learn function for calibration setting\n• Auto input limiter\n• Internal microphone\n• External microphone support (HBT clip mic)\n• Large frequency detection range\n• Special Bluetooth mic/ sensor for Bagpipes supported"

      "label": "Sharpen your sense of time! liveBPM is the tempo monitoring tool for drummers, bands and DJs. It detects music and beats via the microphone and continuously displays the current tempo in beats per minute (BPM). It is easy to use and delivers high-quality results while being energy efficient.\n\n\n=== What users said about liveBPM ===\n\n\nJohn Walden, freelance musician and music technology journalist at musicappblog.com:\n\"There are three obvious applications for the app. First, it would make a brilliant practice tool for a drummer, allowing them to monitor just how good they are at keeping a steady tempo without the aid of a click track to guide them. Second, sat beside your kit during a performance, it would allow you to judge just how well you are hitting the ideal tempo for each song in your set. It’s not just drummers that can benefit for liveBPM as the third use is in mapping the tempo – and any tempo changes – in commercial recordings. While this is useful for drummers, it is instructional for almost any musician.\" \n\n\nJonLong:\n\"I used this at my last band practice and wasn't expecting it to work. I couldn't believe how quickly and accurately it started tracking the bpm, even despite the very loud volume of our music.\"\n\n\nPocketDrummer82:\n\"I am a professional drummer and I have been looking for something like this for years! Unless your playing with backing tracks or recording, Playing with a Click is too Mechanical. This app allows the tempo to breathe, and its like a little angel on your shoulder telling you the band is speeding up or slowing down. It is totally worth the money.\"\n\n\nChris Walther:\n\"I have used this about five gigs now and have quit using my previous tempo meter. I used both for a few gigs to test the accuracy. Dead on. Thanks! Every drummer should use this.\"\n\n\nmagrec:\n\"This has been very helpful for recording. thanks!\"\n\n\n\n\n=== Detailed Description ===\n\n\nThis is a tool designed for professional use:\n- Well-tested beat detection engine guarantees trustworthiness\n- Can handle most genres\n- Produces results accurate to within 0.1 BPM under the following conditions:\n-- The tempo is constant or almost constant\n-- Strong impulses are defining the beat (drums, accentuated rhythm instruments like bass/guitar, etc.)\n\n\nFurther features:\n- Tempo curve shows the development of tempo over time \n- Multiple zoom modes to show last 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20 or 30 minutes\n- Advanced audio spectrum analysis via FFT\n- More accessible and usually more accurate than BPM counters that function through tapping\n- Low battery drain thanks to high performance code and efficient algorithms\n\n\nUsing it as a musician:\n- Use it as an objective tempo reference like a metronome\n- It actually has several advantages over a metronome:\n-- You are not tied to a click, giving you more flexibility\n-- Helps you use tempo changes to enhance your musical expression\n-- With blind tests, it can massively improve your timing confidence, which is especially important if you are in a tempo leading role (e.g. drummer)\n- Discover how/whether your favorite artists use tempo changes\n- Measure and improve your time-keeping skills\n- Identify slowdowns and speedups while practicing your instrument\n- Always be in control of the tempo during your live gigs and rehearsals\n\n\nControls:\n- Power Button: For freezing the tempo curve and minimizing battery drain\n- Clear Button: Clears the tempo curve\n- Slider: Adjusts the target tempo range (i.e. 80-160 BPM)\n- Zoom Buttons: Switch between zoom modes for the tempo curve. (2-30 minutes)\n\n\nNote: \n- You can check and improve the detection by clapping loud to the beat. Also, results can be improved by plugging in a suitable external microphone.\n- You can support my work by rating it on the App Store.

This works great for cases like vocal practice. By using a higher latency, pitch detection will not respond to momentary unintended sounds and noise (works great for instrument tuning).\r\n• Smart Detection - Use machine learning to enable pitch detection only when certain instruments or vocal sounds are detected."

Anyone can jump in and play with over 160 included presets or lay fingers to the controls and begin exploring vast magical realms of creative potential for iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch and Mac. \n\nThe Minimoog Model D App incorporates a number of inspiring sound creation tools and capabilities not present on its analog antecedent. New functions include the ability to play chords with up to four-note polyphony, an easy-to-use arpeggiator for rhythmic pattern creation, a real time looping recorder with unlimited overdubbing capacity, a tempo-synchronizable stereo ping pong delay module, and the Bender -- a wide-range stereo time modulation effect module. \n\nThe Minimoog Model D App also supports AUv3 Audio Unit extensions, which allows multiple instances of this powerful instrument to be used simultaneously within compatible iOS apps supporting AUv3.\n\nA BRIEF HISTORY \nIntroduced by Moog in 1970, the Minimoog Model D served as the archetype for all electronic keyboards that followed. It gave users the ability to design their own sounds, translating imagination into reality. The Minimoog’s portability, affordability and accessibility made it the go-to instrument for musicians looking to expand beyond the traditional sounds of the time. Bernie Worrell used the Minimoog Model D to establish Parliament Funkadelic’s futuristic funk sound. Kraftwerk employed the Minimoog Model D on the successful concept album Autobahn, sparking an entirely new genre. Gary Numan replaced his live band’s guitars with Minimoog Model Ds, creating the prototype for industrial music. The classic sound of the Minimoog Model D can be heard on Bob Marley’s Catch A Fire, Michael Jackson’s Thriller and Dr. Dre’s The Chronic; Detailed in the mini-doc series “A Brief History Of The Minimoog”. \n\nFEATURES \n• Ships with over 160 presets (hundreds more available in the Minimoog Model D App Store) \n• Up to 4-notes of polyphony \n• Easily share presets and audio recordings with friends \n• Arpeggiator module with note-hold and chord latch capability \n• Stereo ping-pong delay effect \n• Bender time modulation effect \n• Real-time looping recorder with overdub and immediate sharing \n• Selectable envelope shapes and triggering behavior \n• Effortless MIDI CC mapping \n• Seamlessly backup presets to iCloud \n• Play mode for easier panel and keyboard interaction \n• A new take on the classic feedback/overload path \n\nSUPPORTS\n• All 64-bit iOS devices\n• AUv3 Audio Unit Extensions (Including GarageBand)\n• MPE Controller Support \n• Ableton Link \n• Inter-App Audio and Audiobus\n• 7 and 14-Bit MIDI \n• MIDI Program Change Support \n• Bluetooth LE MIDI controllers \n• Share over AirDrop, Mail, or other iOS applications"

      "label": "Similar to the human cochlea where the different frequencies are split-up and analyzed, The Snail for iOS uses a spiral grid to visualize root notes and overtones of any incoming sound with utmost precision. The Snail is based on recently developed technology making instrument tuning easy and audio analysis music-oriented and fun to watch.\n\nTune any instrument with utmost precision\n\nVersion 2 offers an additional guitar tuning mode that is available in the tuning view. Just tap on a dedicated string name, play a note and adjust the guitar tuning accordingly. Another major improvement is the new split window mode. Whenever you do any adjustments to parameters you now see how the edits affect the visualization in the upper section. This works in both visualization modes. One mode is the snail grid, a complete musical overview of the audio spectrum. The other one, the tuner view, is especially designed to focus on the root note for tuning purposes. In both views there is a sine tuning oscillator available which is controlled simply by touching the desired note on the iPhone display. There are a lot of customizable parameters. No problem if you would like to tune transposing instruments or if you need a tuning reference other than 440 Hz.\n\nPatented technology\n\nThe well-known IRCAM institute for acoustic and music research in Paris is responsible for the new technology of detection and visualization. It is a patented invention by Thomas Hélie, CNRS researcher at the Sciences and Technologies for Music and Sound (STMS) Laboratory (IRCAM/CNRS/Sorbonne Université). The Snail is also available for macOS and Windows, as stand-alone app or plug-in (VST3/AU/AAX), distributed by Plugivery.\n\nKey features\n\n•\tPrecise audio analysis and instrument tuning in two modes.\n•\tSnail view for a sophisticated visual representation of root note and overtone structures.\n•\tTuner view to tune instruments and to control pitches of voices and other sources.\n•\tFast access guitar tuning (GT) mode.\n•\tSplit window settings menu.\n•\tVisual gain and mic gain controllers.\n•\tSwitchable auto detection.\n•\tTouch sine tuning oscillator.\n•\t2 color modes: coherency index and magnitude.\n•\tAdjustable grid range (octaves).\n•\tSetup for transposing instruments.\n•\tMany customizable parameters like tuning reference, frequency tracking and audio window size."

      "label": "Drambo is an innovative modular groovebox and audio processing environment. Modular components are used to build synthesized and sample based instruments or audio effects using high-quality DSP and audio-rate modulation. Tied to a powerful sequencer, it’s an optimal music creation tool for sound design, composition, performance and experimentation.\n\nAt the heart of Drambo lies an entirely new concept that makes modular creations easy, fun and affordable. Modules are connected automatically, with no cables as you add or rearrange them. A dynamic interface creates modulation knobs when you need them. Modules may house other modules, so you can keep your patch well organized. Of course, automatic connections can be overridden. In Drambo you can focus on playing with sound and signal structure without getting lost in wires.\n\nUse a deep and innovative sequencer to compose patterns and whole tracks, for production or live performance. Go beyond simple looping sequences with parameter locking, conditional step components, parameters automation and powerful scene morphing. Drambo works equally well as a self-contained standalone app or audio unit plugin with audio and MIDI connectivity as an AUV3 instrument, audio effect and MIDI effect. No modular experience necessary to get started playing with preset sounds and effects.\n\nYou can use Drambo as\n\n• A complete music production and performance environment\n\n• Endless modular playground, that allows you to build, modify and store custom instruments and effects. For instance: build a custom synth, sample and resample, build a Theremin using a gyroscope module, or turn your table into a playable surface, by processing microphone input with physical modelling modules. Get weird or make functional instruments and tools.\n\n• MIDI sequencer, that works with hardware and AUv3 instruments (e.g. Drambo sequences other instruments in an AU host app). Moreover Drambo can generate custom MIDI CC messages or modulation signals to control modular synths via DC coupled interfaces.\n\n• AUv3 synthesizer, effect or sequencer in other DAWs. Drambo can replace a lot of audio plugins. For instance: you may use it as a chorus, phaser, reverb, filter, equalizer, complex modular delay, decimator, frequency shifter, MIDI effect or complex modulator for other synths. You may combine, modulate and sequence them in no time.\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Polyphonic, stereo processing and audio-rate modulation. All signals are equal. Up to 8 voices per modular instrument rack.\n\n• Unique modular concept: cable-less, drag'n'drop, color coding dynamic interface, automatic connections, and customizable compact, rack views.\n \n• Directional flow makes Drambo routing and patching straightforward. Signal flows only left to right, so there are no instant feedback routings in Drambo. Delayed feedback is possible using certain modules.\n \n• Simple and clean interface, that scales to every size and device orientation\n  \n• Custom modular racks that can be nested, with presets at the track, rack, and module level.\n\n• Clip launcher / song arrager. \n\n• 16-tracks, polyphonic sequencer with parameter locks, automation and step components. 8 dedicated step sequence editor types, piano-roll, powerful automation designer with drawing modes and cubic Bezier curves.\n\n• Audio Units hosting ( standalone app only )\n\n• Over 120 modules available, such as: oscillators, samplers, physical modelling modules, LFOs, envelope generators, filters, audio effects, mixers, MIDI processors, sequencers and math functions.\n\n• Morph groups: you can morph many parameters using a single slider.\n\n• Available as a standalone app, AUv3 instrument, effect and MIDI effect.\n\n• MIDI, MPE and Ableton Link support\n\nWith Drambo, you are in charge. Create the music from your vision to reality.\n\n\"Drambo changes the face of iOS music apps.\" Cult of Mac\n\nVisit https://patchstorage.com/platform/drambo/ for community content."

The sweetest Christian lyrics of all ages have revolved around His Person and work, in whom lies a boundless wealth of grace and mercy. O how Christ leads and shines in the believers’ singing! These hymns of ‘Immanuel’ are constantly sung in the holy of holies of the human heart. Here, such singing in His presence dismisses all doubts, casts off unholy ambitions, brings tears of repentance, restores the joy of salvation, invokes love and hope, and turns eyes heavenward. Here, dissensions among assemblies and theological schools are silenced, and hymnists from every age and sector of the Christian Church raise one voice to glorify one Lord and Savior. Here, Christ is the theme of all ages, tongues, and creeds; the divine harmony over all human and cosmic discords; and the summing up of all things in the heavens and on earth.\n\nHymns should be simple, full of the experiences of Christ, the appreciation for Christ, and in some measure elevated above mere prose. A desirable hymnbook may be compared to a majestic building, with foundations made solid by accurate truth and sound doctrine, its superstructure elevated with the spirit of poetry, and its interior compartments containing the radiance of spirituality. Spirituality has been the fundamental test in our choice of hymns more often than high poetic literary style.”\n\n6 distinctive features make this treasury useful in drawing nearer to the Lord:\n1. Faithful restoration of the authors’ original words as far as practicable.\n2. Hymns & spiritual songs for BOTH public & private worship.\n3. Special attention to themes often overlooked in hymnals: sovereign grace, overcoming life, personal advent of our Lord, union with Christ, and the sweetness of abiding communion with Him.\n4. Covers the broad lyric spectrum spelled out in Ephesians— “psalms, hymns and spiritual songs” (Eph. 5:19)\n5. Guided by rare and deep associations of hymns with their history:  lyrics breathed by dying lips, traced on prison walls, sung with hushed voices in catacombs, chanted joyfully at midnight, and avowed fearlessly at the fiery stake.\n6. Inclusion of carefully researched biographical profiles of authors & composers, so that believers of all backgrounds can meet on the level ground of a common faith.\n\nChristian Chen, 2006\n\nComing soon\nFull text search"

You can add to the factory sounds by importing your own pads or by purchasing one of the in-app sound packs.*\n\n- Shape your sound. AutoPad's menu gives you control over crossfade time, high-pass and low-pass filters, reverb amount, pan, and volume.\n\n- Easy on storage. AutoPad's seamlessly looped sample-based drones contain just what you need to provide a pleasing atmosphere and don't take up excessive space on your device.\n\n- Stay in sync.

AutoPad lets you save and recall setlists with a simple setlist manager.\n\n- Looks great. AutoPad features a dark color scheme that is easy on the eyes and performs well on the stage.\n\n\nNote on use: \n\nAutoPad sounds great in a variety of contexts, but please make sure you understand the intended use before purchase.\n\nAutoPad's sounds are designed to be played softly and continuously behind live musicians. They include the root, fifth, and octave. As such, they can be used in a major or minor context. When using AutoPad in worship music, it is not necessary to change the pad with each chord change. For example, if you have a song in the key of E, you can play a pad in E for the duration of the song.\n\n\nView Manual: https://www.audiosymmetric.com/manuals.html\nView Tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Uka-nFom-pgTB-DftgDvA\n\n\n* While files of any length can be imported into AutoPad, due to realtime memory restrictions, AutoPad loads a 3.5 minute subsection of files longer than four minutes. A short fade is applied to eliminate pops. See manual for details."

      "label": "Learn to play 'In The Pocket' with Drummer ITP: The World's only intelligent metronome and rudiment training tool! *Worldwide Number 1 iPhone Music App in over 70 countries!*\n\nDrummer ITP can help you to learn exceptionally accurate timing with your drum performances and become a true 'In The Pocket' player. The app is designed for practicing rudiment patterns with a drum practice pad - incorporating an intelligent listening feature, which allows your performance against a metronome click to be measured and given as feedback scores. You can therefore track your progress and identify what rudiment patterns and tempos cause you most trouble with staying in time. \n\n*Please note: as with all professional audio and recording systems, Drummer ITP requires you to use wired headphones to enable zero latency analysis and measurements. Bluetooth headphones do not allow zero latency data exchange.\n\nDrummer ITP helps to identify the key tempos where your technique changes from wrist-action stick hits to faster speeds which require you to control the bounce of the drumsticks. Finding your breaking points with different stick pad rudiments and practice exercises will enable you to focus on the most challenging aspects of your personal stick technique and will underpin your development in all areas of drumming.\n\nThe main display shows both the rolling click waveform and the microphone readings from your performance on the practice pad, so you can easily see if you are playing ahead or behind the beat. There is also a unique accuracy indicator which shows how far ahead or behind the beat each of your hits is. Whilst performing rudiments and exercises on a practice pad, the app records an ongoing measurement of accuracy and consistency of the performance, so you can practice to keep the timing indicator right in the middle of the screen and achieve the highest possible scores. When playing an accented pattern, or an exercise with rests incorporated, the intelligent algorithm checks that the correct type of hits are performed at the right time. If you want to check how accurate the app is, just turn up the loudspeaker volume and you'll see it measure its own sounds to 100% accuracy - so you can see how close your own performance scores are to that of an electronic drum machine!\n\nDrummer ITP can be used in Manual Mode or Rudiment Mode. In Manual Mode the metronome runs freely, as a standard metronome whilst also keeping a measurement of the recent performance scores. With a rudiment pattern active (i.e. using the app's Rudiment Mode), a count in starts a 30, 60, 120 or 300 second rudiment test, the results of which become a benchmark for evaluating your performance progress over time, with all your best high scores being recorded. The app can also be used purely as a standalone high-precision metronome with advanced settings allowing you to choose different pitches, volumes and intervals for the click.\n\nIncludes a total of 68 practice patterns and rudiment exercises for combinations of:\n- standard timing exercises (quarters, eighths, sixteenths)\n- triplet timing exercises\n- single, double and triple paradiddles (including inverted, reverse and offset)\n- single and double paradiddle-diddle patterns\n- rudimental drum rolls\n- accented patterns\n\nAdditional features:\n- notation of all included rudiments and exercise patterns \n- real-time left/right hand pattern indicator \n- accent indicator and moving notation counter \n- tempo adjustment from 30-240 bpm\n- beat time intervals 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n- optional beat one accent for practicing specific time signatures\n- click designer with settings for pitch, tonality, click duration and volume\n- separate click design for the main beat and interval sounds\n- stick pad performance player, to hear what you are attempting to play\n- high scores chart for completed rudiments and exercises\n- preset click sounds\n- microphone sensitivity adjustment\n- intelligent 'learn latency' feature to ensure 100% accurate analysis"

      "label": "iDrumTune Pro is the world’s most advanced, accurate and intelligent system for assisting and educating on drum tuning – used by thousands of drummers all over the world. Now with Drum Kit Designer feature and detailed online tutorials.\n\nFeatured in Modern Drummer 'New and Notable' - July 2018  \n\n\"an invaluable aid not only for drummers but also studio engineers and producers\" - Sound on Sound Magazine\n\n\"I can’t recommend this app highly enough ... for the money, it is indispensable. It's simple, accurate, looks good, and the tuning information is worth the cost of the app alone.\" - www.mikedolbear.com\n\n“***** I never knew I could have this much fun tuning drums!” – Adamrod (App Store review)\n\n“***** Just tuned my first drum and this app is awesome!” – bburt85 (App Store review)\n\n“***** Buy this app if you are a drummer!!!” Lildrummerboy (App Store review)\n\nThe original and most innovative electronic drum tuning app - iDrumTune Pro brings unrivalled accuracy and features that have never been possible before for assisting with drum tuning. Built by world experts in drums and musical acoustics, and backed up by a detailed online training course on Drum Sound and Drum Tuning.\n\niDrumTune Pro includes the following features:\n\n* Pitch Tuning – to make your drums sing and allow you to play musical phrases around the kit\n\n* Lug Tuning – to ensure that the drumhead is evenly tuned and gives a smooth and warm tone\n\n* Resonant Head Tuning – to allow you to be sure that the two heads are working together and giving rich overtones\n\n* Spectrum Analyzer – so you can really start to understand what frequencies are excited and heard when playing the drums\n\n* Drum Kit Presets – so you can save and load your favourite tunings and share them with the world. Now also includes the interactive Drum Kit Designer feature.\n\n* The Science of Drum Tuning – and extensive manual on the science and art of drum tuning and getting the best out of iDrumTune Pro \n\niDrumTune is the first and by far the most intelligent and accurate system for analyzing drum sounds and assisting tuning – developed by drummers, music producers and acoustics research Professors. iDrumTune provides you with a measurement of the drumhead vibration frequency, much in the same way to an acoustic guitar tuner which measures the vibration frequency of a guitar string. In Pitch Tuning mode, you simply hold the iPhone over the center of a drum, about 2-4 inches away, and strike the drum in the center.\n\nThe iDrumTune readout shows the recorded sound waveform and gives the strongest frequency recorded. There is also a tuning indicator bar which shows the drumhead tuning relative to musical notes, so iDrumTune can be used to ensure that your drums are in key with each other or the song you are playing. A frequency spectrum view also allows more detailed analysis and helps with tuning the drum at the lug positions.\n\niDrumTune provides advanced tuning features including an intelligent filter function, Lug Tuning mode and Resonant Head Tuning mode. The filter allows unwanted frequencies to be ignored by the analysis algorithm, whilst Lug Tuning mode offers the simplest and most innovative method for tuning an even frequency response at the lug positions on the drumhead.\n\nThe Preset Manager allows you to save all your favourite drum tunings and call them up when you are in the middle of the process. Drum kits can also be exported and imported, so you can share your favorite tuning setups and load new ones in from other drummers.\n\nDrum Tuning isn’t easy, and drums don’t respond exactly the same way every time you hit them. For that reason, it's valuable to know a little about the science of drum tuning. iDrumTune includes a comprehensive text on the science of drums and drum tuning in order to help you get the best of iDrumTune and to become an expert drum tuner!\n\nWatch the iDrumTune tutorial videos and read reviews on iDrumTune at www.idrumtune.com"

The purpose of this app is to make it fun and easy for people to learn how to sing these songs in parts again. It’s actually not a hard skill to develop, and with a little effort the tradition can be revitalized before it dies away.\n\nUsing the app is simple:\n- Select a song to practice by choosing it from the menu.\n- Mute or unmute any part by tapping the S (soprano), A (alto), T (tenor), or B (bass).\n- Quickly move forward or backwards through measures in the song by swiping left or right.\n- Adjust the tempo of the song by grabbing the tempo in the corner and expanding it to the left to increase the tempo, or down to decrease the tempo.\n- Pause and unpause by tapping the pause/play button at the top of the screen.\n\nApp Features:\n- Isolate each part (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass) so that you can easily learn a part individually.\n- Mute/unmute each part to listen to the different parts in any combination you like.\n- Follow along with traditional music notation. Helpful for those who already read music, and can help those who don't to quickly learn!\n- Adjust the tempo at any time while practicing.\n- Pause, rewind, and retry a segment you just can’t get.\n- Over 70 total songs included - choose from Amazing Grace and other hymns, Christmas and Easter songs, and patriotic songs!"

Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support.

      "label": "Metronome Touch. Style of pendulum.\n\nMetronome Touch is created with one objective: to design a classic metronome with a unique style, so we combined a precise pendulum, perfected accuracy, and realistic interaction. Made of aluminum and glass, Metronome Touch proves a huge statement: It is as exclusive as your device. Launching Metronome Touch, your device will become a metronome.\n\nAnyone can try to make a metronome app, but success only comes when listening to customers. That's why Metronome Touch centers around functions that musicians are looking for: The ability to tap a beat, use customizable presets to save your favorite sets (bpm, time signature and accentuation), and multiple useful ways of adjusting the bpm. Metronome Touch even goes far beyond that: Neither analog nor digital metronomes can synchronize pendulums. But Metronome Touch can. This opens completely new ways when practicing, performing on stage or doing studio recordings.\n\nShould you be teaching students, they can follow your lesson more accurately while concentrating on their own devices synchronized with Metronome Touch. You will gain your student's attention when using this outstanding technology. If you have ever been on stage with bad acoustics, you will love Metronome Touch: It will provide every single band member with a perfect steady and synchronized rhythm on stage. Even when recording a song in separate soundproofed rooms, Metronome Touch keeps you in perfect sync.\n\nEasily adjust Metronome Touch to your likes and needs with the light or dark design - relying on absolute clear vector-based display graphics  - and many well chosen professional metronome sounds.\n\nMetronome Touch is constantly being developed further to ensure the highest customer satisfaction.\n\nFEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY\n\n• Precise engine \nA completely new developed engine makes this app one of the most precise pendulum metronomes available on the App Store. Highest accuracy is supported on all iOS devices.\n\n• Ableton Link synchronization technology\n Metronome Touch was the first metronome worldwide offering pendulum synchronization on iOS devices. You can keep band members‘ metronomes or a whole orchestra in sync.\nAbleton Link provides new ways of practicing together or in a group. \n\n • Memory function\n There is an infinite number of customizable presets to save your favorite sets of bpm, time signature and accentuation.\n\n • Numerical entry\nUsing bpm display let you directly enter tempo values from 20 up to 999 bpm.\n\n• Tap2bpm \nUse the tap field that will interpret your finger taps as bpm.\n\n• Beat count and accentuation\n Choose a beat count from 1 up to 12 beats and free customizable accentuation.\n\n• Styles and sounds\n Customize Metronome Touch to your likes and needs. Choose between dark and light design as well as chosen professional metronome sounds.\n\n• Retina display\n Metronome Touch comes with a complete set of vector graphics for all display sizes and looks simply perfect on your device.\n\nFor more informations, app videos, faq's and pictures go to » www.cu4uc.com"

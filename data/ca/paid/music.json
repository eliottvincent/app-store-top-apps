Get your ideas out or play until inspiration hits using a selection of Ableton Live’s drum kits, synths and melodic instruments. Or create your own sound palette by recording the sounds around you into Note’s sampler instruments using your phone’s microphone. \n\nIf you want to take your ideas further, use Ableton Cloud to send your projects to Live (version 11.2.5 or later) without leaving the app. Open your project from Live’s browser, then keep working – you can edit all your MIDI notes, and all your samples and sounds from Note are exactly the same.\n\n\nBegin with a beat: \n• Choose from 56 Drum Sampler kits\n• Tap out a beat using the 16-pad grid\n• Quantize your beat to fix any loose timing\n• Nudge notes to correct mistakes\n• Add more layers of rhythm\n• Create beat repetitions with Note Repeat\n• Change parameters to shape your sound\n• Experiment with effects \n\nStart with a melody:\n• Choose from 261 synth sounds and 36 Melodic Sampler instruments\n• Play your melody or chord progression with either the 25-pad grid or the piano roll\n• Set a key and scale to get instantly harmonic results, or leave your options open\n• Overdub more layers of harmony\n• Change parameters to shape your sound\n• Add effects to experiment with sound design\n\nSample your environment:\n• Create your own kits by recording percussive sounds into Note’s Drum Sampler \n• Record tonal sounds to create your own Melodic Sampler instruments\n• Manipulate your samples by cutting, filtering or repitching them\n• Shape or transform your sounds with effects\n\nCapture improvisations:\n• Play something, then tap the Capture button to keep it\n• Play at the tempo that feels comfortable and Note will detect it\n• Note will recognize the length of the phrase\n• A loop is created automatically\n• Quantize it, add to it, or change the sound\n\nCreate variations:\n• Note features a grid-based Session View layout\n• Double your loops to create variation within clips\n• Duplicate your clips and create different versions of your ideas\n• Create eight tracks with up to eight clips on eight scenes\n• Try different layer combinations and song structures \n• Export your work in Session View as an audio file to listen and share"

As seen on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\n\nhttps://loopyapp.com\n\n-- “This is the best loop station on the iPhone” -- Dub FX (dubfx.net) \n-- “I pretty much own every mobile looper out there and Loopy is HANDS DOWN the best. Super simple interface with powerful features.” -- J. Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support. Please contact me with questions, bug reports, feature ideas, and other feedback at support@atastypixel.com or https://forum.loopyapp.com. I may be able to fix your issue in less time than it would take to write a negative review!"

AutoPad comes with 10 carefully designed pad sounds. Each one creates a unique atmosphere in all 12 keys.\n\n- Expand your library. You can add to the factory sounds by importing your own pads or by purchasing one of the in-app sound packs.*\n\n- Shape your sound. AutoPad's menu gives you control over crossfade time, high-pass and low-pass filters, reverb amount, pan, and volume.\n\n- Easy on storage. AutoPad's seamlessly looped sample-based drones contain just what you need to provide a pleasing atmosphere and don't take up excessive space on your device.\n\n- Stay in sync. AutoPad features a customizable metronome with a dedicated pan control. Keep your band locked in without needing to lug around a tracks rig.\n\n- Deep MIDI Control. AutoPad's MIDI Actions menu makes it easy to customize how AutoPad responds to your MIDI controller.\n\n- Use with other apps. AutoPad comes with a fully-featured AUv3 plugin!

AutoPad also supports Bluetooth MIDI controllers and AirPlay audio. \n\n- Share with friends. Make sure your band is all on the same page by easily sharing setlists with AirDrop.\n\n- Stay organized. AutoPad lets you save and recall setlists with a simple setlist manager.\n\n- Looks great. AutoPad features a dark color scheme that is easy on the eyes and performs well on the stage.\n\n\nNote on use: \n\nAutoPad sounds great in a variety of contexts, but please make sure you understand the intended use before purchase.\n\nAutoPad's sounds are designed to be played softly and continuously behind live musicians. They include the root, fifth, and octave. As such, they can be used in a major or minor context. When using AutoPad in worship music, it is not necessary to change the pad with each chord change. For example, if you have a song in the key of E, you can play a pad in E for the duration of the song.\n\n\nView Manual: https://www.audiosymmetric.com/manuals.html\nView Tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Uka-nFom-pgTB-DftgDvA\n\n\n* While files of any length can be imported into AutoPad, due to realtime memory restrictions, AutoPad loads a 3.5 minute subsection of files longer than four minutes. A short fade is applied to eliminate pops. See manual for details."

      "label": "SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps. Studio Six Digital is dedicated to making the iPhone and Touch a professional audio and acoustics test device.\n\nCheck out our full line of professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the professional digital iPhone sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real-time analyzer,  FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the energy-time curve function, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time measurement, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for more great acoustical and audio test apps, have a look at AudioTools, our premier app for audio professionals."

      "label": "Benny Greb, well known for his contributions to the drumming education community, shared the approach that he has taken personally to develop his sense of groove and improve his own timing on his instrument in his course “The Art and Science of Groove”. Now with the Gap Click app, everyone can practice his method easily with a simple-to-use app! \n\nUnlike standard metronomes which simply state the time, Gap Click helps you improve your sense of time. Gap Click is more than a metronome with a focus on improving your ability to keep tempo, become more aware and comfortable with off beat clicks and by that, become bullet proof and accurate with all notes of the subdivision.\n\nGAP CLICK\nBy scrolling through the numbers of bars and patterns you can quickly configure a “gap” of time in which the metronome drops out. When the “one” comes back around, will your playing still be in time? How long of a gap can you play through and still maintain solid tempo?\n\nMOVING CLICK\nNext you can experiment with all kinds of off-beat patterns in the Gap Bar which moves the click from the downbeat position to a different location. Can you still play your instrument and maintain the downbeat internally even when you hear the click sound on an off-beat?\n\nBoth the “click” and the “gap” portion supports a variety of different syncopated patterns allowing you the ability to practice in binary or ternary rhythms - with more or less safety net depending on your settings.\n\nFeatures\n• Ability to choose from a variety of different syncopated patterns and # of measures for both the standard \"click\" as well as the \"gap\"\n• Use the nostalgic click wheel to find the right tempo or tap to set your desired tempo from 10 to 300bpm\n• Standard quarter-note time signatures: 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4\n\nPersonalize\n• See visual feedback for each note or rest that is played\n• Accent beat 1 of each measure or turn accents off for a greater challenge\n• Flash the screen for a visual indication when switching from the \"click\" to the \"gap\"\n• Find your favorite sound from a variety of click samples hand-picked by Benny\n\nBuy Once, Use Forever\n• There are no In-App Purchases - a one time purchase includes all current and future features. \n\nTESTIMONIALS\nWhat professionals are saying about GAP CLICK:\n• \"The skills you can sharpen by using this app are integral for what it takes to be a professional drummer in any genre.\" - Matt Halpern\n• \"When I first opened the app, it made (simple) sense, without a tutorial.\" - Chris Coleman\n• \"This app helps you lock in the pocket on a whole different level.\" - Luke Holland\n• \"The Gap Click app is something that every drummer should have in their toolbox.\" - Jared Falk, Drumeo\n\nWhat our users are saying about GAP CLICK: \n• \"If you think you have good timing, this will really put you in your place.\"\n• \"Gone are the days of programming gap clicks!\"\n• \"I’ve never had so much fun being destroyed in my practice session.\"\n• \"This is by far the best money I’ve ever spent on a practice tool.\"\n\nABOUT BENNY GREB\nBenny Greb is one of the most respected drummers in the world today. Not only has he headlined nearly every major drum festival and toured with his clinics and drum camps worldwide, but he is also recognized as a composer and bandleader in his own band Moving Parts, which won him the renowned “ECHO Jazz” award - the German equivalent to The Grammys in jazz.\n\nBenny Greb published two of the most successful and critically acclaimed educational products, “The Language of Drumming” and “The Art and Science of Groove” and he has helped create many signature products available to drummers today.\n\nFind him online at https://www.bennygreb.de as well as on social media."

      "label": "Simple mandolin tuner to tune up your mandolin. This is for a standard mandolin, in GDAE tuning.\n\nTuning your mandolin can be a difficult task for you if you are just beginning mandolin. The good news is, the more you do it, the easier it becomes. A nicely tuned mandolin can make your music sound a lot better and help you greatly while you're are just getting the hang of finger placement for notes.\n\nTouch the note for the string you want to tune and then turn the tuning pegs on your mandolin and match it up with the tone that is being played. The thing that is special about mandolins, is that the strings are in pairs of two. Each string in a pair is exactly the same note. The reason why mandolins are like this is because it creates a cool chorus-like effect.\n\nTip: Make several passes tuning each of the strings. For example you might have noticed that if you have tuned all the strings once, and then back to the first one you tuned, it might be off a little bit. This is because you are increasing or decreasing the tension on each of the strings as you tune it and the instrument's body might bend ever so slightly due to this difference in tension. This causes the other strings to slightly change in pitch. So make sure you keep on checking and tuning the strings until all are in tune, so make several passes.\n\nFor more information on how to tune Mandolin visit:\nhttp://www.tuneinstrument.com/how-to.html\n\nAny questions using the App?

It's a clever combination of dynamic processors that can be set to provide a gentle transparent signal boost respecting the initial dynamic or significant colorised level maximisation. Thanks to a unique signal path, algorithms and a small set of parameters, FAC Maxima makes a complicated task easy.\n\nIn addition to the classic final stage application, FAC Maxima excels on individual tracks too. With a few changes it's easy to go from the common gain deviation compensation, e.g. for vocals, to drastical audio changes that will bring your audio material to new territories: boost reverb tails, flattenize drums… The applications are various and the possibilities are limitless.\n\n• Get the final touch!\nFAC Maxima definitely makes audio louder and that makes it an effective tool in many mastering engineers’ arsenals.\n\n• Be creative!\nEmphasis subtitle details, sometimes floor contains treasure, you will have a completely new listen to your old tracks! The audio background may indeed contain noise, but sometimes also \"pearls\" that may be revealed.\n\n• Go further!\nTired by the advertisement boost, or important speech level variation in broadcasting? Use FAC Maxima to maintain the level constant. DJ's may also benefit from the effects to normalise in real time the level of the mixed tracks.\n\nAs with all FAC products the interface has a unique sober look and provides a great user experience. FAC Maxima also brings a real-time multi-waveform graph having a 6s buffer of the audio material before and after operations, this will help on setting the right parameters and have a visual feedback."

      "label": "BLEASS Sidekick is a combination of a kick drum synth, a step sequencer, and a ducker (aka a sidechain compressor). The result is a plugin that provides a unique way to create exciting rhythmic dynamics within your music.\n\nThe kick drum synth uses an analogue-style engine inspired by vintage beatboxes, which allows it to create a wide range of classic analogue kick drum tones with ease. This synth can be triggered by the built-in 16-step sequencer or by an external MIDI input; its sound can be mixed with the audio passing through the plugin, be used to trigger the plugin’s ducker stage, or both. \n\nUsed without the ducker, BLEASS Sidechain makes it easy to add your own kick parts to loops and other percussive parts. \n\nBringing in the ducker causes the input signal to reduce in volume whenever the kick synth is triggered. When used on a drum loop this lets you impose your own creativity on the underlying feel and beat of the loop, ducking-out the loop’s kick sound and pattern so that you can replace them with a sound and pattern that you have crafted.\n\nPerhaps BLEASS Sidekick’s best trick, though, is to use the kick synth and sequencer purely as a trigger for the ducker. This lets you create fascinating and detailed dynamic rhythms within any part or track, whether individual instrument or an entire mix. \n\nThis plugin is AUv3 compatible and offers Multi-Bus output (within AUM) as well as Midi Input.\n\nMore information and tutorials available on https://www.bleass.com/sidekick"

      "label": "BLEASS Flanger is a rich sounding flanging effect offering a wide range of synchronised modulations which colours sound in a novel and unique way thanks to its complex algorithmic combinations. \n\nThere are three stages of modulation as well as two LFOs, combined offering great sonic versatility - from classic sine flanger sounds to crazy rhythmic modulations courtesy of its 6 different LFO shapes. \n\nThe ability to easily synchronize the flanging effect with the beat makes it ideal to bring subtle flanging variations while evolving harmoniously with a song’s dynamics.\n\nOur customary interface design makes for a smooth and efficient UI with clear visual feedback, increasing the enjoyment and playability of sound designing.\n\nAs with other BLEASS plugins, BLEASS Flanger is very low on CPU usage and works in all compatible hosts.\n\n\n_____TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:\n\nINPUT stage:\n- Low-shelf/High-pass input filter\n- Input gain\n\nLFO A stage: (This LFO modulates DELAY TIME)\n- SYNC: sets LFO’s synchronization between BEAT SYNC and FREE SYNC\n- RATE: sets LFO’s rate\n- OFFSET: when BEAT SYNC mode is activated, sets LFO’s offset relatively to the beat\n- SHAPE: select LFO’s shape between sine, triangle, sawtooth, inverted sawtooth, square and random\n- PHASE: sets offset between the LFO’s two stereo channels\n- DEPTH: sets LFO’s amount as a percentage of DELAY TIME’s value\n- STEREO METER: represents LFO’s state\n\nLFO B stage: (This LFO can modulate either DELAY TIME, DELAY FEEDBACK or DELAY WIDTH)\n- SYNC: sets the LFO’s synchronization between BEAT and FREE\n- RATE: sets the LFO’s rate\n- OFFSET: if SYNC is set to BEAT, sets LFO’s offset relatively to the beat\n- SHAPE: select LFO’s shape between sine, triangle, sawtooth, inverted sawtooth, square and random\n- PHASE: sets offset between LFO’s two channels\n- DESTINATION: sets the LFO’s destination between DELAY TIME, FEEDBACK and WIDTH\n- DEPTH: sets LFO’s amount as a percentage of DESTINATION’s value\n- METER: represents LFO’s state (depending on the selected modulation destination)\n\nENVELOPE FOLLOWER stage: (modulates DELAY TIME depending on the input signal’s level)\n- AMOUNT: sets the amount of modulation as a percentage of DELAY TIME’s value\n- ATTACK: sets the attack of the follower\n- RELEASE: sets the release of the follower\n\nDELAY stage: \n- TIME: sets average delay time\n- FEEDBACK: sets average delay feedback\n- WIDTH: sets delay time’s difference between both channels (and average delay time when width is modulated by LFO B)\n\nMIX stage:\n- POLARITY: if set to “+“, wet signal is added to the dry signal, if set to “-“, wet signal is subtracted to the dry signal\n- DRY/WET: sets the amount of wet signal added (or subtracted) to the dry signal\n\nCheck out www.bleass.com for video tutorials and demos!\n\n* PLEASE NOTE: this is an Audio Unit Effect plugin (AUv3) which requires a compatible host such as AUM, Audiobus, GarageBand, Cubasis, BM3 and Auria. You can also use the BLEASS Flanger as a standalone app using headphones, a mic or an external sound card. *"

      "label": "BLEASS Phaser is an all-encompassing phasing effect which offers a vast array of sonic possibilities, from resonant swirls to stunning atmospheric stereo sounds. \nA colorful and magnetizing Spectrum View coincides with the notch frequencies, and brings an instantly pleasing sonic and optic effect into the sound design process.\n\nPopularised by everyone from Queen to Chromeo, Jean-Michel Jarre to Tame Impala, the phaser effect is great for many instruments such as synthesizer, guitar, bass, and vocals. \nNo modulation collection would be complete without a phaser. This is why BLEASS Phaser delivers at the same time all of the classic phasing effects through 40 refined presets as well as a large pull of stereo functionalities and interweaving modulations thanks to its frequency & spread LFOs, as well as a precise control over the stereo.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS: \n\nThe phaser effect processes the signal through successive all-pass filters and adds the resulting signal to the original to create phase cancellation around certain frequencies (notches). A feedback loop reinjects a certain amount of the processed signal back into the filters chain.\n\nPHASER stage:\n\n- Notches: sets the number of all-pass filters, adding a filter creates a new notch in the signal’s spectrum. Notches count can go from 1 to 24.\n- Frequency: sets the center frequency of the phaser (the frequency of the all-pass filters).\n- Spread: sets the spacing between the notches by changing the Q factor of the filters.\n- Feedback: sets the amount of processed signal reinjected into the filters chain. Feedback can be negative.\n- Feedback Color: sets the frequency of a low-pass filter applied to the feedback signal.\n- Spectrum: a spectrum view representing the estimated frequency position of the notches. Touching this view will adjust the center frequency.\n\nFREQUENCY LFO & SPREAD LFO stages:\n\nSine LFOs that modulate the center frequency and the spread parameter of the phaser.\n\n- Sync: sets the sync state between BEAT (synchronised with the host transport and tempo) and FREE.\n- Shape: sets the shape of the LFO between Sine and Triangle.\n- Rate: sets the LFO rate in Hertz if Sync is set to Free or in fraction of a bar if Sync is set to Beat.\n- Phase: sets the phase difference between left and right channels.\n- Amount: sets the amplitude of the LFO.\n\nMIX stage:\n- Depth: sets the mix between the dry input signal and the signal processed through the filters. When Depth is set at 100%, both signals are at the same level."

      "label": "Note reading made fun! Note Rush is a game for practising note reading on the music staff to help you learn to play the piano, keyboard, flute, saxophone, violin... you name it! Note Rush shows you one note at a time in random order then uses the microphone to listen as you play through them like you would with note reading flash cards, only these flash cards check that you're playing the right note! \n\nPlay with a bunch of fun themes and race to earn stars and beat your best time! Note Rush is great for teaching keyboard geography by making sure each note is played in the correct octave. An indispensable music theory must-have for learning sight reading at all levels of music education.\n\n\"Great app for learning notes!\" - App Store Review.\n\n\"So much better than flash cards! My son loves using this app and his note reading has improved tremendously since starting. I'm thankful he can do this on his own and it keeps track of his high scores which is highly motivating for him.\" - App Store Review.\n\n\"A blockbuster hit with teachers and students... I especially like using it at group lessons.\" - Leila Viss, 88pianokeys.me \n\n\"Note Rush has quickly become my favorite app for piano teaching.\" - Joy Morin, colorinmypiano.com\n\n\"Note Rush is a motivating app that engages students to improve quickly with their note reading skills. It is definitely one of my top favorites and will be used often!\" - Jennifer Foxx, musiceducatorresources.com\n\n\"Note Rush is a great way to review notes for the One Minute Club.\" - Susan Paradis, susanparadis.com\n\n*** Having trouble? See noterushapp.com/troubleshooting for help. ***\n\nListens to Your Instrument\n------------------------------\nNote Rush helps students learn a strong association between notes on the page and keys on your instrument by using your device's microphone to detect when you play each note. Works with pianos, keyboards, flutes, violins, you name it! (See Q&A below for more about supported instruments.)\n\nStudent-paced\n------------------\nNote Rush goes as fast or as slow as the student, with no time limits, so is suitable for complete beginners right through to being a fun challenge even for teachers!\n\nGrand Staff Context\n-----------------------\nThe whole grand staff is always visible, showing each note in full context and helping students improve their note recognition across the two staves.\n\nOctave-Sensitive Keyboard Geography\n---------------------------------------------\nIt's a \"B\", but which \"B\"?? Note Rush teaches keyboard geography by making sure you're getting the note in the right octave every time.\n\nGreat for Home Practise\n-------------------------\nStudents will rush to their instrument at home every day with NoteRush, chasing stars and high scores! Unlike flash cards, children can drill note identification at home with no music-reading parent required to check if they're getting them correct - Note Rush checks for you! Play every day and you'll be great at reading piano music in no time.\n\nLevels\n-------\nNote Rush has fifteen built-in Levels, from Middle C-Position right through to the full grand staff with 2 ledger lines above and below. There are Levels for Treble Clef, Bass Clef or full Grand Staff! Or make your own levels to practise reading specific notes, with sharps and flats for an added challenge!\n\nBetter Than Flash Cards!\n-------------------------\nUse Note Rush instead of printed flash cards! Note Rush was designed to replace the cards used in One Minute Club - a challenge you can run in your studio where students have to complete a given level in under a minute. Give it a try!\n\n--\nNote Rush is made by Thomas Grayston, a software developer, pianist, and husband to a piano teacher."

      "label": "BARBARA has been developed primarily to handle mixed meters, which means the ability to play bars with changing time signatures. As it is a programmable metronome, it has turned out that BARBARA offers many possibilities for both professional and less professional musicians to practice.\n\nBARBARA is a programmable metronome, but, please, do not confuse this with computer programming. Programming BARBARA means just pressing buttons marked with familiar musical symbols, and you'll see it is easy. By pressing the buttons you create sequences of bars that BARBARA plays.\n\nBARBARA the Metronome does not just tick. It plays bars. BARBARA has several pages of buttons with which you can make it play sequences of bars with notes like quarter notes, eight notes, sixteenth notes, and even thirty-second notes. You can specify how many times, or minutes, each bar is played.\n\nThere are rest buttons with which you can specify a certain kind of silence between played bars. With tempo buttons you can set or change the tempo of the metronome in any position in a sequence of bars.\n\nBARBARA can be made to tick certain sections of music with a different metronome sound.\n\nThere are several ways how BARBARA can repeat sequences of bars. You can even create a repeated sequence that is inside a longer sequence that is also repeated.\n\nWhen sequences of bars are repeated, it is possible to increase or decrease the tempo for each new repetition.\n\nBARBARA will store the sequences of bars that you create. You can name your sequences and play them later. The metronome app contains many demo sequences that will help you to learn how the metronome can be used.\n\nAnd yes, BARBARA works easily as a traditional metronome when you make it repeat a single bar. You can set the tempo and activate the metronome by tapping an empty area of the main screen. You can even activate it as a traditional metronome with a single press of a button."

It will leave out beats randomly to force you to strengthen your own inner time-keeping muscles, and it has other cool features for odd meters, drum machine-style patterns, and more... this is an awesome learning, grooving, solidifying tool.\"\n\nStrengthen your inner sense of rhythm! Time Guru is the only metronome with the ability to mute its sound at random, in sequenced patterns, or both, so that you can assess whether you tend to rush or drag or loose your place with odd meters. Time Guru can periodically leave you on your own so that you strengthen your own internal sense of time, rather than relying on the constant, rigid, external time keeping of a metronome. It's like training wheels that sometimes come up off the ground.\n\nTime Guru also features:  \n-the ability to play in different time signatures or sequences of time signatures\n-create rhythmic drum-machine like patterns\n-save presets for tempo, meter, sound and muting-\n-35 loud sound sets; \n-Human or robot voice counting in English, Chinese, French, German or Russian - great for teaching!\n-tap tempo (5 to 300 BPM range)\n-super accurate, rock-solid timing via a customized audio engine. \n\nAnd of course it can function as a normal metronome. \n\nNoTreble.com says: \"I love the aesthetic and layout of Time Guru. It’s very simple and elegant. Time Guru also offers ability to set randomness of your subdivisions (great for testing your internal clock)….There is one thing that Time Guru does that I absolutely love, and for which, this app will always live on my iPhone – at the top of the screen, you will see a series of numbers (1-7). When you press a number, it is set first in a sequence and you can choose a subdivision that will then repeat that number of times (or set it to rest that number of times). Sound confusing? It isn’t, because the layout is so simple. Every time you press a new number, it is set next in the sequence and you choose your continue to choose your subdivisions.\""

But as Apple likes to say, there's an app for that.\"\n—iMore\n\nMusic Info features a clean, modern design that’s simple and efficient to use. When you open the app, if a song is playing in the Music app, its info automatically appears and updates when the song changes. You can also browse your library to select a song and view its metadata. Or get a song’s info directly in the Music app from the share sheet — it’s Music’s missing Get Info button.\n\nMore features\n● Select a song using Music Recognition powered by Shazam\n● Use home screen quick actions to quickly select a song\n● Play the selected song in-app\n● Tap and hold text to copy information\n● Drag and drop artwork into other apps\n● Light and dark mode\n● Keyboard shortcuts\n● Split view multitasking and multiple windows on iPadOS\n● Full accessibility support including Dynamic Type, VoiceOver, and Voice Control\n\nHow it works\n● The Music app, like iTunes before it, saves metadata for each song you have in your library. Music Info reveals this information that otherwise isn’t accessible on iOS and iPadOS.\n● All songs in your library can be accessed in the Music Info app, no matter if they were added via Apple Music, purchased, matched, uploaded, or otherwise synced to your device. Songs in Apple Music that haven’t been added to your library cannot be accessed.\n● The share sheet action is available when sharing a song in the Music app. Note that only songs that are available on Apple Music can be shared. Music Info will try to look up that song in your library which may require an internet connection. It’s possible it may not be able to find the right song, for example, if you’ve renamed it. If that is the case, you can still use the app to access its information even without an internet connection.\n\nThings to note\n● Song metadata cannot be edited on iOS and iPadOS.\n● Music Info does not work with any third-party music services.\n\n* All available metadata:\n- Artwork\n- Title\n- Artist\n- Album\n- Album artist\n- Composer\n- Genre\n- Release date\n- Duration\n- Play count\n- Last played\n- Grouping\n- Track\n- Disc number\n- Compilation\n- Explicit\n- Rating\n- BPM\n- Skip count\n- Date added\n- Comments\n- Lyrics"

      "label": "BeatMirror uses your device's built-in microphone to detect musical tempo in real-time. Set a target tempo with the special tempo keyboard and then start the music. A real-time graph of your tempo will appear right away, allowing you to scroll through your tempo history and see trends. Perfect for musicians looking to build their internal rhythm, or to see the tempo of their favorite songs in real-time!  \n\nTESTIMONIALS:\n\"BeatMirror truly is simplicity at its finest. That quality is missing from most apps who try to cram too many features into one app thus making it difficult to use and many times buggy. We feel like your app is VERY good. We're reviewing BeatMirror and it will be a part of the next show. It's got nothing but thumbs up!\" - Phil Smith of \"Drummer's Weekly Groovecast\" (podcast)\n\n\"When I first heard about BeatMirror, I was kind of skeptical but after trying it out for weeks now and playing with it everyday, I'm mindblown. Alex really wanted to put a focus on helping drummers improve their internal clock and I really think he's done so.\" - Richard Ducat of \"Drummers I Like\" (podcast)\n\n\"Overall, this app is so quick and simple to use, there's not really an excuse as to why you wouldn't use it during practice sessions, just to see how you’re improving. If you're a drummer, having an app on your phone or tablet like BeatMirror just makes sense.\" - Laura Barnes of MI-PRO (mi-pro.co.uk)\n\nFEATURES:\nGood music needs good rhythm. But learning to stay on beat—learning to groove—isn't always easy. Build your inner metronome with BeatMirror and catch yourself when you're speeding up or slowing down. Here’s what BeatMirror has to offer:\n- Wide tempo range. Tempo detection between 40 bpm and 208 bpm.\n- Fast. Detects tempo quickly and accurately.\n- Flexible. Accurate across time signatures (e.g., 4/4, 6/8) and rhythm styles (e.g., swing).\n- Real-time, scrollable graph. Displays current tempo and tempo history in real-time.\n- Zoom features. Choose tight, loose, or full zoom—or double-tap the graph for easy toggling.\n- Easy sharing. Share your tempo graph with a tap.\n- Easy-to-read interface. Optimized for various light environments, such as stages and practice spaces.\n- Tempo keyboard. A special tempo keyboard (with tap pad) lets you set a target tempo easily and intuitively.\n- Visual feedback. If you drift from your target tempo, BeatMirror shows a red (slow down!), blue (speed up!), or green (perfect!) indicator.\n- Custom count-in. BeatMirror gives you an optional count-in before you start playing.\n- Versatile. Perfect for solo practice, band rehearsals, recorded music, and you can even use it at concerts! \n- Tutorial. An in-app tutorial gets you up and running in a flash.\n\nTIPS FOR BEST PERFORMANCE:\n- Avoid handling your device during tempo measurement.\n- Be mindful of competing noise near the device's microphone (e.g., conversation, typing).\n- Unplug any headphones with a built-in microphone.\n\nNOTES ON USAGE:\n- \"Target Tempo.\" BeatMirror is aimed at musicians and bands looking to build their internal rhythm and musical skills. With that in mind, you are prompted for a \"target tempo\" (the tempo you're aiming for) prior to tempo detection. To ensure highly accurate results, the detection range is limited to roughly ±20% of your target tempo. (Tempos outside of this range will not be detected.)\n- Recorded music. To detect the tempo of recorded music using BeatMirror, follow these steps:\n1) Play a song from your favorite music player app using the device speaker (i.e., unplug your headphones). Or, play the song from a different device altogether.\n2) Open BeatMirror and set a rough target tempo by tapping along.\n3) The song's precise tempo will then be displayed in real-time.\n\nQuestions about BeatMirror? Please don't hesitate to get in touch at alex[at]tenkettles[dot]com. Happy practicing! -Alex"

      "label": "Drambo is an innovative modular groovebox and audio processing environment. Modular components are used to build synthesized and sample based instruments or audio effects using high-quality DSP and audio-rate modulation. Tied to a powerful sequencer, it’s an optimal music creation tool for sound design, composition, performance and experimentation.\n\nAt the heart of Drambo lies an entirely new concept that makes modular creations easy, fun and affordable. Modules are connected automatically, with no cables as you add or rearrange them. A dynamic interface creates modulation knobs when you need them. Modules may house other modules, so you can keep your patch well organized. Of course, automatic connections can be overridden. In Drambo you can focus on playing with sound and signal structure without getting lost in wires.\n\nUse a deep and innovative sequencer to compose patterns and whole tracks, for production or live performance. Go beyond simple looping sequences with parameter locking, conditional step components, parameters automation and powerful scene morphing. Drambo works equally well as a self-contained standalone app or audio unit plugin with audio and MIDI connectivity as an AUV3 instrument, audio effect and MIDI effect. No modular experience necessary to get started playing with preset sounds and effects.\n\nYou can use Drambo as\n\n• A complete music production and performance environment\n\n• Endless modular playground, that allows you to build, modify and store custom instruments and effects. For instance: build a custom synth, sample and resample, build a Theremin using a gyroscope module, or turn your table into a playable surface, by processing microphone input with physical modelling modules. Get weird or make functional instruments and tools.\n\n• MIDI sequencer, that works with hardware and AUv3 instruments (e.g. Drambo sequences other instruments in an AU host app). Moreover Drambo can generate custom MIDI CC messages or modulation signals to control modular synths via DC coupled interfaces.\n\n• AUv3 synthesizer, effect or sequencer in other DAWs. Drambo can replace a lot of audio plugins. For instance: you may use it as a chorus, phaser, reverb, filter, equalizer, complex modular delay, decimator, frequency shifter, MIDI effect or complex modulator for other synths. You may combine, modulate and sequence them in no time.\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Polyphonic, stereo processing and audio-rate modulation. All signals are equal. Up to 8 voices per modular instrument rack.\n\n• Unique modular concept: cable-less, drag'n'drop, color coding dynamic interface, automatic connections, and customizable compact, rack views.\n \n• Directional flow makes Drambo routing and patching straightforward. Signal flows only left to right, so there are no instant feedback routings in Drambo. Delayed feedback is possible using certain modules.\n \n• Simple and clean interface, that scales to every size and device orientation\n  \n• Custom modular racks that can be nested, with presets at the track, rack, and module level.\n\n• Clip launcher / song arrager. \n\n• 16-tracks, polyphonic sequencer with parameter locks, automation and step components. 8 dedicated step sequence editor types, piano-roll, powerful automation designer with drawing modes and cubic Bezier curves.\n\n• Audio Units hosting ( standalone app only )\n\n• Over 120 modules available, such as: oscillators, samplers, physical modelling modules, LFOs, envelope generators, filters, audio effects, mixers, MIDI processors, sequencers and math functions.\n\n• Morph groups: you can morph many parameters using a single slider.\n\n• Available as a standalone app, AUv3 instrument, effect and MIDI effect.\n\n• MIDI, MPE and Ableton Link support\n\nWith Drambo, you are in charge. Create the music from your vision to reality.\n\n\"Drambo changes the face of iOS music apps.\" Cult of Mac\n\nVisit https://patchstorage.com/platform/drambo/ for community content."

And, thanks to BLEASS’ super-intuitive interface design, that entire sonic palette is within easy reach of even the most non-technical of musicians.\n\nMegalit includes many innovations that will empower your sound designs:\n- Advanced wavetable oscillators can adjust both wavetable position and fold, bringing near-infinite variety to each of the synth’s 130+ wavetables;\n- Per-oscillator unison mode allows you to create complex layering that would normally require you to load additional synths into your project;\n- Noise generator with dedicated high- and low-pass filtering for super-flexible non-tonal sounds and sound components.\n- Resonant high-pass and low-pass filters that can be applied to individual oscillators or pairs of oscillators, as can the built-in waveshaper and bit-crusher processors;\n- Four LFOs, each with its own timing curve and output smoothing, that allow for the creation of exceptionally complex – not to mention original – modulation patterns;\n- Advanced Motion Sequencer for the creation of complex repeating modulation patterns;\n- Per-patch storage of performance controller response curves ensure a sound will always respond the way you expect it to;\n- Patch randomising feature always produces useable sounds;\n- Built-in multi-band upward/downward compressor provides exquisite control over a sound’s dynamics and punchiness.\n\nAll of Megalit’s parameters, settings and controls, no matter how advanced, are laid out at your fingertips, with intuitive visual feedback ensuring you always know exactly what the synth is doing. And, despite its huge sonic power, Megalit is super-efficient on your system, leaving you with plenty of headroom for running additional instruments and effects… or, better still, more instances of Megalit!\n\n\nBLEASS Megalit is available as an AUv3 plugin or standalone App.\nBLEASS Megalit is also available for Window & Mac Users.\nMore information available on https://www.bleass.com/megalit"

      "label": "Metronome Touch. Style of pendulum.\n\nMetronome Touch is created with one objective: to design a classic metronome with a unique style, so we combined a precise pendulum, perfected accuracy, and realistic interaction. Made of aluminum and glass, Metronome Touch proves a huge statement: It is as exclusive as your device. Launching Metronome Touch, your device will become a metronome.\n\nAnyone can try to make a metronome app, but success only comes when listening to customers. That's why Metronome Touch centers around functions that musicians are looking for: The ability to tap a beat, use customizable presets to save your favorite sets (bpm, time signature and accentuation), and multiple useful ways of adjusting the bpm. Metronome Touch even goes far beyond that: Neither analog nor digital metronomes can synchronize pendulums. But Metronome Touch can. This opens completely new ways when practicing, performing on stage or doing studio recordings.\n\nShould you be teaching students, they can follow your lesson more accurately while concentrating on their own devices synchronized with Metronome Touch. You will gain your student's attention when using this outstanding technology. If you have ever been on stage with bad acoustics, you will love Metronome Touch: It will provide every single band member with a perfect steady and synchronized rhythm on stage. Even when recording a song in separate soundproofed rooms, Metronome Touch keeps you in perfect sync.\n\nEasily adjust Metronome Touch to your likes and needs with the light or dark design - relying on absolute clear vector-based display graphics  - and many well chosen professional metronome sounds.\n\nMetronome Touch is constantly being developed further to ensure the highest customer satisfaction.\n\nFEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY\n\n• Precise engine \nA completely new developed engine makes this app one of the most precise pendulum metronomes available on the App Store. Highest accuracy is supported on all iOS devices.\n\n• Ableton Link synchronization technology\n Metronome Touch was the first metronome worldwide offering pendulum synchronization on iOS devices. You can keep band members‘ metronomes or a whole orchestra in sync.\nAbleton Link provides new ways of practicing together or in a group. \n\n • Memory function\n There is an infinite number of customizable presets to save your favorite sets of bpm, time signature and accentuation.\n\n • Numerical entry\nUsing bpm display let you directly enter tempo values from 20 up to 999 bpm.\n\n• Tap2bpm \nUse the tap field that will interpret your finger taps as bpm.\n\n• Beat count and accentuation\n Choose a beat count from 1 up to 12 beats and free customizable accentuation.\n\n• Styles and sounds\n Customize Metronome Touch to your likes and needs. Choose between dark and light design as well as chosen professional metronome sounds.\n\n• Retina display\n Metronome Touch comes with a complete set of vector graphics for all display sizes and looks simply perfect on your device.\n\nFor more informations, app videos, faq's and pictures go to » www.cu4uc.com"

      "label": "Way more than a metronome, the Time Trainer adds five training tools to help you develop your own internal sense of time!\n\nThis is an accurate and stable metronome (many metronome apps out there are not) and features:\n• tap tempo (to work out tempos by tapping a button),\n• countdown timer (for keeping your practice to schedule!)\n• many different sounds (you like cowbell, wood or xylophone?)\n• accent control (for odd time playing)\n• visual metronome movement with a flash on the beat\n• vibrate option (on each beat or just accent)\n\n...but then we add to that with five training tools which will really help you develop your own time feel - essential for all musicians!\n\n• Bar Breaks • will mute the metronome for a bar or more forcing you to keep your time solid and be perfectly synchronized when the clicks return! This is a superb exercise and will really help develop confidence in holding your tempo. You can adjust how many bars are solid at the start then how many bars are solid and how many bars are muted which will cycle for the duration of the session. You can also select \"random\" mode and a % of bars (that you set) that will be dropped for an even more challenging practice session!\n\n• Random Beat Drop • does exactly what it says on the tin... some of the beats (clicks) will be muted at random, forcing you to be confident with your time and not rely on the click too much. Many people chase the beat or try and anticipate it, and this exercise will help you stop those bad habits! I've personally found that the \"gradual\" setting is most useful, a five minute session starting at 100% with more and more beats muted up to the % that you set.\n\n• Speed Up • is a tool I have wanted for years for my own practice so now I made one. Often when working on scales, arpeggios or licks you want to start at an easy speed where you are playing it 100% correctly and gradually push your technique by playing it faster and faster. With this tool you set a start tempo, end tempo and duration of you practice session and off you go, no more stopping to bump the bpm up a few notches every minute!\n\n• Step Upper • Many people requested that we make a programmable mode, most likely to be used to be able to move from one consistent tempo to another, rather than the gradual increase you get in the Speed Upper. You can program a tempo for X number of bars OR minutes :)\n\n• Subdivisions • Another heavily requested feature was to add in subdivisions for those that need to hear them, and for super slow tempo's where having subdivisions can be really helpful!\n\nI'm sure you will find all of the tools very useful, and of course you will find full support on the justinguitar community forum - please take the time to rate and review it, good things will help promote it and anything negative will help me improve it!\n\nWishing you many happy hours of practice :) Justin"

Silo combines microscopic granulation with macroscopic reverb tails to extract new realms from your existing sounds.\n\nSilo's first section, the granulator, breaks the incoming signal to tiny little bits (called \"grains\") before reconstructing it with massive amounts of control. You can change the speed and pitch of the signal independently and in real-time!\n\nThese grains are then sent to Silo's unique spatializer, which throws the grains all over the stereo field. The spatializer contains a number of motion algorithms to add trajectory to your grains, such as the orbital \"Moons\", the shooting \"Meteors\", or the squirmy \"Biological\". After using this spatializer, you'll never want to use a traditional auto-panner ever again.\n\nFinally, the signal washes through one of Silo's many reverb algorithms, from small, resonant spaces to enormous, booming voids. From \"Bokeh\" to \"Nebula\", each mode can be tweaked to frame your sound perfectly.\n\nAs an AUv3 plugin, Silo has been tested to work perfectly with Garageband, Drambo, AUM, Cubasis, Beatmaker, Nanostudio, apeMatrix, Loopy Pro, and more! Additionally, with its clear layout and smart resizing, Silo can be used on tablets and phones with ease."

      "label": "This is a AUv3 compatible analyser / tuner which can be used as plugin with your favourite DAW such as Cubasis, Meteor, Auria or GarageBand.\n\nThis plugin can be used directly within your DAW to analyse either the monitored input signal from your audio device or your mixer output. It uses Apple's accelerate framework to perform fast high resolution 8K fast fourier transformations to display a real time frequency spectrum. The result is an accurate representation of the sampled sound broken down into its frequency components. \n\nYou can use this plugin in conjunction with equalisers and parametric filters to obtain a nice flat mix or eliminate hard to find unwanted noise or hiss.\n\nVarious display modes include, linear narrow band, logarithmic narrow band, Octave, 1/3 Octave, 1/6 Octave and Mixer Mode with selectable ANSI A and C weighting curves. Up to 64 times oversampling can be applied to obtain more stable readings.\n\nThis plugin also includes a Digital Tuner mode which allows real time note detection, frequency and cents deviation from true pitch.\n\nThis is one of a suite of AUv3 compatible plugins which will also soon be available from 4Pockets."

      "label": "With SonoSequencr you can create individual sequences to perform recurring tasks with just one click.\n\nIf you have multiple Sonos devices and want to play a radio station on all of them, it takes some time to set this up. With SonoSequencr, all you have to do is open the app and tap your previously created sequence.\nYou can lock your iOS device or use another app while your sequence is running in the background.\nOf course, you can also start it from the widget, Apple Watch or using Flic Buttons.\n\nHere are some examples:\n- Group kitchen and dining room, set volume to 5, start a radio station and set a sleep timer to 2 hours\n- Switch your Playbar in the living room to the TV input, set the volume to 40, add dining room and set the equalizer settings for both devices to neutral\n- Disable the subwoofer and enable voice enhancement + night mode on the Playbar in the living room\n- Set the equalizer settings for all your devices to specific values\n- Disable touch on speaker and enable status light for all your devices\n- Set the volume of the kitchen and living room to the same value as in the dining room\n- Make an announcement with your individual text in the children's room\n- etc...\n\nEach of these examples, created once, requires only one tap in the widget or on your Apple Watch.\n\nSonoSequencr also includes a restricted mode. This allows you to restrict control to specific devices, among other things.\n\n\nUsing an optional in-app purchase, you can also start sequences at specific times or via external triggers like IFTTT. Of course, this requires that the iOS device is on the same network as your Sonos devices at the time. For intensive use of external triggers, it is recommended to run SonoSequencr in 'server mode'. In this mode, SonoSequencr is always running in the foreground on a dedicated iOS device. SonoSequencr still supports iOS9.\n\nThere are many more features like grid view, create dynamic alarms, HTTP requests, launch other apps, automatic battery charging in server mode, transfer sequences between devices, etc....\n\nYou can only use music (radio streams/tracks/albums) for your sequences that are stored in your Sonos Favorites (My Sonos) or in your TuneIn radio stations. You can't search your entire music library in this app. Just add your most used music to my Sonos then it can be used in your sequences.\n\nThe Timed Sequences feature is only available with an optional in-app purchase 'Premium'. With this automatically renewing subscription, up to 20 sequences can be run at freely configurable times. The function is only active as long as a valid subscription exists. The costs are billed via the iTunes account. The subscription will be renewed automatically within 24 hours before expiration (same time and costs), unless it is cancelled before in 'Settings' -> 'Manage Subscriptions' or in the iTunes settings.\n\nTo use this app you must have a working Sonos system. SonoSequencr supports Sonos software 1 and 2.\n\nFor terms and conditions and privacy policy see:\nhttps://celltekk.de/sonosequencr/help/privacy\n\nThis is not an official Sonos app."

Who wants to hear an entire song anymore? It’s 2014. You're far too busy to and important to invest any time past the first 60 seconds of a track. What happens at 61 seconds? Boredom, that’s what. All you need is a verse and a chorus. Then, get to the next jam. SWEET. That’s why my Party Hour Playlist Creator makes every party as efficiently awesome as possible! You rock out to only the best part of each song and keep it rolling. What’s even more efficient: you can easily set how many songs in your playlist so you know exactly how long you’ll be partying.

Our notation looks professionally engraved so you’ll be ready to read real sheet music. This precision app will hone your timing and help you develop a strong, internalized sense of rhythm.\n\nThis third app in the Musical Meter suite introduces the following concepts:\n• complex time (7/8, 5/4, and variable)\n• tuplets (duplets, triplets, quadruplets, quintuplets, and sextuplets)\n\nNOTE: This app comes with all features enabled.\n\nSight reading and timing exercises are mentally demanding, so have fun but remember to pace yourself.\n\nEnjoy!"

Now with Drum Kit Designer feature and detailed online tutorials.\n\nFeatured in Modern Drummer 'New and Notable' - July 2018  \n\n\"an invaluable aid not only for drummers but also studio engineers and producers\" - Sound on Sound Magazine\n\n\"I can’t recommend this app highly enough ... for the money, it is indispensable. It's simple, accurate, looks good, and the tuning information is worth the cost of the app alone.\" - www.mikedolbear.com\n\n“***** I never knew I could have this much fun tuning drums!” – Adamrod (App Store review)\n\n“***** Just tuned my first drum and this app is awesome!” – bburt85 (App Store review)\n\n“***** Buy this app if you are a drummer!!!” Lildrummerboy (App Store review)\n\nThe original and most innovative electronic drum tuning app - iDrumTune Pro brings unrivalled accuracy and features that have never been possible before for assisting with drum tuning. Built by world experts in drums and musical acoustics, and backed up by a detailed online training course on Drum Sound and Drum Tuning.\n\niDrumTune Pro includes the following features:\n\n* Pitch Tuning – to make your drums sing and allow you to play musical phrases around the kit\n\n* Lug Tuning – to ensure that the drumhead is evenly tuned and gives a smooth and warm tone\n\n* Resonant Head Tuning – to allow you to be sure that the two heads are working together and giving rich overtones\n\n* Spectrum Analyzer – so you can really start to understand what frequencies are excited and heard when playing the drums\n\n* Drum Kit Presets – so you can save and load your favourite tunings and share them with the world. Now also includes the interactive Drum Kit Designer feature.\n\n* The Science of Drum Tuning – and extensive manual on the science and art of drum tuning and getting the best out of iDrumTune Pro \n\niDrumTune is the first and by far the most intelligent and accurate system for analyzing drum sounds and assisting tuning – developed by drummers, music producers and acoustics research Professors. iDrumTune provides you with a measurement of the drumhead vibration frequency, much in the same way to an acoustic guitar tuner which measures the vibration frequency of a guitar string. In Pitch Tuning mode, you simply hold the iPhone over the center of a drum, about 2-4 inches away, and strike the drum in the center.\n\nThe iDrumTune readout shows the recorded sound waveform and gives the strongest frequency recorded. There is also a tuning indicator bar which shows the drumhead tuning relative to musical notes, so iDrumTune can be used to ensure that your drums are in key with each other or the song you are playing. A frequency spectrum view also allows more detailed analysis and helps with tuning the drum at the lug positions.\n\niDrumTune provides advanced tuning features including an intelligent filter function, Lug Tuning mode and Resonant Head Tuning mode. The filter allows unwanted frequencies to be ignored by the analysis algorithm, whilst Lug Tuning mode offers the simplest and most innovative method for tuning an even frequency response at the lug positions on the drumhead.\n\nThe Preset Manager allows you to save all your favourite drum tunings and call them up when you are in the middle of the process. Drum kits can also be exported and imported, so you can share your favorite tuning setups and load new ones in from other drummers.\n\nDrum Tuning isn’t easy, and drums don’t respond exactly the same way every time you hit them. For that reason, it's valuable to know a little about the science of drum tuning. iDrumTune includes a comprehensive text on the science of drums and drum tuning in order to help you get the best of iDrumTune and to become an expert drum tuner!\n\nWatch the iDrumTune tutorial videos and read reviews on iDrumTune at www.idrumtune.com"

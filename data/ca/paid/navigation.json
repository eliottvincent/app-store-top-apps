      "label": "Theodolite is a multi-function viewfinder that combines a compass, two-axis inclinometer, rangefinder, GPS, map, nav calculator, and geo-overlay photo/movie camera into one indispensable app. Theodolite was one of the very first augmented reality (AR) apps when it was released in 2009, and it’s been downloaded and used by millions of customers since then. Uses are endless, and the app is great for land measurements, outdoor sports, sightseeing, navigation, and finding your way around. Theodolite is a pro grade app and is used extensively by surveyors, geologists, architects, engineers, competitive sportsmen, first responders, military personnel, and search and rescue workers around the world. \n\nTheodolite lets you take data-overlay photos and movies with 2X-8X zoom. Overlay geographical data, angle markings, date/time, author/company info, and project notes directly on photos and movies for later reference. The same data is written into the metadata record of images, making image files self-contained data records. Third-party apps can tap into Theodolite's advanced camera functions with a camera sharing feature.\n\nView current position on the built-in map with optional offline Outdoors maps that include topo contours, roads, trails, landmarks, campgrounds, ski lifts, and more. Live map markers continually update distance/heading relative to the current location and also show wayfinding info in the main viewfinder. Draw polygons on the map to mark things like property boundaries and trails, and import/export polygon data via KML.\n\nShare map markers and nav calculator points with other users of Theodolite via text messages or e-mail. This powerful capability opens up a wide range of collaborative uses including team land surveying, accident investigations, spotting wild fires, triangulation of landmarks, and advanced tactical observation and targeting. With an optional in-app purchase to enable team tracking, you can share location with up to 20 people on Theodolite's map.\n\nTheodolite includes features for serious users like a reference angle mode, nav calculator, map marker import/export, manual and automatic data logging with CSV and KML export, clipboard integration, %grade display, mil compass readout, optical rangefinders (including a mil-based reticle, sniper-style stadiametric graphs, and a variable 4X-24X scope), and night filters to improve use in dark conditions.\n\nTheodolite can provide location in military grid reference system (MGRS) coordinates, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, British/Irish National Grids, US National Grid, Maidenhead locator system, Map Grid of Australia, and six latitude/longitude formats. Optional US State Plane coordinates include SPCS27 and SPCS83 zones covering all US States. The optional Datum Pack adds over 230 geodetic datums to the app to improve position computation from GPS data, covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.\n\nAR Layers include navigational aids like the sun, moon, planets, and Polaris (North star), and the optional US Mountain Summits layer that shows over 70,000 US mountain summits in the viewfinder.\n\nTheodolite has been shown in Apple Keynotes, featured on the App Store, and has been a #1 selling Navigation app in App Stores around the world. Since its introduction in 2009, Theodolite has defined augmented reality navigation. The app continually introduces new technologies, pushing the limits of iOS app development and taking advantage of new hardware capabilities.\n\nFind out why Apple named Theodolite one of the most amazing apps available and showed it being used to explore the Great Wall of China. Where will you take it on your next adventure?\n\nNote: Theodolite is an iPhone app -- see “Theodolite HD” for use on an iPad. And be sure to check out the all-new \"Theodolite for Watch\" and put Theodolite on your wrist!"

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer, GPS tracker and trip cost monitor for iPhones and cellular iPads. \n∙∙ When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! \n∙∙ The cost monitor shows you the current cost of the journey as you drive and tells you each passengers share. \n∙∙ GPS tracker records your trips so they can be analyzed, viewed and shared at any moment.\n\n‣‣ COST MONITOR. What's the cost of my driving?\nBased on gas price for a gallon or litre, MPG (U.S. or UK) or liters per 100 km the app will tell you what the cost is as you drive. You can add an extra cost per kilometer or mile! Useful for all cost aware drivers and for splitting the cost between passengers.\n\n‣‣ GPS TRACKING. Where I've been? How long did it take to get from A to B? \nSpeedometer records your trip statistics even when GPS tracker is switched off. When you need point by point data to see on the map later or export (Google Earth and GPX), speedometer gives you the first class GPS tracker.\n\n‣‣ INFOTAINMENT. \nWhen switched on, infotainment shows trip stats or weather/wind forecast  when you wait. Way better than just showing you a 0 speed!\n\n‣‣ Easy to set speed limits and SPEED LIMIT MEMORY option\nSet speed limits with 4 or 8 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! With SPEED LIMIT MEMORY you just apply the speed limit once and the app applies it for you automatically the next time!\n\n‣‣ MODES\nUse MENU>MODES to turn the app into a Rally computer, G-Force monitor, Camera alerter or taximeter! Currently there are 12 modes available and we are constantly adding new ones.\n\n‣‣ WAYPOINTS.\nSpeedometer gives you the unique way to leave a note with location and even optional photo or audio note attached! As easy as double tap on the big speed digits! You'll find more in a documentation section (star button).\n\n‣‣ RED LIGHT & SPEED CAMERAS\nImport camera data into speedometer in Garmin or iGO csv formats from poi-factory.com, scdb.info or poi-plaza and let speedo alert you on a camera approach and set speed limit automatically before you pass the speed camera!\n\n‣‣ SUNSET/SUNRISE\nWith the sunset and sunrise information that our speedometer provides, you'll be able to avoid driving in the dusk.\n\n‣‣ BARO VSI. Barometric Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI, IVSI) in both scale and graph forms.\n\n‣‣ VOICE COACH. When enabled and configured, voice coach will be telling you active track distance and duration as well as current speed and altitude.\n\n‣‣ MAPS. Google's native, Apple map, Blank map and Offline maps.\n\n‣‣ Siri shortcuts: New Track, Stop Track, Speed limits.\n\n+ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and cellular iPads. All in retina graphics.\n\n+ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KM/H AND KNOTS. Maximum/TOP, average speed, distance traveled.\n\n+ BACKGROUND MODE! Speedometer will work in background if told so and will still warn you with audio alert when exceed a preset speed limit. You can use other apps while speedometer does its job in the background!\n\n+ PRIVACY. Speedometer never shares your location data with 3rd parties or ad agencies. Location data is used solely for tracking your speed and recording the GPS tracks and never leave the app unless you decide to share by means of a track export. It always let you know when background mode is on and never runs in background unless it is explicitly told to do so.\n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone as well as on any cellular iPad. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS (external GPS module is required). \n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nDrive safely, keep the log and notes and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal companion no matter what journey you are going on!"

Buoys, Lights, Bridges, Depth Contours, Depth Soundings, Rocks, Anchorage areas, NOAA Weather Buoys etc. are all selectable and have real time distance, bearing and detail information. Turn off layers to de-clutter the display and only show what is important at the time. Tides, moon and sun times and weather are also all available at your fingertips.\n\nSeaNav’s unique AR view mode allows you to view buoys, lights, ships, waypoints and track overlaid on your iPhone or iPad live camera view. With \"AR LockOn\" you can select a target on the chart and then be guided to it in the AR camera view.\n\nSeaNav lets you measure distances and bearings and record waypoints on routes. When at sea, the app’s Sailing HUD shows your position, Course over ground (COG), Speed over ground (SOG), Vector Made Good (VMG), Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA), Distance and bearing to next Waypoint. Waypoint reached alerts, auto-routing to the next waypoint and collision alerts.\n\nSeaNav has free Apple Watch and Pebble Smartwatch apps available. \n\nLowrance, Simrad and B&G GoFree support included.\n\nYour purchase of SeaNav includes 12 months of free updates to the included US chart set. Further chart updates are then available via an in-app purchase. Charts for other regions including Canada may also be added to your product via optional in-app purchase.\n\nOur in-app purchases are 1 year subscriptions, which automatically renew at the end of the subscription period unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase, and will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Pricing for our 1 year US Charts update subscription is US$9.99.\n\nSubscriptions may be managed by the iTunes account holder and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to  Account Settings after purchase.\n No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.\n\nOur Privacy Policy may be accessed via http://seanav.net/privacy.php\n\nRequires iPhone or iPad. GPS only required for real time route navigation. Optional Real time AIS, Tides and Weather information require an active internet connection. \n\niPhone devices and iPads with a cellular modem already have a built-in GPS, even if they do not have an active service plan.\n\nIf you have a WiFi-only iPad or iPod you will need an external GPS receiver or GPS feed to enable navigation.\n\nPlease note that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nNOT FOR NAVIGATION \n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful.

AyeTides displays tides and/or currents for over 12,500 locations worldwide and unlike many other tide apps, it does not require a network connection. With AyeTides you will never see those annoying ads or be asked to pay for additional features! Sailors, harbor pilots, beachcombers, nature photographers, and more use AyeTides to plan their outings on or around the world's oceans. \n\nHere are some of the things people are saying about AyeTides... \n\n\"AyeTides is a quality professional product”\n\n\"Your support has been the best I have experienced!\"\n\n“As a harbor pilot in New York I’ve been using your excellent tide and current app”\n\n\"I really appreciate the effort that you put into making AyeTides as accurate as it can be. It is a great program that has been very useful to us. I think we have 60 pilots using iPhones and iNavX and your app links in so well.\"\n\n\"I am a ships Pilot in BC and use Aye Tides a lot and it has become invaluable.”\n\nYou can see the day’s events in tabular form, or you can rotate the phone for an interactive graph that shows you the tide’s value at any point during the day. You can find a station on a map, by name, or based on your current location.\n\nAyeTides is updated regularly and stations are added whenever we find new data. We encourage our customers to contact us if you hare having any issues with the program so that we can help you. \n\nThis app is designed to run on your iPhone or iPod Touch. While it will run on your iPad, it does not offer the additional features available with AyeTides XL, which was designed specifically for the iPad. If you have multiple devices, you may want to consider our bundle. You get both apps at a discount!\n\nThis is the only place to install AyeTides. Other websites may look like they have AyeTides, but they do not. We only support iOS, any other version of AyeTides is not ours."

      "label": "Theodolite was one of the earliest augmented reality (AR) apps for iOS when it debuted in 2009 -- in fact Theodolite was pioneering AR technology before \"AR\" was even a buzzword! In the time since, Theodolite has been used by millions of consumers and professionals in their outdoor adventures and on the job. Now, we've taken the Theodolite concept to Apple Watch by combining a compass, inclinometer, GPS, and maps into one indispensable app that sits on your wrist. We're excited to keep evolving this centuries-old instrument as hardware and software technologies allow the concept to come to new device formats.\n\nOn iPhone and iPad, Theodolite uses a viewfinder format, uniting the device sensors (GPS, magnetometer, gyro, accelerometer) and camera.  On Apple Watch, Theodolite combines data from these sensors into an AHRS (attitude and heading reference system) layout similar to what you'd see in the glass cockpit of a modern aircraft. This layout allows Theodolite to efficiently display compass bearing (yaw angle), pitch angle, and roll angle in a compact format that works extremely well on a small screen.  This information is augmented by latitude, longitude, and altitude from GPS, as well as sun and moon position.\n\nNew in Theodolite for Watch version 2 is a map screen and waypoint manager.  You can add waypoints on the map or at your current location, and view waypoints on the compass ring to visualize their bearing from your current location.\n\nTheodolite has settings for compass mode (true or magnetic), distance/altitude units (feet or meters), and position format (decimal degrees, degrees-minutes-seconds, MGRS, USNG, UTM, UTM-B, and Maidenhead Locator System).  Users can choose to display an artificial horizon in the center of the app display (tied to pitch and roll) and can set the app's level reference to flat or vertical orientations of the Watch.  The app has six color schemes, including two night vision modes - midnight red and luminescent green.\n\nTheodolite for Watch is recommended for Apple Watch Series 5 and later (including Ultra).  Apple Watch Series 4 and older do not have a compass sensor and will not show compass data.  On older devices, the app uses the device's gyro sensor to measure rotation.  You can twist the watch's digital crown to adjust and calibrate the gyro to the sun position, moon position, or a known bearing.  Using these references, the \"gyro compass\" is able to give bearing.  The calibration can be repeated as often as desired to give accurate results.\n\nTheodolite reports accuracy from the magnetometer sensor in your Watch.  To improve results, operate Theodolite away from magnets, electronics, or sources of electro-magnetic interference, including car dashboards, aircraft cockpits, metal structures, and other devices.\n\nLike all our apps, we plan to continually improve and evolve Theodolite for Watch.  Please contact us with feature requests, suggestions, and general feedback.  We'd love to hear what you're doing with the app!  And if you don't already have Theodolite for your iPhone or iPad, check it out!"

You can make the terrain stand out with hill shading, using simulated sunlight from the direction of your choice.  In the U.S., this app does not use the new \"US Topo\" maps because they do not show hiking trails and lack other details: please see the web site for more details.\n\nDownloading: US maps are around 8 MB in size and download in a few seconds on a typical home broadband connection.  Canadian maps are larger.  Both cellular data and WiFi can be used, though WiFi is likely to be more reliable in most cases.\n\n- Do please visit http://topomapsapp.com/ for complete instructions, so that you don't miss any features.\n\nWe have many ideas for additional features to add to future versions of this app; if you have ideas or other questions or comments, contact details can be found on the website, http://topomapsapp.com/.

      "label": "Featured by Apple in “Best New Apps”!\n\nPlan your next trip. Mark places you want to go. Remember your favorite spots. Across town or across the world, you’ll never forget another place with Pinbox!\n\nAdd pins where you are, where you’ve been, or where you want to go. Pinbox makes it easy to quickly record and organize your important places into distinct maps for every activity, occasion, or geographic region.\n\nUnlike other apps, Pinbox doesn’t force you to save all your places on a single map. You can make one map for your favorite local restaurants - make another map for your next business trip or vacation - and make another map for errands you need to run this weekend. The possibilities are endless!\n\nPinbox is about you and your places. It’s not a social network. You don’t have to create an account or enter your Facebook details to use the app. Your maps aren’t cluttered with random places bookmarked by strangers. Pinbox is simply the best app for privately bookmarking places that are important to YOU!\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Simple, easy-to-use interface\n• Drop a pin for each place you want to remember\n• Add photos, notes, and other details to each pin\n• Choose from seven different pin colors\n• Organize your pins into separate maps\n• See your location in relation to your pins\n• Send maps to other Pinbox users\n• Send pins to Apple Maps, Google Maps, Waze, or Transit for directions\n• Save up to 2,500 pins\n• Display maps in Standard, Hybrid, or Satellite\n\nEXAMPLES OF MAPS YOU MIGHT CREATE\n\n• Travel planning\n• Favorite restaurants or restaurants to try\n• Customer locations / sales calls\n• Friends and family locations\n• Real Estate listings\n• Favorite hiking / biking trails\n• Secret fishing spots\n• Dog-friendly places\n• Parking spots\n• Favorite stores\n• Multi-stop errands\n• Potential photoshoot locations\n• The list goes on and on and on…\n\n\nStill not convinced? Here’s a few of our favorite reviews…\n\n\n“Pinbox is one of those simple apps that does one thing so well it feels frictionless”.\n-- Stephen Grassie\n\n\n“The interface is gorgeous - I would say that it looks like something Apple designed”.\n-- Macaddict\n\n\n“I have been using this to keep track of all the places the kids and I go so they can see how spread out our world is and they can see where all we have gone. Will use it forever”.\n-- 1Cool Daddy\n\n\n“This app is extremely useful and so simple to use. A lifesaver for keeping track of locations”.\n-- Davies Photo\n\n\n“I love this app. It is exactly what it claims to be. I have wanted this app since the smartphone was invented. So simple, and so many uses”.\n-- T1Man\n\n\n\nUsing Pinbox on an iPod Touch or an iPad:\nLike other map apps, Pinbox uses GPS to determine your location. iPods and Wi-Fi-only iPads do not have a GPS receiver. On these devices, Pinbox provides your approximate location using information based on your proximity to known Wi-Fi networks (when on and available). The more accurate the available information, the smaller the circle identifying your position on the map. This feature is not available in all areas. Known Wi-Fi networks are predominantly in urban areas. An internet connection is required to load maps, look up addresses, and search. Although Pinbox can be installed on iPads, it’s not formatted for the larger iPad screen - it runs doubled like all other iPhone apps.\n\n\n\nPinbox is the result of a collaboration between Scott D. Smith and Paul Burd. We sincerely hope you like it!"

      "label": "The Algonquin Park Adventure Map app is an offline navigation app showing all the paddling routes, campsites, trails, fishing locations, roadside attractions, wildlife viewing areas and more. The app allows tracking and dropping of waypoints, while thousands of points of interest provide information on everything from canoe routes to hiking and backpacking trails.\n\n\r\n\r\nWant to know what fish are in the lake or which lakes are stocked? We have that covered too. Extra trip planning tools and park information rounds out the vast amount of value added information.\r\n\r\n\nBuilt off of the Backroad Mapbooks industry leading topographic maps, the maps contain all the park details found on their bestselling Algonquin Provincial Park waterproof map. These include:\r\n\r\n- Backcountry Campsites\r\n- Canoe Routes\r\n- Cross-country Ski Trails\r\n- Fishing Locations\r\n- Frontcountry Campsites\r\n- Hiking Trails\r\n- Lake Bathymetry (lake depths)\r\n- Mountain Biking Trails\r\n- Outfitters and Park Service Providers\r\n- Paddling & Park Access Points\r\n- Picnic Sites\r\n- Roadside Attractions\r\n- Topographic Contours with Relief Shading\r\n- Whitewater River Routes\r\n- Winter Recreation\r\n- Wildlife Viewing\r\n\r\n\nThe app works fully offline, allowing you to view your current location on the map, drop waypoints and track your route. This will allow you to safely track yourself into and out of new areas or record the trip for later viewing and editing.\r\n\r\n\nLooking for high resolution satellite imagery? We have that too. You will need cell service or wi-fi to view this layer or you can save smaller areas of the park as a separate offline map if desired.\r\n\r\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\r\nNavigating your way into Algonquin’s amazing backcountry is now easier than ever. Simply open the app and follow the instructions to download the offline map. You can also skip this download and save an offline map later.\r\n\r\n\nOnce the map is downloaded, you can zoom right to your current location or pan to the area of interest. The fast, seamless map interface allows you to see all the map content from the popular Backroad Mapbooks series for the area around Algonquin Park.\r\n\r\n\nIf you are not interested in certain activities, this backcountry navigation app allows you to turn the Adventure layers on and off, as well as Crown Land and Resource and Recreational Roads in and around the park. Within each Adventure are hundreds of points of interest (POI) providing descriptions of activities, access information, trail stats such as difficulty, length, elevation gain and much more.

      "label": "This app provides complete offline topographic map coverage of the North Island of New Zealand from the LINZ Topo50 1:50k scale map series.  The maps are all contained in the installation so there is no additional need for downloads, no need for phone or wifi signal, no slow server issues, no account signups, no missing tiles, and no additional map fees. Just install for seamless off-line zooming and panning across the whole island down to 1:50k scale. The app also includes 1:50k resolution satellite images for the island, and elevation data.\n\nOther integrated data includes DOC open and restricted hunting permit boundaries, DOC huts, campgrounds, and tracks, Fish and Game access points, and Te Araroa trails. Other datasets can be imported.\n\nThe app has a full suite of navigation functions including GPS location, compass orientation, distance to map locations, track recording and graphing, route creation and following, import/export of gpx and kml files, search functions for named places and user data. Add and edit your own locations and routes and plot elevation profiles. Uses an intuitive simple interface, with one-touch access to all functions.\n\nLINZ TOPO250 series maps are used at lower zoom levels for easier navigation.\n\nPerfect for outback use out of cell phone range. GPS and maps function fully without phone coverage. No need to cache files in advance either as they are all fully installed with the app. Popular with trampers, hikers, runners, bikers, search and rescue (SAR), hunters, boaters, as well as survey applications.\n\nNote that continuous use of GPS will run down the battery faster than when not using the GPS. The NZTopo50 app gives you full control over when GPS is used. The map can be used without GPS, intermittently with GPS for spot checking of location, continuously for logging while the app is open, or for continuous background logging when the phone is off. \n\nCheck our website for links to user guides and useful tips and tricks.\n\nFeel free to get in touch with any suggestions."

Watch in full screen, view in AR, search, add filters and so much more!\n\nShip Finder has been top rated and top ranking since 2009 and covers most of the world, tracking 20,000+ ships simultaneously.\n\nOur incredible app performance means that you can see all tracked vessels at once - no clustering here!\nSimply tap a ship to see its name, type, photos, speed, dimensions and much more.\nPowerful features such as filters, search and the ability to save favourite ships are included. (You can choose Apple or Google maps too!).\n\nAdd and browse bookmarks to saved locations around the globe to quickly navigate to areas or ports of interest.\n\nYou can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. \n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

The maps are all contained in the installation so there is no additional need for downloads, no need for phone or wifi signal, no slow server issues, no account signups, no missing tiles, and no additional map fees. Just install for seamless off-line zooming and panning across the whole island down to 1:50,000 scale. The app also includes 1:50k resolution satellite images for the island and elevation data.\n\nOther integrated data includes DOC open and restricted hunting permit boundaries, DOC huts, campgrounds, and tracks, Fish and Game access points, and Te Araroa trails. Other datasets can be imported.\n\nThe app has a full suite of navigation functions including GPS location, compass orientation, distance to map locations, track recording and graphing, route creation and following, import/export of gpx and kml files, search functions for named places and user data. Add and edit your own locations and routes and plot elevation profiles. Uses an intuitive simple interface, with one-touch access to all functions.\n\nLINZ TOPO250 series maps are used at lower zoom levels for easier navigation.\n\nPerfect for outback use out of cell phone range. GPS and maps function fully without phone coverage. No need to cache files in advance either as they are all fully installed with the app. Popular with trampers, hikers, runners, bikers, search and rescue (SAR), hunters, boaters, as well as survey applications.\n\nNote that continuous use of GPS will run down the battery faster than when not using the GPS. The NZTopo50 app gives you full control over when GPS is used. The map can be used without GPS, intermittently with GPS for spot checking of location, continuously for logging while the app is open, or for continuous background logging when the phone is off. \n\nCheck our website for links to user guides and useful tips and tricks.\n\nFeel free to get in touch with any suggestions."

      "label": "Congratulations, you have found the finest and most advanced Holding Pattern Computer available.\n\nThis app's primary goal is to provide the specific headings and timings needed to fly a holding pattern whereby the Pilot will roll out precisely onto the inbound leg exactly 1-minute, or other user-defined time or length, from the fix.\n\nThe app is ideal for less seasoned Pilots and those training for their instrument rating and is an excellent cross-check for more experienced Pilots. It helps you remain mentally oriented to the aircraft's relative position to the pattern, magnetic north, and wind effects.\n\nWhereas other holding pattern devices suggest an appropriate entry procedure such as direct, parallel, or teardrop, this Holding Pattern Computer takes it a step further. It provides turn-by-turn directions, including how long to fly a heading before initiating a turn- not only standard rate turns with bank limitations (30° manual flying and 25° with a Flight Director) but arbitrary turn rates too!\n\nThis Holding Pattern Computer employs a sophisticated, patented analytic solution developed by a 51-year Aerospace Industry veteran and FAA Safety Team Representative Les Glatt, Ph.D. ATP/CFI-AI, AGI/IGI. It automatically calculates ground track, wind correction angle, headings, and required timings, given the assigned fix, true airspeed, and virtually any wind direction and velocity up to 99.99% of TAS. \n\nThere are no other applications, including existing aircraft avionics, that is as accurate as this app. And since we measure the outbound time from the point the aircraft turns to the outbound heading, it is no longer necessary to locate the abeam point. How's that for reducing Pilot workload!\n\nThis app takes a step-by-step approach when entering holding data, using individual screens for each component, making it easier to focus on one element at a time while continuing to fly the airplane.\n\nWe've also included an onboard user guide and the seminal paper: \"A Treatise on the Holding Pattern: Expelling the Myths and Misconceptions of Timing and Wind Correction.\"\n\nFor less than the cost of one hour with a flight instructor, you're getting the most advanced Holding Pattern Computer available and the information needed to help you master and fly the perfect holding pattern every time!\n\nIf you want that perfectly timed inbound leg while rolling out precisely on to the inbound course, then this app is for you!\n\nTo learn more, visit https://HoldingPattern.com"

And now, in version 2.0 you also get an intuitive graph that shows sunrise, sunset, moonrise, moonset, and moon phase at a glance. Save recent locations, find locations using GPS location, and save graphs for later.\n\nTides have a great influence on the lives of boaters, fishermen, surfers, coastal communities, marine life, and vacationers just to name a few. Directly or indirectly, the great flow of our massive ocean bodies of water impact the daily lives of everyone on this planet.\n\nThe cyclical movement of the Earth's tides are caused by a combination of the gravitational forces of the sun and moon as well as the shape of the costal region. Unlike simple tide clocks that you can buy in novelty stores, more accurate tide predictions use special data gathered by instruments located at each tide station. The data from these measurements are used to determine the harmonic components which then feed into the mathematical algorithms which predict tides for the future. The end results are tested for accuracy and adjustments are made as necessary.\n\nTide Graph has US owned Tide Stations Only.

      "label": "BlindSquare is pioneering accessible navigation both indoors and outdoors. Know where you are, know where you're going, travel with confidence.\n\nBlindSquare is a new solution that combines the latest technology to help the blind with their daily lives. It has been developed in collaboration with blind people and carefully field tested. You need either an iPhone or an iPad to get started. It also supports some additional accessories to enhance the experience. \n\nHow does it work? \n\nBlindSquare uses GPS and the compass to locate you. It then gathers information about the surrounding environment from FourSquare. BlindSquare has some unique algorithms to decide what information is the most relevant and then speaks it to you with high quality speech synthesis. \n“What's the most popular café within 200 meters radius? Where is the post office or the library?” \n\nYou can control BlindSquare also through voice commands. The Voice Command feature is a premium service requiring purchase of credits for continuous use.  Voice Command Credits are available as an in-app purchase on the App Store.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a GPS solution:\n\nWhen you start the app, it will start telling you the interesting places and street crossings around you. By changing the radius, you can limit the area you are interested in. You can also search by search term or by category. You can select an interesting place from the search results and perform the following tasks:\n\n1) Get contact info (address, phone number) \n2) Open twitter feed or restaurant menu (if provided)\n3) Make a phone call\n4) Start tracking the place (BlindSquare will assist you by repeating the distance and the clock face direction)\n5) Start your favourite navigator for turn-by-turn instructions (TomTom, Navigon or Apple Maps)\n\nBlindSquare is aware of when you travel by car, bus or train and starts to report interesting places in front of you (for example, the next stops) and street crossings when you are passing them.\n\nYou can also save your own private places to iCloud so they will be found with your every device.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a Foursquare client:\n\nIf you like to play Foursquare, you can do the following with BlindSquare:\n \n1) Get a list of nearby FourSquare venues\n2) When you are in a place, you can check in by shaking your device\n3) Do a check in with commenting and twitter/facebook sharing\n4) Correct the location of the place\n\nBlindSquare supports the following languages: English, Arabic, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean (South Korea), Norwegian, Polish, Portugues, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\nVoiceOver usage is supported but it also includes higher quality additional speech synthesis by Acapela Text-To-Speech from Acapela Group.\n \nInstructions in English: https://www.blindsquare.com/user-guide/ and https://www.blindsquare.com/faq/\n\nPlease note: This app retrieves data in real time from Foursquare and Open Street Map. Use of a flat rate data plan is highly recommended.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nHaving only been released in May 2012, BlindSquare has already received several prizes and awards:\n\n - GSMA: Global Mobile Awards 2013, Best Mobile Health Product or Service\n - Apps4Finland 2012\n - OpenCities App Challenge 2012\n - The Finnish Information Processing Association: Best Product 2012\n\nPlease note: To use BlindSquare, your iCloud account has to be active so BlindSquare can access it to save your settings and places.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "Nav Camera uses the proven navigation, augmented reality, and image processing engines from the well known Theodolite app to create a new app that focuses on photogaphy and video recording with data overlays.  The app has been crafted with attention to detail by a top iOS developer, and benefits from over 10 years of development and testing heritage, along with real world usage by surveyors, geologists, architects, engineers, competitive sportsmen, first responders, military personnel, and search and rescue workers around the world.\n\nNav Camera lets you take photographs and record movies in landscape and portrait orientations with geo-location overlays and custom notes.  Geo-location overlays include date, time, position, altitude, GPS datum, and compass bearing. Overlay data is updated in every frame when recording movies, which is great for documenting dynamic scenes or scanning an area.  You can enter up to four lines of custom notes to be rendered into the overlay, which is perfect for job descriptions, project names, company/staff information, invoice numbers, or additional comments/documentation.  Various parts of the overlay can be turned on or off, and multiple overlay colors are available.\n\nNav Camera includes features for serious users including multiple reticles (three types of crosshairs and an SLR-style focus/exposure indicator), colored lens filters to improve use in dark conditions and preserve night vision, and multiple position formats including military grid reference system (MGRS), universal transverse Mercator (UTM), British/Irish National Grids, and six latitude/longitude variations. The optional \"Datum Pack\" adds over 220 geodetic datums to the app for more accurate position and altitude computation from GPS data. Optional datums include NAD-27, NAD-83, OSGB-36, ED-50, and hundreds of others, covering regions and countries on all continents around the world. \n\nFind out why apps like Nav Camera and Theodolite, and their field-proven results, are featured in Apple Keynotes, written up in magazine articles and professional journals, and used by everyday explorers and pro users around the world. Where will you take Nav Camera on your next adventure? \n\nNav Camera works on any iPhone or iPod Touch with camera, running iOS 11.4 or later.  If you like Nav Camera, please leave a review/rating on the iTunes App Store.  It only takes a moment, and helps us a lot. Thanks!"

      "label": "Pro Altimeter for Watch is the newest Watch app from Hunter Research, developer of the popular outdoors app Theodolite.  Pro Altimeter uses the high-fidelity barometric pressure sensor in the Apple Watch to measure and compute altitude.  Although this is a Watch app, it has the same features, capabilities, and accuracy as the Pro Altimeter app for iPhone and iPad, just in a smaller form factor on your wrist!\n\nPro Altimeter has a dead simple interface.  Barometric altitude and GPS altitude are displayed in large easy to read numbers, with available units of feet or meters, and realtime accuracy estimates from the hardware.  At bottom are calibration and settings buttons. The display offers highly-readable color schemes of luminescent green on black, white on black, and midnight red on black.\n\nProper calibration is necessary to measure altitude from barometric pressure (this is why a pilot \"dials in\" the cockpit altimeter before taking off). Pro Altimeter offers numerous methods for calibration -- choose the easiest and most convenient:\n\n1. Use GPS altitude.  This method correlates the measured local barometric pressure with the altitude measured by GPS. This method can be used when your device has a clear line of sight to the sky and a reliable GPS fix with good accuracy that you trust.\n\n2. Manually enter altitude in feet or meters.  This method correlates the measured local barometric pressure with known altitude from landmarks, elevation benchmarks, trail markers, topo maps, land surveys, etc.\n\n3. Manually enter pressure.  If you have a weather station, weather report, or METAR report with equivalent sea level pressure for a nearby location, this can be used to correlate local barometric pressure to altitude.  Pressure can be entered with units of inches Hg, kPa, or mb. \n\n4. Check local airports.  With the tap of a button, Pro Altimeter will locate the five closest airports within 100 miles (160km) of your present location anywhere in the world, and pull in METAR data.  From that list of five, pick the airport of your choice and Pro Altimeter will import pressure data for calibration.\n\nOnce calibrated, Pro Altimeter keeps track of the time since its last calibration.  Because weather and local barometric pressure change over time, the app will warn you when 6 hours have elapsed since the last calibration by flashing the \"CAL\" button.  You should calibrate as frequently as practical -- for example, on a hike, calibrate whenever you pass a trail marker or elevation benchmark, or hourly.  But at a minimum, calibrate at least every 6 hours or whenever weather changes in your area.\n\nPro Altimeter runs on all Apple Watch models running watchOS 8.3 or later."

      "label": "“Awesome!!! The best speed app on iphone” 5 Stars by kurtonic\n\nSpeed Box is a Speedometer and GPS app for both your iPhone and iPad. It displays your current speed, distance, direction and altitude along with your top speed and average speed. The app also keeps a record of the speed and altitude for the last few hours.\n\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n========================\n\n* MPH, KM/H and KNOTS\n* Show decimal speed (e.g. \"45.7 mph\")\n* One app for both the iPhone and iPad\n* \"Speak speed\" - Tap screen to have the speed spoken to you\n* 11 Analog and digital speedometers\n* Map view\n* Maximum and average speed\n* Altitude \n* Digital compass \n* HUD display to see speed in windshield \n* Odometer to measure distance traveled \n* Chart of the traveled speed and altitude \n* Warning signal when driving too fast \n* Export last 3 hours of data \n* Change maximum displayed speed on speedometer \n* Swipe finger over chart to display historic data \n* Display GPS accuracy by tapping the indicator in the top left corner \n\n\nUSER REVIEWS\n========================\n\n5 Stars by Darekakuta \n\"Just what I needed. My '58 chev's speedo doesn't work. This did the trick.\" \n\n5 Stars by Rawd \n\"Great My 79 Firebird speedo only goes to 140 kmh. ;). This worked perfectly.\" \n\n5 Stars \n\"Within 1 mile per hour +/- Great Job!\" \n\nSpeedBox was one of the very early Speedometer Apps for the iPhone. Take advantage of my experience and the refined algorithms that can get a much greater accuracy from the iPhone then a lot of other apps. I regularly update my application to make it even more accurate and usable. \n\nUsers have already used our application to verify the accuracy of their car's speedometer or they tried measuring the speed they achieved while skiing. Can you come up with more ideas? How about measuring the speed of the airplane you travel with? \n\nUSAGE NOTES\n========================\nThe \"GPS strength\" indicator in the top left corner should display a green dot. You can tap this indicator to display the current GPS accuracy.\n\nPlease allow the application up to a minute to find enough satellites to work correctly. \n\nIf you get a message to enable GSP, please go to ”Settings > General > Location Services“ on your iPhone and check if the little switch is set to \"On\" for Speed Box as well as for \"Location Services\" in general. \n\nATTENTION iPod touch users! Unfortunately this app doesn't work very well on the iPod touch and the iPad WiFI (without 3G) since these devices are missing a GPS!\n\n\nFEEDBACK\n========================\nIf you've got any wishes or suggestions for new features, please let me know with the contact form on this application's website (see link below).\n\nI am already working on the next update!"

If you have any issue with BringGo, please send an inquiry to our friendly support team. \nhttp://bringgo.com/customer/feedback.php\n______________ \nBringGo is a premium turn-by-turn navigation app for your smartphone. It is full of useful navigation features such as Text-To-Speech voice guidance, Lane Guidance, Signpost Display, Speed Limits, millions of onboard POIs and much more. Maps are stored on the smartphone for offline use. \n\n3.5 GB of internal memory available is recommended prior to beginning the app download.  Ideally, your phone should have 16 GB of total internal memory in order to use BringGo as well as other apps and services on your phone.\n\nWhen you purchase the BringGo app, you will be downloading all the map data for the United States and Canada directly to your compatible smartphone.  If you wish to reduce the amount of memory required, you may elect to individually download maps for the States/Provinces relevant to you.

      "label": "Pro Compass replicates the look and feel of classic pocket compass hardware in use since the 1800s, adding modern features and technologies.  The app uses advanced OpenGL graphics (normally reserved for games) to render 3D floating compass hardware for realistic operation.\n\nPro Compass offers nine different compass modes with direct read, traditional, and rosette styles capable of displaying degrees, quads, or mils (the direct read mode shows a North-South needle and reversed East-West convention).  In all display modes, Pro Compass shows both magnetic and true direction simultaneously, with a rotating outer true ring that is automatically adjusted for local magnetic declination.  Sun and Moon position are marked on the compass rings and continually updated.\n\nPro Compass displays location and altitude, with decimal, degree-minute-second, UTM, and MGRS position formats.  An optional \"Datum Pack\" adds over 230 geodetic datums covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.  The app also contains a built in two-axis inclinometer that drives two independent bubble levels and a bullseye level.  The inclinometer has angle readout dials for each axis, making it useful for many different types of measurements including slopes, pitches, sight lines, and geological angles like dip and strike. \n\nAfter using Pro Compass, you'll see why it's the best and most realistic compass available on the App Store!  Also be sure to check out the new Pro Compass for Watch, available for all Apple Watch models running watchOS 6 or later.\n\n***** IMPORTANT ACCURACY NOTE *****\n\nPro Compass reports accuracy directly from the magnetometer sensor in your device.  This accuracy is determined by the hardware, not the application itself.\n\nTo improve results, operate Pro Compass away from any electronics or other sources of electro-magnetic interference, including car dashboards, aircraft cockpits, metal structures, and other devices.  \n\nPlease contact the developer via the support link if you need additional information about accuracy or operation of Pro Compass."

      "label": "BACKGROUND:\n\nBuilt from the ground up in the rugged mountains of eastern Afghanistan, Tactical NAV comes from the mind of a U.S. Army Field Artillery officer who had a vision of creating a low-cost and highly accurate tactical navigation platform built specifically for military service members.\n\nTactical NAV's journey began in the notorious Pech River Valley of Kunar Province, Afghanistan. \n\nU.S. Army Capt. Jonathan J. Springer, a Fire Support Officer with the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), began developing the tactical navigation platform following the memorial services for Spc. Blair D. Thompson and Spc. Jared C. Plunk, who were killed in action on June 25, 2010.\n\nAfter pitching the idea and being turned away by the Department of Defense on multiple occasions, Captain Springer remained resolute in his mission to continue developing Tactical NAV — even to this day. His ultimate goals were (and still are) to make a difference for other Soldiers and honor the men and women who were killed and wounded in battle.\n\nHe ended up using his life savings to continue moving forward with the Tactical NAV project, all with the ultimate hope of saving military lives and helping his fellow service members accomplish their mission at home and abroad.\n\nTactical NAV officially launched on the App Store on February 14, 2011.\n\nMISSION:\n\nTactical NAV's mission is to provide military service members with a low-cost, highly accurate, and exceedingly powerful mobile tactical navigational solution.\n\nVISION:\n\nOur vision is to assist and support our nation's service members with their mobile navigational needs and further enable them to operate and win during Multi-Domain Operations (MDO).\n\nBUILT FOR ACCURACY:\n\nTactical NAV's performance is on par with the AN/PSN-13 Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR), and it has the feedback to prove it.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n\nPurpose-built by Soldiers and created to save military lives, Tactical NAV was the very first MGRS-focused app on the App Store. It has proven to be effective across a multitude of environments all throughout the world.\n\nTactical NAV has been successfully evaluated against other software platforms and devices such as Nett Warrior, JCR, BFT, JBC-P, and ATAK. Its accuracy is within 1-to-3 meters of these officially approved systems issued by the Department of Defense.\n\nIAPs & SUBSCRIPTIONS: \n\nTactical NAV contains in-app purchases (IAPs) and subscriptions. Currently, tactical drawing mode is available as an in-app purchase, and offline mapping is also available to users as either a monthly or yearly subscription. All revenue generated from these features goes towards further developmental coding and updates, and a portion of all proceeds are donated to charities that specifically benefit disabled veterans.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n• A military-quality precision targeting platform\n• Purpose-built for the individual Soldier\n• Offline mapping capabilities (complete usage of the TACNAV platform with no emission of a cellular signal)\n• WGS 84 standard (MGRS, UTM, BNG, and USNG coordinates)\n• Tactical drawing mode (e.g., useful for Joint Fires planning, creating overlays, route planning, and so forth)\n• Waypoint plotting functionality with military graphics (per FM 1-02.2)\n• Compass \"FastLock\" function for capturing quick azimuths\n• Snap and save photographs onto the main map for intelligence purposes and AARs\n• Location, waypoint, and photo-sharing capabilities (via email and text)\n• One-button night mode function for low-light situations \n• \"Go to Grid\" option for intelligent pinpoint planning and drawing of overlays\n• Created and tested to ensure utmost accuracy and reliability \n• iOS native code built for austere and contested environments\n• And so much more!!!\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n \nThe Department of Defense does not endorse Tactical NAV, nor should it be used in life-threatening or combat situations in place of a government-issued device."

Don't leave home without the proper map application for your iPhone!\n\nIntroducing TopoPoint Canada, a wilderness navigation tool for displaying FREE Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) high resolution topographic map images and your GPS position whether you are online or not!\n\nNRCan topographic maps contain the highest detail of any map suitable for wilderness travel within Canada.  TopopointCAN downloads these maps from an NRCan server and stores them on your iPhone.\n\n◆◆Updated for iOS 10.\n\n◆◆\"Pinch and Zoom\" now supported!\n\n◆◆TopoPointCAN v2.12 delivers essential features in a lightweight (3.3MB) package:\n\n◆GPS course and speeds displayed on an optional overlay popup by pressing  the 'M' button.  How fast can you ski?\n\n◆Multiple map scale support: 2, 4, 8, 16, and 64 meters per pixel.\n\n◆Compass feature displays true or magnetic north!\n\n◆Online \"browse to location\" feature displays arial and street map data when downloading maps or browsing to a location.\n\n◆Robust scrolling main map view that moves seamlessly across entire UTM zones.\nAs your GPS position changes the map will automatically track in the direction you are traveling.  \"Swipe\" scrolling away from your current location invokes browse mode.  Pressing the 'locate' button resumes tracking of your current GPS position.  Coordinates are displayed in decimal degrees format.\n\n◆No Service?  No Problem!\nSimply download maps of your choice directly to TopoPointCAN's Map Case before departing the cellular data service area or WiFi connection.  Your maps will be available anywhere!  The map name is chosen by the user and displayed on the main screen when in use.  To browse a saved map in the main screen, just select it in the map list and return to the main TopoPointCAN screen.\n\n◆TopoPointCAN gives the user control over downloaded map sizes and boundaries.\nBy specifying downloaded map location and size, the user has control over how much data will be stored.  After downloading, maps can be browsed in the main screen to ensure the correct data is onboard.\n\n◆Automatic offline or online operation\nWhen located within a cellular data service area or connected to WiFi, TopoPointCAN will automatically download and display map images for your current or browse location.  When offline, TopoPointCAN will automatically display stored maps in the main screen.  When in locate mode, the GPS position indicator will automatically display your position on offline saved maps in the main screen.  \n\n◆Main screen display of GPS Position with accuracy and map scale information.\nTopoPointCAN features an innovative GPS position indicator with integrated radial map scale and GPS accuracy information.  Scale and GPS altitude can be displayed in English or Metric units.\n\n◆Powerful Browsing capabilities with position display.\nTopoPointCAN also includes advanced browsing capabilities.  Detailed Latitude and Longitude coordinates are displayed when browsing map images away from your current location.  A precise browse position indicator with map scale is also displayed when browsing.\n\n◆Fully featured Waypoint capabilities, including \"Tracks\" ('T' button).\nTopoPointCAN creates Waypoints with a single main screen button press.  Current GPS location or browse location is recorded by simply tapping the coordinate display text button in the bottom toolbar.  Waypoints can also be entered manually.  UTM coordinate and creation time are also recorded for each Waypoint.  GPS altitude is recorded for Waypoints created with GPS position.  Waypoints are stored in user definable Waypoint Sets and can be emailed via the iPhone's mail application.\n\n◆◆More features are coming soon! \n\nPlease Note:\nGPS features require an iPhone with GPS capabilities.\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\nThe map images displayed are only available for locations within Canada."

We love this mode! We found it much more convenient compared to traditional car dashboards (especially on the roads of Western Europe, which are full of speed cameras and where you need to watch your speedometer all the time). And last but not the least - it just looks cool.  Note: this mode works pretty well at night time and twilight, but on direct sunlight the screen brightness can be insufficient.\n\n- \"aSmart HUD\" can keep track on 4 speed limits, giving a warning (sound and visual) each time you crossing it.

If unsure, use the program only for reference, don't rely on it for 100%. Application requires real A-GPS chip - so, no iPod and not-3G iPad supported. On iPad 3G application function only in \"double pixel\" mode.\n\nThanks to everyone for your suggestions about additional functionality!

      "label": "This app puts the Mayan Dreamspell Calendar in your pocket! \"13:20:Sync makes it so much easier to understand and integrate the calendar into every day life. Highly recommend it.\" \n\nThe Mayan People have described, in breathtaking precision, the cycles of both the universe and nature around us. They created a harmonic calendar that is synchronized to all those cycles. Following these cycles can help you get a stronger connection with nature around you and become conscious of your essence.\n\nThis app provides a simple way to sync along those cycles, to raise our frequency and give us a new lens to view both our day-to-day and planetary events.\n\n- Did you ever realize that our (Gregorian) calendar is not a harmonic calendar? \n- Did you know that the moon has 13 (not 12!) orbits around the earth in 1 year? \n- Why do we live with this irregular calendar?\n- Are you interested in Astrology?\n\n-> All this, and more, is explained carefully in this app. (over 15.000 words on 37 pages) Please note that these text are in English language only.\n\nIn the New Time, synchronicity is the norm.\n\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n5 star rating across the world! \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\"Entertaining as well as enlightening\" \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\nMORE INFO: \nwww.1320sync.com \n\n\nFor the beginner this app is a learning tool because it contains an extensive explanation about Tones and Seals and the synchronizing order of the Mayan Astrology. You may think it's difficult at first but soon you will feel how it all connects. \n\n\"This app is great, and allows easy manipulation of dates. I spent years in books doing in hours what I can now do in seconds.\"\n\nFor the ones who are already familiar with the Mayan Calendar this app is a handy tool to navigate the cycles, and calculate the Combined Kin for any given combination. Furthermore this app can be of great assistance to teach other people about the 13:20 cycles and is used in teachings around the world.\n\n\n=== FEATURES ===\n\n+ Kin Calendar\nThis is your main Mayan Dreamspell Calendar Dashboard with all the details you need to stay in sync. Shows the Kin of today by default, and you can calculate the Kin for any other date.\n\n+ Personal Notes\nOn this new page you can keep your personal notes for the 2 main cycles of time: the Tzolkin cycle of 260 days and the 13 Moon cycle of 365 days. And with the powerful text search function you quickly find your notes.\n\n+ Kin Picker\nSelect any combination of the 13 Tones and 20 Seals. Top section can scroll to 4 pages with information.\n\n+ Combined Kin Calculator \nCalculate the Combined Kin of any combination of Kin. You can add as many Kin as you like to calculate the Combined Kin for a group of people. \n\n+ Tzolkin with indication of the GAP day's and Wavespell and more. Tap and hold to select a Kin number directly.\n\n+ Contact Import \nAll contacts in your Contacts App will be automatically imported and assigned to the correct Kin. See all your contacts with their Mayan Reading and how you relate to them. \n\n+ 13 Moon Calendar \nFull integration of 13 Moon Calendar. (doubles as a birthday calendar!) \n\n+ 13:20 Information \nLots of information about the theory behind synchronization to help you navigate the Mayan Dreamspell Calendar. The texts provide a clear explanation of the Cycles of Time. (More than 15.000 words on 37 pages) Please note that these text are in English language only.\n\n+ Sharing\nOn all the 3 main tabs you can share the current selected Galactic Signature using your favorite app. \n\n\n# Based on the work of José Argüelles.\n# This app was made with permission of and in cooperation with the Foundation for the Law of Time - www.lawoftime.org, \n# Ariel Spilsbury."

Then you can easily find the Gas amount for a given amount of Oil, or the Oil amount for a given amount of Gas.  You can add the mix to history to keep track of the age and how often you have mixed.  Finally, you can save notes such as repairs or motor oil changes, for each preset.\n\n Gas Mix now supports all the common units: U.S. Gallons, Imperial Gallons, Liters, Ounces and MilliLiters.  You can even choose to enter your Gas in U.S. Gallons and it will find Oil amount in Milliliters!\n\n Use Gas Mix for all your 2-cycle powered engines:\n-Outboard Boat Engines\n-Lawnmowers \n-Chainsaws \n-Motorcycles\n-Karts\n-Snow Blowers\n-Weed Trimmers\n-ATVs \n-Racing / Hi-Performance Engines\n-And More...\n\nAnd Why Should You Care?\nBecause the longevity of your small engine relies on mixing fuel in the proper proportion. Excessive oil may cause fouled spark plugs, poor performance, smoke and carbon build-up. Not enough oil, will reduce the lifetime of the engine, from poor lubrication of the piston and cylinder walls. With this app, you are sure to mix correctly."

How often do you spend 10-15 minutes looking for your car in a big parking lot? With Anchor Pointer you can find your parked car in less than a minute*.\n\nUser Feedbacks\n\n“I used it while hiking on the river bluffs today and tested it. It worked great. Took me right back to my car and even showed how far away in it was.” — by Bjverano\n\n“Unbelievably Easy and Accurate!!! Finally a GPS that does have all the clutter that a normal GPS would have. For off-road driving and hiking it's a MUST!!!” — by Jimbo6765\n\n“Having recently spent a weekend hiking in the Peak District I found myself using this app constantly to help with orienteering. The app lends itself to so many different uses (the Park facility being just one of them). Recommended!” — by S N Khan\n\n* Park Car only works in open parking lots due to GPS restrictions."

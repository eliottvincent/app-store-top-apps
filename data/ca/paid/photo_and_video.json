      "label": "Your pocket app for removing unwanted stuff from photos on the go. It gives your photos a clean look while saving you valuable time.\n\nAn accidental object, even though it may look tiny and harmless, can completely ruin the entire composition of a photo and make it worthless. However, it’s not a pain if you have your favorite TouchRetouch at hand.\n\nHere at ADVA Soft, we never stop creating. We are constantly developing new technologies and features to improve TouchRetouch both functionally and visually. The most recent additions, such as the mesh removal feature, new algorithm for edge-aware object removal, and a few more great new things, reflect the needs expressed by you and reveal our appreciation of your loyalty.\n\nBelow you'll find more details on what features TouchRetouch has to offer.\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\n• No subscriptions, ads, and in-app purchases\n• No personal information requests\n• No quality and EXIF data loss\n• Professional photo edits with ease\n\nNOTE\n\nThe automatic object removal algorithm works best on uniform backgrounds.\n\nWhat magic can you do with TouchRetouch?\n\n• Remove wires, power lines, and other linear objects\n• Eliminate objects like street signs, trash cans, stop lights\n• Get rid of meshes in the foreground\n• Remove background people\n• Erase pimples, skin blemishes, and wrinkles in the most natural way\n• Clean up travel photos\n• Remove text from Instagram and Snapchat posts\n• Restore old photos\n\nHow will you create magic in your photos?\n\nSINGLE-TOUCH RETOUCH\n\nThe app works great for quick retouches.\nMake minor imperfections disappear just by marking them. It takes seconds for the app to remove small details that ruin your photos.\n\nIf the task is to erase a line from your pic, mark only a section of the line or just tap it to remove it completely; no need to be precise — the app will find the line! In the manual retouch mode, all lines have control points, thus giving you more control and flexibility over adjusting curved segments.\n\nOBJECT REMOVAL LIKE MAGIC\n\nThe app declutters your images in a matter of seconds. That could either be people or other background details you may need to erase. Use automatic content removal with the Brush tool or, when the result is not that perfect, manual retouching with the Clone Stamp tool to repair a photo. \n\nAUTOMATIC MESH DETECTION AND REMOVAL\n\nIf you think that \"getting past the mesh netting\" is quite a challenging task, you probably haven’t tried using TouchRetouch yet. The app offers a way to deal with the problem in two simple steps. Select the tool from the main menu and tap the Go button to have the mesh removed just like magic. The whole detection and selection work between these two steps is done by the algorithm; no action is required on your part.\n\nHELPFUL TUTORIALS\n\nCheck out the in-app tutorials and play around a bit with the app to learn how to get the most out of it.\nLittle effort and experience are needed to become a pro in using TouchRetouch. The interface and layout are clear and intuitive enough to make you feel comfortable the very first time you use it.\n\nDownload TouchRetouch now to harness photo magic from your pocket.\n\nTouchRetouch is brought to you by ADVA Soft — a team of like-minded professionals and enthusiastic innovators committed to designing intelligent yet simple apps that create magic in your photos and save you time. Visit our website at www.adva-soft.com to learn more about the company and the apps it develops.\n\nFor any assistance with TouchRetouch, contact ADVA Soft Support at touchretouch@adva-soft.com.

Enjoy the show on your big screen.\n\nWith Video & TV Cast you can browse through the web and stream any online video on your Chromecast (movies, tv shows, sports, music and more). Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your Chromecast. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Chromecast immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n* The app only works with a Chromecast 1+2+Ultra by Google and on devices with Google Cast or Chromecast built-in.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. \n\n* If a specific video does not cast, please check our FAQ. If that does not help, please give us a chance to help you by dropping a mail to info@video-tv-cast.com instead of leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for your video as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Chromecast. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Subtitles: Display subtitles & closed captions on TV.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> USER FEEDBACKS\n\n\"You've brought the chromecast to life on iOS devices!! And you designed it work easily and quickly\"\nRyan, England\n\n“I looooove your app. It has taken my Chromecast to a whole new level.”\nRosalind Romero, USA\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nWe want to say thank you for all your great support and kindly invite you to honestly rate our app. This helps us to keep up our app development and support for you. Please do not trust other apps that ask you for 5-star ratings in exchange for premium upgrades. This is against good developer ethics and also against Apple guidelines.\n\nIf you have any feedback, feature requests or other request, please notify us at info@video-tv-cast.com\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here.

Slow Shutter Cam puts an end to mere snapshots and gives you some of the most powerful features of a DSLR camera. All this, in a package that fits in your pocket.\n \nSlow Shutter Cam offers three capture modes to capture unique images:\n \nMOTION BLUR: Equivalent to the shutter priority mode on a DSLR, the Motion Blur mode is perfect for creating ghost images, waterfall effects or suggesting movement in your photographs by adding a blur.\n\nLIGHT TRAIL: The Light Trail mode allows you to 'paint' with light, show car light trails and fireworks or capture any other moving light in a unique way. Unlike shooting with a DSLR and being tied to specific rigid settings to obtain good results, the Light Trail mode takes care of the essentials, letting your creativity soar!\n\nLOW LIGHT: In low light conditions, this capture mode allows the camera to accumulate every photon of light hitting the sensor. The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!\n\nHighlights:\n\n•  Unlimited Shutter Speed and manual ISO\n•  Option to resume capture \n•  Real time live preview - See the result in real time\n•  Innovative 'Freeze'  and ‘Blur Strength’ controls\n•  Tap to adjust focus/exposure\n•  Time-lapse Intervalometer\n•  Apple Watch support and handy Self-Timer \n•  Full resolution support on every devices\n\nWith Slow Shutter Cam on your iPhone or iPod touch you get the features of a DSLR camera with the convenience of a device that you can drop in your pocket and take with you wherever you go.

Please do not trust other apps that ask you for 5-star ratings in exchange for premium upgrades.

For example, you can take photo of your products, mask them and then save them in the mask library. You can later add those cut outs on a background you want to add it to.\n\nCreate a fun photo by adding one part of the photo as a foreground and another photo as a background.\n\nSave images in high resolution either in JPEG, PNG or HEIC format."

      "label": "DoubleTake by Filmic transforms your iPhone into a multi-cam studio allowing you to capture video from two cameras at the same time on recent devices*\n\n*NOTE:  Per iOS 15 capabilities, multi-cam video is restricted to the following devices only:  iPhone 13 series devices, iPhone 12 series devices, iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro, 11, Xs Max, Xs, Xr, SE 2. iPad Pro 2018 and newer.  While this app will install and function on all devices supported by iOS 15, all devices outside of this list will be restricted to recording video from on a single camera.\n\nUse DoubleTake to record video in new ways:\n\n- Camera Visualization:  Better than a director’s viewfinder!  Use DoubleTake’s camera picker view to visualize all available cameras for your device.  Use this view to help decide how to frame your shot and which cameras you will select.\n\n- Shot/Reverse shot:  To capture all the organic and intimate interaction between two actors or interviewer and interviewee.  Traditionally, filmmakers would need to employ two cameras and place these in cumbersome ‘over the shoulder’ locations.  With DoubleTake you can place one device in between your actors and place the audience right in the middle of the conversation.\n\n- Multi-cam:  Capture two different focal lengths of the same subject at the same time.  Use DoubleTake with the Ultra Wide lens (iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro and 11 only) and the Tele to capture both an establishing shot and a punch-in on your subject simultaneously. Or use any other combination of front and rear lenses for unrivaled multi-cam capture.\n\n- PiP or Discreet:  The DoubleTake interface allows you to see both cameras of your video capture at the same time through the use of a Picture in Picture (PiP) window.  You can move this PiP around the screen, tap to zoom in, or swipe it away if it’s distracting (the second video will continue to record).  With DoubleTake you can decide if you want to record your videos as separate discrete files or if you want the video recorded as a composite video that includes the PiP window animated as you see it on the screen.\n\n- Split-screen: Doubletake also allows you to use any two cameras to create a 50/50 split-screen effect that is saved as a single video. This is great for capturing engaging interviews, or any scenario where two sides of the story need equal weighting on screen.\n\n- Focus & Exposure Controls: DoubleTake allows you to set and lock your focus and exposure on both cameras during multi-cam capture with our unified reticle. Just tap anywhere to set an area of interest with the reticle, then tap again to lock or unlock. Our easy to use camera switcher lets you effortlessly move between your A and B cams during a recording to adjust the focus and exposure for each independently of one another.\n\nVideo Specs:\n- Full frame focus and exposure for smooth and easy automated focus and exposure adjustments.\n\n- Selectable broadcast frame rates:  24fps, 25fps, and 30fps depending on your project requirements.\n\n- 1080p video at high bitrate encoding for maximum quality.  (note: 1080p video is the maximum resolution supported by the Apple API for multi-cam capture).\n\n- Composited PiP or separate discreet video files recorded as .h264 .mov files are saved to DoubleTake’s internal library which supports batch export to the Camera Roll."

      "label": "\"Spectre is a new iOS camera app that uses AI to create stunning long exposures” — the Verge\n\nIntroducing Spectre, from the makers of Halide, one of the top camera apps in the App Store.\n\nSpectre uses AI to help you make amazing long exposure photographs. Spectre can remove crowds, turn city streets into rivers of light, make waterfalls look like paintings, and much more. Until now, it was difficult to take long exposures: from keeping the camera steady to guessing the amount of light you need. Spectre takes care of all of that!\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n\n• MAKE CROWDS DISAPPEAR: Spectre helps take photos of crowded, touristy places. Simply set a medium or long duration and take a shot to erase the crowd from a location. Capture the those special moments like you remember them.\n\n• RIVERS OF LIGHT: At night, AI scene detection automatically switches modes to draw beautiful light trails, for stunning nighttime city photography or light painting.\n\n• GORGEOUS WATER: Capture waterfalls, ocean waves, fountains and more with beautiful ghostly water. \n\nLIVE PHOTOS AND VIDEO\n\nSpectre’s intelligent computational shutter takes hundreds of shots over the span of a few seconds, and saves them in an accompanying live photo. That means you can pick a different frame as your photo, apply live-photo effects, and even use the long exposure as a live-wallpaper!\n\nENDLESS SMARTS\n\nSpectre is a packed with powerful technology from by the team that brought you Halide.\n\nFrom machine learning-based scene detection to computer vision aided image stabilization, Spectre is jammed full of impressive technologies to get the best possible image.\n\nDESIGNED FOR HUMANS\n\nSpectre is meticulously designed. Its dark UI is gentle on the eyes when you shoot at night. Gorgeous glowing highlights infuse it with a unique style. Custom typefaces and iconography combined with unique, smooth controls make it as tactile and delightful as an actual physical camera. Like its sister app Halide, the app is easily usable with one hand, even on the largest iPhones.\n\nHIGH-TECH SHOWCASE \n\nBuild with the latest tech, Spectre isn't just a long exposure camera — it’s the cutting edge technology showcase of one of the App Store’s foremost camera apps, Halide. Here’s just a few of the latest technologies that we use in Spectre:\n\n- DCI-P3 Wide Color Pipeline\n- Live Photos\n- Metal Graphics Acceleration\n- Tripod Detection\n- Siri & Shortcuts\n- AI Stabilization\n- Machine Learning & CoreML\n- Computer Vision\n\nCOMPATIBILITY:\n\nSpectre’s smart Automatic Scene Detection requires iOS 12. AI-based stabilization features are available on iPhone 6S and later.* For the best experience, we recommend iPhone 8 or later.\n\nOn iPhone 6, Spectre captures in lower resolution. \n\n* (Full compatibility device list: iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max)\n\nABOUT US \n\nWe’re Ben and Sebastiaan, two friends living in the San Francisco Bay Area that love building fantastic apps for photography. \n\nWe hope you love Spectre! We’d love your feedback to make it even better or any reports of bugs you run into. You can always contact us directly via email: support@halide.cam, on our Twitter: @halidecamera or Instagram: @halideapp\n\nDon’t forget to share your amazing results by tagging them with #SpectreShot so we can share them on our growing social media accounts!"

It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a specific video is not working, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: Use the Playbar for advanced video control while browsing, including video scrubbing, forward, rewind, play, pause, stop.\n\n* Local Videos: Cast your camera roll videos from an iPhone or iPad.

Instead of spending all that time setting up your big camera, just choose your desired film/sensor size and focal length in the app and point the iPhone camera at what you want to photo to verify framing. If you are happy with the framing then you can get the big camera out. The app has a large database of camera sensors details and film formats but if the format you desire isn’t there you can add your own custom format. The app is targeted at stills photographers or film makers working in either film or digital. If you don’t have your big camera with you, Viewfinder Preview is still great for photo sketching, location scouting or story boarding.\n\nThe app includes\n\n- Customisable menus so you can include the film/sensor formats and focal lengths you care about.\n- A fully configurable light meter.\n- You can take photos with it, so you have a record of shots you were framing.\n- Photos taken with the app include additional data that describe the film format, focal length and lighting meter settings at the time the shot was taken\n- Add notes to your photos\n- A photo gallery for viewing photos taken with the app which also displays the additional data\n- Share images in emails, messages\n- Create albums of photos from the same project, trip etc\n- Create PDF documents of albums\n- Film stock emulation\n- Wide angle lens adapter support"

Please also remember to visit https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTmlTTxPbBbcn1Fd1NRWTOczTY1RYEug4 for more video tutorials. Each video only lasts a few minutes but you will surely learn a lot from them. You can also reach us through Instagram. Links are under the menu inside the app.\n\nThis is a special call to landscape photographers, travel photographers, nature photographers, and those who are interested in night photography, city photography, time-lapse, star-trails, milky way or astrophotography: look no more, this is the ultimate app for you - the Planit Pro. It only costs you a cup of Frappuccino but will save you tons of time and effort and a lot of gas money. Most importantly, it will make you enjoy landscape photography even more.\n\nAnsel Adams dedicates the beginning of his first book \"Taos Pueblo\" to visualization. He introduced the idea of \"previsualization\", which involved the photographer imagining what he wanted his final print to look like before he even took the photo. Of course, there are many great photos that were taken impromptu. However, for landscape photographers, being able to previsualize the scene before going there will greatly reduce the chance of being caught unprepared and will greatly increase the chance of getting better photos.\n\nPhotographers use various tools to help them pre-visualizing the scene. Nowadays, many of those tools are phone apps. Planit Pro is an all-in-one solution that is designed to leverage the map and simulated viewfinder technologies to provide the necessary tools for photographers to pre-visualize the scene in combination with the ground subjects and the celestial objects such as the Sun, the Moon, Stars, Star-trails and Milky Way.\n\nIn the Planit Pro app, we packed it with features - from location scouting such as GPS coordinates, elevations, distance, elevation gain, clear view, focal length, depth of field (DoF), hyperfocal distance, panorama, and aerial photography, to the Ephemeris features such as the sunrise, sunset, moonrise, moonset time and direction, twilight time, special hours of the day, sun/moon finder, major stars, constellations, nebulae azimuth and elevation angle, star trail planning, time-lapse calculation and simulation, sequence calculation and simulation, milky way searching, solar eclipse and lunar eclipse, exposure/ND filter calculator, light meter, rainbow position prediction, tide height, and tide search, etc. All the information is either represented on the map as an overlay or visually presented in simulated viewfinders (VR, AR, picture, or street view), just like you look through your camera's viewfinder. Whatever you want for your landscape photography, it is there in the Planit Pro.\n\nLandscape photography is an adventure in the natural world. We understand that sometimes there won't be any network connection when you are out exploring. Planit Pro was designed for having it in mind. If you preload the offline elevation files and the offline mbtiles maps, you can use the app fully offline without the need for network connections.\n\nLicense agreement at https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nPrivacy Policy at https://planitphoto.com/privacy.html"

The clever app will automatically fill in the expanded areas based on the content surrounding it. \n\n• Reframing a photo by using aspect ratios\n\nWith the list of the most common aspect ratios the app has to offer, you can obtain a photo of the needed proportions fast and with no effort. As soon as a specific ratio is selected, tap the Apply button — and the app will crop or uncrop your shot to those specific dimensions.\n\n• Reframing a photo by using grids\n\nRecrop provides you with a set of the classical composition grids to help you be accurate when recomposing your images. After selecting a grid, just move a photo frame as needed to balance the photo.\n\nSTRAIGHTENING PHOTOS\n\nStraighten a crooked horizon line in a photo by swiping left or right or up or down anywhere outside the photo frame. The resolution of the photo won't be lost — the nearby pixels will be copied and added to the areas created.\n\nPRAISES ABOUT RECROP\n\n“Recrop does one thing insanely well and is the only smartphone app dedicated to this task: like content-aware fill for Photoshop, it can extend elements of an image to give more of what you missed, allowing you to crop, rotate, and even enlarge without sacrificing parts of the original image.” — Dan Rubin, Photographer, Designer\n\nDownload Recrop right now and give it a try!\n\nIf you have any questions or complaints about Recrop or need assistance with the app, please email us at support at adva-soft.com."

      "label": "Reeflex is the best photography app on the App Store designed for enthusiasts, creatives, and professional photographers! The app provides pro-level DSLR features directly on your iPhone while being extremely intuitive and easy to use.\n\n— Professional Tools for Everyone —\n\nReeflex offers two main capture modes - the main one for classic still photography and the IAP long exposure photography mode - providing a rich set of professional tools for full manual control over focus, exposure, and white balance. The live histograms combined with the zebra stripes allow you to precisely monitor your exposure. The focus peaking is a powerful guide for adjusting the focus on your subject. By a simple two-finger tap on the viewfinder, Reeflex also allows you to independently adjust focus and exposure, moving two reticles across the scene.  \n\nReeflex allows shooting in HEIF, JPG, TIFF, or RAW on all iPhone models. You can also shoot in the Apple ProRAW* format and 48MP*** on compatible devices.\n\n— Slow Shutter Mode (IAP) —\n\nReeflex offers the best long-exposure tools on the App Store. Enjoy the flexibility of manual controls and watch the picture forming on the screen. Select either Motion Blur or Light Trails modes to make people disappear, give moving water & cloudy skies a smooth silky appearance, or transform busy roads and starry skies into stunning rivers of light. Long Exposure on iPhone has never been easier than now!\n\n— Honorable Mentions —\n\nOnly a few days after its launch Reeflex was listed as “Must Have APPS - You Never Heard About” by the highly popular iReviews YouTube channel. Reeflex Pro Camera is now a top-tier camera app vastly acclaimed among the iPhone photography community worldwide, being featured by some as the \"best camera app\" for 2022 across several youtube channels and mobile photography magazines (Mobiography.net, PhotoFocus.com, iPhonephototeam.com)\n\n— MAIN FEATURES —\n\n• Still photography mode with full manual controls\n(ISO, shutter speed, focus, and white balance)\n• Automated Focus and Exposure reticles (AF/AE)\n• Luma and RGB zebra stripes\n• Live luma and RGB histograms \n• Advanced focus peaking\n• Support for multiple cameras\n• JPEG, HEIF, or TIFF as processed formats\n• Apple’s ProRAW* and RAW** support\n• Wide Angle camera 48MP support***\n• GPS location in photos’ metadata\n• Gyroscopic tiltmeter\n• Extended digital zoom up to 10x\n• Integrated camera roll\n• Color-blind users' support: customization of focus peaking colors\n• Tutorials, tips, and detailed explanations are available in the settings section\n\n— SLOW SHUTTER MODES (in-app purchase) —\n\n• Motion blur mode: blur movement, from silky waterfalls to dreamy cloudy skies\n• Light trails mode: transform busy roads and starry skies into stunning rivers of light\n• Wide range of long-exposure capture durations, from 0.5 seconds up to 2 hours\n• Bulb mode - select a custom long-exposure capture duration\n• Live Preview - allows you to monitor the long-exposure capture\n\n— REMARKS —\n\n*ProRAW is only supported on iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max, iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max, iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max.\nOn other iPhone devices, when the RAW format is selected, photos will be saved in the standard Bayer RAW format.\nNote: RAW format requires an iPhone 6s or later.\n\n**On devices older than iPhone 12, hence from iPhone 11 and prior, the RAW format is not supported on the Ultrawide camera\n\n***48MP is only supported on the main Wide Angle camera on the latest iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max.\nNote: RAW format does only support 12MP.\n\n— GET IN TOUCH —\n\nWe'd love to hear from you!

      "label": "“Cortex Camera Takes Great Low Light iPhone Photos”\n-Lifehacker\n\n“In my experience, I found that Cortex Camera greatly reduced noise in low-light conditions. And I was able to get crisp shots without the need for a stand or tripod.”\n-CNET\n\nCortex Camera improves on your device’s already excellent camera to achieve quality that rivals a DSLR. It combines dozens of exposures to create a single noise free, high resolution photo. If you want the best quality for a static scene and you aren't carrying a bulky DSLR with you, Cortex Cam is an excellent alternative.\n\nPLEASE NOTE that while a tripod is not required, the camera must be held steady and your subject must be still for the duration of the exposure, which takes 2-10 seconds with default settings.\n\nIn addition to the image quality benefits mentioned above, Cortex Cam also enables long exposure effects such as motion blur and soft water. Switch off the \"remove motion blur\" option to capture these effects.\n\nCortex Cam is all about achieving the best image quality possible on a mobile device. It uses RAW data (when available) to increase sharpness and image detail. Professional exposure controls (including shutter priority, ISO priority, and full manual) enable great photos even in the most challenging lighting situations. It may not replace your DSLR (or the default camera app for that matter), but for certain situations you will find it indispensable.\n\n- Advanced image processing techniques combine information from multiple frames to remove noise and increase resolution.\n- Motion compensation enables hand-held long exposure photography.\n- The “enhance shadows” option brightens dark areas of your photos without making them look unnatural or processed.\n- Uses RAW data as input to increase sharpness and image detail (iPhone 6s and above).\n- Supports JPEG or TIFF file formats.\n- Supports telephoto lens on iPhone 7 plus and above.\n- Manually choose to combine 10-99 frames or let Cortex Cam automatically determine number of frames.\n- Includes support for front camera, shutter timer, and grid overlay.\n- Most of all, image quality! The majority of development time has been spent on making image quality unreasonably good for a mobile device.\n\nImage resolution depends on which device you’re using:\n\niPhone 6s, 6s plus: 19 megapixels\niPhone 7 and above: 27 megapixels\n\nFollow @CortexCamera on twitter for more Cortex Camera goodness!"

(As available by device and microphone.)\n- Sample Rate: 24Khz, 44.1Khz, 48Khz\n- Format: AAC, PCM\n\nThat's a lot of options! But REC gives you simplicity along with flexibility, you'll never be able to select a combination that doesn't work with your device.\n\nCaptivating Controls\nREC's floating buttons put pro level controls at your fingertips, and keeps them out of the way while you're focusing on what's important, shooting your video! A single tap brings up any of the control menus where you can adjust the white balance, shutter speed, ISO, EV, and focus manually.  Or, use our intuitive touch controls to specify precisely where in your frame focus on and expose to. Quickly swap between the Wide, Ultra-Wide, Telephoto, or Front cameras and different formats with a flick of your finger, and your selection is always available at a glance. Optionally overlay a grid, and zoom in or out to help you frame the perfect shot every time.\n\n\nDashing Display\nEverything you need to know while recording your video is presented in a compact, easy to read heads-up display. Quickly check the audio levels, see how much storage is left in your device, and a short summary of your selected format options, without having the view of your subject obscured.\n\nTerrific Timecodes\nIf you record footage using several devices such as: your iPhone, a video camera, a DSLR, a microphone, and you use the same reference clock for all of your recordings, then it will be dead simple to synchronize everything while you are editing your creation. This is a great way to record multi-angle video, using your phone as an additional camera!\n\nREC provides two Timecode methods. The first one is \"Time of Day\", which simply records your device's clock information alongside the video. In order for it to work, just make sure all your devices are set to the same time. For really accurate and extremely simple synchronization, REC also provides Bluetooth sync using Tentacle Sync devices. Using Tentacle Timecode, REC is able to synchronize your iPhone footage within an incredible 1-frame resolution window. You can find more about the Tentacle Sync solutions at https://tentaclesync.com.\n\n\nMarvelous Management\nREC saves all of your videos seamlessly to the built-in manager that lets you quickly and easily preview your creations. Watch your shots at different speeds, and preview them without sound if you're trying to find the right shot to share in a sensitive environment. Sending a video to your photo library or favorite editor is just a tap away. Or if you'd prefer, send videos directly to the Photo Library and enjoy its seamless integration with any app that supports video."

The entire process takes about 30 seconds and the result images are stunning! Easily share the image to your camera roll and upload to Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, LinkedIn, Twitter, Clubhouse and Zoom!\n\nNote: We utilize both the phone's AI processing and remote ML resources so an Internet connection is required.\n\nStep 1: Align your device straight and level at arms length\nStep 2: Tap the shutter button - this will take two pictures, one with flash and one without. You can also select a photo from your camera roll instead.\nStep 3: Choose which photo looks best\nStep 4: We process your image through two separate AI-based filters\nStep 5: Choose your background from a variety of colors or choose either the average color or a blurred background of  the original picture.  Select any background color you'd like by choosing the last option and inserting a HEX RGB value.\nStep 6: Choose a border color to make your headshot stand out\nStep 7: Share and download a high-resolution image directly from the app to your camera roll or preferred social network!\n\nTo adjust the blurred background, simply select the blur background from the final adjustment screen and enter your desired blur!\nHave a question, concern or suggestion on how to improve the app?

      "label": "LED aquarium lights are brilliant, but blue (actinic) light interferes with your camera sensor, changing the beautiful colors of your fish and corals into a scene from a black light filled roller rink from the 1980's.\n\nEnter our hopeful hero, Aquarium Camera. It dreams of ridding the internet of bad aquarium photography. It's designed to color correct the actinic light from LEDs in real-time on our mobile devices, the thing we use to take photos of everything else in our lives, except our tanks... until now. \n\n\"The Aquarium Camera app is an essential tool for reef tank photography.\" – ReefBuilders.com\n\nYou can now stop buying pro camera rigs, shooting in raw, buying gels, and turning off your blue lights to get great and accurate shots of your tank. You don't need to spend hours in post-production or photo editing apps, tweaking the hue and lighting of each of your photos. Simply put, all you need is the Aquarium Camera and an iPad or iPhone to get GREAT photos and videos of your aquarium. \n\n“So easy to use…  Love it!!!  And the color changing is realtime so you can see the screen and the real thing side by side to ensure you get the right balance.” \n– Carlos Chacon, IT Manager at CoralVue\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Real-time white balance color\n• Real-time RGB adjustment\n• *NEW* Real-time Gel mode - orange gels are typically used by professional photographers to compensate for blue light. The new gel mode works like magic by simulating what a gel over your lens will do to your shots. It goes a step further by dynamically changing it's color based on what it sees in your shot (it's like buying millions of gels and picking just the right one for each shot)\n• Take Photos or Video\n• Portrait and Landscape photos (obviously)\n• Digital pinch to zoom\n• Touch to focus\n• Manually control brightness\n• Toggle the flash on/off (works great if your corals are really close to the glass in your aquarium)\n• Download it one time and use on your iPad and iPhone\n• Quickly access your camera roll to review shots\n• Share photos or videos right from the library\n\nSpecial thanks to the members of Reef2Reef.com for testing version 3.0 of the app! Over 250 aquarists tested version 3.0 prior to pushing to the app store. Check out the Reef2Reef, ReefCentral, Nano-Reef and ChicagoReefs forums to see some of their awesome aquarium photos! Super big thanks to Reef2Reef members Jason Mack, Scott Nelson, Scurvy, NorthFLreefer, ReeferMadness80G, Budau18 and Stratru362 for giving me permission to use their photos in the preview!\n\nI created the Aquarium Camera app because I was tired of seeing posts of brilliant aquariums on forums like Reef2Reef, Nano-Reef, ReefCentral that don't truly represent the health and beauty of the fish, plants, and corals inside. It wasn't as big of a problem in the days of VHO, Power Compacts and Metal Halide lighting, but with LEDs now taking over the aquarium lighting space, we needed another solution. \n\nLet's commit ourselves to spending less time trying to correct the lighting on our aquarium photos and videos and more time enjoying our fish, shrimp, snails, plants, and corals... oh, and doing water changes.\n\nThe before and after shots in the preview were taken at the 2017 Aquatic Experience Kessil booth, A80 Tuna Blues. The video was taken under an AquaIllumination Nano LED fixture."

      "label": "CameraPixels is a unique manual photography app. The premium tools and intuitive UI make CameraPixels the best choice for professional mobile photographers. CameraPixels participated in Berkley Eclipse Megamovie 2017 thanks to its extensive raw bracketing. \n\nAll-in-one \n============= \nCameraPixels is all-in-one capture solution, that supports multiple photo and video capture modes. Among them are Bracketing, Slow Shutter and Time-lapse modes. CameraPixels has the most advanced bracketing available on the iOS platform, which includes exposure and focus bracketing.\n\nBest for macro photography\r\n============= \nWith CameraPixels you can capture the best macro shots, be it a single image or a series of images, called focus bracketing, which can later be combined into one all-in-focus photo (requires external app for focus stacking). If you have an external macro lens, let CameraPixels save its name to the EXIF data for you, so later you can always remember which lens was used. Currently CameraPixels supports Olloclip™, Loupe System™ and Moment™ lenses. \r\n\r\nBest for professional HDR photography\r\n============= \nCameraPixels has the most advanced exposure bracketing on iOS. With up to 15 images per bracket you can capture even the most difficult lighting situations. CameraPixels support auto-, iso and shutter-brackets, with an optional flash frame. The captured images can be used to create stunning HDR photos using your favorite professional HDR software.\r\n\nIntuitive UI \n============= \nCameraPixels has a simple and efficient UI. The most important information is always in front of your eyes, and this allows you to avoid surprises like an unexpected flash fire or the wrong output photo or video format. Stop being distracted by the uncertainty of the settings, concentrate on your capture! \n\nISO/Shutter priority modes \n============= \nCameraPixels is among a few photography apps that support advanced exposure modes like ISO and Shutter priority. These modes are indispensable during dynamic photography when there is no time for adjusting manual exposure. \n\nHistogram and clipping warnings \n============= \nThe histogram is a great tool to estimate your exposure. It can show you if the photo has under-exposed or over-exposed areas. Clipping warnings, on the other hand, can show you exactly where those under and over-exposed areas in your photo are. \n\nDepth capture \n============= \nOn dual/triple-camera devices, CameraPixels can capture depth information alongside the colour photo. If the photo has depth information, in the preview window, two additional buttons appear (depth and portrait) that allow you to inspect the depth of the image and apply it to simulate an aperture. \n\nPresets \n============= \nCameraPixels was designed for professional photographers that value efficiency of their workflow. The unlimited presets, including the possibility to expose them to Widget make CameraPixels the ultimate photography tool. \n\nFeatures overview\n============= \n- UI optimized for manual capture\r\n- RAW and ProRAW (on supported devices) photo capture\r\n- Auto, manual and semi-automatic (ISO- and Shutter-priority) exposure modes\r\n- Photo, Burst, Portrait, Slow Shutter, Exposure Bracket, Focus Bracket, Video and Time-lapse\r\n- Clipping warnings to highlight under- and over-exposed areas in real time\r\n- Focus peaking and loupe during the manual focus adjustments\r\n- Single or series of Exposure Brackets with up to 15 images per bracket. AEB, ISO- and Shutter-brackets are available.\r\n- Single or series of Focus Brackets with up to 100 images per bracket\r\n- Adjustable photo and video resolution\r\n- Adjustable photo and video quality\r\n- Advanced photo processing (Smart HDR and Deep fusion on supported devices)\r\n- Unlimited presets with the possibility of exposing them to the widget\r\n- Advanced intervalometer\r\n- Multiple framing options"

Now you can visualize exactly what shots will look like at any location, at any time of the year or day. You can see precicely how light will illuminate and the shadows will fall.\n\nAUGMENTED REALITY \n\nFor landscapes we create a dynamic 3d mesh of the surrounding terrain and show how the light will change throughout the day across the hills, mountains and valleys. \n\nFor city photographers we download OpenStreetMap building data and render a 3d reconstruction of the buildings and streets. You can therefore see exactly how the light will strike the buildings throught the day.\n\nNIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY\n\nNew to Helios Pro are a number of tools to help with night photography. The new milky way section gives you three different ways of visualizing the stars at any location. It also includes a unique night-shoot planner designed to let night photographers plan Milky Way photography. \n\n- Multiple tools to explore sun, moon, and star data.\n- Light simulation on a range of virtual stand-ins.\n- Scarily accurate alchemy and celestial mechanics.\n- Night-shoot planner to see the optimum dates and times to shoot the Milky Way.\n- Dynamically generated 3D models of landscapes, buildings, cars, trees (and of course, a dinosaur).\n- Many tools will still work without reception.\n- Multiple ways to export data.\n- iPad and iPhone compatible"

For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

Sometimes it's not easy to see your upcoming shift schedule very clearly, especially if your shifts don't fall into the traditional working week. Shift Worker solves this problem and turns the frustrating task of entry into a quick and easy experience.\n\nShift Worker allows you to create your own types of shifts by combining visually-attractive icons with letters/numbers so that they can be easily identified at a glance. By including a range of icons (such as suns and stars for day and night shifts) in a variety of colors, any combination is possible for all types of shifts.\n\nEntering shifts can be done quickly by simply selecting a type of shift and tapping on each date it occurs. An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!\n\nIn addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. \n\nShift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date. Notes can be used anytime additional information needs to be added to a date.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Create a virtually unlimited amount of shift types\n- Enter shifts on the calendar months in advance in seconds\n- Add your rotation and automatically fill the calendar in a few simple steps\n- Show friends and family shifts using multiple calendars\n- View the calendar in timeline format to see your shift flow at a glance\n- Create colored personalized notes for any date on the calendar\n- Include week of year or week 1/2 alternating pattern on calendar\n- Jump to any month by using the \"Goto\" button\n- Save a month's worth of shifts to your background\n- Share your shifts to others via email, MMS, Facebook or Twitter\n- Import other Shift Worker shifts and view them all within the one app\n- No in-app purchases!\n- No ads!"

It's the most advanced screen mirroring solution with zero delay and the highest screen quality.\n\nMirror photos, videos, games, websites, apps, presentations, documents and spreadsheets on Roku.\n\n* Supported Roku TVs: Hisense, Sharp, TCL, Insignia, Hitachi, Philips, Element, JVC\n\n* Your iPhone/iPad and your Roku must be connected to the same wifi to enable screen mirroring. Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Roku or any other trademark mentioned here.

      "label": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

The features below are what you would gain access to by subscribing, whereas the features above are what are already included in the base app. \n\nSUBSCRIPTION FEATURES\n\n1. ACCESS PROJECTS FROM THE WEB\n\nCreate, edit and share Reports from our web app. Using the new website allows you to quickly type up comments using your computers keyboard as well as accessing your Projects from any browser.\n\n2. MULTIPLE IMAGES\n\nYou can now show more than one Image for each Issue. This is useful for showing several angles of the same Issue, or to compare before and after Images.\n\n3. SYNCING\n\nSync your projects between devices. Start your project with your iPhone, type it up on an iPad, and do final editing on your PC or laptop. Reports can be generated from any location.\n\n4. FOLDERS\n\nOrganise your Projects into Folders. Place several Projects for one property in a Folder. Name your Folders after the area, client, group, site or anything you want to keep organised!\n\n5. MORE PROJECT INFORMATION\n\nAdd a site address for each Project, as well as a Project photo to give the finishing touch to your Report’s cover.\n\n6. ISSUE DUE DATES\n\nGive Issues a Due Date so your Assignees know exactly how long they have to complete any tasks required.\n\n7. COMPLETE ISSUES\n\nMark your Issues as completed. If all your Issues are completed, you can now even mark the whole Project as completed.\n\n8. REPORT COLOURS\n\nIn addition to these new themes, you can now set up your own colour scheme! Prefer to use a blue that matches your company’s logo, over the default red in a theme? Now you can!\n\n---\n\n*** Subscription Information ***\n\nA monthly or annual purchase will be applied to your iTunes account at the end of the trial.

      "label": "TomatoFlex is a productivity app based on the pomodoro time management technique - focusing on simplicity.\n\nIt comes with a standalone Apple Watch, iPhone and iPad app, synchronised when used together.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- 3 different Apple Watch complication types, supporting all watch faces\n- 5 different types of iOS widgets\n- Work/break settings from 1 minute to 90 minutes\n- Apple Watch alarm and actionable iOS notifications\n- Seamless synronisation of your session and statistics across all the supported devices\n- Smart statistics which automatically groups sets and detects breaks\n- Unlimited statistics history which you can export to csv\n- Hourly productive breakdown and daily focus time tracking\n- Stop, Pause and partial pomodoro completion\n- Skip break when you are in flow\n- Recents tracking for quick switch between intervals\n- Add or delete pomodoro completions if you forgot to start tracking\n- iCloud saving of statistics to never lose your history\n- iPad multitasking\n- Light and dark theme\n- Shortcuts integration\n\n\nMore details for black belt pomodoro ninjas:\n\nIt is flexible because it does not force you into intervals with second precision. It just notifies you about the interval end and you decide when do you want to continue with the next interval. This is more realistic in a real world scenario as you might need an extra minute or so to complete your current work before you want to go for a break. It is a similar experience as a traditional analog pomodoro timer. Our statistics module can figure out what counts as a set or break, so you still get the same insight and discipline for your focused work. \n\nIf you have any question don't hesitate to reach us at [company@talkingchickenfriend.com](mailto:company@talkingchickenfriend.com)\n\n\"The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.\" - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)"

There is a lot of swearing. Really so very much swearing. Please do not buy this app and then be shocked by the swearing, because there is a lot of it, and here we are, telling you about it right up front. \n\nIf traditional housekeeping isn’t really your style, but your living space needs a little attention, UfYH’s challenges and customizable features will help you get your place back in shape, a few minutes at a time. Rather than encourage marathon cleaning sessions, UfYH gives you the tools to clean up, a little at a time. Unf&%*ing your habitat turns dreaded chores into easy-to-complete tasks, with a hefty dose of “filthy” language to motivate you to clean up.\n\n    -Clean and simple easy-to-use interface.\n    -Select timed challenges in 5, 10, or 20 minute intervals and try to beat the clock to finish the challenge.\n    -Select challenges by room.\n    -Create a customized to-do list and reminders to keep you on schedule.\n    -Earn achievements for completing challenges or finishing your to-do list.\n    -Use the 20/10 timer to reward yourself with a 10-minute break for every 20 minutes of work. Shorter challenges count cumulatively toward your total time.\n    -Random motivators remind you that excuses are boring and use a combination of a little guilt, a little shame, and a little swearing to get you moving. \n\nUfYH is especially useful for those who don’t have a lot of spare time to devote to cleaning: students, people with full-time jobs, people with roommates, anyone who can’t find the motivation to get up and just do something. Even if it’s just a little something! Our lives are complicated and messy, and we’re often overwhelmed and distracted, and sometimes a little lazy. Unf&%* things and see a remarkable difference in how you tackle cleaning.\n\nUfYH uses frequent profanity and is for mature audiences. In-app, the word \"filth\" is replaced by its older, more foul-mouthed cousin. This app uses the \"f-word.\" A lot. Please be aware of this before purchasing."

You can create individual projects, each with unique input values and results. \n\n2. Each fitting has its own custom set of input parameters and results. \n\n3. You can easily change the minimum and maximum allowable values for all input parameters. \n\n4. It includes a useful search feature that allows you to type in a partial or full fitting code name to quickly retrieve it. \n\n5. It allows you to display and email two types of reports. The app reports also include a spreadsheet attachment that you can open on your desktop computer to do further analysis. \n\n6. The app displays inputs and results in both IP and SI units. \n\n7. Works on both the iPhone and iPad and adjusts its user interface according to the proper size screen.\n\nThe ASHRAE Duct Fitting Database application was designed by Carmel Software Corporation exclusively for ASHRAE."

      "label": "Is that three bend saddle at the end of the pipe?  Don't you wish you could flip the bender around to make the bend easier?  My Bender has your back.  One of the key features is My Bender's ability to allow you to orient the bender to make your bending more practical, just tap on the bender to flip the orientation of the bender.\n\nMy Bender,  offers the most accurate conduit bending calculations on the App Store.  How? Because My Bender uses \"your\" bender, with its unique bending characteristics to do the math.\n\nMost other calculators use the cosecant method which is simply an approximation, or a rule of thumb.  But as pipe size and bend angle increase in size, the error introduced with the approximation also increases.  This is because the benders' radius and pipe diameter are not taken into consideration, this is not the case with My Bender.\n\nCurrently My Bender can calculate:\n-Offsets with predetermined locations on the conduit.\n-Match an existing offset's angle.\n-Three Bend saddles that fit like a glove.\n-Four Bend saddles that \"look like they grew there\".\n-Kicked 90° Bend that will make your heart skip a beat.\n-Calculate the distance from your benchmark to the center of bend for any angle.\n \nThere are other conduit bending calculators on the App store, but none have the polish and attention to detail that My Bender has.  My Bender allows you to \"flip\" the orientation of the bender to best suit practical bending, and then shows you the correct measurement for the benders current orientation.  \n\nMy Bender helps the professional electrician keep track of all the conduit benders he uses.  As you know every bender has its own bending characteristics.  In order to account for these differences in benders it is necessary to have a log book where the bender's details are kept.\n\nAdd your own:\n- Hand Benders\n- \"Chicago\" Benders\n- 555 Benders\n- Cyclone Benders\n- Smart Benders\n- Table Benders\n\nMy Bender not only keeps track of your benders, it also calculates some very important characteristics:\n\n-Take up (aka Deduct) for a 90° bend\n-Gain on a 90 degree bend\n-Centerline bending radius\n\nHow does My Bender calculate this?\nEverything is based on the centerline bending radius.  This is calculated by bending one 90° bend and making some key measurements.  You select the pipe size and material.  And that is all it takes for My Bender to \"fingerprint\" your bender.\n\nEvery key measurement also has a description page that uses diagrams to help you visualize the measurement.\n\nSince I can not respond directly to reviews: Please email  support@iBendPipe.com"

Duct sizing for both rectangular and circular ducts. Tap on the values for velocity or friction to switch between calculation methods.\n\nUsers can change between I-P and S-I units by tapping the toggle switch at the top.\n\nThe detailed sizing mode allows the Engineer to adjust the duct dimensions and air flow rates, while checking the resulting friction rate and velocity which update automatically. Detailed sizing mode is typically used to analyse existing duct systems, and was added upon the request of users' feedback. \n\nCalculations are based on standard air 0.075 lb/ft3 (1.2 kg/m3) in clean galvanized steel duct.\n\nAny feedback is welcome, and will be the basis for future updates."

      "label": "Welcome to the Equipd Bible - a powerful Bible reading and personal study app. \n\nWhat makes the Equipd Bible different from other Bible apps? It has been carefully optimised for daily workflows, from using in the ministry, to daily bible reading and collating your favourite scriptures and study notes. Use it one-handed on your iPhone or in split-screen mode on your iPad. Look up selected verses with the fastest copy scripture tool ever. Personalise this Bible app and make it your own.\n\n* Load compatible Bibles in EPUB format from the Equipd website or other approved sources. Check www.equipd.me/bibles for more information.\n\n* View different Bibles side-by-side for easy comparison. Or read just one Bible full-screen.\n\n* Load multiple languages side-by-side for sharing in the ministry with those from different cultures. Great for language learners.\n\n* Bible Reading Schedules with reminder notifications. You can setup one or multiple schedules at a time. Never get behind on daily Bible reading again.\n\n* For Chinese users or learners ... automated Pinyin, Zhuyin (Bopomofo), Sidney Lau, or Yale romanization can be generated and shown in 2-line format above the Simplified or Traditional characters.  \n\n* For Japanese users or learners ... automated Furigana or Romaji in 2-line format.  \n\n* Jump from viewing just the selected verses to the Chapter window to get the full context.\n\n* Multiple ways to look up scriptures. Use the 3 scrollers at the top, or the Bible Picker accessed from the toolbar. Use the double-tap or \"shake\" gestures to show the Picker - great for one-handed use on the iPhone. \n\n* Add study notes against verses. View notes for the current chapter in a side-panel (iPad and iPhone Plus). Access all notes from the toolbar.\n\n* Import MP3 files for offline audio. In Safari locate a MP3 ZIP file and \"Open in...\" the Equipd Bible.\n\n* The easiest \"Copy\" scripture feature you have ever seen. Great for copying scriptures into note-taking apps.\n\n* Bookmarks organised by topic or category. You can even put a comment against a bookmarked scripture to highlight a main point or line of reasoning.\n\n* History of scripture lookups.\n\n* Backup and Restore of verse notes and bookmarked scriptures, with backup reminders.\n\n* Clipboard Lookups - just copy a scripture from another document or app, and then open Equipd ... Equipd will try and look it up for you!\n\n* A powerful URL scheme so that you can create links to open scriptures in the Equipd Bible from external apps or documents. The Equipd Bible implements the x-callback-url scheme for developers to integrate with.\n\n* Streamlined workflow and screen rotation for all devices from the iPhone 4S to the larger iPhone 6 Plus, and of course it works great on the iPad. iOS 7 or above is required.\n\n* Split Screen support for iPad mini 4, iPad Air 2, iPad Pro.\n\n---\n\nPlease view the website and forums on www.equipd.me for more details and support. All official support is in English, but community users may offer support in other languages.\n\nI sincerely hope the Equipd Bible app can help you to be \"completely equipped for every good work\"! — 2 Timothy 3:17.\n\n---\n\nWebsite: www.equipd.me\nForums: www.equipd.me/forums\nFaceBook: facebook.com/equipd.me\nTwitter: twitter.com/equipd\n\n---\n\nIf you enjoy Equipd Bible, you might also enjoy...\n\n*** ServicePlanner ***\nA new Field Service and Ministry App with automated Dropbox Sync, full Call and Return Visit Management, Reporting, Time Scheduling and much more.\nwww.serviceplanner.me"

      "label": "Rainfall Calculator are physic/math calculator to find how many litres of rain water you can harvest per year, evaluate the cost savings and also recommend the minimum tank size for water storage.\n\nFeatures:\n- Instant calculation\n- Result are copy able to other app\n- Formula are include as reference\n- Support up to 16 decimal place\n- Support various unit for each input\n\nRainwater Collection Calculator\n- The catchment area is multiplied by the depth of rain that falls on it to give the total volume of water produced. \n- 1 millimetre of rain over 1 square metre of roof equals 1 litre of water\n- Annual rainfall (in millimetres) x Roof surface area (in square metres) = Roof catchment capacity.\n- You can add the cost of mains or tap water per M3 to evaluate the cost savings per year if this rainwater is collected and used instead of drinking water.\n- Minimum Tank Size store (33%) of the \"Annual Rainfall On Your Roof Area\" as you use the water while you are collecting it.\n\nThe rain will collect in gutters that channel the water into downspouts and then into some sort of storage vessel. Rainwater collection systems can be as simple as collecting rain in a rain barrel or as elaborate as harvesting rainwater into large cisterns to supply your entire household demand.\nYou can also collect rainwater for garden use. Plants like rainwater, because it's naturally soft, and free of chlorine and other chemicals. If drought is a problem where you live, collecting rainwater is a good way to deal with watering restrictions. If you're on a municipal water system, you stand to save a considerable amount of money. \n\nThanks for your support and do visit nitrio.com for more apps for your iOS devices."

All you have to do is: create a task name, set a timer, and press Countdown Timer. \nAfter the timer ends you will be prompted to answer if you accomplished the task or not? How it went (well or not) and what you could do differently the next time.\nWith Duration Mode, the total time you spend on the task will be displayed.\n\n\nWhat is the purpose and goal of this application?\nThe ultimate goal of Task Timer is to help you improve focus and results in the tasks that you have set for yourself. \nWith repeated usage, the answer that you gave at the end timer session, you will be reminded of how the previous timer session went. \nIf for example, you wrote that you got distracted by something, you know what you should look out for this time.\n\nIs there anything else?\nTask Timer will also log all your end session answers to each task. With the History option, you will get an overview of the task you have set for yourself and how you can make an improvement to it.\n\nYou can choose from various countdown timer displays. \nAs a parent, when you put your child on a time-out, he or she has something to look at.\nAs a user, it's always nice to have something to look at when you get distracted and Task Timer will put you back on the right track."

There is no need to navigate through multiple screens just to get a measurement.  Easy and intuitive to use, and measurement are displayed in big font to make it easy to read.\n\n+FAST ONE SCREEN CALCULATIONS\nSimple one screen calculations that show results \"live\" and on the fly as you slide your finger to enter values in.\n\n+ACCURATE CALCULATIONS\nCenterline bending radius - based calculations are also available.  These calculations offer greater accuracy when compared to bending multiplier methods.  Preposition your bends automatically.  All bends take shrink into account so you don't have to do any math.  What's faster - bending it twice or bending it right the first time?\n\n+PROTRACTOR FUNCTION INCLUDED\nUse the included protractor function to measure the angle as you bend.  Angle will be fed directly from your input screen to save you time.\n\n+BENDER PROFILES\nAlmost 100 different bender/pipe combinations included.  You have the ability to tweak or completely modify any of the combinations to match your bender on the field.\n\n+ WHO IS IT FOR?\nIf you consider yourself a craftsman that takes pride in his work, iBend Pipe is for you.  If other \"sparkies\" come to you when they have a difficult bend, this is for you.  If you want to have a smaller \"bone\"  pile, this is for you.  If you can write your name in conduit, this is for you.  From, a  1st year inside wireman apprentice to a seasoned “old timer” this app will save you time and material.\n\nInput fractions instead of converting to decimals and get results in fractions.\n\nThanks for all the great reviews, if you have any suggestions:\nsupport@ibendpipe.com"

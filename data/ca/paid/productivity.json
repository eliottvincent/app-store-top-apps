For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

Sometimes it's not easy to see your upcoming shift schedule very clearly, especially if your shifts don't fall into the traditional working week. Shift Worker solves this problem and turns the frustrating task of entry into a quick and easy experience.\n\nShift Worker allows you to create your own types of shifts by combining visually-attractive icons with letters/numbers so that they can be easily identified at a glance. By including a range of icons (such as suns and stars for day and night shifts) in a variety of colors, any combination is possible for all types of shifts.\n\nEntering shifts can be done quickly by simply selecting a type of shift and tapping on each date it occurs. An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!\n\nIn addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. \n\nShift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date. Notes can be used anytime additional information needs to be added to a date.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Create a virtually unlimited amount of shift types\n- Enter shifts on the calendar months in advance in seconds\n- Add your rotation and automatically fill the calendar in a few simple steps\n- Show friends and family shifts using multiple calendars\n- View the calendar in timeline format to see your shift flow at a glance\n- Create colored personalized notes for any date on the calendar\n- Include week of year or week 1/2 alternating pattern on calendar\n- Jump to any month by using the \"Goto\" button\n- Save a month's worth of shifts to your background\n- Share your shifts to others via email, MMS, Facebook or Twitter\n- Import other Shift Worker shifts and view them all within the one app\n- No in-app purchases!\n- No ads!"

It's the most advanced screen mirroring solution with zero delay and the highest screen quality.\n\nMirror photos, videos, games, websites, apps, presentations, documents and spreadsheets on Roku.\n\n* Supported Roku TVs: Hisense, Sharp, TCL, Insignia, Hitachi, Philips, Element, JVC\n\n* Your iPhone/iPad and your Roku must be connected to the same wifi to enable screen mirroring. Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Roku or any other trademark mentioned here.

      "label": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

      "label": "iBend Pipe is the best conduit bending applicaiton on an iPhone, it helps you bend it right...the first time.  \n\nIt calculates the following bends using English or Metric measurements so you don’t have to:\n\n    -Offsets Bends (specify towards an obstruction or away from an obstruction)\n    -Rolling Offsets Bends  (specify towards an obstruction or away from an obstruction)\n    -Parallel Offset Adjustment\n    -3-Bend Saddles\n    -4-Bend Saddles\n    -Segment Bends\n    -90° Bends\n    -Back to Back 90° Bends\n    -Kicked 90°s Bends\n    -Compound 90° Bends around a Round Obstruction\n    -Compound 90° Bends around a Square Obstruction\n    -Compound 90° Bends around a Rectangular Obstruction\n\n+ HOW DOES IT WORK?\nSimply slide your finger to set measurements and results are updated instantly.  There is no need to navigate through multiple screens just to get a measurement.  Easy and intuitive to use, and measurement are displayed in big font to make it easy to read.\n\n+FAST ONE SCREEN CALCULATIONS\nSimple one screen calculations that show results \"live\" and on the fly as you slide your finger to enter values in.\n\n+ACCURATE CALCULATIONS\nCenterline bending radius - based calculations are also available.  These calculations offer greater accuracy when compared to bending multiplier methods.  Preposition your bends automatically.  All bends take shrink into account so you don't have to do any math.  What's faster - bending it twice or bending it right the first time?\n\n+PROTRACTOR FUNCTION INCLUDED\nUse the included protractor function to measure the angle as you bend.  Angle will be fed directly from your input screen to save you time.\n\n+BENDER PROFILES\nAlmost 100 different bender/pipe combinations included.  You have the ability to tweak or completely modify any of the combinations to match your bender on the field.\n\n+ WHO IS IT FOR?\nIf you consider yourself a craftsman that takes pride in his work, iBend Pipe is for you.  If other \"sparkies\" come to you when they have a difficult bend, this is for you.  If you want to have a smaller \"bone\"  pile, this is for you.  If you can write your name in conduit, this is for you.  From, a  1st year inside wireman apprentice to a seasoned “old timer” this app will save you time and material.\n\nInput fractions instead of converting to decimals and get results in fractions.\n\nThanks for all the great reviews, if you have any suggestions:\nsupport@ibendpipe.com"

During the day whenever you achieve your goal or something positive enter it right away into the 3 Wins app. You can also pause at the end of your busy day to summarize and record your wins/achievements. By doing this, your brain will shift more towards positive thinking. \n\nTrack your achievements or personal goals, every day. Stretch your brain and take the good thoughts out before going to sleep and forgetting about them.\n\n\n=== WHAT IS A WIN? === \nA win can be anything positive you think of that was completed during the day. It can be something personal for example no junk food ate, or you made the bed in the morning. Treat all accomplished tasks in the day as a win and celebrate by checking them off. You can also track your business goals and achievements for the day, for example you met or exceeded your daily sales quota or finished that project you were working on for weeks! \n\nAppreciate your daily wins more!\n\n\n=== SAMPLE WINS ===\n• No junk food\n• Drank 8 glasses of water\n• Completed stretching\n• Breathe\n• Finished workout\n• Marketing project completed\n• First 5K run\n• Had a healthy snack\n\n\n=== HOW IT WORKS? === \nEach day has a goal to write down at least 3 wins to close the day on green. You can add random completed goals or create a repeating task that you will check off every day. Why 3? We want to stretch your brain and think more on the positive side. There had to be at least 3 things you have completed today?! Did you drink enough water, took a bike to work, parked further to walk more, said thank you, smiled. Any positive task completed is a win! And don’t be tied just to 3, if it was 1 or 10 write them all down!\n\n\n=== KEY FEATURES ===\n• Super simple achievement tracking.\n• Calendar view will show you a glance color coded view of your month. Dark green colors mean you have achieved 3 or more wins, lighter colors not quite there, but it is better than none!\n• Daily general reminder to get things noted.\n• Set reminders for your scheduled wins to get reminded to complete them.\n• Create wins/tasks that are repeating/recurring.\n• Supports Siri Shortcuts.\n• Apple Watch app.\n• iCloud sync\n• Confetti celebration for a full day of wins!"

      "label": "Notebooks is a writing app, a text and markdown editor, your personal Wiki and Zettelkasten, a file organizer, task manager, PDF and eBook creator and more. This may sound like a lot, but consider you have a few text fragments, randomly created, which you want to combine into a chapter of a book and saved as PDF or eBook; or a quick note sparks off an idea, generates a couple of tasks, each of which requires you to organize further research material; or you have business related documents which need to be separated from private diaries, records and files. – With Notebooks you handle these jobs easily without switching apps, and while remaining focussed and creative.\n\n• Notebooks stores all your documents as regular files in standard formats. You are always in control of your documents, never need to worry about how to export them, and they remain compatible across devices and over time.\n\n• Create formatted documents with styles, attachments, tables or checklists, and add a table of contents if you like. Choose between a variation of ready made document styles, or create your own, if you want.\n\n• Write your documents in plain text and allow Notebooks to automatically handle lists, highlight and center the current line on screen, automatically insert closing characters for  (, {, [, \" and more. - Plain text is a universal format which can be used on any device without any specific software.\n\n• Use Markdown to create formatted documents from plain text. Notebooks supports *MultiMarkdown* and its own flavor of *Discount*.  – Click any word in a formatted Markdown text and start writing at that position. You can even create checklists (- [ ]) and tick them off in formatted view. Syntax highlighting and a set of dedicated extra keyboard keys make Markdown editing easy.\n  \n• Use your Apple Pencil to sketch ideas or annotate images and PDF documents.\n\n• Use Notebooks' advanced editing capabilities to work on documents which are stored in other apps.\n\n• Compile selected documents or the contents of whole books into a single document, an eBook or a PDF document.\n\n• Link between documents in Notebooks. In Markdown you can even use Wiki style links ([[ ]]). When clicking a link to a document which does not yet exist, Notebooks suggests to create it. And when you move or rename documents, Notebooks makes sure the links remain intact.\n\n• Create as many books as you need to structure your projects and details. Nest books as deep as you like, there is no limit in Notebooks. If you ever loose track, Notebooks' full text search helps you quickly turn up even the most hidden document.\n\n• Turn books into task lists to display document as tasks which can be ticked off. Assign due dates and alerts, and divide projects into nested sub projects, which makes them easier to handle. \n\n• For simple lists you can use checklists in formatted documents and Markdown.\n\n• Assign Context tags to books and documents to create shortcuts that are accessible for a smart book at Notebooks' top level. – Notebooks can even extract context tags from the contents of documents as you create them.\n\n• Import all documents and files you want to keep close at hand, no matter whether PDF, email, web pages, MS Office or iWorks, photos, videos, music and more.\n\n• Scan documents and extract text using OCR (iOS 13)\n\n• Sync files between iPads, iPhones, Mac or PC. \n\nWith all that, Notebooks may quickly become your one and only app for everything you want to keep close at hand.\n\nUser Comments: \n\n“Notebooks is a wonderful App, which is so much better than the dozen other note apps I tried. It is sophisticated, in an unassuming way, so that you find yourself greatly rewarded and being productive without sacrificing time/effort to the App. I cannot tell you how much productivity I have gained.  I am having a huge amount of fun, I use it constantly, more than the phone on my iPhone in fact.\" \n\n“You are GTD in every way that makes it efficient and makes me efficient.”"

The best productivity experts recommend reducing your workload for better per-task performance.\n\n3 ENERGY-BASED WORKFLOWS\n\nOnce you have your 3 priority tasks. We've created 3 workflows, Eat That Frog, Climb The Summit, and the Slow Burn to help you best order your day for success and energy.\n\nSINGLE-TASK FOCUS MODE\n\nTo truly focus, we need fewer distractions. Blocking out attention to focus on just your key task can make a huge difference. Inside Bento, we have a single-task focus mode combined with a countdown timer for deep focus work states.\n\nDARK & LIGHT MODE\n\nEach box can be customized with an emoji alongside stunningly animated themes. Each theme has a light mode and dark mode, for optimal productivity.\n\n6 BEAUTIFULLY ANIMATED THEMES\n\nRelaxing Japanese-themed backgrounds for a soothing way to handle your most meaningful tasks.\n\n---\n\nBento can be used in a variety of ways, here are a few recommendations:\n\n- Create a daily Bento to plan your 3 priority tasks\n- Plan the full week by adding up to 7 Bento boxes\n- Build a week, month, and yearly goals list for planning ahead\n\nThe Bento app is the best and most effective place to implement the Bento Methodology, a new mindful way to approach task management. Bento is now optimised for iPad as part of a single universal app for all your iOS devices.\n\n---\n\nQUESTIONS\n\nReach out on Twitter @BentoMethod or email bento@keepproductive.com for any help.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\n\nFind the full privacy policy here: https://www.bentomethod.com/privacy"

      "label": "\"Oblique Strategies\" is a concept developed by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt to help artists overcome creative blocks through lateral thinking. It consists of a deck of cards, each one containing a vague or ambiguous phrase that can be used to solve a problem intuitively, by breaking conventional thinking patterns and interpreting it from a new perspective.\n\nThis app aims to translate the essence of the original cards deck into a digital experience, making it accessible to a wider audience. It contains the original edition, as well as the newer decks, presenting them in a sleek minimalist style inspired by the original design of the cards. The user interface is simple and straightforward, built to encourage creative or design thinking without distracting from the process. The home screen widget on iOS 14 allows reading a new quote every day without opening the application. The Apple Watch version can run independently without needing the app installed on your iPhone.\n\nWith VoiceOver, anyone with a visual impairment can have the Oblique Strategies phrase read to them. Long tap the screen to have the last sentence read to you again. Also, you can shake the iPhone for a new sentence."

It’s like having a personal editor on your phone or tablet! SpellCheckPlus Mobile is even able to identify many errors typical of second language learners, e.g.: I am student instead of I am a student. \n\nSpellCheckPlus Mobile makes it easy to copy and paste text to or from its editor. \n\n*** Please note that SpellCheckPlus Mobile requires an internet connection during use. ***"

      "label": "Is that three bend saddle at the end of the pipe?  Don't you wish you could flip the bender around to make the bend easier?  My Bender has your back.  One of the key features is My Bender's ability to allow you to orient the bender to make your bending more practical, just tap on the bender to flip the orientation of the bender.\n\nMy Bender,  offers the most accurate conduit bending calculations on the App Store.  How? Because My Bender uses \"your\" bender, with its unique bending characteristics to do the math.\n\nMost other calculators use the cosecant method which is simply an approximation, or a rule of thumb.  But as pipe size and bend angle increase in size, the error introduced with the approximation also increases.  This is because the benders' radius and pipe diameter are not taken into consideration, this is not the case with My Bender.\n\nCurrently My Bender can calculate:\n-Offsets with predetermined locations on the conduit.\n-Match an existing offset's angle.\n-Three Bend saddles that fit like a glove.\n-Four Bend saddles that \"look like they grew there\".\n-Kicked 90° Bend that will make your heart skip a beat.\n-Calculate the distance from your benchmark to the center of bend for any angle.\n \nThere are other conduit bending calculators on the App store, but none have the polish and attention to detail that My Bender has.  My Bender allows you to \"flip\" the orientation of the bender to best suit practical bending, and then shows you the correct measurement for the benders current orientation.  \n\nMy Bender helps the professional electrician keep track of all the conduit benders he uses.  As you know every bender has its own bending characteristics.  In order to account for these differences in benders it is necessary to have a log book where the bender's details are kept.\n\nAdd your own:\n- Hand Benders\n- \"Chicago\" Benders\n- 555 Benders\n- Cyclone Benders\n- Smart Benders\n- Table Benders\n\nMy Bender not only keeps track of your benders, it also calculates some very important characteristics:\n\n-Take up (aka Deduct) for a 90° bend\n-Gain on a 90 degree bend\n-Centerline bending radius\n\nHow does My Bender calculate this?\nEverything is based on the centerline bending radius.  This is calculated by bending one 90° bend and making some key measurements.  You select the pipe size and material.  And that is all it takes for My Bender to \"fingerprint\" your bender.\n\nEvery key measurement also has a description page that uses diagrams to help you visualize the measurement.\n\nSince I can not respond directly to reviews: Please email  support@iBendPipe.com"

This provides a different, more efficient view of your schedule.\n\nHOW IT LOOKS\n\nIt looks like a projection of your calendar of events onto a 12-hour dial that has hour and minute hands just like a regular watch.\nEvent sectors are displayed in those hour intervals in which they will occur.\nThe interval of idle time between events is displayed between sectors, as well as the time from an hour hand to the start of each event.\nEvents are displayed automatically 12/24 hours ahead of time.\n\nThe calendar and analog clock, combined, give a visual representation of your busyness, allow you to effectively plan and calculate daytime.\n\nUse a widget for better integration.\n\nAREAS OF APPLICATION\n\n• Day scheduling and timing. Conveniently track your daily tasks, meetings, events and at any time know how much time is left to wait until the end of the current event and until the start of the next. Don't be late.\n\n• Accounting and control of working hours. Keep your phone in your workplace and you will be completely under control.\n\n• Class schedule. Observe how much time is left before the end of a tiresome lecture at the university and never be late for laboratory work.\n\n• Schedule of the day. Follow your daily routine and get better, just use the app to keep track of your to-dos and daily tasks. Take rest breaks in time!\n\n• Trip timer and flight duration. Are you losing the passage of time due to endless travel and flights? Control check-in time, boarding time and flight duration. Keep everything under control.\n\n• Make your meal, medication, and exercise schedule clearer. Lead the right lifestyle and be healthy!\n\n• Convenient countdown to scheduled events in the app and widget. The plan of the day will be executed exactly.\n\n• The app may appeal to fans of Pomodoro and Chronodex timer technologies. Time tracking with him will happen in a new way."

This is useful when running tube on beams and cross braces.\n\nJoint Offset:\nThe Joint offset calculates the measurements and offsets to aid in the positioning of an offset tube joint or connecter in a specific location, and gives the measurements to place the center of the joint.\n\nFall Calculation:\nThe Fall Calculator calculates the fall or Offset amount, over a set distance based on a fall ratio.\nThe usual fall minimum for tubing in instrumentation is 1:12 or 8.33%."

      "label": "One evening, after a very long week of shows we were sat in the office looking at the show times wishing the running times would work them selves out (we've all been there), it was at this moment this show timing app was created. Welcome to the future of show timing without multiple stop watches and reminder alarms. Now you can start your show with the press of one button and the app does the rest. With unlimited Acts and Intervals in any configuration that you like! , just set your show structure, tell it your interval duration(s) and away you go. \n\nShow StopWatch also handles separate in act timers and show stops, adjusting the running and playing times accordingly! Once you have completed a show you can then email the times with a simple button press or copy them your clipboard as well as storing them for later. \n\nThere is also the option to have pre show notifications for back stage calls and the same again in the interval so you don't have to spend all your time looking at the clock. The app will also run in the back ground of your phone if for what ever reason you need to use your phone for something else (certainly not facebook, for those long scenes with no cues) while its running. \n\nThis app was created by stage managers for stage managers, it is currently being used by a number of productions and companies including UK Tours, West End shows and Repertory Theatres. It will continue to be a working development so any thing you come across that you think ‘it would be great if’ please don't hesitate to get in contact! It became apparent while testing how tiny details make a difference to everyone so we have tried to incorporate them all, for example; the interval timer shows both time elapsed and remaining, and is in green until you start over running when it goes red (because how often do you go up on time), and the ability to access times so far, for those quiet moments where you are able to start the show report early!\n\nThis app has not been made to replace your note book, still write times down if you get a chance, its simply to try and make life easier at the end of the show! Have a play, get to know it and let us know how you get on!\n\nIf you want to get in contact email me at jackrlord@gmail.com"

RPMmtr analyses those sound patterns to measure RPM (rotational speed) based on state-of-the-art signal processing technology.\n\nThe result of this estimation is shown in three different views. The tachometer view displays the rotational speed at a glance. The color of the dent indicates how clear the measurement is. You can swipe the red ring control and improve the result by specifying the expected RPM range.\nThe tracking view shows the evolution of the rotational speed over time. The accuracy of the measurement is indicated by the size and color of the circles.\nExperts can use the spectrogram view: the graph shows the frequency distribution of the sound. Small arrows show the rotational speed. Adjust the axes scaling by a swipe with one finger.\n\nNotice on usage:\nThe app can estimate the correct rotational speed only in cases if the sound is very clear (i.e. the rotating device generates clear periodic sound patterns with one frequency) and there is no background noise.\nRPMmtr is for educational purposes only.

      "label": "With its subtle timer movements and dark colors that won’t break your concentration, Focus Pocus helps you stay focused on your work and not on the clock.\n\nFocus Pocus is a pomodoro timer that helps you manage your time using the pomodoro technique. The pomodoro technique aims to improve your productivity by helping you focus your attention on your work for short intervals (pomdoros), allowing for rest breaks in between to avoid fatigue.\n\nOther pomodoro timer apps may catch your attention with a big countdown timer and flashy colors. Focus Pocus instead opts for a subtle timer design reminiscent of a mechanical wall timer that moves slowly and steadily, with subdued colors that keep the attention on your task at hand. The result is a pomodoro timer that won't distract you while you work.\n\nKey Features\n\n1. Designed to minimize distractions with an unobtrusive and easy-to-use interface. Rotate the control knob at any time to adjust the time remaining, and start/pause/stop the timer with large, accessible buttons.\n\n2. Curated options such as notifications and a metronome sound are available to help you customize your experience.\n\n3. Lightweight and fast: tiny 1MB download and loads in a snap.\n\n4. Privacy conscious: no data collection, tracking, or analytics. No dark patterns designed to keep you hooked to your device."

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nGet Started\n• Interactive tutorial project\n• Keep each manuscript and supporting materials in a self-contained project\n• Import Word, RTF, Final Draft and plain text files\n• Easily split imported text into separate sections\n\nGet Writing\n• Write your manuscript in sections of any size\n• View all sections as a single text using the “Draft Navigator” (iPad only)\n• Quickly navigate sections using the “binder” sidebar\n• Format with fonts and presets\n• Comments, footnotes, links and highlights\n• Simple bullets and lists\n• Insert images\n• Pinch-zoom to resize text\n• Full-screen mode (iPad only)\n• Typewriter scrolling mode keeps typed text center-screen (iPad only)\n• Write a screenplay using scriptwriting mode\n• Live word and character counts\n• Set word and character count targets\n• Find and replace\n• Customizable keyboard row provides quick-access buttons for formatting, navigation and punctuation\n• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for external keyboard users\n• Dark mode\n\nFind Your Structure\n• Write in any order and reorganize later\n• Write a synopsis for any text section and see it in the outline\n• Expand, collapse and drill down into sections of your project\n• Rearrange sections as index cards on the corkboard (iPad only)\n• Project-wide search\n• Track ideas using labels and status\n• Apply custom icons to your sections\n\nRefer to Research\n• Import research material such as image, PDF and media files\n• View research files or other sections right alongside your writing (iPad only)\n• Every section has its own notes area for jotting down ideas\n• Supports multi-tasking split screen mode (supported devices only)\n\nShare Your Work\n• Compile to a single document for sharing or printing\n• Use different formatting in your exported or printed document\n• Export to Word, RTF, Final Draft, PDF or plain text\n• Convert rich text to Markdown for sharing with Markdown apps\n• Create and email zipped backups of your projects\n\nWork Anywhere\n• Use Dropbox to sync between devices and with the macOS and Windows versions of Scrivener*\n• Copy projects between devices via iTunes\n\n* Requires a Dropbox account (not compatible with iCloud).\n\nSUPPORT\nYou can contact us at ios.support@literatureandlatte.com, visit our forums at http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum, or find us @scrivenerapp on Twitter."

Use it to create to do lists, make grocery lists, take notes, write an outline of a story, prepare notes for a presentation, make a list of gift ideas, plan a vacation... or anything else you'd want to make a list for.\n\n\nBEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED\n\nAssign a fun icon to each of your lists - there are over 450 to choose from. You can also select from 30 themes to customize the app's design to your liking.\n\n\nSIMPLE AND VERSATILE\n\nPaperless is easy to use with a clean, elegant and well thought out interface. Each list can either be a checklist or a regular list without checkboxes, making a wide variety of uses possible.\n\n\nREALLY HELPS YOU GET THINGS DONE\n\nFor checklists and todo lists, many people prefer using Paperless over traditional \"getting things done\" apps - or, they use it in addition to one. There are no due dates or priority settings, so you're left to focus on the actual tasks at hand, rather than waste time changing those settings when your priorities change. Instead, if a particular task becomes important, you can simply move it to the top of the list.\n\n\nAUTOMATIC BACKUP AND SYNCING\n\nAutomatically backup your lists and sync them between iOS devices via a free Dropbox account.\n\n\nPOWERFUL FEATURES\n\n- send lists via email, others can import your list into their copy of Paperless\n- send a plain text version of a list via iMessage, or copy it into another app\n- easily duplicate lists\n- manually reorder lists and list items\n- sort list items alphabetically\n- copy and move items from one list to another\n- comprehensive search\n- passcode lock\n\n\nPRAISED BY THE PRESS\n\n\"Paperless deserves a spot on your iPhone\" - Lex Friedman, Macworld (4.5 out of 5 mice rating)\n\n\"Paperless has a permanent spot on the first page of my iPhone's home screen... it will probably earn a similar spot on yours.\" - Marianne Schultz, AppShopper\n\n\"... a good way to ensure things get done at your own pace, free of the disappointment of missing deadlines.\" - Nick Spence, Macworld UK\n\n\"I've been trying many To Do apps since iPhone 1.0 -- from the expensive Things to Toodledo and others -- and I don't use any of them regularly. Most just require too much effort. Paperless is the first one I've found that hits that sweet spot between being simple enough you'll actually use it and powerful enough to be useful.\" - Marc Zeedar, REALbasic Developer Magazine (4.8 out of 5 rating)\n\n\"This is one nice-looking list / task app... As a basic list app, the beautiful Paperless reigns supreme.\" - Bonnie Eisenman, 148apps.com (4 out of 5 rating)\n\n\nPRAISED BY USERS\n\n\"Best app ever - The most incredibly useful app I've come across. Simple, effective and bloody marvelous!!!\"\n\n\"The simplicity of the interface and the flexibility given to the user is perfection.\"\n\n\"Simply loved it - Best app I've ever downloaded, my life is so organized now! ...\"\n\n\"After having tried a good deal of apps to get myself more organized - both free and paid - it is clear that this tops them all. Other apps presented a kind of novelty; I could fool myself into thinking that I was more organized, but it was never long before I abandoned them because it was obvious that they consumed unnecessary time. Paperless, however, has truly helped. It is streamlined, it is simple, it is sumptuous\"\n\n\nPLEASE RATE AND REVIEW\n\nIf you love Paperless, please leave a review and star rating. Thank you!"

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store.

Sometimes it's not easy to see your upcoming shift schedule very clearly, especially if your shifts don't fall into the traditional working week. Shift Worker solves this problem and turns the frustrating task of entry into a quick and easy experience.\n\nShift Worker allows you to create your own types of shifts by combining visually-attractive icons with letters/numbers so that they can be easily identified at a glance. By including a range of icons (such as suns and stars for day and night shifts) in a variety of colors, any combination is possible for all types of shifts.\n\nEntering shifts can be done quickly by simply selecting a type of shift and tapping on each date it occurs. An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!\n\nIn addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. \n\nShift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date. Notes can be used anytime additional information needs to be added to a date.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Create a virtually unlimited amount of shift types\n- Enter shifts on the calendar months in advance in seconds\n- Add your rotation and automatically fill the calendar in a few simple steps\n- Show friends and family shifts using multiple calendars\n- View the calendar in timeline format to see your shift flow at a glance\n- Create colored personalized notes for any date on the calendar\n- Include week of year or week 1/2 alternating pattern on calendar\n- Jump to any month by using the \"Goto\" button\n- Save a month's worth of shifts to your background\n- Share your shifts to others via email, MMS, Facebook or Twitter\n- Import other Shift Worker shifts and view them all within the one app\n- No in-app purchases!\n- No ads!"

Keep an eye on all the important parameters of your car with a personalized dashboard.\n\nEXHAUST FLAP REMOTE CONTROL*\nTake control over the exhaust flap in your car and decide yourself, whether it should be closed or open.\n\nACTIVE SOUND DESIGN**\nIf you do not like the artificial engine sound generated in your car, just mute the Active Sound Design with BimmerLink.\n\nSOUND TUNING***\nThe “Sound Tuning” option allows you to disable the “exhaust burble“ in cars equipped with the S55 engine (M2 Competition, M3, M4).\n\nDPF REGENERATION****\nBimmerLink allows you to check the current state of the diesel particulate filter in your car. Find out when the last regeneration took place or how much ash has accumulated in the filter and start a regeneration with the touch of a button.\n\nBATTERY REGISTRATION\nIf you want to replace the battery in your car, this has to be registered in the engine control unit and BimmerLink allows you to do this yourself now.\n\nPARKING BRAKE SERVICE MODE\nBimmerLink allows you to activate the service mode for the electromechanical parking brake.\n\nSERVICE RESET\nReset the service display in your car after carrying out maintenance work like a brake pad replacement or an engine oil change.\n\nREQUIRED ACCESSORIES\nTo use the app one of the supported Bluetooth or WiFi OBD adapters or cables is required.

Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research?

      "label": "«Проектор отдельной реальности» – это настоящий подарок и для тех, кто уже успел оценить эффективность Трансерфинга, и для тех, кто впервые знакомится с этой удивительной техникой управления реальностью.\n\nОтветьте себе на вопрос: кто создает вашу жизнь? Вы сами? Или обстоятельства, другие люди, мода, престижные тенденции? Послушно следуя за тем, что диктует социум, люди часто забывают о собственных стремлениях и проживают в тоске «чужую» жизнь, вместо того чтобы наслаждаться собственным уникальным путем. \n\nНовое приложение «Проектор отдельной реальности» – предлагает простой и очень эффективный подход: перестать быть Приемником чужой информации и стать Транслятором, начать «снимать свое кино». \n\nВсе, что необходимо сделать: \n• создать «слайд» - обрисовать словами заветную цель в каждой сфере жизни; \n• ежедневно записывать «мыслеформы», подтверждающие реализацию ваших намерений.\n\nВедение записей в таком ключе поможет вам сосредоточиться на своих намерениях и постепенно, день за днем, превращать идеальную картинку в объективную реальность.\n\nДля удобства пользователей в приложении предоставляется множество примеров формулировок целей (слайдов), а также ежедневных подтверждений (мыслеформ). Можно создать слайд какой угодно темы либо выбрать из имеющихся: \n\n• Дом\n• Семья\n• Мое дело (миссия)\n• Здоровье\n• Внешний вид\n• Трансерфинг\n• Саморазвитие\n• Достаток\n• Предназначение (поиск)\n• Бонусы жизни\n• Личная сила\n• Творчество\n• Единая линия\n\nВ разделе «Инфо» вы найдете подробное Руководство пользователя и сжатое описание основных принципов Трансерфинга, а при первом запуске приложения вас ждет краткая инструкция по использованию приложения.\n\n«Я не строю планы – Я создаю реальность!»"

      "label": "Ikiru is a simple but powerful app for making lists, keeping notes and setting reminders. It aims to help you live a productive and meaningful life, by enabling you to focus on the things that are most important to you.\n\n\nIKIRU IS VERSATILE\nUse it to create to do lists, shopping lists, take notes, store contact information, keep track of books to read, or movies to watch... or anything else you'd want to make a list for.\n\n\nIKIRU IS BEAUTIFUL\nWith a clean and easy to use design, choose from over 2000 icons to assign to your lists.\n\n\nIKIRU IS POWERFUL\n- create lists within lists\n\n- assign a due date and reminder to list items\n\n- view all items with a due date in one convenient timeline\n\n- add a photo to list items\n\n- drag and drop to sort list items, or automatically keep a list sorted alphabetically, by modification date, completion date, and more\n\n- easily copy or move items from one list to another\n\n- mark items incomplete to return them to their original position in the list (this makes lists easy to reuse)\n\n- send a list via email, and the receiver can import your list into their copy of Ikiru\n\n- view items with due dates on your Apple Watch\n\n\nIKIRU KEEPS YOUR DATA SAFE\n- automatically back up and sync lists between iOS devices using iCloud\n\n- use Touch ID or a custom passcode to protect your information\n\n\nIKIRU HAS PURPOSE\nThe word \"ikiru\" (ee-kee-roo) means \"to live\" in Japanese. It's also the title of an Akira Kurosawa film about a man who decides to do something meaningful with his life. Ikiru (the app) is my attempt at doing something meaningful with my life, and hopefully help others live meaningful and productive lives.\n\n\nIKIRU HAS HISTORY\nIn 2010 I released a list-making app called \"Paperless\". From busy moms to airplane pilots to people who needed a little help remembering things after suffering a brain injury, Paperless has been used by hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. Ikiru is built upon that legacy - incorporating the best ideas from Paperless, greatly improving upon them, and adding big features that people have requested.\n\n\nIKIRU NEEDS LOVE\nIf you find Ikiru useful, please rate and review it in the App Store. Thank you!"

There is a lot of swearing. Really so very much swearing. Please do not buy this app and then be shocked by the swearing, because there is a lot of it, and here we are, telling you about it right up front. \n\nIf traditional housekeeping isn’t really your style, but your living space needs a little attention, UfYH’s challenges and customizable features will help you get your place back in shape, a few minutes at a time. Rather than encourage marathon cleaning sessions, UfYH gives you the tools to clean up, a little at a time. Unf&%*ing your habitat turns dreaded chores into easy-to-complete tasks, with a hefty dose of “filthy” language to motivate you to clean up.\n\n    -Clean and simple easy-to-use interface.\n    -Select timed challenges in 5, 10, or 20 minute intervals and try to beat the clock to finish the challenge.\n    -Select challenges by room.\n    -Create a customized to-do list and reminders to keep you on schedule.\n    -Earn achievements for completing challenges or finishing your to-do list.\n    -Use the 20/10 timer to reward yourself with a 10-minute break for every 20 minutes of work. Shorter challenges count cumulatively toward your total time.\n    -Random motivators remind you that excuses are boring and use a combination of a little guilt, a little shame, and a little swearing to get you moving. \n\nUfYH is especially useful for those who don’t have a lot of spare time to devote to cleaning: students, people with full-time jobs, people with roommates, anyone who can’t find the motivation to get up and just do something. Even if it’s just a little something! Our lives are complicated and messy, and we’re often overwhelmed and distracted, and sometimes a little lazy. Unf&%* things and see a remarkable difference in how you tackle cleaning.\n\nUfYH uses frequent profanity and is for mature audiences. In-app, the word \"filth\" is replaced by its older, more foul-mouthed cousin. This app uses the \"f-word.\" A lot. Please be aware of this before purchasing."

The user of the app is responsible for double checking the results.  Please ensure that all default values (prices, product densities, etc.) are to your liking before calculating.\n\nDo you want to know how much a fertilizer blend will cost per ton?  Per acre?  Liquid or dry blends?  This is the app for you!  It was designed by farmers for farmers and others involved in the agricultural world.  To get you started it includes some common fertilizers, but you can edit the products and add your own.\n\nWorking the app couldn’t be easier.  Start a blend, specify how many pounds per acre of each element that you’d like to apply, and then specify which products you want to use in the blend.  That’s it and you’re ready to calculate!  But what if you want to have a final blend that includes two particular products for the same element?  Just choose both products and specify what percentage of each you want in the final product (i.e. 65% of N Product 1 and 35% of N Product 2).  Once you’re ready and press ‘Calculate’ you’re served with a detailed report showing (fields are for dry blend with liquid fields bracketed):\n\nNet Elements in Blend\nWeight per Load\n(Weight of liquid per acre)\nWeight of Product to Order (Volume to Order)\nVolumes, Costs, Etc.\nLegal Analysis %\n\nIn the latest update we tried to add support for as many units as possible.  Should you find a unit we missed or a conversion that you suspect isn't right, please email us and we'll get it up to date."

This app does not detect non-magnetic objects, For example, aluminum or wood studs. \n\nDISCLAIMER: The performance of the app is limited by the construction of the wall, presence of a phone cover and/or the material of the nails in the studs.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nIf your device has a external case, please remove before using this app.\n\nCalibrate your device’s magnetic sensor by moving the device in a \"Figure 8\" pattern. Then tap the \"Intensity\" reading displayed on the app to set the baseline to zero.\n\nTo accurately detect nails using this app, on iPhone 5s and below, sweep with the right edge of the device against the wall. For iPhone 6 and above, sweep with the top edge of the device along the wall.\n\nSometimes it helps to first figure out the location of the magnet (compass magnet) on your phone using a magnetic material so it becomes clear where to \"mark\" when you find a nail in the stud.\n\n\nLocalization Credits: Laura Klein (French), Ilgiz Khisamov (Russian), Yasu Yu (Chinese), Cem Yolcu (Turkish)"

Simplifying our lives makes us less stressed and more productive. Having tasks fed to you one by one allows you to maintain focus on completing just a single task. To top it all off, shuffling makes completing tasks fun and motivating.\n\nSHUFFLING\nTaskBox’s unique algorithm allows weighted shuffling. With priorities set on your tasks, higher priority tasks will have a higher chance of being selected for you to complete first.\n\nDESIGN\nEvery element and detail of TaskBox is designed to enhance user experience. Minimalistic in design, the app creates zero burden, even goes as far as to lighten up your day.\n\n\"Productivity is never an accident. It is always the result of a commitment to excellence, intelligent planning, and focused effort.” - Paul J.

The calculations are based on both electromagnetic theory and the statistical analysis of terrain characteristics to calculate the degradation of the RF wave as a function of distance and the variability of the RF wave with respect to time and space.\n\nThe Irregular Terrain Model has two different prediction models. One is the Area Prediction mode which calculates propagation losses over an area where the exact terrain parameters are not known, but approximated using terrain roughness, environmental parameters and statistical parameters. \n\nThe second is a point-to-point mode where specific latitude/longitude pair values are entered for both transmitter and receiver. Environmental parameters and statistical parameters are also used in this prediction mode.\n\nThe results may be saved to iCloud, emailed, or posted to Facebook or Twitter. The results are in CSV format.\n\nIn the Area Prediction mode a table along with a graph shows the path loss over the distance entered into the settings. The graph is viewed by rotating the device once the results table is shown.\n\nIn the Point-To-Point Prediction mode a table along with a graph shows the path loss and elevation profile of the RF path."

      "label": "\"Oblique Strategies\" is a concept developed by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt to help artists overcome creative blocks through lateral thinking. It consists of a deck of cards, each one containing a vague or ambiguous phrase that can be used to solve a problem intuitively, by breaking conventional thinking patterns and interpreting it from a new perspective.\n\nThis app aims to translate the essence of the original cards deck into a digital experience, making it accessible to a wider audience. It contains the original edition, as well as the newer decks, presenting them in a sleek minimalist style inspired by the original design of the cards. The user interface is simple and straightforward, built to encourage creative or design thinking without distracting from the process. The home screen widget on iOS 14 allows reading a new quote every day without opening the application. The Apple Watch version can run independently without needing the app installed on your iPhone.\n\nWith VoiceOver, anyone with a visual impairment can have the Oblique Strategies phrase read to them. Long tap the screen to have the last sentence read to you again. Also, you can shake the iPhone for a new sentence."

      "label": "Voice Dream Writer helps everyone write better: Text-to-speech proofreading reduces mistakes, phonetic and meaning search help you use the right words, and an active outline helps you organize and improve the structure of your writing.\n\n• Featured in the US App Store Education Collection.\n\n• \"Voice Dream Writer's technically designed for people with reading disabilities, but it's useful for just about anyone who needs a little help proofing.\" - Lifehacker\n\nText-To-Speech Proofreading. Professional proofreaders recommend reading out loud as the best way to catch mistakes. Like a personal proofreader, Voice Dream Writer reads your writing using text-to-speech, so you can easily spot awkward sentences, grammatical errors and typos. Also, it can read words and sentences as you type or voice dictate. This way, you can type faster because you no longer have to look up to check the text you just wrote. \n\nWord Finder. Voice Dream Writer helps you find the right words using phonetic search and meaning search. For example, search for \"inuf\" phonetically, and you will find \"enough\", and search for \"Fast Africa Cat\" by meaning and you will find \"Cheetah.\" Word Finder also shows you the dictionary definition of a word as you type without you having to select anything or open another program. \n\nOutline. As you write, Voice Dream Writer automatically creates an outline of headings, paragraphs and sentences. The Outline helps you structure your document better by giving you an always-on overview. You can also quickly navigate to a section in a long document without endless scrolling. Finally, you can drag and drop elements in the Outline to organize your writing. No more selecting, cutting and pasting large blocks of text.\n\nBesides these unique features, Voice Dream Writer also comes with everything you would expect from any great writing tool:  \n\n• Comprehensive settings for text appearance\n• Uncluttered writing area\n• Search for text\n• Search for misspelled words\n• Word count\n• Synchronize and backup with iCloud\n• Import and export for Dropbox, Google Drive, and Box\n• Preview and print with multiple themes\n• Markdown support for formatting\n• Export to Microsoft Word format (compatible with Apple Pages)\n• Support for Bluetooth keyboard\n\nThe app is not only fully accessible, it was designed with students and adults with print disabilities in mind. There are special tools for VoiceOver users to manage the cursor, select text, and find and correct misspelled words by stepping through them. Voice-based Proofreading and Phonetic Search are invaluable for people with dyslexia. Also included is the research-proven Dyslexie font.\n\nVoice Dream Writer will continue to evolve. We would love to hear from you!"

Stay in the flow when it's time to type a number or symbol or you need to move around, because the needed keys are right there in the main layout.  And we use the full width, not just the middle, to display word suggestions.\n\nErgonomics aren't sacrificed either.  The main keys are big enough to type fast, and autocorrect is fine-tuned for catching common finger misses.  You'll find using Typefinity is almost like having a full bluetooth keyboard -- without the weight and bulk!\n\n  • Numbers and punctuation in one layout, where your fingers remember.\n  • Cursor keys for easy, precise movement by letter or word.\n  • Dedicated keys for accented characters in your language.\n  • Option switch for typing other symbols and accented characters.\n  • Full autocorrect in all supported languages, showing more than three words.\n  • “Short” layout option for more screen visibility in landscape orientation.\n  • Swipe input (trace words with your finger), and flick up on number and punctuation keys for shifted versions.\n  • Numeric and calculator modes.\n  • Privacy friendly (“full access” is NOT required for most functionality, including autocorrect).\n\nLanguages / layouts supported: English (US and British / UK / Aus, Dvorak), Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French (France and Canada), German, Italian, Norwegian (Bokmål), Polish, Portuguese (Portugal and Brazil), Romanian, Spanish, and Swedish."

When you want to see these elements, you can toggle them on by tapping on the extension. You can also tap 'save settings' to store your own preferences.\n\nThe extension also hides the ads that are inserted in your search results.\n\nThe app is open source and doesn't collect any data.

For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n• Create personalized Allow Lists for different situations. Non-allowed apps will be blocked.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

Sometimes it's not easy to see your upcoming shift schedule very clearly, especially if your shifts don't fall into the traditional working week. Shift Worker solves this problem and turns the frustrating task of entry into a quick and easy experience.\n\nShift Worker allows you to create your own types of shifts by combining visually-attractive icons with letters/numbers so that they can be easily identified at a glance. By including a range of icons (such as suns and stars for day and night shifts) in a variety of colors, any combination is possible for all types of shifts.\n\nEntering shifts can be done quickly by simply selecting a type of shift and tapping on each date it occurs. An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!\n\nIn addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. \n\nShift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date. Notes can be used anytime additional information needs to be added to a date.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Create a virtually unlimited amount of shift types\n- Enter shifts on the calendar months in advance in seconds\n- Add your rotation and automatically fill the calendar in a few simple steps\n- Show friends and family shifts using multiple calendars\n- View the calendar in timeline format to see your shift flow at a glance\n- Create colored personalized notes for any date on the calendar\n- Include week of year or week 1/2 alternating pattern on calendar\n- Jump to any month by using the \"Goto\" button\n- Save a month's worth of shifts to your background\n- Share your shifts to others via email, MMS, Facebook or Twitter\n- Import other Shift Worker shifts and view them all within the one app\n- No in-app purchases!\n- No ads!"

      "label": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nGet Started\n• Interactive tutorial project\n• Keep each manuscript and supporting materials in a self-contained project\n• Import Word, RTF, Final Draft and plain text files\n• Easily split imported text into separate sections\n\nGet Writing\n• Write your manuscript in sections of any size\n• View all sections as a single text using the “Draft Navigator” (iPad only)\n• Quickly navigate sections using the “binder” sidebar\n• Format with fonts and presets\n• Comments, footnotes, links and highlights\n• Simple bullets and lists\n• Insert images\n• Pinch-zoom to resize text\n• Full-screen mode (iPad only)\n• Typewriter scrolling mode keeps typed text center-screen (iPad only)\n• Write a screenplay using scriptwriting mode\n• Live word and character counts\n• Set word and character count targets\n• Find and replace\n• Customizable keyboard row provides quick-access buttons for formatting, navigation and punctuation\n• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for external keyboard users\n• Dark mode\n\nFind Your Structure\n• Write in any order and reorganize later\n• Write a synopsis for any text section and see it in the outline\n• Expand, collapse and drill down into sections of your project\n• Rearrange sections as index cards on the corkboard (iPad only)\n• Project-wide search\n• Track ideas using labels and status\n• Apply custom icons to your sections\n\nRefer to Research\n• Import research material such as image, PDF and media files\n• View research files or other sections right alongside your writing (iPad only)\n• Every section has its own notes area for jotting down ideas\n• Supports multi-tasking split screen mode (supported devices only)\n\nShare Your Work\n• Compile to a single document for sharing or printing\n• Use different formatting in your exported or printed document\n• Export to Word, RTF, Final Draft, PDF or plain text\n• Convert rich text to Markdown for sharing with Markdown apps\n• Create and email zipped backups of your projects\n\nWork Anywhere\n• Use Dropbox to sync between devices and with the macOS and Windows versions of Scrivener*\n• Copy projects between devices via iTunes\n\n* Requires a Dropbox account (not compatible with iCloud).\n\nSUPPORT\nYou can contact us at ios.support@literatureandlatte.com, visit our forums at http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum, or find us @scrivenerapp on Twitter."

The app itself does not store any hint to the actual cipher or key size.\n• Uses a randomly generated 'salt' combined with the Master password. Salt helps to protect from off-line dictionary attacks.\n• The key to open the data file is created by combining your master password with the 512-bit 'salt'. The result is hashed 1000 times by SHA-256. Repetitive hashing makes a brute force attack more difficult.\n• Supports auto destruction of the data file after a predefined number of unsuccessful unlocks have been tried.\n\nFor more info see http://www.awallet.org/\n\nIf you like this App, rate it in the App Store.

      "label": "iBend Pipe is the best conduit bending applicaiton on an iPhone, it helps you bend it right...the first time.  \n\nIt calculates the following bends using English or Metric measurements so you don’t have to:\n\n    -Offsets Bends (specify towards an obstruction or away from an obstruction)\n    -Rolling Offsets Bends  (specify towards an obstruction or away from an obstruction)\n    -Parallel Offset Adjustment\n    -3-Bend Saddles\n    -4-Bend Saddles\n    -Segment Bends\n    -90° Bends\n    -Back to Back 90° Bends\n    -Kicked 90°s Bends\n    -Compound 90° Bends around a Round Obstruction\n    -Compound 90° Bends around a Square Obstruction\n    -Compound 90° Bends around a Rectangular Obstruction\n\n+ HOW DOES IT WORK?\nSimply slide your finger to set measurements and results are updated instantly.  There is no need to navigate through multiple screens just to get a measurement.  Easy and intuitive to use, and measurement are displayed in big font to make it easy to read.\n\n+FAST ONE SCREEN CALCULATIONS\nSimple one screen calculations that show results \"live\" and on the fly as you slide your finger to enter values in.\n\n+ACCURATE CALCULATIONS\nCenterline bending radius - based calculations are also available.  These calculations offer greater accuracy when compared to bending multiplier methods.  Preposition your bends automatically.  All bends take shrink into account so you don't have to do any math.  What's faster - bending it twice or bending it right the first time?\n\n+PROTRACTOR FUNCTION INCLUDED\nUse the included protractor function to measure the angle as you bend.  Angle will be fed directly from your input screen to save you time.\n\n+BENDER PROFILES\nAlmost 100 different bender/pipe combinations included.  You have the ability to tweak or completely modify any of the combinations to match your bender on the field.\n\n+ WHO IS IT FOR?\nIf you consider yourself a craftsman that takes pride in his work, iBend Pipe is for you.  If other \"sparkies\" come to you when they have a difficult bend, this is for you.  If you want to have a smaller \"bone\"  pile, this is for you.  If you can write your name in conduit, this is for you.  From, a  1st year inside wireman apprentice to a seasoned “old timer” this app will save you time and material.\n\nInput fractions instead of converting to decimals and get results in fractions.\n\nThanks for all the great reviews, if you have any suggestions:\nsupport@ibendpipe.com"

We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase."

      "label": "CalenGoo gives you a fast and easy way to access and modify your Google Calendar with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. It can also be used when you have no Internet connection, using the cached data. Changes are saved and uploaded the next time you are connected.\n\nThe calendar view is similar to the web view of Google Calendar. Events are displayed using the same calendar colors that you use in your Google Calendar, even Google's event colors are supported (please see http://www.calengoo.com/cc ). It also recognizes which calendars are visible and which are hidden. So the view should match the view of your Google Calendar as much as possible. \n\nCalenGoo also has a month view similar to that of Google Calendar. It can be zoomed and panned to quickly get an overview over the events of a month. Zooming the month is done by using the two-finger-zoom gesture that you know from Safari and the photo application. A double tap opens the tapped day.\n\nIt also supports the same kinds of recurrence rules as Google Calendar and displays recurring events correctly even when you are offline or scroll far into the future.\n\nYou can also use Google Calendar's feature to invite people to events and see their status (accepted, declined, maybe, no answer). They will get an invitation email with links to e.g. accept or decline the invitation.\n\nGoogle Calendar has an integrated task list, called Google Tasks. Tasks with a due date are displayed on the corresponding days of the calendar. CalenGoo can do the same, it can sync this list, display your tasks in the calendar views and in a list view and it even makes your tasks available offline. You can edit and add tasks and the changes will be synced with Google Tasks.\n\nYou either need a (free) Google Calendar account to use this app or you can use it with your iOS calendars. However using it with Google Calendar has a few advantages.\n\nTo get more information, screenshots and a tutorial, please go to http://www.calengoo.com\n\nIf you have any problems or suggestions, please send an email to calengoo@dgunia.de or take a look at CalenGoo's support website to get help.\n\nIf you think the font is too small and hard to read, you can increase the font size of all calendar views in the settings under \"Settings\", \"Display and Use\".\n\nFeatures ( http://www.calengoo.com ):\n\n- Drag&drop to quickly copy and move events\n- Templates to quickly create similar events again. They can even be combined, e.g. one template for the location of an event and another for the attendees\n- Print/PDF function to print the day, week, month or agenda view via AirPrint or to email it as a PDF file\n- Supports the same recurrence rules as Google Calendar\n- Supports Google Calendar's event colors when syncing via OAuth2\n- Icons can be assigned to Google Calendar events\n- Date/time can be entered using the iOS wheels or by using a keypad\n- Fast search function\n- Show/edit iOS calendars in addition to Google calendars (or instead of Google calendars)\n- Sync with Google Tasks and iOS Reminders\n- Reminders can be snoozed and they can be (optionally) repeated every minute\n- Birthdays and anniversaries of your contacts can be displayed\n- Zoomable month view, which can be configured to scroll horizontally (month by month) or vertically (week by week)\n- Events can be linked to contacts\n- Floating events and completable events\n- Photos and PDF files can be created and attached to events (via Google Drive)\n- Calendar selection bar to quickly show and hide single calendars\n- The location of an event can be opened with Apple Maps, Google Maps, Navigon, TomTom, Skobbler, Sygic, iGo or Waze\n- View/edit calendars that are shared with others via Google Calendar\n- Many configuration options to change the way the app looks and works"

      "label": "iCircuit is the premier iPad and iPhone app for designing and experimenting with circuits and Arduinos. Its advanced simulation engine can handle both analog and digital circuits and features realtime always-on analysis. It is the perfect companion to students, hobbyists, and engineers.\n\nYou use it as you would any CAD program: you add elements, connect them together, and set their properties.\n\nBut iCircuit is unlike other CAD programs because it is always simulating. It's just like working with the real circuit. You do not stop to take a measurement or spend a lot of time configuring reports. Instead, you just play with the circuit as you normally would, with the power on!\n\nThere are over 70 elements you can use to build your circuits. The app has everything from a programmable Arduino, to simple resistors, to switches, to MOSFETS, to digital gates.\n\nThe app features a multimeter that you use to probe around the circuit to instantly read voltages and currents. If you want to see how a value changes over time, then you can add values to the built-in oscilloscope. The scope can simultaneously track many signals over time and features a touch interface to control the total time displayed and stacked and unstacked modes to easily compare signals. The scope can also display the Fourier transform of any signal so that you can see the performance of filters.\n\nSupported elements include:\n\n• Programmable Arduino using a subset of the C programming language\n• Signal generators, Voltage sources, Current sources, and Dependent sources\n• Resistors, Capacitors, and Inductors\n• Manual SPST/SPDT and DPST/DPDT Switches, Push buttons, and Relays\n• LEDs, Diodes, BJ Transistors, and MOSFETs\n• Audio simulation with Speakers, Microphones, Buzzers, DC Motors, and LEDs\n• ADCs, and DACs\n• Logic gates: AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR\n• JK and D Flip-flops\n• 38 7400 series digital parts \n• 78xx and LM317 voltage regulators\n• 7-segment display and driver\n• Antenna with simulated AM and FM signals\n\nYou can also create sub circuits to introduce new elements and componentize your designs.\n\nNo matter your skill set, you'll be playing with circuits in no time with iCircuit."

      "label": "Congratulations! You’ve just discovered the app that perfects the process of improved attention and focus. Old science has taught us new ways to unlock the power of your brain to stay focused and attentive, even on tasks where it feels nearly impossible. With this app you will experience consistent increases in: \n\n\t-Sustained attention \n\t-Increased focus\n\t-Consistent on-task behavior\n\nYou will become less distracted and more productive, even on the most boring of tasks. \n\nOld Science + New Technology = Earned Success \nNearly 50 years ago, researchers found that using random, audio beeps on a tape recorder (beeper tape) helped test subjects stay focused better than others who:\n   -Depended on another person to prompt them to stay on task \n   -Relied upon reward systems as incentive\n   -Used medication exclusively\n\nDevelop Self-Regulation \nOriginal Beeper App™, developed by a licensed mental health provider is designed to allow you to assess your own level of attention on any given task and to record these results. \n\nThis is important because research shows that a person who can self-monitor their attentiveness and focus, whether through using a beep tape or some other cueing device, will consistently increase in on-task behavior, accuracy and performance. \n\nSelf-regulation strategies are proven to be effective procedures for increasing on-task behavior above and beyond the gains typically associated with medications or other external methods. \n\n\n\nFlexible and Customizable \nYou can set the timer, sound and frequency of your beeper prompts to be exactly suited to your personal needs. You will quickly and easily determine the best settings for you. \n \nUse at School \nOriginal Beeper App™ is custom made for school implementation as well. It does not interfere with a teacher’s lesson, and it does not require constant teacher involvement to manage off-task behaviors. Lastly, since Original Beeper App™ is completely customizable for many situations that require sustained on-task behavior, it is the most effective resource for supporting on-task behavior in the real world, all over the world.    \n \nPossible Applications of Original Beeper App™\n1.     Complete chores at home more quickly\n2.     Independently focus on homework\n3.     Maintain clear attention on work projects\n4.     Get through college courses with confidence \n5.     Work quietly in classroom setting (any grade) \n6.     Apply your best effort on any other situation at school, work or home when sustained focus is expected.\n\n\nWhat Users have already experienced Using Original Beeper App -\n\nThe beeps feel like guardrails keeping focus steadily flowing between the lines. If having a day where they are more distracted, increasing the frequency of the beeps tightens the guardrails. \n\nThe randomness of the beeps (at any frequency) is helpful because it prevents the mind from finding a pattern and coasting. It’s like driving on a curvy road instead of a straight one. \n\nThe beeps help users automatically check in and adjust their focus. If their thoughts are drifting out of the lane, the beep brings them right back where they need to be to stay on-task. \n\n\n*NEVER USE WHEN DRIVING/OPERATING ANY VEHICLE/ MACHINERY\n\n\nvisit originalbeeperapp.com for complete information"

How about not opening Safari? Yes, you can even switch engines in Spotlight with shortcut and redirect to Safari automatically.\n\n◆ URL Scheme: xSearch not only supports website engines, but also supports URL Scheme, for example: search `twapp apple` in Safari (or Spotlight) will redirect to Twitter app (if it's installed) and search `apple` automatically.\n\n◆ Syncing all your engines across your devices via iCloud.\n\n◆ Export and Import engines JSON file, this let you backup your engines or share engines with other users.\n\n◆ Edit engines in JSON.\n\n◆ Use share extension to search any text via xSearch.\n\n!!!

SigTrax expands this resource by supplying tools that allow signal trackers to find the origin of signals faster with more accurate results.\n\nSIMPLIFY THE TRACKING PROCESS\nThe advent of mobile smart devices allows us to have tools that before were either non-existent or like the signal trackers collection of papers, maps and marking instruments, unwieldy to carry and use. With SigTrax, manually handling maps, plotting intersection points and determining a route to reach an intersection point is eliminated, simplifying searches resulting in faster and more accurate results.\n\nBEARINGS AND CROSSPOINTS™\nBearings are lines from a starting coordinate toward a compass heading as an indication of the approximate direction of a signal.  Bearings can be entered into SigTrax in multiple ways, selectively viewed, edited or deleted.  Bearing collections can be archived then retrieved at a later time, vital when tracking signals over long time periods.\n\nCrosspoints, locations where bearing lines intersect, are automatically managed\nwhen bearings are added, deleted or edited. \n\nDriving maps complete with text and voice routing instructions direct the user to a Crosspoint location.\n\nEASY TO USE\nThe SigTrax user interface was designed to be simple and easy to use in less than ideal conditions.  SigTrax can be customized to individual preferences and needs using the Settings function.  A complete User Guide is included for quick reference.\n\nSigTrax+ OPTIONAL FEATURES\nSigTrax+ optional purchasable features expand the signal tracking toolkit.\n\nSigShare™ allows bearings and archives to be displayed in a large format such as Google Earth, ideal for presentations.\n\nDataTrax™ is a smart interface that automatically inserts and plots bearing generated from external systems such as Doppler.\n\nThe SigTrax website details DataTrax features and requirement.\n\nTraxTeam™ allows cooperative hunting, a foundation of signal tracking, that greatly extends the possibility of a successful and timely hunt, vital in emergency situations.\nMultiple trackers form a TraxTeam™ instantaneously sharing bearing information with the hunt group.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\nRequires IOS device with GPS and internet access to obtain map images.\n\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nCheck the SigTrax web site to discover the SigTrax difference.\nBe sure to explore the video series and User Guide to learn more about the benefits of signal tracking with SigTrax.\n\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\nSigTrax offers auto-renewing subscription as in-app purchases to access TraxTeam.\nTraxTeam 3 Month is a three-month access to TraxTeam.\nTraxTeam One Year is a one-year access to TraxTeam.\n\nPlease read about the auto-renewing TraxTeam subscriptions before purchasing.\nPayment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.\nSubscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to then the user's Account Settings after purchase.\nAny unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to a product.\nPlease review the TraxTeam terms-of-use policy: www.sigtrax.com/tos.html and our privacy policy at www.sigtrax.com#privacy."

      "label": "BlockyTime, A simple time logger no need to tap Start/Stop.\n\n### App Store Featured of 2016 in China & HongKong ###\n### Top 10 Productivity apps in China ###\n\nEverybody has his own demand on tracking time, but most people can't persist on it for long time because the traditional time-tracking App is way too professional, and it costs too much energy to use a stopwatch.\n\nBlockyTime is very different from traditional time-tracking App, it never needs to tap \"Start/Stop\". Months of research of users experience made us to work out a better tracking method which is more suitable for people's thinking. No worries to forget to start or stop stopwatch, just take a few seconds in leisure time, like playing game, select, tap, a whole day is tracked.\n\nWhen tracking time no longer has pressure but becomes relaxing, it solves the persistence problem easily. Even people don't has huge perseverance can be good at time management.\n\n[Features]\n• Super easy and rapid method to track time spending on every event\n• Custom classification of event\n    Not only by event type (eg. work, rest), but also by specific details (eg. Game, music), also by priorities (such as four quadrants)\n• Unique link of event and object, analyze event from different angle\n• Comment, record details of event like writing a diary\n• Statistics, analyze time occupation by pie or bar chart\n• Trend, check and compare events time spending in line chart by day or month\n• Goal, such as reach 10000h in 5 years on drawing\n• Backup data to iCloud or computer, never lose it\n• Selected color themes, and colorblind mode is added\n\n[Suitable for]\n• Students\n  Track time spending on subjects, analyze it and make a better study plan\n• Researchers\n  Track time spending on research, analyze and make a more efficient research plan\n• Managers\n  Who have many projects to do and needs to know time spending on every project\n• People with part-time jobs\n  Track time on every work and analyze earnings\n• Salespeople\n  Record time and frequency of contacting clients\n• New moms and dads\n  Get to know baby's regular life and make a plan to rest\n• People haven't know the value of time\n  Keep tracking time for a while, the statistics will shock you\n• People want to analyze time and make him better\n• People want to know what costs time\n• People are not satisfied with current situation, want to learn how to manage time and improve himself \n\n[Q & A]\nQ: Why named \"BlockyTime\"?\nA: Though time is continuous, for rapid tracking, we separate time into blocks by half an hour at the expense of accuracy. This period not only meets the need of statistics, but also is convenient for people to remember event.\n\nQ: Why make 30 minutes a block? This is not accurate.\nA: Statistics is meaningful only when people persist for a long time. Look at statistics in week or month, 30 minutes a blocks hardly make negative effects on analysis. Compared to spending more energy to make it accurate, track time quicker, take advantage of saved time on other things makes it better.\n\nQ: I have OCD, inaccuracy makes me uncomfortable.\nA: Just stand back and think about it, if you pursue the accuracy, after every time of record, should you add an event called \"Tracking time\"? Then it takes some time to track this one, so you have to record again, and then, endless loop…\n\nNever spend much time on tracking time, this is truly using time effectively.\n\n[Users' comments]\n“The most time-saving tool ever”\n“It makes me not to spend time on recording, reveals the essence of tracking. I must rate this truly efficient app”\n“One of my favourite time management/tracking apps!”\n“Very easy to use and intuitive”\n“Easiest time tracking tool I ever used”\n“Milestone app of time tracking” -- zhihu.com\n\nIf you like this app, just take one minute to rate it, we'll appreciate it!\n\n[Contact me]\nGot some ideas in your mind?

      "label": "‘Hand Tuber’ is a simple to use tubing offset calculator, and offers the field tubing specialist a handy tool to accurately place stainless instrument or copper tubing bend offsets in the field, utilising its in-built bender library and specialized calculations for both Metric and Imperial measurements.\n\nThis tool has been specifically developed to calculate for all bend angles, and not just 30°, 45°, 60°, and 90°, for those times where tubes are required to be run between obstacles such as beams, cable ladders, and pipework.\n\n‘Hand Tuber’ also allows you the benefit of being able to add your own specific Rotary Draw Tube Bender to the bender choices in the library.\n\nImperial and metric benders are included in the inbuilt bender library, and the calculator can be used with both inches and millimeters as a unit of measure with a high degree of accuracy.\n\nIn a Nutshell:\n\n•\tSeven common Tubing Offset calculations included in the program.\n•\tCan be used for most Rotary Draw type benders (Center Line Radius)\n•\tAll results are calculated by using the tube center and/or bender radius.\n•\tAll calculations are based on trigonometry formula giving precision.\n•\tHand Tuber can be set up for either inches or millimeters.\n•\tThe most common Imperial and Metric bender profiles are included.\n•\tAdd new benders in ‘Add Benders’, and build a new bender profile.\n•\tMaintains a History of your previous completed bend calculations.\n•\tHelp screens included for all bend offsets and are quickly accessible.\n•\tMost calculations are completed on a single screen.\n•\tHandy graphics show the calculation results as a visual reference.\n•\tAdjustment, Offset, and Seating Allowance reference charts included.\n•\tHandy standard calculator function within the app.\n•\tEase of navigation to switch pages quickly and directly.\n•\tAccess to Online Tubing Manual via a handy link from the app.\n\nSo what’s the bottom line:\n\nFast on screen calculations, no need to use ‘cast offs’ to find that bend position.\nHelps to save wastage and reduce that ‘Bone Pile’ or stock of ‘Future Bends’.\nSaves time in working out those common and tricky offsets quickly.\nFinds the answer when the ‘Measure then Bend’ technique won’t work.\nVery handy, fits in your pocket or bag on your mobile device.\n\nOffsets and Calculations Included in the Current Release:\n\nSimple Offset: \nThe simple offset calculates the position of the second bend in a standard 2 bend offset, based on the previous Pre-Bent angle and the offset required for any angle between 0° and 90°.\n\nPredictive Offset:\nThe predictive offset calculates the second bend in a standard 2 bend offset, based on the previous planned bend angle, and the required offset, before either bend in the offset has been bent for any angle between 0° and 90°.\n\nParallel Offset:\nThe parallel offset calculates the position adjustment of the bend in a parallel tube, by giving the +/- length needed in order to maintain a consistent spacing between tubes with a change in direction.\n\nLong Run Offset:\nThe Long Run Offset calculates the Slope Length and Bend Angle for long runs of tube with a fixed or known Offset and Run length.\n\nBack Bend Offset:\nThe Back Bend Offset calculates the bender 0° position, for a bend that folds back on itself at an angle greater than 90°. This is useful when running tube on beams and cross braces.\n\nJoint Offset:\nThe Joint offset calculates the measurements and offsets to aid in the positioning of an offset tube joint or connecter in a specific location, and gives the measurements to place the center of the joint.\n\nFall Calculation:\nThe Fall Calculator calculates the fall or Offset amount, over a set distance based on a fall ratio.\nThe usual fall minimum for tubing in instrumentation is 1:12 or 8.33%."

      "label": "One evening, after a very long week of shows we were sat in the office looking at the show times wishing the running times would work them selves out (we've all been there), it was at this moment this show timing app was created. Welcome to the future of show timing without multiple stop watches and reminder alarms. Now you can start your show with the press of one button and the app does the rest. With unlimited Acts and Intervals in any configuration that you like! , just set your show structure, tell it your interval duration(s) and away you go. \n\nShow StopWatch also handles separate in act timers and show stops, adjusting the running and playing times accordingly! Once you have completed a show you can then email the times with a simple button press or copy them your clipboard as well as storing them for later. \n\nThere is also the option to have pre show notifications for back stage calls and the same again in the interval so you don't have to spend all your time looking at the clock. The app will also run in the back ground of your phone if for what ever reason you need to use your phone for something else (certainly not facebook, for those long scenes with no cues) while its running. \n\nThis app was created by stage managers for stage managers, it is currently being used by a number of productions and companies including UK Tours, West End shows and Repertory Theatres. It will continue to be a working development so any thing you come across that you think ‘it would be great if’ please don't hesitate to get in contact! It became apparent while testing how tiny details make a difference to everyone so we have tried to incorporate them all, for example; the interval timer shows both time elapsed and remaining, and is in green until you start over running when it goes red (because how often do you go up on time), and the ability to access times so far, for those quiet moments where you are able to start the show report early!\n\nThis app has not been made to replace your note book, still write times down if you get a chance, its simply to try and make life easier at the end of the show! Have a play, get to know it and let us know how you get on!\n\nIf you want to get in contact email me at jackrlord@gmail.com"

Especially useful if you need to estimate big objects where standard tape measure can't be applied (e.g. measure the height of a tree or building) and where the accuracy is not critical. \n\nQuick Guide on startup contains information about app calibration and tips for proper measurements. If height of the camera is unknown you can calibrate with known length (sheet of paper, width of  road, etc) or height (person's height, fence, etc)\n\nAccuracy of the app depends on the way the app is used: Supported-Mode (e.g. using Tripod) , where your device is fixed at known height,  provides much  better accuracy compared to  FreeHand-Mode due to stable device position and proper rotation.\n\nAccuracy estimation is also shown when measurement result is presented.\nMillimeters units are used in the app now."

Please don't put questions or suggestions in a review -- there's no way for me to reply directly to you.\n\nIf your schedule varies from week to week, keeping track of your working days can be a chore, and it’s often difficult to quickly figure out when you’ll be on-duty weeks or months in the future.\n\nScheduler to the rescue!  Designed for public-service employees such as police officers, firefighters and health-care workers — anyone who works an unusual but predictable schedule — Scheduler always shows your schedule for the next six years from “today.”  Common shift schedules are built-in, such as the “Berkeley” (a.k.a. “California”), “48-96” and “Dupont,” but you can easily change them or create other repeating schedules covering any number of days.  See the screenshots (here and on the web site) for some examples.  And there’s even a “Doofus” mode for showing irregular schedules (e.g., health-care workers).\n\nIf your spouse/partner works a shift schedule, too, you can have that entirely different rotation appear on the calendar with yours.  This will help you organize family activities such as vacations and day-care.\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Displays your schedule for the next six years, including vacations and holidays.\n• Perfect for public-service workers such as police officers and firefighters.\n• Records trades (swaps). Tracks hours earned or owed on a person-by-person basis.\n• Formats emails for sending out trade offers and approval requests.\n• Maintains a record of your OT hours.\n• Tracks your vacation time: automatically computes hours earned and shows weekly balances.  Also records and totals sick time.\n• Logs “events” with date, time and location — you can edit the title, text, and location details when you have time.\n• Overlays an entirely separate schedule for your spouse/partner to help you coordinate your lives.\n• Adjustable colors for shifts, vacations, Kelly days, holidays, etc.\n• Mark special days such as Kellys, paydays, “early” shifts, or training days.\n• Countdown to retirement.\n• Extensive Help pages for every feature and screen; indexed.\n\nNotes:\n1. You *can* enter a custom schedule.\n2. You *can* set the text that appears on each day.\n3. You *can* enter very long rotations.\n4. You *can* superimpose text to mark special days on the calendar.\n5. You *can* set bi-weekly repeating events (e.g., for paydays)\n6. Visit my website (link below) for help and contact info.\n\n8. Scheduler is complicated. Please don't give up and leave a bad review -- I can't help you that way. Contact me at sched@buddy.com (or using the in-app email button on the Help screen) with questions or comments. I reply to all emails immediately (or within a few hours if I'm sleeping or traveling, which isn't often). If you didn't hear from me promptly, it means there was failure in the \"Tubes.\"  Please try again to contact me.\n\nAttention FDNY (firemen): you'll find my other app, FDNY, more useful for FD New York.\n\nAttention: UK bus and train drivers: you might find my other app, UK Rota, more useful."

      "label": "GSDfaster helps you get stuff done faster & be more productive. \n\nGSDfaster empowers you with tools and a thinking process to offload your ideas and stuff into a trusted source for delayed processing. GSDfaster at the core is a GTD (Getting Things Done) method developed by David Allen. It takes something that's Implicit and moves it into an Explicit state. GSDfaster finally helps you focus using an in-built Tomato Timer Technique to generate results.\n\n*** MEET ERNEST ***\n\nMy name is Ernest and I built GSDfaster to solve my own productivity woes back in 2005. GSDfaster is a unique app maintained by me (not a company) out of sheer love for productivity. Unlike companies that build apps; they come and go. As a consumer it is hard to invest time and resources into short lived products. GSDfaster stands the test of time since its maintained by an individual, not a company.\n\n*** PRIVACY MATTERS ***\n\n​My philosophy behind incognito product development is that privacy matters. When you meet a new person do you reveal all your inner personal story? Of course not. As an experienced software engineer I know how other companies store your data, in plain text; unencrypted on their servers. You only ever find out when they have a data breach.\n\n*** RUNS OFF THE GRID ***\n\nHave you tried to run your other apps offline or in poor internet connectivity environments? Most will fail. GSDfaster excels. This is an app you can always rely on to be available for you with or without an internet connection.\n\n*** CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP ***\n\nGSDfaster is 5 x cheaper than a burger or your morning mocha. And you have it for life. This app will serve you a lifetime. With lifetime free support.\n\n*** FREE PRODUCTIVITY EDUCATION ***\n\nI blog here http://www.gsdfaster.com/blog/ on productivity and how to use GSDfaster app to make the most of your investment. Please spend some time reviewing this section and leave a comment.\n\nI love feedback so please email me at ernest@gsdfaster.com or a send a tweet https://twitter.com/gsdfaster"

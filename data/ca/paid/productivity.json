Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store.

Sometimes it's not easy to see your upcoming shift schedule very clearly, especially if your shifts don't fall into the traditional working week. Shift Worker solves this problem and turns the frustrating task of entry into a quick and easy experience.\n\nShift Worker allows you to create your own types of shifts by combining visually-attractive icons with letters/numbers so that they can be easily identified at a glance. By including a range of icons (such as suns and stars for day and night shifts) in a variety of colors, any combination is possible for all types of shifts.\n\nEntering shifts can be done quickly by simply selecting a type of shift and tapping on each date it occurs. An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!\n\nIn addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. \n\nShift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date. Notes can be used anytime additional information needs to be added to a date.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Create a virtually unlimited amount of shift types\n- Enter shifts on the calendar months in advance in seconds\n- Add your rotation and automatically fill the calendar in a few simple steps\n- Show friends and family shifts using multiple calendars\n- View the calendar in timeline format to see your shift flow at a glance\n- Create colored personalized notes for any date on the calendar\n- Include week of year or week 1/2 alternating pattern on calendar\n- Jump to any month by using the \"Goto\" button\n- Save a month's worth of shifts to your background\n- Share your shifts to others via email, MMS, Facebook or Twitter\n- Import other Shift Worker shifts and view them all within the one app\n- No in-app purchases!\n- No ads!"

You can add notes, tag it, schedule it, and break it down into smaller steps.\n\n• Your Projects\nCreate a Project for any big goal, then add the to-dos to reach it. Use headings to structure your list as you outline your plan. There’s also a place to jot down your notes, and a deadline to keep you on schedule.\n\n• Your Areas\nCreate an Area for each sphere of your life, such as Work, Family, Finance, and so on. This keeps everything neatly organized, and helps you see the big picture as you set your plans in motion.\n\n• Your Plan\nEverything on your schedule is neatly laid out in the Today and Upcoming lists, which show your to-dos and calendar events. Each morning, see what you planned for Today and decide what you want to do. The rest is down to you :)\n\n\nMORE THINGS TO LOVE\n\nAs you dive deeper, you’ll find Things packed with helpful features.

A great example is the Share extension, which allows you to create to-dos with content from other apps, such as a link to a website you want to get back to.\n\nYou can also enjoy a beautiful dark mode at sunset, connect your calendars, add widgets to your home screen, create to-dos via Siri, import from Reminders—Things can do it all! There’s even Shortcuts integration if you want to automate your workflows.\n\n\nMADE FOR APPLE WATCH\n\nThings comes with a great app for Apple Watch. Just raise your wrist to glance at your Today list, mark to-dos complete as you go, and dictate new ones on the fly—all synced instantly with your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\n\n\nAWARD-WINNING DESIGN\n\nMade in Stuttgart, with two Apple Design Awards to its name, Things is a fine example of German engineering: designed not only to look fantastic, but to be perfectly functional as well. Every detail is thoughtfully considered, then polished to perfection.\n\n“It’s like the unicorn of productivity tools: deep enough for serious work, surprisingly easy to use, and gorgeous enough to enjoy staring at.”\n—Apple\n\n\nGET THINGS TODAY\n\nWhatever it is you want to accomplish in life, Things can help you get there.

Using one of the supported OBD adapters you can read trouble codes or display sensor values in realtime, check the current state of the DPF in your car or register a new battery after replacement. BimmerLink even allows you to remotely control the exhaust flap or mute the Active Sound Design in your car.\n\nREAD AND CLEAR TROUBLE CODES\nDiagnose your car as would otherwise be possible only by your Service Partner. In contrast to generic OBD apps that read emission related errors only, BimmerLink allows you to read and clear trouble codes from ALL control units in your car.\n\nDISPLAY REALTIME SENSOR VALUES\nBimmerLink provides a big selection of values like oil temperature or boost pressure. Keep an eye on all the important parameters of your car with a personalized dashboard.\n\nEXHAUST FLAP REMOTE CONTROL*\nTake control over the exhaust flap in your car and decide yourself, whether it should be closed or open.\n\nACTIVE SOUND DESIGN**\nIf you do not like the artificial engine sound generated in your car, just mute the Active Sound Design with BimmerLink.\n\nSOUND TUNING***\nThe “Sound Tuning” option allows you to disable the “exhaust burble“ in cars equipped with the S55 engine (M2 Competition, M3, M4).\n\nDPF REGENERATION****\nBimmerLink allows you to check the current state of the diesel particulate filter in your car. Find out when the last regeneration took place or how much ash has accumulated in the filter and start a regeneration with the touch of a button.\n\nBATTERY REGISTRATION\nIf you want to replace the battery in your car, this has to be registered in the engine control unit and BimmerLink allows you to do this yourself now.\n\nPARKING BRAKE SERVICE MODE\nBimmerLink allows you to activate the service mode for the electromechanical parking brake.\n\nSERVICE RESET\nReset the service display in your car after carrying out maintenance work like a brake pad replacement or an engine oil change.\n\nREQUIRED ACCESSORIES\nTo use the app one of the supported Bluetooth or WiFi OBD adapters or cables is required.

      "label": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

It consists of a deck of cards, each one containing a vague or ambiguous phrase that can be used to solve a problem intuitively, by breaking conventional thinking patterns and interpreting it from a new perspective.\n\nThis app aims to translate the essence of the original cards deck into a digital experience, making it accessible to a wider audience. It contains the original edition, as well as the newer decks, presenting them in a sleek minimalist style inspired by the original design of the cards. The user interface is simple and straightforward, built to encourage creative or design thinking without distracting from the process. The home screen widget on iOS 14 allows reading a new quote every day without opening the application. The Apple Watch version can run independently without needing the app installed on your iPhone.\n\nWith VoiceOver, anyone with a visual impairment can have the Oblique Strategies phrase read to them. Long tap the screen to have the last sentence read to you again. Also, you can shake the iPhone for a new sentence."

Salt helps to protect from off-line dictionary attacks.\n• The key to open the data file is created by combining your master password with the 512-bit 'salt'.

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nGet Started\n• Interactive tutorial project\n• Keep each manuscript and supporting materials in a self-contained project\n• Import Word, RTF, Final Draft and plain text files\n• Easily split imported text into separate sections\n\nGet Writing\n• Write your manuscript in sections of any size\n• View all sections as a single text using the “Draft Navigator” (iPad only)\n• Quickly navigate sections using the “binder” sidebar\n• Format with fonts and presets\n• Comments, footnotes, links and highlights\n• Simple bullets and lists\n• Insert images\n• Pinch-zoom to resize text\n• Full-screen mode (iPad only)\n• Typewriter scrolling mode keeps typed text center-screen (iPad only)\n• Write a screenplay using scriptwriting mode\n• Live word and character counts\n• Set word and character count targets\n• Find and replace\n• Customizable keyboard row provides quick-access buttons for formatting, navigation and punctuation\n• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for external keyboard users\n• Dark mode\n\nFind Your Structure\n• Write in any order and reorganize later\n• Write a synopsis for any text section and see it in the outline\n• Expand, collapse and drill down into sections of your project\n• Rearrange sections as index cards on the corkboard (iPad only)\n• Project-wide search\n• Track ideas using labels and status\n• Apply custom icons to your sections\n\nRefer to Research\n• Import research material such as image, PDF and media files\n• View research files or other sections right alongside your writing (iPad only)\n• Every section has its own notes area for jotting down ideas\n• Supports multi-tasking split screen mode (supported devices only)\n\nShare Your Work\n• Compile to a single document for sharing or printing\n• Use different formatting in your exported or printed document\n• Export to Word, RTF, Final Draft, PDF or plain text\n• Convert rich text to Markdown for sharing with Markdown apps\n• Create and email zipped backups of your projects\n\nWork Anywhere\n• Use Dropbox to sync between devices and with the macOS and Windows versions of Scrivener*\n• Copy projects between devices via iTunes\n\n* Requires a Dropbox account (not compatible with iCloud).\n\nSUPPORT\nYou can contact us at ios.support@literatureandlatte.com, visit our forums at http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum, or find us @scrivenerapp on Twitter."

      "label": "Voice Dream Writer helps everyone write better: Text-to-speech proofreading reduces mistakes, phonetic and meaning search help you use the right words, and an active outline helps you organize and improve the structure of your writing.\n\n• Featured in the US App Store Education Collection.\n\n• \"Voice Dream Writer's technically designed for people with reading disabilities, but it's useful for just about anyone who needs a little help proofing.\" - Lifehacker\n\nText-To-Speech Proofreading. Professional proofreaders recommend reading out loud as the best way to catch mistakes. Like a personal proofreader, Voice Dream Writer reads your writing using text-to-speech, so you can easily spot awkward sentences, grammatical errors and typos. Also, it can read words and sentences as you type or voice dictate. This way, you can type faster because you no longer have to look up to check the text you just wrote. \n\nWord Finder. Voice Dream Writer helps you find the right words using phonetic search and meaning search. For example, search for \"inuf\" phonetically, and you will find \"enough\", and search for \"Fast Africa Cat\" by meaning and you will find \"Cheetah.\" Word Finder also shows you the dictionary definition of a word as you type without you having to select anything or open another program. \n\nOutline. As you write, Voice Dream Writer automatically creates an outline of headings, paragraphs and sentences. The Outline helps you structure your document better by giving you an always-on overview. You can also quickly navigate to a section in a long document without endless scrolling. Finally, you can drag and drop elements in the Outline to organize your writing.

Stay in the flow when it's time to type a number or symbol or you need to move around, because the needed keys are right there in the main layout.  And we use the full width, not just the middle, to display word suggestions.\n\nErgonomics aren't sacrificed either.  The main keys are big enough to type fast, and autocorrect is fine-tuned for catching common finger misses.  You'll find using Typefinity is almost like having a full bluetooth keyboard -- without the weight and bulk!\n\n  • Numbers and punctuation in one layout, where your fingers remember.\n  • Cursor keys for easy, precise movement by letter or word.\n  • Dedicated keys for accented characters in your language.\n  • Option switch for typing other symbols and accented characters.\n  • Full autocorrect in all supported languages, showing more than three words.\n  • “Short” layout option for more screen visibility in landscape orientation.\n  • Swipe input (trace words with your finger), and flick up on number and punctuation keys for shifted versions.\n  • Numeric and calculator modes.\n  • Privacy friendly (“full access” is NOT required for most functionality, including autocorrect).\n\nLanguages / layouts supported: English (US and British / UK / Aus, Dvorak), Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French (France and Canada), German, Italian, Norwegian (Bokmål), Polish, Portuguese (Portugal and Brazil), Romanian, Spanish, and Swedish."

You can also tap 'save settings' to store your own preferences.\n\nThe extension also hides the ads that are inserted in your search results.\n\nThe app is open source and doesn't collect any data.

There is no need to navigate through multiple screens just to get a measurement.  Easy and intuitive to use, and measurement are displayed in big font to make it easy to read.\n\n+FAST ONE SCREEN CALCULATIONS\nSimple one screen calculations that show results \"live\" and on the fly as you slide your finger to enter values in.\n\n+ACCURATE CALCULATIONS\nCenterline bending radius - based calculations are also available.  These calculations offer greater accuracy when compared to bending multiplier methods.  Preposition your bends automatically.  All bends take shrink into account so you don't have to do any math.  What's faster - bending it twice or bending it right the first time?\n\n+PROTRACTOR FUNCTION INCLUDED\nUse the included protractor function to measure the angle as you bend.  Angle will be fed directly from your input screen to save you time.\n\n+BENDER PROFILES\nAlmost 100 different bender/pipe combinations included.  You have the ability to tweak or completely modify any of the combinations to match your bender on the field.\n\n+ WHO IS IT FOR?\nIf you consider yourself a craftsman that takes pride in his work, iBend Pipe is for you.  If other \"sparkies\" come to you when they have a difficult bend, this is for you.  If you want to have a smaller \"bone\"  pile, this is for you.  If you can write your name in conduit, this is for you.  From, a  1st year inside wireman apprentice to a seasoned “old timer” this app will save you time and material.\n\nInput fractions instead of converting to decimals and get results in fractions.\n\nThanks for all the great reviews, if you have any suggestions:\nsupport@ibendpipe.com"

We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase."

      "label": "TaskTask is the easiest way to get your Outlook or Gmail tasks onto your iPhone! TaskTask directly connects with your Office 365 Business, Exchange on-premises, or Google tasks to keep your full task list in sync between Outlook and your device. Everything is tracked, include all the advanced properties you can see in Outlook. Best of all TaskTask includes flagged items (email!) so you can see your complete task list on the go.\n\nUsing TaskTask, you can manage your to-do list, create tasks, set start/due dates, mark complete, assigning categories, change importance, set and receive reminders, and delete tasks. An Exchange Server or Office 365 account is required to synchronized tasks with Outlook. No additional software is necessary. TaskTask works with Gmail directly, although in a limited fashion.\n\nKey Features:\n- Simple interface, quickly create new tasks and mark tasks completed\n- Set task attributes, such as category, importance, start/due/complete dates, and notes\n- Synchronize your task list with your e-mail account (no hidden fees or software to download)\n- Quickly swipe to complete or delete a task \n- Easy set up with automatic configuration of your server\n- Drag-to-order your tasks, see the same order in Outlook\n- Recurring tasks and reminders\n- View attachments on your tasks and attach files from other apps\n\nHow is TaskTask better than Reminders?\n- See your task list how you prefer: organize by start date, due date, category, importance, or reminder date.\n- Reorder your tasks just by dragging them around\n- Full category support, including downloading your list of categories and colors from your Exchange Server.\n- See tasks in the same order as Outlook's To Do Bar\n- Task filters: filter out tasks in the future or tasks you don't want to see on your mobile device\n- Flagged mail items: See the full list of items from your To Do Bar, not just tasks\n- Quick Task Entry: Type a list of task subjects quickly in one space, and TaskTask automatically creates the set of tasks\n- Mark tasks as private: Hide tasks from others who have visibility to your task list\n\nNote: To synchronize your tasks with Outlook, your email account must be on a compatible Microsoft Exchange Server or Office 365 Business account. Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 and newer versions are supported, although there may be additional factors that prevent TaskTask from working with your server. \n\nIf you are using Mail.app or Microsoft Outlook 2011 (Macintosh) with your email account in \"Exchange\" mode, TaskTask is compatible with your server. Because there are specific requirements for your server, please verify with your e-mail administrator that your server meets these requirements before purchasing this app."

Forget books, calculators, compasses, ancient saddle layout procedures, laptops, expensive CAD programs, mathematics or internet access to figure out how to make that perfect saddle joint.\n\nPipe Saddle Layout Calculator is easy. Pipe Saddle Layout Calculator provides the offset layout dimensions for that perfect pipe joint. This calculator works with any size pipe, any angle of intersection, and any wall thickness of pipe. User enters: main pipe, branch pipe, wall thickness (this app considers wall thickness, you don't want to leave too much metal, or take too much off) and branch angle. The calculator does the rest.\n\nThis calculator produces an on the fly ordinate table of the offsets. The beauty of this app is that it also produces full size pattern templates, so you don't have to measure and layout all of the work points. Now you can print out your pipe pattern templates for any size and any angle intersection. This version outputs patterns configured for an 8.5 X 11 (everyone has access to one of these), 11 X 17, and 24 X 36 printer sizes. So with this app and a 8.5 X 11 printer, the user can still produce any size pipe coping pattern.\n\nThe calculator is very versatile. Presently input and output is US based imperial and/or metric. Output is feet, or feet and inches, decimal or fractions (to 1/32\"). This app has been updated to support metric solutions.\n\nUser can control how much cut line accuracy he/she wants by setting how many control points are desired (infinite amount, user can get 8 control points, i.e. every 45 degrees or 360 control points, i.e every degree, or more). Most books only give 8 or 16 control points. This app allows an infinite amount. For example, a 2\" pipe needs fewer control points than a 48\"."

It aims to help you live a productive and meaningful life, by enabling you to focus on the things that are most important to you.\n\n\nIKIRU IS VERSATILE\nUse it to create to do lists, shopping lists, take notes, store contact information, keep track of books to read, or movies to watch... or anything else you'd want to make a list for.\n\n\nIKIRU IS BEAUTIFUL\nWith a clean and easy to use design, choose from over 2000 icons to assign to your lists.\n\n\nIKIRU IS POWERFUL\n- create lists within lists\n\n- assign a due date and reminder to list items\n\n- view all items with a due date in one convenient timeline\n\n- add a photo to list items\n\n- drag and drop to sort list items, or automatically keep a list sorted alphabetically, by modification date, completion date, and more\n\n- easily copy or move items from one list to another\n\n- mark items incomplete to return them to their original position in the list (this makes lists easy to reuse)\n\n- send a list via email, and the receiver can import your list into their copy of Ikiru\n\n- view items with due dates on your Apple Watch\n\n\nIKIRU KEEPS YOUR DATA SAFE\n- automatically back up and sync lists between iOS devices using iCloud\n\n- use Touch ID or a custom passcode to protect your information\n\n\nIKIRU HAS PURPOSE\nThe word \"ikiru\" (ee-kee-roo) means \"to live\" in Japanese. It's also the title of an Akira Kurosawa film about a man who decides to do something meaningful with his life. Ikiru (the app) is my attempt at doing something meaningful with my life, and hopefully help others live meaningful and productive lives.\n\n\nIKIRU HAS HISTORY\nIn 2010 I released a list-making app called \"Paperless\". From busy moms to airplane pilots to people who needed a little help remembering things after suffering a brain injury, Paperless has been used by hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. Ikiru is built upon that legacy - incorporating the best ideas from Paperless, greatly improving upon them, and adding big features that people have requested.\n\n\nIKIRU NEEDS LOVE\nIf you find Ikiru useful, please rate and review it in the App Store. Thank you!"

Features include dynamic illustrations of each design, and the ability to share reports and spreadsheets through email.\n\nThis app is based upon the popular ASHRAE Duct Fitting Database desktop and web applications. The advantages of this mobile app are that you can easily use it out in the field to do quick duct pressure loss calculations, the inputs can be adjusted by touch, and installation is automatic. \n\nThe following is a partial list of features: \n\n1. You can create individual projects, each with unique input values and results. \n\n2. Each fitting has its own custom set of input parameters and results. \n\n3. You can easily change the minimum and maximum allowable values for all input parameters. \n\n4. It includes a useful search feature that allows you to type in a partial or full fitting code name to quickly retrieve it. \n\n5. It allows you to display and email two types of reports. The app reports also include a spreadsheet attachment that you can open on your desktop computer to do further analysis. \n\n6. The app displays inputs and results in both IP and SI units. \n\n7. Works on both the iPhone and iPad and adjusts its user interface according to the proper size screen.\n\nThe ASHRAE Duct Fitting Database application was designed by Carmel Software Corporation exclusively for ASHRAE."

Equipment location services\n\nIt also includes 2 bonus modules:\n\n1. The \"HVAC Equipment Locator\" has the same functionality as our stand-alone Locator app. It allows you to input information about all of your HVAC equipment, upload it to a remote web server (at www.carmelsoft.com/EL), and SAFELY share information about it with other technicians within your company. The equipment's GPS coordinates become its globally unique identifier, allowing you to input and retrieve information about it just by standing next to it.\n\n2.  The “HVAC Quick Load” module allows you to quickly perform rule-of-thumb heating and cooling load calcs based upon just inputting the building type, square area, and # of people. Please see the description located under the stand-alone \"HVAC Quick Load\" app for more details about it.\n\nThe benefits of using this app are:\n\n1. Great for use out in the field. Quickly size heating and cooling equipment, show the client, then email the results back to your office for further analysis.\n\n2. Show off your advanced on-screen reports to clients convincing them you are using cutting-edge technology\n\n3. Save time by inputting information in the field and then returning to your office to perform more in-depth analysis\n\nThis app was designed by Carmel Software Corporation, a 20-year old software design firm specializing in engineering analysis software applications geared toward engineers, architects, technicians, and home owners. In fact, our software powers the analysis capabilities of major Autodesk software tools such as Revit (The makers of AutoCAD).\n\nWe will continue to update this app based upon user feedback.  Please email us at info@carmelsoft.com for any comments.\n\nWe also offer training and tutorial videos at: www.carmelsoft.com/HVACLoadPlus."

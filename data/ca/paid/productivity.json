For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store.

Sometimes it's not easy to see your upcoming shift schedule very clearly, especially if your shifts don't fall into the traditional working week. Shift Worker solves this problem and turns the frustrating task of entry into a quick and easy experience.\n\nShift Worker allows you to create your own types of shifts by combining visually-attractive icons with letters/numbers so that they can be easily identified at a glance. By including a range of icons (such as suns and stars for day and night shifts) in a variety of colors, any combination is possible for all types of shifts.\n\nEntering shifts can be done quickly by simply selecting a type of shift and tapping on each date it occurs. An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!\n\nIn addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. \n\nShift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date. Notes can be used anytime additional information needs to be added to a date.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Create a virtually unlimited amount of shift types\n- Enter shifts on the calendar months in advance in seconds\n- Add your rotation and automatically fill the calendar in a few simple steps\n- Show friends and family shifts using multiple calendars\n- View the calendar in timeline format to see your shift flow at a glance\n- Create colored personalized notes for any date on the calendar\n- Include week of year or week 1/2 alternating pattern on calendar\n- Jump to any month by using the \"Goto\" button\n- Save a month's worth of shifts to your background\n- Share your shifts to others via email, MMS, Facebook or Twitter\n- Import other Shift Worker shifts and view them all within the one app\n- No in-app purchases!\n- No ads!"

      "label": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nGet Started\n• Interactive tutorial project\n• Keep each manuscript and supporting materials in a self-contained project\n• Import Word, RTF, Final Draft and plain text files\n• Easily split imported text into separate sections\n\nGet Writing\n• Write your manuscript in sections of any size\n• View all sections as a single text using the “Draft Navigator” (iPad only)\n• Quickly navigate sections using the “binder” sidebar\n• Format with fonts and presets\n• Comments, footnotes, links and highlights\n• Simple bullets and lists\n• Insert images\n• Pinch-zoom to resize text\n• Full-screen mode (iPad only)\n• Typewriter scrolling mode keeps typed text center-screen (iPad only)\n• Write a screenplay using scriptwriting mode\n• Live word and character counts\n• Set word and character count targets\n• Find and replace\n• Customizable keyboard row provides quick-access buttons for formatting, navigation and punctuation\n• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for external keyboard users\n• Dark mode\n\nFind Your Structure\n• Write in any order and reorganize later\n• Write a synopsis for any text section and see it in the outline\n• Expand, collapse and drill down into sections of your project\n• Rearrange sections as index cards on the corkboard (iPad only)\n• Project-wide search\n• Track ideas using labels and status\n• Apply custom icons to your sections\n\nRefer to Research\n• Import research material such as image, PDF and media files\n• View research files or other sections right alongside your writing (iPad only)\n• Every section has its own notes area for jotting down ideas\n• Supports multi-tasking split screen mode (supported devices only)\n\nShare Your Work\n• Compile to a single document for sharing or printing\n• Use different formatting in your exported or printed document\n• Export to Word, RTF, Final Draft, PDF or plain text\n• Convert rich text to Markdown for sharing with Markdown apps\n• Create and email zipped backups of your projects\n\nWork Anywhere\n• Use Dropbox to sync between devices and with the macOS and Windows versions of Scrivener*\n• Copy projects between devices via iTunes\n\n* Requires a Dropbox account (not compatible with iCloud).\n\nSUPPORT\nYou can contact us at ios.support@literatureandlatte.com, visit our forums at http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum, or find us @scrivenerapp on Twitter."

That's ok! You can trace or draw your own digitally or even on paper. Upload a pattern and get designing."

      "label": "TaskTask is the easiest way to get your Outlook or Gmail tasks onto your iPhone! TaskTask directly connects with your Office 365 Business, Exchange on-premises, or Google tasks to keep your full task list in sync between Outlook and your device. Everything is tracked, include all the advanced properties you can see in Outlook. Best of all TaskTask includes flagged items (email!) so you can see your complete task list on the go.\n\nUsing TaskTask, you can manage your to-do list, create tasks, set start/due dates, mark complete, assigning categories, change importance, set and receive reminders, and delete tasks. An Exchange Server or Office 365 account is required to synchronized tasks with Outlook. No additional software is necessary. TaskTask works with Gmail directly, although in a limited fashion.\n\nKey Features:\n- Simple interface, quickly create new tasks and mark tasks completed\n- Set task attributes, such as category, importance, start/due/complete dates, and notes\n- Synchronize your task list with your e-mail account (no hidden fees or software to download)\n- Quickly swipe to complete or delete a task \n- Easy set up with automatic configuration of your server\n- Drag-to-order your tasks, see the same order in Outlook\n- Recurring tasks and reminders\n- View attachments on your tasks and attach files from other apps\n\nHow is TaskTask better than Reminders?\n- See your task list how you prefer: organize by start date, due date, category, importance, or reminder date.\n- Reorder your tasks just by dragging them around\n- Full category support, including downloading your list of categories and colors from your Exchange Server.\n- See tasks in the same order as Outlook's To Do Bar\n- Task filters: filter out tasks in the future or tasks you don't want to see on your mobile device\n- Flagged mail items: See the full list of items from your To Do Bar, not just tasks\n- Quick Task Entry: Type a list of task subjects quickly in one space, and TaskTask automatically creates the set of tasks\n- Mark tasks as private: Hide tasks from others who have visibility to your task list\n\nNote: To synchronize your tasks with Outlook, your email account must be on a compatible Microsoft Exchange Server or Office 365 Business account. Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 and newer versions are supported, although there may be additional factors that prevent TaskTask from working with your server. \n\nIf you are using Mail.app or Microsoft Outlook 2011 (Macintosh) with your email account in \"Exchange\" mode, TaskTask is compatible with your server. Because there are specific requirements for your server, please verify with your e-mail administrator that your server meets these requirements before purchasing this app."

      "label": "CalenGoo gives you a fast and easy way to access and modify your Google Calendar with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. It can also be used when you have no Internet connection, using the cached data. Changes are saved and uploaded the next time you are connected.\n\nThe calendar view is similar to the web view of Google Calendar. Events are displayed using the same calendar colors that you use in your Google Calendar, even Google's event colors are supported (please see http://www.calengoo.com/cc ). It also recognizes which calendars are visible and which are hidden. So the view should match the view of your Google Calendar as much as possible. \n\nCalenGoo also has a month view similar to that of Google Calendar. It can be zoomed and panned to quickly get an overview over the events of a month. Zooming the month is done by using the two-finger-zoom gesture that you know from Safari and the photo application. A double tap opens the tapped day.\n\nIt also supports the same kinds of recurrence rules as Google Calendar and displays recurring events correctly even when you are offline or scroll far into the future.\n\nYou can also use Google Calendar's feature to invite people to events and see their status (accepted, declined, maybe, no answer). They will get an invitation email with links to e.g. accept or decline the invitation.\n\nGoogle Calendar has an integrated task list, called Google Tasks. Tasks with a due date are displayed on the corresponding days of the calendar. CalenGoo can do the same, it can sync this list, display your tasks in the calendar views and in a list view and it even makes your tasks available offline. You can edit and add tasks and the changes will be synced with Google Tasks.\n\nYou either need a (free) Google Calendar account to use this app or you can use it with your iOS calendars. However using it with Google Calendar has a few advantages.\n\nTo get more information, screenshots and a tutorial, please go to http://www.calengoo.com\n\nIf you have any problems or suggestions, please send an email to calengoo@dgunia.de or take a look at CalenGoo's support website to get help.\n\nIf you think the font is too small and hard to read, you can increase the font size of all calendar views in the settings under \"Settings\", \"Display and Use\".\n\nFeatures ( http://www.calengoo.com ):\n\n- Drag&drop to quickly copy and move events\n- Templates to quickly create similar events again. They can even be combined, e.g. one template for the location of an event and another for the attendees\n- Print/PDF function to print the day, week, month or agenda view via AirPrint or to email it as a PDF file\n- Supports the same recurrence rules as Google Calendar\n- Supports Google Calendar's event colors when syncing via OAuth2\n- Icons can be assigned to Google Calendar events\n- Date/time can be entered using the iOS wheels or by using a keypad\n- Fast search function\n- Show/edit iOS calendars in addition to Google calendars (or instead of Google calendars)\n- Sync with Google Tasks and iOS Reminders\n- Reminders can be snoozed and they can be (optionally) repeated every minute\n- Birthdays and anniversaries of your contacts can be displayed\n- Zoomable month view, which can be configured to scroll horizontally (month by month) or vertically (week by week)\n- Events can be linked to contacts\n- Floating events and completable events\n- Photos and PDF files can be created and attached to events (via Google Drive)\n- Calendar selection bar to quickly show and hide single calendars\n- The location of an event can be opened with Apple Maps, Google Maps, Navigon, TomTom, Skobbler, Sygic, iGo or Waze\n- View/edit calendars that are shared with others via Google Calendar\n- Many configuration options to change the way the app looks and works"

      "label": "\"...a true notepad experience that may help you make a clean break from the pencil-and-paper era.\"  -New York Times. \n\nUsers describe Mental Note as \"the only notepad app... that's actually better than, and as simple as, a pen and paper.\" It's \"the future of note taking\", and \"a big sketchpad... [to] free associate and put stuff down in any format\".\n\nTurn your iPhone or iPod touch into a digital notepad.  Combine photographs, voice recordings, drawings and text - all on the same page, in any order you choose.\n\nAn idea... a flash - a moment of genius.  When a thought hits, and you have to remember it, why limit how you record it?  The more context and sensory details you can capture, the clearer the idea can be put down.  Use photographs, audio, sketching and text together on the same page... a digital page that can be shared with anyone.  \n\nMental Note allows you to capture ideas as they happen: use photographs, dictate, add text, sketch on anything.  Ideas clarified.  Creativity captured.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Draw with your finger using multiple colours and widths on top of photographs, text, or anywhere else on the page.  Zoom in to sketch fine details.\n\n- Take a photo or choose one from your album and add it to the page. \n\n- Add audio to the page by recording with the built-in microphone (iPhone) or an external microphone (iPod touch). Continue to edit your note while recording. \n\n- Organize your notes using tags. \n\n- Password protect your private notes and flag your important ones. \n\n- Attach Calendar events to your notes.\n\n- Undo, redo anything in the note by shaking the device.\n\n- Delete note sections using the toolbar button or by swiping any note section. \n\n- Move a note section by swiping and then dragging it to its new location.\n\n- Length of a note is limited only by device memory. \n\n- Export in a variety of formats including PDF, text, Mental Note format, and more.  Send using email, iCloud, Dropbox, and more.  \n\n* Send a note in Mental Note format so the note may be imported into another person's Mental Note app.\n\n* Using email, export a complete note directly from Mental Note as either a PDF document or a picture (each audio recording is attached to the email as a separate file; use QuickTime or another modern media player to play the attached audio).  You can also email just the text from your note.\n\n- Export your notes and backups to your iCloud and/or Dropbox account.\n\n- Share a note with your friends using Twitter. \n\n- Map the location a note was created at (if location services are enabled). \n\n- Change the size and font of the text in your notes. \n\n- Change the color and background of your notes. \n\n- Numerous other configuration options. \n\n- Supports all orientations.\n\n\nTHIS VERSION IS OPTIMIZED FOR iPhone & iPod touch.

You can choose just a few simple traits, like what type of character, gender, outfit, and an action for that character.  Or get as detailed as their age, body type, and even art style, in addition to several additional expressions to give your character  more personality. \r\n\r\nYou might get a Female Gopher in a Tarzan outfit tumbling,  or a Tall Chubby Male crocodile, age 18-20, in a Santa outfit water skiing, drawn in a Primetime Animation style *and* additionally for the same character draw the expressions of “Overcome”, “Challenged” and “Proud”.  We’ll also store the most recent 20 character sets, so you can look them back up if you get a bit spin happy and want to draw a character you’ve spun recently.\r\n \r\nIn addition to the app, I have put together a ‘Character Design Shuffle’ Facebook group, so artists worldwide can share their character designs with other artists and get feedback.  You can upload your own character designs from your computer, or you can use the app’s Upload feature to pick a photo of your character and which character spin it goes with and we’ll upload it for you.  (The app will ask for your permission to post to Facebook, but know that we only use it for this upload feature that you control.)\r\n \r\nSo get shuffling and unlock that creative block…\r\n \r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n* Character traits can be locked or unlocked when you spin, so you can be given a very simple character, or a very detailed character to draw from.\r\n* Over 20 Quintillion (that's 18 zeroes) combinations when spinning all categories.\r\n* We’ll save the most recent 20 characters  for you so you can look them up again later.\r\n* Question mark buttons next to each character trait will attempt to look up the word on the Internet to help if you’re not clear on its meaning.\r\n* Upload an image from your device’s photo library to the ‘Character Design Shuffle’ Facebook group once you’ve drawn a character you’ve spun.\r\n* Visit the ‘Character Design Shuffle’ Facebook group from the app.\r\n* Visit http://silvertoonsapps.com from the app to see other apps by Stephen Silver."

      "label": "OmniOutliner 3 Enterprise simplifies deployment for customers who wish to pay full-price for the Pro edition up front. For most customers, we recommend our normal edition — which uses in-app purchases to support free two-week trials, two levels of functionality (Essentials and Pro), and upgrade discounts. The list price and the functionality of OmniOutliner Pro are the same in both apps.\n\nOmniOutliner 3 for iOS brings structured writing to all your iOS devices.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Dark Mode: OmniOutliner’s UI automatically adjusts to correspond to the display mode of iOS.\n• File Browser: OmniOutliner now uses Apple’s file browser giving you more flexibility with where you store your documents and how they sync.\n• Multiple Windows: Increase your productivity on iPadOS by working with two documents at the same time.\n• Drag and Drop: Text can be dragged to documents. Rows can be dragged between documents or to other apps.\n• Keyword Filtering: Filter the outline by a keyword via the new Filter icon in the toolbar.\n• Improved Outline View: Row handles and Status Checkboxes now follow the row indentation level.\n• Templates: Choose a template or apply a theme to an existing document using OmniOutliner’s new Template Picker.\n• Printing: Documents can now be printed via the new Print option in the Share menu.\n• PDF: Send a PDF copy of your document using the new PDF format option.\n• New File Format: OmniOutliner 3 for iOS adopts the new .ooutline format introduced by OmniOutliner 5 for Mac: a flat (zipped) file that is more compatible with third-party cloud sync platforms. While .ooutline files are zipped by default, package files are still available for scenarios where that makes more sense, like for version control.\n• OPML Mode: When editing OPML files, features not supported by the file format are hidden or disabled.\n• Omni Automation: Cross-platform scripting with JavaScript.\n• Focusing: A Section List has been added to give you an overview and focus on certain areas.\n• Status Bar: When focused or filtered, a status bar appears to remind you that content is hidden and provide easy access to your full outline.\n• Drag and Drop: In addition to text, images and other files can be dragged to documents.\n• Filters: Create and save keyword filters. If you’re syncing with OmniOutliner 5 Pro for Mac, you can also apply advanced filters created in the Mac edition of OmniOutliner.\n• Optimized Inspector: The Contents and Text Style Inspectors now open in a unified view on smaller iOS devices and as a unified sidebar on larger iOS devices, allowing for improved access to inspector contents. When space is available, the Inspector sidebar now persists on the screen, making it easier to make multiple changes to your document.\n• Outline Column: The outline column can now be placed anywhere in a multi-column document.\n• Excel & Powerpoint Export\n• Password Encryption: Add a password to your documents to secure them with AES-256 encryption.\n• OPML Mode: Edit metadata for OPML files and set text encoding in the Document inspector.\n\nFor video tutorials and other information, please visit our website!\n\nIf you have any feedback or questions, we’d love to hear from you! The Omni Group offers free tech support: you can reach us by email at omnioutliner@omnigroup.com, by phone at 1-800-315-6664 or +1-206-523-4152, or on twitter @omnioutliner.\n\nThank you!"

There is no need to navigate through multiple screens just to get a measurement.  Easy and intuitive to use, and measurement are displayed in big font to make it easy to read.\n\n+FAST ONE SCREEN CALCULATIONS\nSimple one screen calculations that show results \"live\" and on the fly as you slide your finger to enter values in.\n\n+ACCURATE CALCULATIONS\nCenterline bending radius - based calculations are also available.  These calculations offer greater accuracy when compared to bending multiplier methods.  Preposition your bends automatically.  All bends take shrink into account so you don't have to do any math.  What's faster - bending it twice or bending it right the first time?\n\n+PROTRACTOR FUNCTION INCLUDED\nUse the included protractor function to measure the angle as you bend.  Angle will be fed directly from your input screen to save you time.\n\n+BENDER PROFILES\nAlmost 100 different bender/pipe combinations included.  You have the ability to tweak or completely modify any of the combinations to match your bender on the field.\n\n+ WHO IS IT FOR?\nIf you consider yourself a craftsman that takes pride in his work, iBend Pipe is for you.  If other \"sparkies\" come to you when they have a difficult bend, this is for you.  If you want to have a smaller \"bone\"  pile, this is for you.  If you can write your name in conduit, this is for you.  From, a  1st year inside wireman apprentice to a seasoned “old timer” this app will save you time and material.\n\nInput fractions instead of converting to decimals and get results in fractions.\n\nThanks for all the great reviews, if you have any suggestions:\nsupport@ibendpipe.com"

      "label": "QuickBend is the quickest and most accurate conduit bending calculator app.\n\nQuickBend is an advanced conduit bending calculator that was created to be fast and accurate while being visually appealing, innovative, and intuitive. Offering you the most accurate measurements using the center-line radius algorithm based upon the bender that you're using. \n\nEasily select between different types of benders and choose the size of the shoe and conduit type that you're using. The last bender that you selected will be the bender that appears when you open the app up again. See and edit your bender's information (Center-line Radius, Deduct, Gain, Setback, Travel, and Radius Adjustment) within the 'Bender Specs' section. \n\nQuickBend supports the following bends.\n\n• Offset\n• Rolling Offset\n• Matching Bends Offset\n• Matching Centers Offset\n• Parallel Offset\n• Three-Point Saddle\n• Four-Point Saddle\n• 90\n• Kick With 90\n• Matching Bend Kick\n• Matching Center Kick\n• Parallel Kick\n• Multiple Parallel Kicks\n• Compound 90 - Circle Obstruction\n• Compound 90 - Rectangle Obstruction\n• Compound 90 - Square Obstruction\n• Segmented 90\n\nQuickBend Benders\n\n• Cosecant (Okay. it's not a bender, however;  if you prefer the multiplier method with no radius. It's available.)\n• Current Tools: 750/751\n• Current Tools: 77\n• Current Tools: 747\n• Gardner Bender: Big Ben\n• Gardner Bender: Sidewinder\n• Gardner Bender: Electric Sidewinder\n• Gardner Bender: B2000 Cyclone\n• Gardner Bender: Ultra Eegor\n• Gardner Bender: B300 Series\n• Greenlee: Hand Benders\n• Greenlee: 1800/1801\n• Greenlee: 1818\n• Greenlee: 555\n• Greenlee: 854DX\n• Greenlee: 855GX\n• Greenlee: 881\n• Greenlee: 884/885\n• Ideal: Hand Benders\n• Klein: Hand Benders\n\nQuickBend Multiple Bends\n• Layout multiple bends on a single stick of conduit.\n• Offset to Obstruction\n• Offset from Obstruction\n• Three Point Saddle\n• Four Point Saddle\n• 90 Bend, Kick\n• Kick with 90\n• Place a cut mark for those rare occasions that you need to cut and thread the conduit before bending.\n• Flip bends around.\n• Graphic representation of where the bend/cut will layout on a stick of conduit.\n• Bend layouts are based on your benders centerline radius, deduct, and gain.\n• Toggle 'Measure to Centers' to help line up conduits when working on raceways with multiple conduit sizes.\n\nQuickBend includes a protractor level which is easily accessible and can be Zeroed by a simple tap.\n\nQuickBend allows you to pick between either form of measurements, imperial (inches) or metric (cm).\n\nQuickBend's QuickCheck indicates if bends are impossible by a subtle change of turning the measurements and text red.\n\nQuickBend's center-line radius algorithm is especially useful when bending conduit that is larger than 1 inch and bends that exceed 30 degrees.\n\nIf you'd like to make any suggestions or just want to say 'hi' please e-mail me at rigidpro@outlook.com"

      "label": "\"Oblique Strategies\" is a concept developed by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt to help artists overcome creative blocks through lateral thinking. It consists of a deck of cards, each one containing a vague or ambiguous phrase that can be used to solve a problem intuitively, by breaking conventional thinking patterns and interpreting it from a new perspective.\n\nThis app aims to translate the essence of the original cards deck into a digital experience, making it accessible to a wider audience. It contains the original edition, as well as the newer decks, presenting them in a sleek minimalist style inspired by the original design of the cards. The user interface is simple and straightforward, built to encourage creative or design thinking without distracting from the process. The home screen widget on iOS 14 allows reading a new quote every day without opening the application. The Apple Watch version can run independently without needing the app installed on your iPhone.\n\nWith VoiceOver, anyone with a visual impairment can have the Oblique Strategies phrase read to them. Long tap the screen to have the last sentence read to you again. Also, you can shake the iPhone for a new sentence."

      "label": "Notebooks is a writing app, a text and markdown editor, your personal Wiki and Zettelkasten, a file organizer, task manager, PDF and eBook creator and more. This may sound like a lot, but consider you have a few text fragments, randomly created, which you want to combine into a chapter of a book and saved as PDF or eBook; or a quick note sparks off an idea, generates a couple of tasks, each of which requires you to organize further research material; or you have business related documents which need to be separated from private diaries, records and files. – With Notebooks you handle these jobs easily without switching apps, and while remaining focussed and creative.\n\n• Notebooks stores all your documents as regular files in standard formats. You are always in control of your documents, never need to worry about how to export them, and they remain compatible across devices and over time.\n\n• Create formatted documents with styles, attachments, tables or checklists, and add a table of contents if you like. Choose between a variation of ready made document styles, or create your own, if you want.\n\n• Write your documents in plain text and allow Notebooks to automatically handle lists, highlight and center the current line on screen, automatically insert closing characters for  (, {, [, \" and more. - Plain text is a universal format which can be used on any device without any specific software.\n\n• Use Markdown to create formatted documents from plain text. Notebooks supports *MultiMarkdown* and its own flavor of *Discount*.  – Click any word in a formatted Markdown text and start writing at that position. You can even create checklists (- [ ]) and tick them off in formatted view. Syntax highlighting and a set of dedicated extra keyboard keys make Markdown editing easy.\n  \n• Use your Apple Pencil to sketch ideas or annotate images and PDF documents.\n\n• Use Notebooks' advanced editing capabilities to work on documents which are stored in other apps.\n\n• Compile selected documents or the contents of whole books into a single document, an eBook or a PDF document.\n\n• Link between documents in Notebooks. In Markdown you can even use Wiki style links ([[ ]]). When clicking a link to a document which does not yet exist, Notebooks suggests to create it. And when you move or rename documents, Notebooks makes sure the links remain intact.\n\n• Create as many books as you need to structure your projects and details. Nest books as deep as you like, there is no limit in Notebooks. If you ever loose track, Notebooks' full text search helps you quickly turn up even the most hidden document.\n\n• Turn books into task lists to display document as tasks which can be ticked off. Assign due dates and alerts, and divide projects into nested sub projects, which makes them easier to handle. \n\n• For simple lists you can use checklists in formatted documents and Markdown.\n\n• Assign Context tags to books and documents to create shortcuts that are accessible for a smart book at Notebooks' top level. – Notebooks can even extract context tags from the contents of documents as you create them.\n\n• Import all documents and files you want to keep close at hand, no matter whether PDF, email, web pages, MS Office or iWorks, photos, videos, music and more.\n\n• Scan documents and extract text using OCR (iOS 13)\n\n• Sync files between iPads, iPhones, Mac or PC. \n\nWith all that, Notebooks may quickly become your one and only app for everything you want to keep close at hand.\n\nUser Comments: \n\n“Notebooks is a wonderful App, which is so much better than the dozen other note apps I tried. It is sophisticated, in an unassuming way, so that you find yourself greatly rewarded and being productive without sacrificing time/effort to the App. I cannot tell you how much productivity I have gained.  I am having a huge amount of fun, I use it constantly, more than the phone on my iPhone in fact.\" \n\n“You are GTD in every way that makes it efficient and makes me efficient.”"

How about not opening Safari? Yes, you can even switch engines in Spotlight with shortcut and redirect to Safari automatically.\n\n◆ URL Scheme: xSearch not only supports website engines, but also supports URL Scheme, for example: search `twapp apple` in Safari (or Spotlight) will redirect to Twitter app (if it's installed) and search `apple` automatically.\n\n◆ Syncing all your engines across your devices via iCloud.\n\n◆ Export and Import engines JSON file, this let you backup your engines or share engines with other users.\n\n◆ Edit engines in JSON.\n\n◆ Use share extension to search any text via xSearch.\n\n!!!

      "label": "WoodworkerCalc is a specialized calculator for fine woodworking and other crafts. It makes it very easy to enter and perform calculations on measurements and tracks errors that can accumulate during layout. When laying out repeating units, a small round off error in the fractions can result in large errors. WoodworkerCalc displays these errors so the layout accommodate them.\n\nIt is easy to go back and forth before decimal and fractional results. You can choose the precision of the fraction to reflect real-world working units. For example, 1/32 is the typical smallest unit used for woodworking layout.\n\nCalculations are stored on “tapes” which can be saved and restored later. This allows sequences of calculations to be preserved for later use.\n\nThere is also a board foot calculator which is useful when purchasing material.\n\nA triangle calculator avoids the need to remember high school trigonometry."

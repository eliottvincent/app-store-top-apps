Perhaps bored and passing time, or just stuck at home in silence.\nIt's been far too long since you last hit the court and worked up a good old sweat, am I right?\n\nYou'd go through the old familiar motions, as if on auto-pilot.\nLoading up that shot, arms tensing, and then a flick of the wrists:\nSwish. No basketball to play with, but your motions are on point!\n\nThe good old days flew by faster than you can shout 'travel!'.\nThat's youth for you. It came, now it's went.\nOr so you thought...\nYet now, that imaginary basketball's back in virtual form. He shoots! He scores!\nNothing beats that sound, that classic, weirdly satisfying\nSWISH!\nSo now you're up on your feet again, heart racing.\nYou're alone no longer! That's right! We get you, man!\nWe made AirShot: a game just for you!\n\nThere's the effortless motion recognition. The pinpoint spatial audio simulation.\nAnd it all comes together to recreate that satisfying swish.\n\nOnce a baller, always a baller.\nNo matter how tough life gets, you can always AirShot that stress away!\n\nHere's to each and every MVP out there, on the court or elsewhere!\n——————————————\n[How to Play]\nWear your watch according to the instructions shown to have it recognize your throwing motions, and you'll hear that old familiar swish. Nothin' but net!\n\n1. There's a chance you'll hear a clang as you hit the rim, missing the shot. There's a whole bunch of hidden secrets...\n2. On top of shooting hoops SFX, there's actual shooting SFX, whip noises, and more... We're adding heaps of new sounds with each update, and more gameplay for you to enjoy too."

As the perfect mum or dad watching all your kids' Ice Hockey games, be the one setting the ambiance for the team AND being where the heater is! Talk to the scoreboard guru and offer to play music during the games. Nothing simpler, get the app, setup your playlist with the perfect start time for each song, and plug your phone to the rink's audio system. That's it! All the kids will vote for you to play at all the games now. You will see, the time at the rink will fly and you will be looking forward to the next game like never before and you will never freeze again. I wrote that app for my son, it changed the way I see rinks now. The team was even convincing home teams we were visiting to let me play music for the travel games!   \n\nThis is the perfect Dad's app for Ice Hockey Entertainment music management and playlist. Play Pump up Songs, Face Off, and Crowd Power Up to cheer up for your team. \n\n24 songs included in this version of the app. These songs by Audionautix and Kevin MacLeod are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution license. The 36 buttons of the app can be reprogrammed with any of your own songs from your iTunes library. (Horns, Organs, ...). \n\nThe latest addition is a full screen of your best team teams' Horns! It comes included! If I am missing your favorite team, contact me on instagram @HockeyDJApp.\n\n12 suggested links to iTunes titles which will pump up your kid's team.\n\nEvery button is customizable and can be set to point to the songs you own in your iTunes Local Library (No need for iTunes Cloud Subscription). You can purchase more screens if you want, up to 15 extra screens giving you a total of 216 customizable buttons.\n\nThe cool thing about the buttons is that you can set you own starting time per song, placing the play button at the best moment of the song to have a maximum effect on your DJ skills and for the please of the parents and players at the rink.\n\nThe \"Horn\" and \"1min Left in the game\" buttons are also customizable, and now you can recall the previous song after playing a goal announcement.\n\nVia InApp purchase, you can record your own voice for quick announcements and set on the \"1min Left Button\" (or on any other buttons).\n\nWith additional inApp purchases, you can play announcements for Penalties, by selecting : The voice, the player, the team, the time and type of penalty. Then you just need to press the ready and play button. With version 5.0 and above, you can also record player roster names. This will be played on demand when you announce penalties. You can even use it to record your own announcements and play them on the rink speakers as you would play any songs from the app.\n\nDisclaimer : Copyrighted songs (120 suggested) are not included in the Apps. This latest version will let you use your iTunes Cloud Music Subscription to select your songs. From the Settings screen, you can find a button to pre-load each screen with specific startup time for each song."

By freedivers, for freedivers, our freedive apnea trainer helps you with static apnea tables and lung capacity training so you can effectively increase the time when diving underwater.\r\nSee why STAmina Apnea Trainer is one of the best apnea apps to improve the breath-holding time for freediving, scuba diving and spearfishing, as well as surfing, running, and other water sports with 6 different apnea tables types.\n\n\r\n■ FREEDIVING & SPEARFISHING APNEA TRAINER FEATURES:\n\n\r\n◉ 6 APNEA TABLE OPTIONS \r\nSTAmina Apnea Trainer can create / generate custom apnea (exercises that are automatically created based on the maximum breath-hold and match the user’s level) or let you select from the following customizable table types:\r\n\r\n- O2 deprivation table – accustoms a body to lower oxygen levels. This is achieved by increasing the amount of time that you hold your breath on each attempt, while the resting time is fixed.\r\n\r\n- CO2 Tolerance table – helps a body to adapt to high carbon dioxide levels. This is achieved by decreasing the length of resting time between fixed breath-hold periods.\r\n\r\n- Wonka table – a variation of CO2 tables. Apnea timer starts after the first contraction, the rest time takes one breath.\r\n\r\n- Mix table – tables where apnea time increases and rest time decreases with each round.\r\n\r\n- Custom table – allows mixing of different approaches to create a custom training, thus generating the most effective training program.\r\n\r\n- Pranayama – a breathing technique to decrease stress in the body and relax the nervous system.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ APPLE HEALTH SYNCRONIZATION \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED TRAINING WITH VARYING DIFFICULTY\r\nWhen you start working with the application, you set your personal record in breath holding. Based on this data, the app will offer a personalized training program with exercises of 3 difficulty levels to choose from: easy, normal, and hard.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED EXERCISE SETTINGS \r\nEach exercise can be edited by setting your own number of repetitions, breath hold time, rest time, etc.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ TRAINING REMINDERS \r\nGet the notification to start your apnea training. Set a reminder in the apnea diver app for the day and the time & get a notification to do a breath holding training session.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONAL STATISTICS AND DETAILED TRAINING HISTORY\r\nAll your workouts and exercises are recorded in the freedive trainer app to track the detailed progress of each training.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ VOICE GUIDANCE\r\nTraining may be accompanied by voice guidance with male/female voices recorded by professional voice actors. STAmina supports English, French, Russian voice guidance.\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n◉ HEART RATE AND OXYGEN SATURATION TRACKING\r\nTrack your heart rate while doing breath holding exercises (a compatible HR monitor or pulse-oximeter is required) \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CONTRACTIONS TRACKING \r\nUse our freedive trainer to track unlimited contractions, analyse captured data after exercises\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CLOUD SYNC / BACKUP\r\nAccess your data on multiple devices and easily restore it in case you switch devices/phones.\n\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\nStamina Apnea Trainer allows training breath hold effectively for anyone who cares about all kinds of diving including:\r\n> beginner or professional freedivers;\r\nspearfishers;\r\n> scuba divers to learn how to dive longer on one tank;\r\n> surfers in case of unexpected breath hold;\r\n> underwater sports athletes such as underwater rugby, hockey, etc.\r\n> runners who want to train breath holding & high tolerance to CO2 while running\r\n\r\n_______\r\nInfo https://getstamina.app/\r\nContact https://www.facebook.com/staminamobile/\r\nSupport hello@squarecrowdapps.com"

      "label": "Used by beginners through Major Championship winners on the PGA Tour, and validated by an Independent Scientific Study by the Departments of Physics and Biomechanics at Yale University.\n\nThe Tour Tempo Total Game allows you to learn how to correctly integrate the Tempo of the Tour Pros into your golf swing. Over 100,000 golfers worldwide, including Major Championship winners on the PGA Tour, have improved their games by using Tour Tempo.  \n\n\"In all the reviews I've written for MyGolfSpy (a number now pushing up on 100), I'd only given one perfect score. Now Tour Tempo can be added to that most-elite company. Tour Tempo is scientifically proven, it's easy to use, and it will help you in every facet of the game.\" \n— GolfSpy Matt: http://www.mygolfspy.com/tour-tempo-review\n\n\"It will be the best thing that you will ever do for your game.\" \n— Pat Dempsey, 2011 RE/MAX World Long Drive Grand Champion 55+\n\n\"You will get better right away! When you synch your swing to that of the Tour Pros with Tour Tempo, you’ll get better right now!\" \n— Dan Rooney, Folds of Honor\n\n\"The Unified Theory of Tempo\" \n— Golf Digest \n\n\"No one has ever come up with a way to teach Tempo until now.\"\n— Travel + Leisure Golf \n\nBased on the international best selling golf book, Tour Tempo. The book outlines and explains the discovery of a specific mathematical ratio regarding the elapsed time of the backswing and the elapsed time of the downswing of the Tour Pros. The Tour Tempo System is simple and easy to learn. All you do is react to three scientifically spaced musical notes. These musical notes alert you to start your takeaway, start your downswing, and then the third note lines you up with impact. It’s just that easy - you literally download the app, turn it on, grab a club and start swinging to the Tempo of the Tour Pros.\n\nLONG GAME\nThe Long Game Tones will teach you how to swing with the tempo ratio exhibited by the Tour Pros. We measured the time of their backswings and downswings by counting how many frames of video each part took. The magic ratio on full swings turned out to be three parts backswing to one part downswing. Tones are provided for each of the following frame ratios of Tour Tempo - 18/6, 21/7, 24/8 & 27/9. The Tour Tempo Tones have a clear purpose. They establish the intrinsic tempo of the golf swing in your subconscious mind. Once this is accomplished, you will not have to think about tempo while playing. This is what the Tour Pros have already done. You are about to acquire that same ability.\n\nSHORT GAME\nThe Total Game App also contains the Short Game Tones of 14/7, 16/8, 18/9 & 20/10. After the publication of Tour Tempo, John Novosel studied the short game swings of the top touring pros, and discovered that virtually all of them employ a 2 to 1 swing ratio on or around the greens - a different Tempo than the 3 to 1 ratio of the Long Game. This is another reason why the game of golf is so hard to master.      \n\nTEMPO TRACKS\nThe Tempo Tracks are an easy way to integrate Tour Tempo into your daily routine. One of the best ways to use the Tracks is to listen to them while driving to the course before a round of golf. The more you listen to them, the more the Tour Tempo rhythm will be ingrained into your Golf Swing. \n\nFOCUS TRACKS\nThe Focus Tracks are revolutionary relaxation songs that contain the Tones of Tour Tempo. Each Track has a Part II that has binaural tones embedded in the music to get your brain into an optimum state for concentration. This optimum state is more commonly known to athletes as “Being in the Zone.”\n\nVIDEOS\nThe videos give a complete explanation of the Tones and how to use them to immediately and dramatically improve your Total Game.  \n\nDISCOUNT\nThe app is your first step towards a more powerful, consistent golf game, and that is why we are giving you a discount from our Tour Tempo Shop. On the 'Info' screen you will find a one-time discount code good for $10 off on a future purchase at TourTempo.com and TourTempo.eu."

Tap the screen once again after your break and the app will display your Break Speed speed.\n\nBreak Speed is more than 10x the accuracy of a radar gun and has become the standard for break shot speed measurements, privately and professionally. With such high precision, you can use Break Speed to provide that feedback you need to improve your breaks. Break harder and more consistently with Break Speed.\n\nDon't worry about others breaking around you or other pool hall noise. Even shouting players won't fool our Break Recognition technology.\n\nFind out why professional pool players are using and recommending Break Speed to others.\n\nOur collaboration with Predator has been very effective. It's been great to work with a team that understands the science of billiards. The Predator R&D team has been testing the application along side their own speed measurement equipment and the Iron Willie robot,  following a number of testing sessions, the Predator R&D team found the application so accurate that a partnership in pool science began.\n\n\"The application is really spot on. During my many testing sessions with the Predator Team there was very little deviation between the Predator testing equipment and the application,\" said Predator Pro Mike Dechaine.\n\nIf you're a serious player, and you don't have Break Speed Powered By Predator, what are you waiting for?"

      "label": "Avy savvy backcountry skiers and riders know that three things count when it comes to the terrain’s influence on avalanches: the slope, the elevation, and the (compass) aspect. And the Avalanche Inclinometer delivers all three. Sure, you can find plenty of inclinometer apps (also known as clinometers) that are designed for carpenters, but Steve's Avalanche Inclinometer is meant for people who spend time in avalanche terrain. \n\nThis app shows the slope, elevation, and aspect in BIG FONTS which are perfect for tired eyes in stormy (or bright-and-too-sunny) weather. And it doesn’t display a gaggle of tiny buttons and widgets to decipher when you should be skiing.\n\nYou can sight across a slope by holding your phone parallel to the slope, or you can sight up or down a slope by sighting along the long-edge of your phone like a gunsight. (Through-the-camera sighting is nifty when the light is just right, but it often isn't.)\n\nWhen you have your phone aligned with the slope, a single tap on the screen will lock the data so you can read it. The Avalanche Inclinometer will even speak to you as you’re measuring the steepness so you won’t need to look at the screen. And the BIG inclinometer dial changes colors based on the slope which provides instant feedback on how the steepness of the terrain is contributing to the likelihood of an avalanche.\n\nAfter measuring the slope, you can tap a single button to share your current GPS location, the slope in degrees, and the elevation. The email includes kml and gpx waypoint files, and a link that will let you quickly see the location in any browser. You can enter the email address one time and the Avalanche Inclinometer will remember it for next time. Less typing; more skiing.\n\nThe Avalanche Inclinometer isn’t free, but apps don’t grow on trees. To buy this app you’ll spend less than buying a beer at a ski resort—think of it as buying Steve a beer!\n\nIn addition to the Avalanche Inclinometer, it is important that you take an avy class, pay attention to the avalanche red flags, use good route finding techniques, and practice your avalanche rescue skills frequently"

The same old stickhandling drills get boring and you can't afford a private stickhandling instructor. Well.... you can now!\n\nDangleTime is your private stickhandling coach on your phone. Anytime you want to work on your stickhandling just pull out your phone and get training. \n\nThe app keeps track of your \"DangleTime\" which is the amount of time you spend practicing using the app. This time can be shared and compared with friends. Who can get the highest DangleTime? The higher your DangleTime the more you can level up, go from a Duster to an All-Star!\n\nThe app comes with 3 free training packs. Each training pack contains 8 stickhandling drills. When you select a training pack a drill will play for 20 seconds with a 10 second break and then the next drill will play until all drills in that pack have played. These times can be adjusted in the settings menu. \n\nIf you'd like more stickhandling drills you can purchase them and continue to challenge yourself and improve your stickhandling. \nAll drills are demonstrated by Jeremy Rupke from How To Hockey with plans to add new drill packs from more hockey instructors. \n\nShow me your DangleTime with #DangleTime on Instagram and Twitter and follow me @howtohockey"

      "label": "Shootility SightSet is an app designed to make it easy to zero your pistol, rifle or air rifle sights or scopes, without needing to be a rocket scientist.  It's not just designed to be flexible, quick and easy to use to save you time, it can also save you a significant amount of money.  With the ever increasing price of factory ammunition, SightSet can pay for itself remarkably quickly. Simply by saving you as few as just 10 rounds for many calibers!\n\nIf, like us, you enjoy shooting more than you enjoy math, sighting in can get to be a real chore. Especially when you are zeroing multiple firearms, shoot different loads or with different types of ammunition (so you need to do it often). You need to take into account the adjustment precision of your sights, the distance at which you are shooting over, the size of the targets ...as well as possibly compensating for metric sights on ranges measured in feet or yards (or metric ranges with inch/MOA adjustable sights). No wonder it can be so easy to make a mistake. \n\nSightSet solves the problem by removing the manual errors. It calculates adjustments for you, based on the shot fall that you actually observe.  Match your sight against one the predefined sight definitions (inch, metric or MOA).  Match your target against one of the 140+ common small bore, high power, air-rifle, pistol or air-pistol targets. Tell SightSet the distance. Then just plot your shots as you take them on a zoomable screen showing a copy of your target. \n\nSightSet calculates average distance of your shots from the target center (in cm, inches or MOA), tells you how many clicks you need to make to adjust for windage and elevation, and even reminds you which direction you should turn the adjusters. If a couple of your shots have gone wild, simply go into edit mode to delete them so they don’t affect the calculations. You can even overlay a grid onto the target to get an easy indication of the spread of your shots.\n\nIt’s no problem if SightSet doesn’t have a definition for your sight, either. Create your own using one of the 33 standard inch, metric or MOA settings provided. SightSet even provides the tools to create your own simple targets (square ones too!). \n\nAnd to make it easy to set up your sights time and time again, you can quickly create favorites to hold the common combinations of sights, targets and distances that you use.\n\nFor more information and instructional videos visit: www.apphelia.com\n\n(For a detailed list  of targets and click settings, see www.shootility.apphelia.com/faq.html)"

These quality sounds are custom made, hand recorded sets from hunting enthusiast and author Douglas Boze.\n\nAll Sets can be loops and you can even choose a custom delay duration before the Set will play again. This delay is associated with each Set, so you can program the delay specifically for the Sets you use the most.\n\nPick your favorite background image to customize the App from 5 pre-selected images taken in the field.\n\nThe App supports the use of a bluetooth speaker (if you have one) to play the Sets at a distance from your location in addition to using the speakers on your phone directly.\n\nSupports a 'dark mode' that will reduce the brightness of the screen, reducing any light pollution that might otherwise be a problem in a low light situation."

Your friend or coach can then view your performance in realtime.\n\nCueMeasure is used by top coaches around the world to quickly detect problems with the cue action and help to solve them!\n\nNo need to invest in expensive equipment when you can already improve a great deal using this application only.\n\nPlease note that you can install CueMeasure on an iPad for coaching mode, but for the actual measuring of the cue action it requires an iPhone.\n\nWe are constantly working on updates of CueMeasure, there are new great features coming up very soon, keep an eye open!"

      "label": "The TRACT Optics Impact Ballistics mobile application takes the guesswork out of long-range shooting and provides data to help the most experienced shooter as well as the beginner or novice. This mobile application is one of the most comprehensive databases of information available today. With virtually every modern ammunition manufacturer’s information listed shooters can match any TRACT rifle scope reticle to their exact cartridge. Simply select your scope, then your ammo/bullet the program will calculate the bullet drop information as it pertains to your reticle automatically. If you cannot find your particular round of ammunition in the program, simply add the Ballistic Coefficient (B.C.) and Muzzle Velocity to the program and you will be good to go. With the ability to import current weather conditions the Impact program will provide up to date Bullet Drop Compensation to help you make accurate shots in the field or at the range. While the mobile application is designed to provide ballistic date without an internet connection, when the user has an internet connection, they are able to access our complete library of videos, articles, and blogs. Simply navigate to the Learn section of the app and you can access the Getting Started section for Rifle Scopes, Binoculars and Spotting Scopes as well as Pro Shooting Tips with videos detailing How To videos showing how to maximize the performance of your optic. You can even shop our complete line of Optics and Accessories right from the App. This app will be continually updated with new ammunition information, new product releases and videos. Selectable options include Meters or Yards, Drag Table, Spin Drift, Sight Height, Printable Dope and BDC cards, the ability to compare loads, atmospheric conditions (manual entry or automatic import), wind direction, sight setting/zero calculator and much more. The program is capable of providing ballistic data out to 2,500 yards. The BDC card allows the shooter to print out a “cheat sheet” that can show the bullet drop at each magnification (for Second Focal Plane scopes) The Dope card provides velocity, energy, path, drop, wind drift, time of flight, # of click value and MOA or MRAD info in 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 yard increments. Weather/Atmospheric conditions can be automatically imported thanks to our direct link to World Weather Online, or you can manually enter the Temperature, Altitude, Barometric Pressure and Humidity through the Conditions section. The conditions section also allows the user to enter Bullet Wind Drift information such as wind speed and direction and provide data in inches, MOA or MRAD. The sight settings section is a great resource for shooters who would like to zero their rifle at a further distance then they are able to shoot. For example, if a user only has access to a 100-yard range but would like his rifle to be zeroed at 200 yards, the Sight Setting section will show the user where his bullet needs to impact on a 100-yard target to be zeroed at 200 yards. Our goal for this app is that it provides you with a comprehensive resource for everything and anything related to TRACT Optics…Where you Belong."

      "label": "Are you loyal to your team even though you may not live near your team’s home city? \n\nHave you recently re-located to a new town? \n\nDo you travel frequently and trying to find your team’s game shown at your hotel bar is problematic and unreliable? \n\nAre you a social person that would rather watch the game with other fans like yourself? \n\nIf you answered yes to any of the previous questions, Team Bar Finder is for you. \n\nThere are literally thousands of Team Bars and locations that host watch parties for fans of teams that are not located in their favorite teams’ home market. Watching a game with other fans of the same team creates an atmosphere and environment of that feeling of being back home rooting on your favorite team even if you are miles away. Until now, finding these team bars has been difficult, unreliable and time consuming. Team Bar Finder eliminates all of that.\n\nTeam Bar Finder is simple to use. You’ll first register an account with Team Bar Finder. Choose your favorite teams from major sports – Pro Football, College, Pro Basketball, Pro Hockey, Pro Baseball and Football (Soccer). You can select just one team or multiple teams across all sports. Add, deleted and edit your favorite teams at any time. \n\nThe dynamic mapping operation has three functions. The default view shows all team bars in a specific location, no matter what team affiliation or sport. Select the “My Teams” tab and every location not affiliated with your team will disappear, leaving only those team bars that will be showing your favorite teams’ games. The search bar and “Team Name” tab allows you to type in a team name to search for team bars of a team not designated a favorite. Zoom into the region where you would like to watch the game and select the location you prefer.\n\nOnce you have found a location you would like to visit, touch the team bar finder icon to open the details page. There you will see the name of the establishment, which team or multiple teams they support, the address, phone number and the ability to get driving directions using Maps. Because the bar and restaurant industry is volatile with locations closing unexpectedly or new management choosing to not host a specific fanbase, it is best to contact the location prior to your arrival. This ensures your game will be shown with sound and other like-minded fans gather there regularly. Some locations are strictly 18 or 21 and older spots. If you will be bringing underage fans to watch the game, make sure your location does not have age restrictions prior to going there.\n\nWith so many team bars opening and closing, it is nearly impossible to keep up with all the changes. That’s why we have included the “add a bar” function. Tap the plus sign to add a bar and alert our staff of a location that may not be in the Team Bar Finder database. There you can list the establishment name, address and which teams’ games they show. You can even include additional details like, “they play the fight song after every touchdown” or “2-for-1 drink specials for fans wearing silver and black”. Once submitted, our team will verify the location details. If the location is confirmed, the bar or restaurant is added to the expansive Team Bar Finder database. \n\nNo matter if you are a season ticket holder and want to catch a game in a different city with fans like yourself or you have moved away and remain loyal to your team, Team Bar Finder can help you find your happy place. Sports fans share a special kinship that is social in nature. Watching your team with other fans makes it more enjoyable, regardless of your distance from your college or team’s home town. Team Bar Finder brings sports fans together with a common rooting interest. \n\nDownload the app now and start finding your happy place."

Wouldn’t it be great to be able to dive deeply with one big breath and take incredible pictures for your friends at home? The Apnea Trainer makes it possible! By using it to train three times a week, you can quickly double your underwater time.\n\nThis is the same training principle used by apnea divers. It’s based on a yoga technique which strengthens the diaphragm muscles allowing you to fill your lungs with more oxygen and releasing more carbon dioxide while exhaling. The system is relatively simple and depends on finding the right time intervals which are provided by the program, thus letting you relax and concentrate on your breathing. This will guarantee maximum training success.\nThe program will also come in handy just before the actual dive since a pranayama mode is already included. The Apnea Trainer will help you keep your whole body calm and give you the perfect preparation for those amazing, long-lasting dives. \n\n\nFeatures:\n+ Training to improve free diving time\n\n+ Pranayama mode to calm your body before diving or snorkeling\n\n+ Custom time settings for pro divers\n\n+ Optical and Audio instructions\n\n+ Easy to use interface\n\nUpdated user interface with the help of Bjoern Maser by www.minimalist.ch."

This encourages the players to continue shooting in an effort\n to reach 10 000 shots. The shot counting screen can be used to keep track of slapshots, wrist shots, back hands, and snap shots. \n\n• Video Teaching Tips - The app comes with 4 shooting tips for each type of shot. The main video will teach proper technique, while the following three videos for \neach shot type will give tips on advanced shooting methods. The advanced shooting tips will help keep shooting practice fun, and also teach the player new ways to use each shot\n\n• Training - The app comes with two training tools, the buzzer beater and the quick release. \n\n•• The buzzer beater is a count down clock with a built in delay to allow players to prepare for the first shot after hitting the start button. The countdown clock\nduration can be set by the player. The player can use the buzzer beater clock to see how many shots they can take in a set amount of time, how many times they can hit the net\nfrom different distances in a given time, how many targets they can hit in a given time, etc. Use the buzzer beater for all types of shots, and keep track of how many shots\nyou are taking with the shot counter\n\n•• The quick release tool will train the player to shoot the puck quickly and accurately. The player inputs how many pucks they want to shoot, and the break duration\nbetween each shot. The app will then call out a location to hit, the player must shoot for the loction that was called out, and then set up to shoot for their next shot. \nThis training tool teaches quick release, and reaction time as the player needs to quickly adjust their shot depending on what location is called out. \n\n• Tracking - The app comes with a built in notepad that allows players to keep track of their achievements such as accuracy and shot velocity (if they have a radar\ngun). With the touch of a button the player can also instantly share how many shots they have taken with the Facebook and Twitter buttons."

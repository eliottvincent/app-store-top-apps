Short videos show how to execute the individual steps correctly from several different perspectives - in real time, slow motion and with diagrams. In order to study individual movement sequences in greater detail, it is possible to move the pictures both forwards and backwards individually. \nStill pictures with explanatory texts illustrate the crucial phases of the movement and help users improve their technique so as to ski more efficiently.\nOnce the app has been downloaded, the videos can be played without an Internet connection. Thanks to its functional design, the app can be used directly on the ski trail."

Perhaps bored and passing time, or just stuck at home in silence.\nIt's been far too long since you last hit the court and worked up a good old sweat, am I right?\n\nYou'd go through the old familiar motions, as if on auto-pilot.\nLoading up that shot, arms tensing, and then a flick of the wrists:\nSwish. No basketball to play with, but your motions are on point!\n\nThe good old days flew by faster than you can shout 'travel!'.\nThat's youth for you. It came, now it's went.\nOr so you thought...\nYet now, that imaginary basketball's back in virtual form. He shoots! He scores!\nNothing beats that sound, that classic, weirdly satisfying\nSWISH!\nSo now you're up on your feet again, heart racing.\nYou're alone no longer! That's right! We get you, man!\nWe made AirShot: a game just for you!\n\nThere's the effortless motion recognition. The pinpoint spatial audio simulation.\nAnd it all comes together to recreate that satisfying swish.\n\nOnce a baller, always a baller.\nNo matter how tough life gets, you can always AirShot that stress away!\n\nHere's to each and every MVP out there, on the court or elsewhere!\n——————————————\n[How to Play]\nWear your watch according to the instructions shown to have it recognize your throwing motions, and you'll hear that old familiar swish. Nothin' but net!\n\n1. There's a chance you'll hear a clang as you hit the rim, missing the shot. There's a whole bunch of hidden secrets...\n2. On top of shooting hoops SFX, there's actual shooting SFX, whip noises, and more... We're adding heaps of new sounds with each update, and more gameplay for you to enjoy too."

      "label": "Avy savvy backcountry skiers and riders know that three things count when it comes to the terrain’s influence on avalanches: the slope, the elevation, and the (compass) aspect. And the Avalanche Inclinometer delivers all three. Sure, you can find plenty of inclinometer apps (also known as clinometers) that are designed for carpenters, but Steve's Avalanche Inclinometer is meant for people who spend time in avalanche terrain. \n\nThis app shows the slope, elevation, and aspect in BIG FONTS which are perfect for tired eyes in stormy (or bright-and-too-sunny) weather. And it doesn’t display a gaggle of tiny buttons and widgets to decipher when you should be skiing.\n\nYou can sight across a slope by holding your phone parallel to the slope, or you can sight up or down a slope by sighting along the long-edge of your phone like a gunsight. (Through-the-camera sighting is nifty when the light is just right, but it often isn't.)\n\nWhen you have your phone aligned with the slope, a single tap on the screen will lock the data so you can read it. The Avalanche Inclinometer will even speak to you as you’re measuring the steepness so you won’t need to look at the screen. And the BIG inclinometer dial changes colors based on the slope which provides instant feedback on how the steepness of the terrain is contributing to the likelihood of an avalanche.\n\nAfter measuring the slope, you can tap a single button to share your current GPS location, the slope in degrees, and the elevation. The email includes kml and gpx waypoint files, and a link that will let you quickly see the location in any browser. You can enter the email address one time and the Avalanche Inclinometer will remember it for next time. Less typing; more skiing.\n\nThe Avalanche Inclinometer isn’t free, but apps don’t grow on trees. To buy this app you’ll spend less than buying a beer at a ski resort—think of it as buying Steve a beer!\n\nIn addition to the Avalanche Inclinometer, it is important that you take an avy class, pay attention to the avalanche red flags, use good route finding techniques, and practice your avalanche rescue skills frequently"

Talk to the scoreboard guru and offer to play music during the games. Nothing simpler, get the app, setup your playlist with the perfect start time for each song, and plug your phone to the rink's audio system. That's it! All the kids will vote for you to play at all the games now. You will see, the time at the rink will fly and you will be looking forward to the next game like never before and you will never freeze again. I wrote that app for my son, it changed the way I see rinks now. The team was even convincing home teams we were visiting to let me play music for the travel games!   \n\nThis is the perfect Dad's app for Ice Hockey Entertainment music management and playlist. Play Pump up Songs, Face Off, and Crowd Power Up to cheer up for your team. \n\n24 songs included in this version of the app. These songs by Audionautix and Kevin MacLeod are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution license. The 36 buttons of the app can be reprogrammed with any of your own songs from your iTunes library. (Horns, Organs, ...). \n\nThe latest addition is a full screen of your best team teams' Horns! It comes included! If I am missing your favorite team, contact me on instagram @HockeyDJApp.\n\n12 suggested links to iTunes titles which will pump up your kid's team.\n\nEvery button is customizable and can be set to point to the songs you own in your iTunes Local Library (No need for iTunes Cloud Subscription). You can purchase more screens if you want, up to 15 extra screens giving you a total of 216 customizable buttons.\n\nThe cool thing about the buttons is that you can set you own starting time per song, placing the play button at the best moment of the song to have a maximum effect on your DJ skills and for the please of the parents and players at the rink.\n\nThe \"Horn\" and \"1min Left in the game\" buttons are also customizable, and now you can recall the previous song after playing a goal announcement.\n\nVia InApp purchase, you can record your own voice for quick announcements and set on the \"1min Left Button\" (or on any other buttons).\n\nWith additional inApp purchases, you can play announcements for Penalties, by selecting : The voice, the player, the team, the time and type of penalty. Then you just need to press the ready and play button. With version 5.0 and above, you can also record player roster names. This will be played on demand when you announce penalties. You can even use it to record your own announcements and play them on the rink speakers as you would play any songs from the app.\n\nDisclaimer : Copyrighted songs (120 suggested) are not included in the Apps. This latest version will let you use your iTunes Cloud Music Subscription to select your songs. From the Settings screen, you can find a button to pre-load each screen with specific startup time for each song."

      "label": "The TRACT Optics Impact Ballistics mobile application takes the guesswork out of long-range shooting and provides data to help the most experienced shooter as well as the beginner or novice. This mobile application is one of the most comprehensive databases of information available today. With virtually every modern ammunition manufacturer’s information listed shooters can match any TRACT rifle scope reticle to their exact cartridge. Simply select your scope, then your ammo/bullet the program will calculate the bullet drop information as it pertains to your reticle automatically. If you cannot find your particular round of ammunition in the program, simply add the Ballistic Coefficient (B.C.) and Muzzle Velocity to the program and you will be good to go. With the ability to import current weather conditions the Impact program will provide up to date Bullet Drop Compensation to help you make accurate shots in the field or at the range. While the mobile application is designed to provide ballistic date without an internet connection, when the user has an internet connection, they are able to access our complete library of videos, articles, and blogs. Simply navigate to the Learn section of the app and you can access the Getting Started section for Rifle Scopes, Binoculars and Spotting Scopes as well as Pro Shooting Tips with videos detailing How To videos showing how to maximize the performance of your optic. You can even shop our complete line of Optics and Accessories right from the App. This app will be continually updated with new ammunition information, new product releases and videos. Selectable options include Meters or Yards, Drag Table, Spin Drift, Sight Height, Printable Dope and BDC cards, the ability to compare loads, atmospheric conditions (manual entry or automatic import), wind direction, sight setting/zero calculator and much more. The program is capable of providing ballistic data out to 2,500 yards. The BDC card allows the shooter to print out a “cheat sheet” that can show the bullet drop at each magnification (for Second Focal Plane scopes) The Dope card provides velocity, energy, path, drop, wind drift, time of flight, # of click value and MOA or MRAD info in 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 yard increments. Weather/Atmospheric conditions can be automatically imported thanks to our direct link to World Weather Online, or you can manually enter the Temperature, Altitude, Barometric Pressure and Humidity through the Conditions section. The conditions section also allows the user to enter Bullet Wind Drift information such as wind speed and direction and provide data in inches, MOA or MRAD. The sight settings section is a great resource for shooters who would like to zero their rifle at a further distance then they are able to shoot. For example, if a user only has access to a 100-yard range but would like his rifle to be zeroed at 200 yards, the Sight Setting section will show the user where his bullet needs to impact on a 100-yard target to be zeroed at 200 yards. Our goal for this app is that it provides you with a comprehensive resource for everything and anything related to TRACT Optics…Where you Belong."

By freedivers, for freedivers, our freedive apnea trainer helps you with static apnea tables and lung capacity training so you can effectively increase the time when diving underwater.\r\nSee why STAmina Apnea Trainer is one of the best apnea apps to improve the breath-holding time for freediving, scuba diving and spearfishing, as well as surfing, running, and other water sports with 6 different apnea tables types.\n\n\r\n■ FREEDIVING & SPEARFISHING APNEA TRAINER FEATURES:\n\n\r\n◉ 6 APNEA TABLE OPTIONS \r\nSTAmina Apnea Trainer can create / generate custom apnea (exercises that are automatically created based on the maximum breath-hold and match the user’s level) or let you select from the following customizable table types:\r\n\r\n- O2 deprivation table – accustoms a body to lower oxygen levels. This is achieved by increasing the amount of time that you hold your breath on each attempt, while the resting time is fixed.\r\n\r\n- CO2 Tolerance table – helps a body to adapt to high carbon dioxide levels. This is achieved by decreasing the length of resting time between fixed breath-hold periods.\r\n\r\n- Wonka table – a variation of CO2 tables. Apnea timer starts after the first contraction, the rest time takes one breath.\r\n\r\n- Mix table – tables where apnea time increases and rest time decreases with each round.\r\n\r\n- Custom table – allows mixing of different approaches to create a custom training, thus generating the most effective training program.\r\n\r\n- Pranayama – a breathing technique to decrease stress in the body and relax the nervous system.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ APPLE HEALTH SYNCRONIZATION \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED TRAINING WITH VARYING DIFFICULTY\r\nWhen you start working with the application, you set your personal record in breath holding. Based on this data, the app will offer a personalized training program with exercises of 3 difficulty levels to choose from: easy, normal, and hard.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED EXERCISE SETTINGS \r\nEach exercise can be edited by setting your own number of repetitions, breath hold time, rest time, etc.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ TRAINING REMINDERS \r\nGet the notification to start your apnea training. Set a reminder in the apnea diver app for the day and the time & get a notification to do a breath holding training session.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONAL STATISTICS AND DETAILED TRAINING HISTORY\r\nAll your workouts and exercises are recorded in the freedive trainer app to track the detailed progress of each training.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ VOICE GUIDANCE\r\nTraining may be accompanied by voice guidance with male/female voices recorded by professional voice actors. STAmina supports English, French, Russian voice guidance.\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n◉ HEART RATE AND OXYGEN SATURATION TRACKING\r\nTrack your heart rate while doing breath holding exercises (a compatible HR monitor or pulse-oximeter is required) \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CONTRACTIONS TRACKING \r\nUse our freedive trainer to track unlimited contractions, analyse captured data after exercises\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CLOUD SYNC / BACKUP\r\nAccess your data on multiple devices and easily restore it in case you switch devices/phones.\n\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\nStamina Apnea Trainer allows training breath hold effectively for anyone who cares about all kinds of diving including:\r\n> beginner or professional freedivers;\r\nspearfishers;\r\n> scuba divers to learn how to dive longer on one tank;\r\n> surfers in case of unexpected breath hold;\r\n> underwater sports athletes such as underwater rugby, hockey, etc.\r\n> runners who want to train breath holding & high tolerance to CO2 while running\r\n\r\n_______\r\nInfo https://getstamina.app/\r\nContact https://www.facebook.com/staminamobile/\r\nSupport hello@squarecrowdapps.com"

The same old stickhandling drills get boring and you can't afford a private stickhandling instructor. Well.... you can now!\n\nDangleTime is your private stickhandling coach on your phone. Anytime you want to work on your stickhandling just pull out your phone and get training. \n\nThe app keeps track of your \"DangleTime\" which is the amount of time you spend practicing using the app. This time can be shared and compared with friends. Who can get the highest DangleTime? The higher your DangleTime the more you can level up, go from a Duster to an All-Star!\n\nThe app comes with 3 free training packs. Each training pack contains 8 stickhandling drills. When you select a training pack a drill will play for 20 seconds with a 10 second break and then the next drill will play until all drills in that pack have played. These times can be adjusted in the settings menu. \n\nIf you'd like more stickhandling drills you can purchase them and continue to challenge yourself and improve your stickhandling. \nAll drills are demonstrated by Jeremy Rupke from How To Hockey with plans to add new drill packs from more hockey instructors. \n\nShow me your DangleTime with #DangleTime on Instagram and Twitter and follow me @howtohockey"

You can use Dive Log at the dive site or on the dive boat to capture the information about the site while it is fresh in your mind (or your dive guide's mind). You can even capture the GPS coordinates of the dive site using the built in location services of your iOS device. Details about your actual dive can be added immediately after your dive or at the après dive event and later be saved to your desktop computer. The dive buddy feature is fully integrated with Contacts on your iPhone or iPad, letting you capture information about your newest dive buddy or quickly add an existing buddy to a particular dive. The dive data and statistics features let you have an immediate answer the next time your dive guide asks how much weight you used on your last dive or have all the information you need about your dive history when you fill out that next dive waiver.  Metric and Imperial values are supported for all appropriate logbook fields. You can easily enter values using the appropriate units for the situation and view them in your preferred measurement system. You can even explore detailed dive profiles from popular dive computers that you download with your desktop software and later upload to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad. Dive profile data can also be transferred directly from certain dive computers directly via Bluetooth or using a supported Bluetooth accessory and an associated in-app purchase.  \n\nOn Windows, Diving Log 6.0 (www.divinglog.de) is fully integrated with Dive Log on iPhone/iPad and has built in synchronization. Diving Log 6.0 has extensive support for importing data from dive computers and other dive log applications. \n\nOn Mac OS X, logbook information can be imported to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad from a number of compatible applications using the free Dive Log Manager application available from More Mobile Software (www.moremobilesoftware.com/divelog-sync). Dive Log DT (available on the Mac App Store) can be used to directly import a number of dive computers and file formats and can synchronize with Dive Log on iOS.\n\nDive data can be directly downloaded on a Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch from Bluetooth LE capable dive computers such as the Suunto EON Steel, Suunto EON Core, Suunto D5, Scubapro Galileo 2 (G2), Aladin Sport (Matrix), Aladin H (Matrix), G2 HUD, Aladin A1, Shearwater Teric, Peregrine, Petrel 2, Perdix, Perdix AI, NERD 2, Oceanic VTX, Pro Plus 4, Geo 4.0, VEO 4.0, Aeris A300CS, Aqualung i300C, i550C, i750TC, i770R, Sherwood Wisdom 4, Mares Genius and certain heinrichs weikamp OSTC computers as well as the DiveNav Inc. bluebuddy and Tech Buddy dive logger accessories. Supported Bluetooth LE accessories are available separately.\n\nMares Bluelink Pro is a Bluetooth LE accessory by Mares and available for purchase separately (www.mares.com). The Bluelink Pro allows you transfer dive data from certain Mares dive computers (Puck Pro, Smart, Smart Air, Quad and Quad Air) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nDive Computer Buddy (aka DCbuddy) is a Bluetooth LE accessory by DiveNav Inc. (note that the DCbuddy itself is no longer available). The DCbuddy allows you transfer dive data from certain dive computers (including models from Suunto, Oceanic, Aqualung, Aeris, Sherwood, Tusa and Mares) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch."

Even shouting players won't fool our Break Recognition technology.\n\nFind out why professional pool players are using and recommending Break Speed to others.\n\nOur collaboration with Predator has been very effective. It's been great to work with a team that understands the science of billiards. The Predator R&D team has been testing the application along side their own speed measurement equipment and the Iron Willie robot,  following a number of testing sessions, the Predator R&D team found the application so accurate that a partnership in pool science began.\n\n\"The application is really spot on.

These quality sounds are custom made, hand recorded sets from hunting enthusiast and author Douglas Boze.\n\nAll Sets can be loops and you can even choose a custom delay duration before the Set will play again. This delay is associated with each Set, so you can program the delay specifically for the Sets you use the most.\n\nPick your favorite background image to customize the App from 5 pre-selected images taken in the field.\n\nThe App supports the use of a bluetooth speaker (if you have one) to play the Sets at a distance from your location in addition to using the speakers on your phone directly.\n\nSupports a 'dark mode' that will reduce the brightness of the screen, reducing any light pollution that might otherwise be a problem in a low light situation."

This app allows the user to select the type of clay target they are shooting, select the distance of the target, and the angle to get recommendations for the correct choke to use, and the estimated lead for the target.  Using this app will help the user become a more successful shooter.\n\nIn addition to the choke and lead recommendations this app has a Shotgun Vault which allows the users to catalog their firearms and the chokes they already have for them.  There is also a feature within the vault where the user can store notes about each firearm such as bore sizes, serial numbers, and any other notes the user wishes to save.  All of this information is securely stored within the cloud, only accessible to you.  This can be a very helpful feature to save notes about the user’s favorite firearms.\n\nAfter entering firearm information into the Shotgun Vault, the user will see an add to cart icon appear on the main Choke Selection screen when they do not own a specifically recommended choke.  From this add to cart icon, the user can painlessly order chokes to fill in their set through the Briley Best Shot App.  \n\nAs an added bonus, any chokes purchased through the Briley Best Shot App will qualify for a 10% discount!"

      "label": "Do you love polework but have run out of ideas how to use your poles? Are you looking to engage your horse’s brain as well as their body in a fun and beneficial way? Do you get bored in the arena and need to help finding new ways to keep both you and your horse entertained?\n\nIf the answer is yes to any of the above then you need the Polework Patterns App by Fancy Footwork Equestrian  in your life! \n\nThis app includes 40 different layouts (20 main and 20 random) which are designed to be multi directional and use between one and twenty poles. There are several unique features including:\n\n- the option to search for layouts based on the amount of poles you want to use:\n   • 1–5 poles\n   • 6–10 poles \n   • 11–15 poles \n   • 16–20 poles \n\n- the option to search for exercises based on what area of a horse’s development you want to focus on – here you will find 15 categories including \n   • Balance \n   • Core \n   • Engagement \n   • Response to rider \n   • ... and more!\n\n- a random button which can be used if you can’t decide which layout to go for, or if you like to live a little dangerously! Either way press that random button, watch the poles spin, the confetti fall and then marvel as your layout is revealed! \n\n- all of the layouts have different suggested exercises to use (four options for the main layouts and two options for the random layouts), each of which are colour-coded to show which pace to use, and a proposed difficulty rating attached to help you decide if that exercise is suitable to your horse’s stage of training.\n\n- 120 potential exercises with four suggestions given per exercise as to what areas it could help your horse improve on. (Flexibility, straightness etc) \n\n- a “Favourites” folder where you can add any of the 80 exercises used in the main layouts for quick and easy access.\n\nPolework patterns was developed by the creator of Fancy Footwork Equestrian, Nina Gill. Nina is a qualified coach who runs Polework clinics full-time and is passionate about her work and the many benefits of polework. This passion has led to Fancy Footwork Equestrian collaborating with some of the U.K.’s biggest equestrian YouTubers and influencers, as well as having Polework training articles printed in three of the biggest equine magazines to date. \nWith this app you will never run out of Polework ideas, even the biggest layouts have been designed to be broken down into smaller sections so that those sections can be used as a standalone layout if you don’t have enough poles to build the whole thing."

Simple and straightforward to use, the app uses the sound generated by tapping the strings to calculate the tension with high accuracy. In addition, the interactive swingweight calculator aids in customizing your racquet to fit your own stroke pattern, while the stiffness calculator allows you to simulate different racquet configurations. \n\nRacquetTune not only makes it easier to decide when it is time to restring, it is also an invaluable tool when testing different racquets and strings and in identifying which of your racquets is best suited for different types of games. RacquetTune also allows you to check whether your stringer is consistent in his work. \nRacquetTune includes the following user-friendly tools:\n\nTension measurement \n- Quickly determines the tension and stringbed stiffness. \n- Able to detect changes in tension as small as 0.1 kg/0.2 lb.\n- An accuracy indicator ensures results are consistent. \n- Graphical presentation of sound waves helps you find the ideal way of tapping the strings. \n- Settings can be customized to serve tennis, squash, racquetball and badminton racquets, respectively. \n- View the tension history for each racquet as a list or a graph.\n- Email a spreadsheet with test data.\n\nSwingweight calculator \n- Add as many weights as you wish to the frame. \n- Move and change weights to visualize how swingweight, balance and sweet spot location are affected.\n- Enter target values for the racquet and let RacquetTune distribute the weights automatically.\n\nStiffness calculator \n- Simulate various racquet and string configurations\n- Vary tension, string type and racquet head size. \n- Shows load-displacement curves, stiffness and elastic energies \n- Handles the large deformations encountered in actual play \n\nView a demo video at racquettune.com\n\nRacquetTune has been featured in tennis magazines in USA, Italy, France, Germany, Sweden and Norway. \n\n\"The app is very, very impressive. I get more tension diagnostic questions than just about anybody in the universe, so this is a very good thing to be able to recommend.\" \nJonathan Wolfe \nUS Racquet Stringers Association\n\nNote, that the actual string tension in the racquet and the setting seen on a stringing machine are two different things and therefore incomparable - more information can be found at racquettune.com."

Wouldn’t it be great to be able to dive deeply with one big breath and take incredible pictures for your friends at home? The Apnea Trainer makes it possible! By using it to train three times a week, you can quickly double your underwater time.\n\nThis is the same training principle used by apnea divers. It’s based on a yoga technique which strengthens the diaphragm muscles allowing you to fill your lungs with more oxygen and releasing more carbon dioxide while exhaling. The system is relatively simple and depends on finding the right time intervals which are provided by the program, thus letting you relax and concentrate on your breathing. This will guarantee maximum training success.\nThe program will also come in handy just before the actual dive since a pranayama mode is already included. The Apnea Trainer will help you keep your whole body calm and give you the perfect preparation for those amazing, long-lasting dives. \n\n\nFeatures:\n+ Training to improve free diving time\n\n+ Pranayama mode to calm your body before diving or snorkeling\n\n+ Custom time settings for pro divers\n\n+ Optical and Audio instructions\n\n+ Easy to use interface\n\nUpdated user interface with the help of Bjoern Maser by www.minimalist.ch."

Determining the solunar period is therefore useful for activities such as birdwatching, fishing or hunting. There are two major and two minor solunar periods each day. The time at which each solunar occurs varies depending on the date and on your geographical location.\n\nThe app helps you to determine the solunar period and expected animal activity index (where 6-point is when animals are most active). It also tells you the exact sunrise, sunset, sun transit, moon rise, moon set, and moon transit times, alone with moon phase. The app can utilize your iPhone's build-in GPS to obtain your geographical location. In case you are using iTouch or without GPS signal, the app also accepts user input of longitude and latitude. \n\n\nFEATURES:\n.Locations: GPS or Manual Entry\n.Major & Minor Periods\n.Activity Index\n.Moonrise / Moonset Times\n.Moon Phase Data\n.Sunrise / Sunset Times\n.Sun Transit\n.Moon Transit\n.Day / Week View\n.Any Date\n.Any Location - Worldwide\n\nNo network is needed.

Internal barometer is used on supported devices for better precision. If more accuracy is needed, a portable weather station can also be used. Application can run without GPS, WiFi and internet, in this case user has to give the weather data manually.\n\n• For each carburetor configuration, the following values are given: main jet, needle type, needle position, pilot jet, air screw position, throttle valve size, spark plug\n• Fine tuning for all these values\n• History of all your jetting setups\n• Graphic display of fuel mix quality (Air/Flow Ratio or Lambda)\n• Selectable fuel type (gasoline with or without ethanol, Racing fuels available, for example: VP C12, VP 110, VP MRX02, Sunoco)\n• Adjustable fuel/oil ratio\n• Mix wizard to get the perfect mix ratio (fuel calculator)\n• Carburetor ice warning\n• Possibility of use automatic weather data or a portable weather station\n• If you don't want to share your location, you can manually select any place in the world, the carburetor setups will be adapted for this place\n• let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, meter and feet for altitude, liters, ml, gallons, oz for fuel, and mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg atm for pressures\n\nValid for the following 2T models from 1998 to 2023:\n• 50 SX\n• 50 SX Mini\n• 50 Supermoto\n• 60 SX\n• 65 SX\n• 65 XC\n• 85 SX \n• 105 SX\n• 125 SX \n• 125 SXS\n• 125 EXC\n• 125 XC-W\n• 125 MXC\n• 125 EXE\n• 125 Supermoto\n• 144 SX\n• 150 SX\n• 150 XC \n• 150 XC-W\n• 200 SX\n• 200 EXC\n• 200 XC\n• 200 MXC\n• 200 EGS\n• 200 XC-W\n• 250 SX\n• 250 SXS\n• 250 XC\n• 250 XC-W\n• 250 EXC\n• 300 EXC\n• 300 XC\n• 300 XC-W\n• 300 MXC\n• 380 SX\n• 380 EXC\n• 380 MXC\n• Freeride 250 R\n\nThe application contains four tabs, which are described next:\n\n• Results: In this tab main jet, needle type, needle position, pilot jet, air screw position, throttle valve, spark plug are shown. These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine configuration given in the next tabs.\n  This tab lets do a fine tuning adjustment for all this values to adapt to the concrete engine.\n  Besides this jetting information, the air density, density altitude, relative air density, SAE - dyno correction factor, station pressure, SAE- relative horsepower, volumetric content of oxygen, oxygen pressure are shown too.\n On this tab, you can also share your settings with your colleagues.\n  You can also see in a graphic form the calculated ratio of air and fuel (lambda).\n\n• History: This tab contains the history of all carburetor setups.\n  This tab also contains your favorite carburetor configs.\n\n• Engine: You can configure in this screen the information about the engine, that is, engine model, year, spark manufacturer, fuel type, oil mix ratio.\n\n• Weather: In this tab, you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. \n  Also this tab allows to use the GPS to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service (you can choose one weather data source from several possible) to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity).\n  In addition, this application can work with a pressure sensor built into the iPhone. You can see if it is available on your device and turn it on or off.\n  Also, on this tab, you can enable alerts about possible carburetor icing.\n\n\nIf you have any doubt about using this App, please, contact us.

Create multiple rosters including scheduled substitutions and optional libero(s).  Track possession, score, time-outs, substitutions, libero swaps, and rotations during a set.  Includes support for rally or sideout scoring, side switches, libero serving, and non-standard start/end scores.  Replaces and far exceeds the functionality of a plastic rotation locator costing $8-10...it even reminds you when you have scheduled substitutions!  Made by volleyball coaches for volleyball coaches – we use it ourselves for every match.\n\n\"Used the app for about 6 matches now and I love it. Thank you for this as it is exactly what I have been needing. A feature that I didn't really notice right away and have come to love is the 'undo' screen. A great tool when you have to prove where the score keeper made a mistake!\" - Coach Scott\n\nPlease click on Reviews (select \"All Versions\")  to see other reviews of VBLT from coaches like you.  Thanks and please keep those reviews coming so others can find us and join the thousands of coaches already using Volleyball Lineup Tracker! :)\n\n\nFor the best results, when you first start, run through the tutorial at http://tinyurl.com/VBLineupTrackerTutorial to get familiarized with the app. (Note: this has not been updated for recent versions of the app yet, but should still be very helpful for the basic features.)"

      "label": "* Seamlessly integrates OpenWeatherMap, MET Meteorologisk institute, Amazon weather data, GPS and phone's onboard barometer to quickly and accurately calculate your air density, density altitude and rest very useful for tuners and aviators data\n\n* Works great without cellular connection or barometer\n\n* Сan work without access to your current location (we care about your privacy), you can manually select any place in the world on the map and get data for this place\n\n*Get weather via Bluetooth using weather stations: Kestrel DROP, Kestrel 5x00, WeatherFlow WEATHERmeter, Skywatch BL\n\nThis app provides:\n- Air Density\n- Density Altitude\n- Relative Air Density (RAD)\n- Dew Point\n- SAE - Dyno Correction Factor\n- SAE - Relative Horsepower\n- Station Pressure\n- Saturation Vapor Pressure\n- Virtual Temperature\n- Actual Vapor Pressure\n- Cumulus Cloud Base Height\n- Dry Air\n- Dry Air Pressure\n- Volumetric Content of Oxygen\n- Oxygen Pressure\n\nThis app can obtain automatically the position and altitude to get the temperature, pressure and humidity from the nearest weather station thought internet. Internal barometer is used on supported devices for better precision (from iPhone 6/6+ and newer iPads). If more accuracy is needed, a portable weather station can also be used. Application can run without GPS, WiFi and internet. If you're in internet range, you don't need to supply any data. If you're out of internet range, all you need to supply is the outside air temperature.\n\nGreat tool for pilots, drag racers, engine tuners, or anyone who needs to conveniently find their Air Density, Density Altitude, Dyno Correction Factor and rest of calculated data.\n\nNo ads or in-app purchases.\n\nThe application is made up of three tabs that are described next:\n\n• Results: In this tab are shown:\n- Air Density\n- Density Altitude\n- Relative Air Density (RAD)\n- Dew Point\n- SAE - Dyno Correction Factor\n- SAE - Relative Horsepower\n- Station Pressure\n- Saturation Vapor Pressure\n- Virtual Temperature\n- Actual Vapor Pressure\n- Cumulus Cloud Base Height\n- Dry Air\n- Dry Air Pressure\n- Volumetric Content of Oxygen\n- Oxygen Pressure\n\n In addition, the parameters used for the calculations are showed and can be changed (time, temperature, humidity, pressure and altitude).\n For each of the parameters there is a detailed explanation (just tap on any parameter).\n\n• History: This tab contains the history of all calculating data. If you change the weather, the new data will be saved in history.\n\n• Weather: In this tab, you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. \n  Also this tab allows to use the GPS to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service (you can choose one weather data source from several possible) to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity).\n  You can manually select which type of atmospheric pressure you are working with (for example if you use portable barometers, weather stations):\n- sea level pressure QNH\n- sea level pressure QFF\n- station pressure (barometric pressure)\n  In addition, this application can work with a pressure sensor built into the iPhone. You can see if it is available on your device and turn it on or off.\n  Also, on this tab, you can enable alerts about possible carburetor icing.\n\nThe app let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, meter and feet for altitude, and mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg y atm for pressures.\n\n\nIf you have any doubt about using this App, please, contact us. We answer every question, and we take care of all comments from our users to try to improve our software. We are also users of this application."

      "label": "Ice Time: Hockey Zone Timer is the perfect way to track your team's time spent on offense or defense.  It’s a powerful little tool that gives teams the ability to have solid numbers to use during post-game briefings.\r\n\r\nWith a design that's intended to be \"heads up\", you can keep your eye on the game and simply tap the offensive or defensive zone as the puck moves during gameplay.  A second tap in the active zone stops the clock for stoppages in gameplay. \r\n\r\nThe team setup is a snap: Just select the end of the rink the teams will start from--as viewed from YOUR seat.  At the start of each new period Ice Time: Hockey Zone Timer will move your teams to the opposite ends as the goalies change positions. You never need to transpose where your team is. Left is left and right is right!\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the game, you'll get a break down by period (for either team selected) of time spent on offense or defense. From there you can share a screen shot or text report with a single touch.\r\n\r\nYour team names will be saved for the next game.\r\n\r\nLook for “Ice Time Plus: Complete Ice Hockey Utility”, coming soon to the iPad.  There you’ll combine the Hockey Zone Timer with a music player and a customizable soundboard to store your goal horns without having to swipe between apps."

      "label": "The iSnipe app is a training tool that will help hockey players improve their shot. The player will benefit from video teaching tips, a shot counter, two training tools, and a tracking page\nLearn more about each benefit the app delivers below\n\nThe training tools include\n• Shot Counting for all shots\n• Video tips for all shots, advanced shooting tips\n• A buzzer beater\n• A quick release training tool\n• A notepad to keep track of goals and achievements \n\nLearn more about each training tool below\n\n• Shot counting - The first screen allows players to input the number of shots they have taken. This encourages the players to continue shooting in an effort\n to reach 10 000 shots. The shot counting screen can be used to keep track of slapshots, wrist shots, back hands, and snap shots. \n\n• Video Teaching Tips - The app comes with 4 shooting tips for each type of shot. The main video will teach proper technique, while the following three videos for \neach shot type will give tips on advanced shooting methods. The advanced shooting tips will help keep shooting practice fun, and also teach the player new ways to use each shot\n\n• Training - The app comes with two training tools, the buzzer beater and the quick release. \n\n•• The buzzer beater is a count down clock with a built in delay to allow players to prepare for the first shot after hitting the start button. The countdown clock\nduration can be set by the player. The player can use the buzzer beater clock to see how many shots they can take in a set amount of time, how many times they can hit the net\nfrom different distances in a given time, how many targets they can hit in a given time, etc. Use the buzzer beater for all types of shots, and keep track of how many shots\nyou are taking with the shot counter\n\n•• The quick release tool will train the player to shoot the puck quickly and accurately. The player inputs how many pucks they want to shoot, and the break duration\nbetween each shot. The app will then call out a location to hit, the player must shoot for the loction that was called out, and then set up to shoot for their next shot. \nThis training tool teaches quick release, and reaction time as the player needs to quickly adjust their shot depending on what location is called out. \n\n• Tracking - The app comes with a built in notepad that allows players to keep track of their achievements such as accuracy and shot velocity (if they have a radar\ngun). With the touch of a button the player can also instantly share how many shots they have taken with the Facebook and Twitter buttons."

These are just a few of the day to day conveniences this app will help achieve:\n\n - Pair your watch as a proper vehicle key, just like your phone! Works under all conditions, including in underground parking garages or in the middle of a desert!\n\n - Forgot to plug in? Get a notification if vehicle is in a pre-configured location and not plugged in - all done directly on the watch, no external servers required, keeping your privacy!\n\n - Add the graphic corner complication to your watch face and enjoy the convenience of having easy access to state of charge, charging indicator, time remaining if charging, sentry mode active indicator and indicator if any windows, doors or trunks are open. All from one complication, that also will launch the app when tapped. \n\n - During and after charge, a panel will show how much energy was added. Convenient if you schedule your charge during the night - wake up each morning and easily check how much energy was added to the battery. \n\n - If you have multiple vehicles on your account, tap the vehicle name to quickly and easily switch between them. \n\n - You can queue up commands by tapping on buttons, then put your wrist down and the commands will execute in the background when the vehicle is successfully woken up. \n\n - When you tap the unlock vehicle button, the charge port will also unlock if a charging cable is attached. That's convenience right there!\n\n - Want to reduce phantom drain? Background updates can be configured to longer intervals between updates or to only update if car is already awake or can be disabled entirely for absolutely zero impact on phantom drain.\n\n - A warning panel will show up if any doors, windows or trunks are left open. Conveniently, you can tap the panel to close any open windows.\n\n - Need to access the frunk? Just do it from your wrist - no fiddling with your phone. \n\n - Sitting comfy in the couch, but just remembered you have a road-trip in the morning? Set the charge limit to 100% - or any value really - and start charging, right from the convenience of your wrist!\n\n - Leaving the office after a long hot day? Activate the HVAC when you're on your way, and enjoy a nice cool vehicle.\n\n - When charging, tap the time remaining label to switch to show time of expected completion - no more head calculus!\n\n - Need to run a quick errand, but you don't have your phone? Unlock your vehicle from your wrist, then activate remote start and off you go. Just please be mindful that this feature requires internet connectivity on both watch and vehicle - so don't drive into the desert and leave your vehicle, or you'll get stuck there!\n\nA note about security and privacy:\nThis app accepts two types of login. Either Tesla account credentials or a Tesla API token. Your account credentials are never stored in the app, but are used only once to obtain an authentication token and refresh token directly from the Tesla API server. If you would rather supply that token yourself, you can do so instead. It is required to supply a refresh token. Your token will be persisted in the app. Tokens will be revoked if you change your Tesla account password. No network traffic will ever be emitted from this app that goes anywhere other than directly to the Tesla API servers, unless the OPTIONAL cloud processing is enabled, in which case an in-flight encrypted ACCESS token with a lifespan of 8 hours will be transmitted and stored ONLY WHILE COMMAND IS EXECUTING. The source code for this application will at all times be made available to any security researcher for a voluntary security and safety audit. \n\nDisclaimer: \nThis app is not endorsed by Tesla Inc. Use at your own risk. No guarantee of proper function is given. Only you are responsible for any changes to your car caused by using this app.  \n\nMade in Denmark"

I also applied \nother filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an \nenvironment suitable for spirit communication.\n\nThe audio itself is made up of phonemes, \npartial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help \nspirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.\nthere are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.\n\nThese sounds banks play in a similar\nway to that of my other app \"Spiritus Ghost Box\" but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has\n8 active sound banks.\n\nWhite Noise Sound Bank:\n\nThis app also has an optional 9th sound bank called \"White noise\". \nThis bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This \naudio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the \n\"Holy Grail\" of EVP recorders. This is not a White Noise Generator, this is a normal sound bank like the others but this one contains white noise from the DR60.\n\nAudio Effects:\n\nThis app does contain Echo and Reverb audio effects. These have been proven \nto be the best effects to apply to ITC sessions. The echo can create audio that can be \nmanipulated within the echo itself. Echo can also help in live, real time communication by \nrepeating the audio and allowing you to better hear whats coming through. Reverb can be \napplied to the audio to create a spacious sound environment that will enhance audio manipulation."

      "label": "This professional tool called Clinometer is the most precise (all you can get with some calculations) slope measurement tool for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad using all sides of the device plus the camera. It can be used for simple applications like aligning a frame as well as for more sophisticated fields of applications where an arbitrary slope needs to be measured exactly. Read the reviews (and write your own) for all the applications you find! Thank for all your positive feedback! Please use our support link if you have questions and suggestions, we don't read the iTunes reviews every day!\n\nWith this tool, the slope can be measured by all edges of the device and through the camera. The current features include:\n\n◆ 3 Modes (incl. auto switching): Clinometer mode (auto when holding upright), Camera mode (any direction, manual activation) and Bubble level (smoothly fading in when holding flat).\n\n◆ Relative angles: Besides measuring absolute angles, for every mode you can measure the relative angle between device positions\n\n◆ Advanced two way calibration on all sides: For every 4 sides plus the bubble mode you can calibrate in two steps, which allows you to calibrate exactly even on non-level surfaces. Each direction can be calibrated individually to achieve the optimal precision. \n\n◆ Speech synthesis: The device will speak the current reading, so you don't have to watch the display while measuring/aligning your object.\n\n◆ Five different unit modes: The device can display the slope in degrees (rounded or in tenth of degrees), percentage, rise over run (common for roof slope measurement in :12) and 1V:H (common in engineering)\n\n◆ Dial Rotation: You can smoothly rotate the background dial and thus define which side of the device represents 0° and 90° degrees. \n\n◆ Motion-sensitive Lock feature: Besides the common instant simple tap hold mechanism you can activate the motion-sensitive lock. If activated the device waits for the final lock until you hold your device steady enough for at least 2 seconds. You can set the lock sensitivity between 0.1° and 1.0° degrees. \n\n◆ Peer Mode: Use two devices to measure angles: One as a display, the other as the measurement device that can be attached to the hardware you want to align. \n\n◆ Fullscreen Mode: The full screen mode can be toggled by tapping the center of the screen and by the upper and lower arrows in the center. This prevents you from erroneous inputs while measuring.\n\n◆ Different color schemes: Press the S/C Button to instantly switch the color. The color can be selected differently for the bubble and the clinometer mode. The predefined color sets include day and night color schemes (Black on White, White on Black and Red). \n\n◆ Adjustable Auto-Lock: You can prevent the device from turning into the sleep mode. \n\nAccording to wikipedia: An inclinometer or clinometer is an instrument for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or inclination of an object with respect to gravity. It is also known as a tilt meter, tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. \n\nFor recreational use only. After the calibration it CAN (!) be very accurate especially for the main axis after calibration. The measurement is performed as well as possible (we try our best) by using the three inbuilt accelerometers. \n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! \n\nWe will improve the application long-term. This was the first application of this kind shortly after the opening of the App Store. Since then it is continuously updated and enriched with new features."

      "label": "Noir is a Safari extension that automatically adds a dark mode to every website you visit.\n\nIt makes browsing the web at night so much better. With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.\n\nAnd the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it is – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop. And with over 20 built-in themes and the ability to create your own, you can customize the results exactly the way you want.\n\nNoir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!\n\nBuilt from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Focus Filters and Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows. And your settings are automatically synced to all your devices using iCloud.\n\nAnd just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data. Period.\n\nNoir is made by a solo iOS developer. It does not include any subscriptions or ads. Buy Noir once, use it forever.\n\nNotes:\n• Found a website where Noir’s dark mode doesn’t look just right? Let me know by reporting it. The app will be frequently updated to address issues that are reported.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\n• The Noir extension requires access to the websites you visit to analyze the existing style of the page and to override it with Noir's dark style.\n• Noir never collects your browsing data. The only data Noir ‘collects’ are your settings, and those will never leave your device.\n• You can read Noir’s full Privacy Policy at https://getnoir.app/privacypolicy"

Multiple aviation functions can be performed on the CX-3® flight computer including those related to time, speed, distance, heading, wind, fuel, altitude, cloud base, standard atmosphere, glide, climb & descent, weight & balance, as well as a holding pattern function to help determine entry method and holding details. The CX-3® has 12 unit-conversions: Distance, Speed, Duration, Temperature, Pressure, Volume, Rate, Weight, Rate of Climb/Descent, Angle of Climb/Descent, Torque, and Angle. These 12 conversion categories contain 38 different conversion factors for over 100 functions. A calculator, clock, timer, and stopwatch are also built in along with multiple settings for lighting, backlighting, themes, time zones and more."

Ishraq prayer is 10 to 12 minutes after sunrise. There is a misconception where Islamic websites and people use the word \"Ishraq\" and then give timings for actual Sunrise. Praying at sunrise is forbidden and must be performed after at least 10 minutes of sunrise. iPray for this reason adds 10 minutes to sunrise and labels it correctly as \"Ishraaq\".\n\n* Prayer Alerts will ONLY alert you with an initial Takbir. The full azan (and its length) is NOT supported by the iOS alert mechanism as there is a maximum limit of 30 seconds of audio playback."

This app is used by BBC studios, astronomers, concert promoters, etc. \n\nVersion 5 contains the following functions:\n\n* Universal support for all iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices running iOS 8 or higher (including iPhone 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, and all of the latest iPads and iPads Pro)\n* Optimized for iOS 13 and watchOS 6, full 64 bit support\n* Alarm function with snooze (touch anywhere on the screen), volume fade-in, based on weekdays\n* Alarm time based on seconds (not minutes)\n* Local time / UTC time mode\n* Alarm notification window instead of normal alarm sound, if app is not running or in the background\n* Use playlists or a manual picker selection from your own music library as alarm sounds\n* The alarm sound is also playing when the device is muted, or the display is switched off, and also works in AirPlay environments\n* Customizable time server sources\n* Colors: green, red, blue, yellow, white, dark green, violet, pink, orange, turquoise and hidden, with a separate color option for digits, seconds and segments\n* Alternative visual display of fractional seconds (1/60th sec. resolution)\n* 12/24 hours display\n* Optional second tick sound\n* Full landscape support (including settings dialog)\n* Touching the display lets the buttons and status bar fade out\n* Touching the display again will add the current date (in all orientations)\n* Disabled screen auto-lock\n* Options \"sync at startup\", \"hourly\", \"daily\", or a sync button for manual syncing\n* The last known time delta is used when started without sync\n* \"Night mode\", which dims the display using a slider, shows the seconds with only one dot (to prevent a hard brightness switch between second 59 and second 0), switches off the tick sound, and reduces screen updates to save battery\n* To minimize burn-in effects (especially on the iPhone X OLED display), the clock is doing micro movements when running longer than 5 minutes\n* VoiceOver support\n\nAnswers to common questions:\n\n* An application can not set your device's system time, so a time sync between the atomic time and the device time is not possible.\n* If you want to wakeup with music, please do not exit the app before going to sleep (which would result in a local notification dialog without music in the morning), and do not lock your device. Be aware that running an application all the time, even without display, consumes battery, so please make sure that your iPhone is fully charged before you go to bed, connect it to your charger, or use the app's Night mode, which is much more energy-saving."

And without any measures on the part of the site owner, these personal data may be stolen. If you do not want something of the sort to happen, thing about accessing all sites via the HTTPS technology.\n\nHTTPS Now is a Safari extension (content blocker) that protects your browsing activity by automatically enabling the HTTPS protocol on all websites that you visit. By loading the HTTPS version of websites into your browser, all your traffic will be encrypted, reliable and surveillance free.\n\nAlthough major websites already encrypt the traffic by using HTTPS, it’s not guaranteed that you use this technology - sometimes is not active by default or some embedded assets are loaded through the default and unencrypted HTTP connections. Also, clicking links can redirect you to the insecure versions of sites. Actually more than 75% of websites out there still rely on unencrypted HTTP communications.\n\nThe HTTPS Now extension will fix these problems by rewriting all your requests from HTTP to HTTPS. It will also make sure that the assets from the visited websites (images, styles, scripts or ads) are transferred via the safe HTTPS and no one can steal your cookies, passwords, sessions or private data.\n\n• What is the HTTPS protocol and why should you care?\nDid you know that browsing the web in a coffee shop, airport or hotel with free internet access can be dangerous? Even your own home or company internet connection is not safe. This is because the common HTTP web traffic can be intercepted in clear text, inspected and even modified by anyone.\nHTTPS has significantly more secure since this protocol will encrypt your communications.\n\n• The benefits of the HTTPS protocol and why should you use it?\n- Faster page loading: data sent over HTTPS loads faster since the new HTTP/2 protocol is available in Safari only on encrypted communications\n- Confidentiality: no one can read your content, passwords or messages\n- Integrity: your traffic cannot be modified - for example, no key-loggers can be injected\n- Authentication: your site cannot be routed to a clone without you knowing it\n\n• Is this a VPN service?\nNo, this extension is not a VPN service, but is very efficient and safe as a VPN. This extension will make sure you are using only HTTPS in your surfing and the usage of HTTPS will make your traffic encrypted, reliable and surveillance free. Also, HTTPS is much faster than a VPN.\n\n• Support\nWe read your support emails every day, day by day.\nWrite with confidence any question, feedback or complaint and you will receive an answer in a very short period of time."

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here. Chromecast is a trademark of Google LLC."

      "label": "The HotPaw Morse Code Decoder translates Morse Code sound into text.  Just use the microphone or headset input on your iPhone or iPad for the audio signal input, and watch decoded text appear.\n\nThe Morse Code Decoder includes both an automatic decoding mode, plus manual controls to allow the decoding of weaker signals in noise and QRM.  Manually adjustable parameters include the frequency of the audio filter, the WPM dot/dash speed used for detecting characters, the threshold level of background noise, and whether Farnsworth timing is to be used for detecting spaces between individual characters.\n\nThe Morse Code Decoder includes a built-in spectrogram to help determine the audio frequency of the Morse Code tones.  Use the optional narrow-band DSP audio filter to help filter out background noise.  The audio filter works for tone frequencies from 300 to 2400 Hz.  Please do not try to decode tones outside this range.\n\nThe Morse code WPM (words per minute) detection speed is automatically adaptive from about 8 to 40 WPM, and can be locked to the current estimated WPM dot speed.  You can also manually set the WPM code speed if the automatic speed detection guesses incorrectly.  A QRQ High Speed WPM mode setting allows decoding much higher WPM speeds in the range of 30 to 80 WPM.\n\nPlease aim your iPhone microphone at the Morse Code sound source so that the iPhone's noise cancelling microphone doesn't cancel it out.  You can see if sound is getting to the iPhone by seeing a peak in the spectrum display.  Please use the manual settings if automatic decoding does not adjust to the frequency, WPM. or background noise threshold level properly.  Decoding will not work if the audio filter or WPM are set incorrectly, or there is a lot of background noise or room echoes above the threshold setting.  Please see the help file on the HotPaw website for hints as to how to solve decoding issues."

      "label": "Apart from the most reliable app for polar alignment (with or without a polar scope), PS Align pro has become the astronomer's swiss-army knife with all the tools added over the years. Remember, all features & updates are free forever, the only in-app purchases are donations (tip jar).\n\nPolar Scope Align will calculate the position of Polaris or σ Octantis in your Polar Scope reticle for your location (using your phone's GPS or manually), allowing a quick and accurate polar alignment. It is one of the few programs that are accurate in lower latitudes by correcting for atmospheric refraction (so expect results to agree only with precise software and not most simplistic \"polar align\" apps - see the \"Accuracy\" section in help for details). In the settings you can select the polar scope reticle that matches your own, from a vast collection:\niOptron old & new, Astro-Physics RAPAS & PASILL, various versions of Takahashi EM-10/11/200/400/500, NJP, PM-1, P2-Z, the latest Orion / Skywatcher, the Classic Skywatcher / Orion / Celestron / Meade / EXOS2 / Bresser, the Telrad, Rigel QuikFinder, a couple for Astrotrac / Losmandy / Kenko / Avalon, the Vixen PF-L/Atlux/SX/SXD/SXP/AXD/GP/GP-DX/Polarie Polar Axis Scopes, a Konus and several Polar Finders: Tuthill, Explore Scientific 8x50, Meade 9x60, Vixen Polaris, Celestron 7x50, Carton Optical. PoleMaster help view for South Hemisphere users. If you have one not included, just ask the developer to add it!\n\nFeature list:\n\n-Accurate calculation of Polaris or Sigma Oct for any date and location, including effect of atmospheric refraction (and annual aberration, nutation). Most other apps do not perform precision calculations, so please only compare app readings to accurate sources (USNO, scientific software etc).\n-Use device time/date/location, or enter your own, or pick from online & offline world databases via the Location Manager.\n-Approximate daytime / no polarscope polar alignment tool. Great for visual use, solar imaging (inc. eclipses) and even limited short focal length astrophotography. Now with sun shadow calibration for more accuracy!\n-Laser / Hop Align for nighttime alignment using a calibration star for obstructed or not visible polar star, or for improving laser align.\n-Full app in red-color (or alternative green, white) night mode - tools switchable to daytime view.\n-Deep Space Object (DSO) Database with 22000+ objects from several catalogs (Messier, Caldwell, NGC, IC, Herschell 400, Sharpless 2, Barnard), along with stars (Yale Bright Star) & planets. Search, apply filters, sorting, download DSS color images for all items, or get help finding them with your non-goto telescope with the Push-To function.\n-Connect to and control WiFi-enabled iOptron mounts.\n-Over 30 calculators useful for observing and astrophotography, from eyepiece magnification and field of view, to imaging resolution and reducers.\n-Xasteria: World astro-weather report based on 7Timer! data\n-Water vapor satellite images.\n-List of visible ISS and bright satellite passes.\n-Moon phase & lunar Calendar with solar/lunar rise/set and twilight times.\n-Wizard to calculate your reticle centering offset and correct or compensate for it.\n-Zoomable reticle view and customized routines & tools: Alt-az alignment error display for mounts that calculate it after star alignment (e.g. iOptron iEQ45, CEM60), polar alignment when your scope is not in zero position (for mounts like iOptron ZEQ/CEM on which you can always access the polar scope), remember zero position on Celestron / Skywatcher / Orion etc reticles.\n-Bubble level (using either gyro or accelerometer) and Compass heading, as well as magnetic declination reading.\n-GPS accuracy & elevation data.\n-Red/White/LED light.\n-Dimming slider.\n-iOptron, NexStar and Meade LX200 Star Lists.\n-Support for iPhone & iPad from iOS 9 (and iPod Touch, except tools that require the compass)."

This allows you to write your applications for use with devices such as puck.js in a language you are more familiar with (i.e. javascript) and be able to use it from your iOS device.\n\nUse the built-in console viewer to debug issues when running your site on WebBLE.\n\nSecurity is important for bluetooth device access, and so only sites that use https are supported, and it is not possible to connect to a bluetooth device without permission being granted by the user.\n\nInitially the following key APIs are supported:\n\n- bluetooth.requestDevice()\n\n- BluetoothDevice.gatt\n- BluetoothDevice.addEventListener('gattserverdisconnected', cb)\n\n- BluetoothRemoteGATTServer.connect()\n- BluetoothRemoteGATTServer.disconnect()\n- BluetoothRemoteGATTServer.getPrimaryService()\n\n- BluetoothRemoteGATTService.getCharacteristic()\n\n- BluetoothRemoteGATTCharacteristic.writeValue()\n- BluetoothRemoteGATTCharacteristic.readValue()\n- BluetoothRemoteGATTCharacteristic.startNotifications()\n- BluetoothRemoteGATTCharacteristic.stopNotifications()\n- BluetoothRemoteGATTCharacteristic.addEventListener(\"characteristicvaluechanged\", cb)"

      "label": "***THIS APPLICATION DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY SERVER SIDE SERVICE***\n\nQuantumult is a powerful proxy client.\n• Right now supports protocol Shadowsocks(r), HTTP, HTTP over TLS, SOCKS5 and SOCKS5 over TLS, VMess.\n\nIt can capture all the TCP traffic and redirect under you own way by using Filter function.\n• The filter has a few types to match. For TCP traffic that has the upper layer protocol HTTP(S), 'HOST', 'HOST-SUFFIX', 'HOST-KEYWORD', 'USER-AGENT', 'GEOIP' and 'IP-CIDR' are all supported. For the other TCP traffic, 'GEOIP' and 'IP-CIDR' are supported. Especially, when deal with HTTP(S) traffic, Quantumult has another function called Rejection, it matchs the whole URL of the HTTP(S) request.\n• After match, the filter has a lot of actions to deal with the request, built-in policy 'DIRECT', 'REJECT', 'PROXY', all your servers and your customized policies. Actually you can see all the actions as a lot of paths and you can decide which request goes through which path by using filter function.\n\nMore over, Quantumult can be a convenient web develop tool on mobile device.\n• When you on the road without the Mac platform debug tools like Charles and Wireshark, you still can use Quantumult to log parts of the web request to debug some web issues.\n• Quantumult can log all the HTTP(S) request header and response header.\n• Yes, you are right it can log the HTTPS request header and response header, be sure to install and trust Quantumult root CA for this advanced function.\n\nSince quantumult has a function called PROXY, sure it can redirect your traffic to remote proxy servers. But be clear, we do NOT provide any server side service or support, you should build your own servers.\n• Like we said early Quantumult can redirect all TCP traffic through the filter function, that means you can visit different web site through different servers by the filter. See it can accelerate your network connection if you set your filter right, and of course the filter is totally customizable.\n• About the customized policy, there are 3 different types of customized policy, 'SSID', 'Latency' and 'Static'. The 'SSID' policy depends on your network enviroment, Wi-Fi, Cellular or specific Wi-Fi with the SSID your provided. The 'Latency' policy is based on the latencies of all the servers of the policy settings, the result is the shortest(The test interval has the option of 600 or 1200 seconds). The 'Static' policy is based on your manual selection of servers or other polices from the policy settings. Sure you are right, some of polices can wrap other polices, convinent, right ?\n\nAbout working state, Quantumult can work in 3 state, 'GLOBAL', 'DIRECT' AND 'AUTO'.\n• The GLOBAL state will ignore filter settings and redirect all TCP traffic through the built-in PROXY policy(you need build and add your server first).\n• The DIRECT state will ignore filter settings and redirect all TCP traffic directly to the destination web site. How this state useful ? Yes, it can be a simple web develop tools by analizing the reqeust header and response header including HTTPS.\n• The AUTO state, we call it auto because it base on the filter you set to divide the TCP traffic through different paths, like the popular ACL way.\n\nExtra, Quantumult can also work as a HTTP proxy server for devices under the same Wi-Fi, when this function is turned on, the home view will show the IP and port for other device easily to connect.\n\n\nAt last, some attentions.\n• About the location on the map of home view. It is not the real location in the real world, it's just the IP location and might not be correct."

      "label": "What if you could take the best construction calculator and fix it.  That’s right ... you love it, it has served you well, and you stand by it ... but could it do more?  Could it be easier to use?\n\nAfter testing by pros from around the world, BuildCalc is ready to give you more - more function and more answers with less complexity, less hassle, and less confusion. \n\n\nMORE FUNCTIONALITY:\n\n• Advanced Baluster Function: Complete layout of railing and staircase balusters with less guess work - and with all the flexibility you need for every custom job.\n• Advanced Stair function: Stair layouts for professional results - including dimensioned drawings of your Stringer, Stringer Installation, and Finished Staircase.  And you can email a PDF of these drawings right from BuildCalc so you can print them or share them. \n• Fence Function: Give BuildCalc a fence row length and it will tell you how many posts, rails, pickets, and or panels you need.  \n• Interactive Functions: The Stair, Baluster, Compound Miter, and Rafter functions are now fully interactive.  Want to change input values?  Change the Run?  Switch between Regular and Irregular Hip Roof analysis?  You can do this and your results will be updated automatically - without you needing to remember what key to press. \n\n\nMORE ANSWERS:\n\n• You are no longer tied down to: only one brick, block or tile size for the masonry function; a fixed number of drywall sheet sizes; only one footer cross sectional area; or one size of shingles and sheathing.  If you don’t see the size you want, you can add as many as you need.  And for area input, you can store your custom sizes in Length x Width format, so you won’t have to do mental gymnastics to figure out what was the dimensions for that last size you stored.\n• Want to cut your hip roof rafter using a miter saw ... or a circular saw using a hand-held protractor?  With a tap of a button, BuildCalc will automatically switch between Miter Saw and Protractor results.  BuildCalc can do this for Compound Miters, too.\n• Sheathing Angles, Purlin Angles, Gable Area, Backing Angles, Plan Angles, Rough vs. Finished Stair Layout Dimensions, Stringer Throat, Stringer installation dimensions ... and a lot more not found on other construction calculators.\n\n\nLESS COMPLEXITY AND LESS HASSLE:\n\n• Tired of having to press and press and press buttons to get the results of a calculation?  BuildCalc puts an end to this.  For all advanced functions, you get ALL of your results in list form with just one or two key taps.  \n• And, rather than having to write down those results, all advanced functions allow you to save your results - as many times as you want with a label you choose - so you can recall the complete results at your convenience.  Now you can do a calculation today and two days, two weeks or two years later, it is there for you.\n• Less “quirks”.  Have you been annoyed by arcane key stroke sequences on other construction calculators?  We are too.  BuildCalc 2.1 streamlined the keystrokes to do a better job of giving you less “errors” and more results.  Don’t remember what you have to enter before a Hip Rafter or Stair calculation?  Well, now you don’t have to.  BuildCalc will provide you with a check list of inputs and on-the-spot help to get it right.\n• Drywall and Masonry “Room Mode”:  If you have stored a Length, Width and Height for a room, BuildCalc will give you the Drywall or Masonry required for the walls and the ceiling / floor - with only a tap of the Drywall or Masonry button.  No more pondering over complex key sequences ... it just works.\n\n\nNOW WITH ADVANCED STAIRS, BALUSTER, AND HIP/VALLEY FUNCTIONS\n\nGet more results than you ever could before - including dimensioned Stringer, Stringer Installation and Finished Staircase Drawings.  Drawings can then be emailed to others or printed at your convenience.  Email us and we'll send you an example!"

With WhatCall your boss with think you tried calling them while you can leave a voicemail letting them know you won't be in to work.\n\n- Returning a call to a friend or partner when you're busy and don't have time to speak to them. WhatCall will connect you straight to voicemail allowing you to leave a message without spending precious time getting drawn into a conversation.\n\n- Leaving a message for someone you know is unable to answer the phone (eg. in a meeting or putting a baby to sleep) but may have forgotten to turn off their phone.

This way it is the fastest method to calculate how much gas and e85 you need to put in the tank. It is such a fast method, by the time you get out of your car, you already know how much fuel you need to add in the tank. Literally 3 seconds.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nYou have the option to select what your current ethanol content is if you measured it with an ethanol content analyzer and the app easily calculates how much E85 and how much gas you need to add to reach your target ethanol mix.\n\nYou can also specify the ethanol content of your E85 if you measured it with an Ethanol Content Analyzer, so this way you get an exact guide as to how much E85 and how much gas you have to put in the tank.\n\nTank Capacity\n-Specify the capacity of your tank\n\nTank Percentage\n-How full is your tank\n\nE85 Ethanol Content\n-What is the Ethanol content of your E85 what you are about to put in the tank\n\nTarget Ethanol Mix\n-What your desired ethanol mix is, for example (E30 E40 E50 E60 E85)\n\nCurrent Ethanol Mix\n-What your current ethanol percentage is of your current fuel in the tank\n\nFor any questions please feel free to contact at profisoftgames@gmail.com"

      "label": "Crowd GPS Scanner App that allows the user to quickly find the most common crowd locate GPS devices such as tile. These are the devices the size of a coin that will transmit signals back to the owners for anything up to a year with just a watch battery. Before these devices came to market tracking would require larger batteries & sim cards which would become quite large and simple to find.\nHow the Crowd Locate system works:\nCrowd locate works on the basis that when a tile is paired to a phone it will stay connected to that phone whilst paired and within approx. 30ft. Once the tile device goes out of range it will start sending a signal to \"Find me\" This signal will be collected by any persons phone that runs the tile app! This is how crowd locate works, the more people having the app the more chances the tile can be pinpointed. Once the tile has come within 30ft of another mobile phone running the app it will pinpoint that exact location on a map and send that information back to the owner of the tile! This will give the owner of the tile a real time location on a map with a time when located.\nWith our App you can search all devices within approx. 30ft and the App will list all devices detected.\nThe App will only detect devices that you don't have paired to your own phone or that are currently sending out signals because they are out of range to paired device. \nThis can be put to the test if you have a tile that has been paired to your phone. When you have a tile paired to your phone and the tile app is running on your phone the Crowd GPS Scanner App will NOT list any tiles that you own. Now swipe closed the tile app and turn off your phone then turn it back on. The tile you own will now be in lost mode because it's not connected to your phone. Whilst in lost mode it will be transmitting a signal \"Find me\" so now if you open the Crowd GPS Scanner App it will now list the tile device on the screen. Stop clear the results and start the tile App which will pair to the tile. Now if you run the Crowd GPS Scanner App it will NOT list your own device."

If you want to spread the fish or tripe quantities across several days, it can do that too.\nOne, two or more meals a day ? You got it.\nSeveral pets ? No sweat !\nYou prefer pounds and ounces over grams ?

All that is required is to enter the type of fuel in the tank, the units, the amount remaining, and the amount desired - the converter will do the work.  Easily adjust and save the specific gravity, conversion factors, and the decimal places.  I you want to try before you buy check out the free version - Aviation Fuel Converter Lite.

Maintaining husbandry tasks, testing, stability, water changes, inhabitant stats etc. are all vital to keeping successful aquariums. \n\nPocket Marine was designed to make inputting, storing and keeping all information with you at ease. Often, any issues that we have with our aquariums can be linked to actions that were performed a short time beforehand. For this reason, a log of changes made, actions performed or additions can be vital when trying to decipher a problem that may be in play. Pen and paper has always been a great way to keep this information at hand but, Pocket Marine offers a place to store this somewhere that, this day and age, is with us at all times.\n\nNot just for tracking events. Pocket Marine is a great way to help you log your inhabitants into specific tanks, record your latest water change for your mixed reef tank or simply log your latest maintenance action performed on the fish only office tank. Recording your information couldnt be easier and keeping it on your mobile device saves on that frantic search incase of needing the information at a later date.\n\nHelp with that last second impulse buy at the store. With an in depth library of over 800 species of fish, invertebrates and coral and being added to daily, you will always have the information on hand that you need to make that informed decision on a purchase. \n\nWe hope you enjoy using the app and that we can help with your success in the hobby and welcome any feature requests you may have.\n\nHappy Reefing!"

      "label": "Create an ideal staircase with one simple measurement. Fine-tune the stairs to fit your space with an easy to use and understand, graphical interface. \n\nEnter the total rise, and the app calculates total run (base length or overall run), pitch (angle or slope), unit run (goings or tread), unit rise (rise or step height), and all other measurements. You can then adjust the total run to fit your available space or preferred tread materials. A feature unique to Delux Stairs fine-tunes the stringer to accommodate for differences in flooring thicknesses such as the tread thickness and upper and lower finished flooring. This ensures every step is identical, which is the difference between clumsy, dangerous, amateur stairs and professional-quality, comfortable, code-compliant stairs. Additional stair details, such as nosing, riser thickness and stringer dimensions are also calculated and adjustable.\n\nBlueprint plans can be directly printed or emailed in PDF which include platform position options, stringer peak positions, bottom step rise adjustments, top step run adjustments, and more.\n\nThe headroom clearance tool is also unique to Delux Stairs and not only shows you top floor opening requirements with adjustable floor thicknesses, but also continuous headroom obstruction clearance from the top to the bottom of the stairs.\n\n◎ No ads, notifications, permission, subscriptions or in-app purchases.\n◎ Direct visual graphic feedback for quick, easy to understand design.\n◎ Diagrams & info screens make the sometimes cryptic terms clear.\n◎ Email the finished blueprints to the client or to yourself.\n◎ Print finished blueprints on any AirPrint-compatible printer.\n◎ Takes flooring and tread thickness differences into account to ensure each step is identical to comply with building codes.\n◎ Presets for Outdoor (decking), Indoor (plywood or hardwood) or Masonry (concrete) stairs.\n◎ Perfect for open stringer and concrete designs & a great starting point for housed and box stairs.\n◎ Headroom Clearance tool for determining top floor opening as well as continuous overhead obstruction clearance.\n◎ High contrast, large text screens can be seen in bright sunlight at the job site.\n\nSettings include:\n- Imperial or Metric systems\n- Specify Preferred Target Unit Run\n- Specify Preferred Target Unit Rise\n- Select point where inches > ft or mm > meters\n- Customize Minimum Headroom"

High frequency controls the behaviour of living invaders shown promise according to different research studies.\n\nMosquitoes, Cockroaches and Mice are responded to different frequency. Even individual group of pest in different regions may vary, Pest Buzzer equips 3 different high frequencies for each group. User can switch different frequency in each group to repel the pest.\n\nHumans are unable to hear high frequency over 20kHz. There is a test button in RED colour with human ear symbol which emits 4.4kHz for user to test speaker if the device is not mute and volume has been set to maximum.\n\nThe frequency applied for Mosquitoes is in low end frequency between 11kHz to 20kHz. It is possible to be heard by your kids. If they can hear it, you may need to choose 20kHz+ frequency range.\n\nIt is important to note that ultrasonic frequencies do not travel between walls. So for the most effective pest control, ultrasonic device need to be placed in open area without obstacles."

      "label": "StopTheMadness is a Safari extension that stops web sites from making your browser harder to use. And it protects your privacy on the web. StopTheMadness is not an ad blocker: it offers unique features not available from ad blockers or any other apps. StopTheMadness is one of a kind!\n\nMade by indie developer Jeff Johnson. The support link has documentation and my email address.\n\nMany web sites deliberately disable user interface features in Safari that you normally expect to work. StopTheMadness re-enables those features for you in Safari:\n• opening contextual menus\n• selecting, copying, cutting, and pasting of text\n• drag and drop\n• AutoFill/autocomplete of passwords, emails, etc.\n• 2-finger click to open a link in a new tab\n\nStopTheMadness also protects your privacy on the web:\n• Stops Google AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages)! Automatically loads the original \"canonical\" web site page instead of Google AMP.\n• Removes tracking tags such as utm_source, gclid, and fbclid from the end of URLs.\n• Stops clickjacking in Google Search, Gmail, Facebook, and DuckDuckGo.\n• Stops hyperlink auditing (anchor \"ping\").\n• Stops tracking beacons (Navigator.sendBeacon).\n• Stops sites from using the Page Visibility API to know when a tab is visible on your screen.\n• Stops URL shorteners. Checks the links you click in Safari for well-known link shorteners — bit.ly, tinyurl.com, l.facebook.com, t.co, etc. — and loads the unshortened destination URL instead of the shortened URL. This occurs without setting any cookies or other site data, so you can't be tracked by your click.\n\nBonus Features:\n• Stop videos from autoplaying. This works even on sites where Safari doesn't stop autoplay, such as YouTube. And YouTube video ads are automatically skipped! Also stops videos from following you down the page when you scroll on many sites.\n• Stop sites in Safari from pausing your audio in a background app such as Apple Music.\n• Show native video controls. Use Picture-in-Picture from Safari on sites that don't normally support it, including YouTube!\n• Automatically select the highest video quality on YouTube!\n• Hides the annoying popup banners prompting you to get the app on Google, Google Maps, DuckDuckGo, IMDb, Instagram, Quora, Reddit, and Tumblr!\n• Font replacement. Substitute one font for another on web pages, such as Helvetica for Arial and Courier for Courier New.\n• Add your own site-specific CSS and JavaScript to web pages!\n• Custom URL redirects! Redirect new Reddit to old Reddit, Twitter to Nitter, YouTube to Invidious, etc. You can create any redirect that you want!\n• Stop keyboard page zoom. Stops the page from zooming in when you show the software keyboard!\n• Enable pinch-to-zoom on sites that prevent it, such as old reddit.\n• Stops \"Are you sure you want to leave this page?\" alerts. Close your tabs without getting stopped by the site!\n• Force external links to open in the current tab instead of a new tab. Remove target=\"_blank\" from links so that they no longer automatically create a new tab.\n• Force external links to open in a new tab instead of the current tab. This is great if you're scrolling through a list of links and want to open each one in a new tab.\n• Force images to the front. Bypass the transparent overlay on sites such as Instagram that prevents you from dragging and opening the contextual menu on images.\n• Warns when you paste or type beyond the maximum length in a password field or other text field. Stops you from accidentally losing characters!"

It will turn your phone into a Geiger Müller Counter to measure radioactivity after proper calibration. \n\n** Attention after upgrading iOS to a higher iOS do the calibrate again, as camera data properties might have changed ** \n\n\nDisclaimer: The type of radiation picked up by the camera can be dangerous/detrimental to the user's health as well as cause damage to the device. \n\nImportant note: The camera sensor can measure gamma radiation (CS137 for example) and some beta radiation (depends on the energy if the beta rays can pass through the plastic parts - for example H3 or K14 are weak sources). It cannot measure alpha rays (PO210) For AM241 though its primary a Alpha source also some gamma radiation is emitted and might be detectable for a longer measurement. Please check our homepages for examples and hints on how to measure.\nWe did calibrations with several iPod2*, IPhone 3GS*, iPhone 4*, iPhone 4S, iPhone5, iPhone 5S iPhone 6, 6s and iPad 2, iPad 3* devices at the Helmholtz Research Centre, Munich. we used a CS137 test source from 10 µGy/h till 1 Sv/h for each of the phones we had. The values are stored for a rough start on the application (all devices differ a little bit). For precise professional measurement the devices must be adjusted to the sensor which is possible with the expert setup. For personal use the defaults should be sufficient (please give us feedback). \n* = Attention some phone might not be compatible due the new version of iOS or missing features (gps precision using sim cards)- please try to use an older rev of the App which should be available according to my settings (1.3)."

From the Underwood-inspired keystrokes and bell to the randomized ink patterns, this app was designed with the authentic experience of the classic writing machine in mind.\n\nAnything you create on My Typewriter can be saved, printed, exported, and uploaded to any platform you would like. Furthermore, the page size of My Typewriter has been optimized for social media posting to give your work the highest aesthetic quality on what’s becoming the chosen platform for the modern day poet. \n\nSome advantages My Typewriter has over other typewriter apps are the ability to delete mistakes, a longer page to be better-suited for long-form works, a font randomizer, a selection of vintage fonts to choose from, and the ability to move the cursor around manually in order to play with poetic form or to function like a traditional word-processor. \n\nWe hope the next wave of Kerouacs, Plaths, and Hemingways use My Typewriter to create their masterworks just as we hope anyone with the inkling to write finds true joy from this virtual typewriter. \n\nWriters write, so get to it!\n\nDeveloped by Winnona Partners, LLC\nhttps://winnonapartners.com"

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here. Chromecast is a trademark of Google LLC."

      "label": "Necrophonic is an ITC app used for spirit communication and EVP research.\n\n8 Sounds Banks:\n\nThe audio has been mastered in a way to bring out various sound properties . \nUsing Pro Tools I was able to enhance high, mid, and low range frequencies. I also applied \nother filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an \nenvironment suitable for spirit communication.\n\nThe audio itself is made up of phonemes, \npartial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help \nspirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.\nthere are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.\n\nThese sounds banks play in a similar\nway to that of my other app \"Spiritus Ghost Box\" but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has\n8 active sound banks.\n\nWhite Noise Sound Bank:\n\nThis app also has an optional 9th sound bank called \"White noise\". \nThis bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This \naudio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the \n\"Holy Grail\" of EVP recorders. This is not a White Noise Generator, this is a normal sound bank like the others but this one contains white noise from the DR60.\n\nAudio Effects:\n\nThis app does contain Echo and Reverb audio effects. These have been proven \nto be the best effects to apply to ITC sessions. The echo can create audio that can be \nmanipulated within the echo itself. Echo can also help in live, real time communication by \nrepeating the audio and allowing you to better hear whats coming through. Reverb can be \napplied to the audio to create a spacious sound environment that will enhance audio manipulation."

      "label": "Need to quickly detect wood studs hidden under drywall, plasterboard, or stucco in order to safely and securely hang a picture, shelf, TV or other wall fixture? Studfinder turns your mobile device into a stud detector tool! Studfinder uses your device's compass (magnetometer) sensor to precisely pinpoint metal studs, nails, screws, and other metal fasteners embedded in all wooden wall studs. A stud detector is essential for DIYs to securely hanging heavy wall fixtures and ensures the fasteners are well anchored in the solid wall studs hidden beneath the drywall.\n\nThis app operates in a similar manner to other hand-held stud detector tools: as you move the device along the wall, the LED lights light up in sequence as your device's magnetometer approaches the stud. However, modern mobile devices do not have a density sensor (which is used in real studfinder tools), so Studfinder uses your compass (magnetometer) sensor instead. The compass sensor detects subtle changes in the background magnetic fields caused by the conductive metal fasteners that are located in all wooden studs. Because of the lack of a density sensor in mobile devices, studfinder apps cannot detect wood studs themselves, but instead, detect the metal fasteners in the studs. Please keep this difference in mind when using Studfinder. \n\nFeatures:\n- Automatic sensor check\n- Active detection button\n- Stability indicator (Green LED)\n- 3 detection level indicators (Red LEDs)\n- 10 sensitivity levels (for various drywall thicknesses)\n- Toggle-able detection beeper\n- Easy to follow, in-app DIY instructions\n\nThere is also a quick video tutorial that shows how the app works on my website: http://toadlybroodle.ca/portfolio/apps/stud-finder-app/\n\nThanks for downloading and using my app. I have constantly been updating and improving it since 2013, based on user feedback, in order to make it the most accurate, responsive, and easy to use stud finder app on the market. Please consider reviewing the app so future versions can be even further improved!"

With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.\n\nAnd the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it is – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop. And with over 20 built-in themes and the ability to create your own, you can customize the results exactly the way you want.\n\nNoir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!\n\nBuilt from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Focus Filters and Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows. And your settings are automatically synced to all your devices using iCloud.\n\nAnd just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data. Period.\n\nNoir is made by a solo iOS developer. It does not include any subscriptions or ads. Buy Noir once, use it forever.\n\nNotes:\n• Found a website where Noir’s dark mode doesn’t look just right? Let me know by reporting it. The app will be frequently updated to address issues that are reported.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\n• The Noir extension requires access to the websites you visit to analyze the existing style of the page and to override it with Noir's dark style.\n• Noir never collects your browsing data. The only data Noir ‘collects’ are your settings, and those will never leave your device.\n• You can read Noir’s full Privacy Policy at https://getnoir.app/privacypolicy"

Amplosion will automatically redirect AMP links you encounter, and you can even permit certain websites to continue to display AMP by adding them to the Allowlist. Amplosion shows how many times it has activated with a beautiful flip counter at the top of the app so you can see how many times it's saved the day. There's also a myriad of beautiful app icons to choose from. \n\nIt's completely open source, so with this transparency you can verify everything about the extension.\n\nAwesome home screen widgets are included as well, featuring the flip counter so you can see how many times Amplosion has activated right from your home screen.\n\nAs a bonus, it features a lovable digital dog that lives in the app named Lord Waffles, and a beautiful story about him and his turtle friend Rascal. There's also a widget for Lord Waffles!"

Blacks are pure black because OLED, which stands for Organic Light-Emitting Diodes, can switch off individual pixels.\n\niPhones with OLED screens should be handled with a bit of care to avoid image persistence or screen burn-in, if you treat your new iPhone with attention you will not suffer from this and your device will have a better resale value, see vendor support article HT208191.\n\nUse this app to visually check your OLED screen if you have signs of \"Image Persistence\" or \"Burn-In\". Read about the best way to take care of it.\n\nWhen you want to buy/sell a (second-hand) iPhone with an OLED display, you can use this app to visually check for damage to the screen.\n\nThis App does not claim to fix or repair an OLED screen which has Image Persistence, or burn-in.\n\nYou can also enjoy two demo videos to check out how good looking Dolby Vision and HDR 10 are, on your iPhone OLED display.\n\nRecently we have added 4 Dolby Atmos tests for the Spacial Audio on the Air Pods Pro."

All watch complication types are supported, including those really weird ones.  Also you can change the complication icon under Settings;\n7. The watch app can listen automatically on launch. There is an option under settings to do the same thing on the iPhone;\n8. If the weather or time are wrong, ensure you've enabled Location access in the Alexa app to the \"Voice in a Can\" device, and that you have granted Location permissions to the app on your phone;\n9. You don't have to say \"Alexa\" ... just speak your command when the app is listening;\n10. You can change the language that you speak and hear responses in, under \"Settings\" on the watch and phone.  Only languages supported by Alexa are supported. The language should be set automatically.\n\nIf you have questions or any support issues please don't hesitate to email damian@voiceinacan.com ... you should get a response within 24 hours, and often in minutes.\n\nThis app was not created or endorsed by Amazon.

Ishraq prayer is 10 to 12 minutes after sunrise. There is a misconception where Islamic websites and people use the word \"Ishraq\" and then give timings for actual Sunrise. Praying at sunrise is forbidden and must be performed after at least 10 minutes of sunrise. iPray for this reason adds 10 minutes to sunrise and labels it correctly as \"Ishraaq\".\n\n* Prayer Alerts will ONLY alert you with an initial Takbir. The full azan (and its length) is NOT supported by the iOS alert mechanism as there is a maximum limit of 30 seconds of audio playback."

Add custom stations for peer-to-peer connections. Note: Peer-to-peer connections are outbound only.\n\nFAVORITES LIST・Add stations to your favorites list and quickly access them by modes and bands when ready to initiate a connection.\n\nPHOTO ATTACHMENTS・RadioMail makes it easy to share photos with other users. You can access your phone's camera directly from the app, or attach photos from your photo library. The app automatically optimizes images to reduce the transmission time. When you receive an attachment, you can preview it and add annotations if you like. You can also save attachments to local folders or iCloud, or share them via other apps.\n\nPOSITION REPORT・Use the phone’s internal GPS to automatically provide an accurate location for position reports. Position reports are posted to the Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS) network.\n\nNOTIFICATIONS・RadioMail allows you to receive notifications when new messages come in while the app is running in the background. This means you don't have to constantly check for new messages - the app will automatically fetch them for you. Note: this feature is only available for telnet connections.\n\nADDRESSES・Send or receive messages with your primary Winlink account, tactical addresses, or secondary accounts. Seamlessly send messages to Winlink and regular email addresses. Look up contacts from the address book and access their email addresses when composing messages.\n\n\nRadioMail is independently developed and not affiliated with the Amateur Radio Safety Foundation, Inc.

      "label": "SPLnFFT is a sound level meter (noise meter) for your iPhone or iPad with many advanced features: frequency analyzer, frequency meter, test signal generator, dosimeter, ...\n\nThis soundmeter App is the only one for iOS recommended by the \"Laborers' Health and Safety Fund of North America\".\nHere are extracts from other reviews:\n\"our favorite sound measurement app\" SafetyAwakenings.com\n\"SPLnFFT is comprehensive, easy to use\" TapeOp.com\nYou will find more reviews here: https://www.facebook.com/SPLnFFT\n\nFor daily use, a very simple interface displays the level of exposure: if orange or red, protect your ears !\nProfessional users will take advantage of a wide range of accurate and reliable measurements: Leq, peak, L10, L95, taktmaximal, frequency analysis, histogram, dosemetering, ... A&C weightings are compliant with ANSI® S1.42 standard. \"468\" refers to ITU-R 468-4\n\n>>> Some KEY INFORMATION <<< :\n- you absolutely need to allow access to microphone to use this App\n- screen rotation must be un-locked\n- there are built-in help messages (speech bubble). Need more ? Contact us !: email, blog, Facebook,...\n- do not expect to measure as low as 0dB(A) in a quiet room, for these 2 reasons: 30-130dB(A) is the standard usable range for sound level meters and anyway a standard quiet room is around 30dB(A) whereas a typical anechoic chamber is 10 to 20dB(A)\n- to change frequency weightings (dB(A),dB(C),...) a LONG PRESS is required (1/3rd of a second). This is to avoid accidental changes\n\nTop digital display is for measurement of sound power in 'slow' mode (averaged on 1s). Central analog display is for 'fast' mode (averaged on 1/8th s). But it can display 'slow' mode as well on request: just click on 'fast' label.\nPeak and average values are displayed below and are held until you touch the 'reset' label. The videos on Youtube reveal more details.\n\nBottom view is a real time FFT (frequency analysis). You will notice that predominant frequency and next one are highlighted. Their frequencies and relative power are displayed on the right. If your input signal is a pure tone then this App will lock on its frequency and display a very accurate result.\nGreen line is the result of a real time FFT done with 1024 points. Purple line is the averaged FFT (exponential filtering done on power of each frequency). Blue line is a copy of what the purple line was when the user froze the display the last time.\nA test tone at 1kHz or a white noise or a pink noise can be generated and sent to right and/or left outputs (select the type you want in BEEP tab). This FFT view - more precisely an upsized version of it - can be exported as a picture in your own photo library, using the camera button (when display is frozen only).  This picture can be exported in a mail as well.\nThe display can be flipped upside-down to ease reading: just rotate your iPhone while holding it vertically.\n\nAs for ALL sound meters (thus including this one and all others at any price), calibration is suggested if you want to reach extreme precision. This is enabled in this App thanks to a slider to apply some compensation and to three non volatile memories (choice to be made in MIC. tab). How to ? For calibration, you need and external reference, either a calibrated sound meter, or a calibrated noise source.\nNote as well that the tiny embedded loudspeaker cannot reproduce extreme frequencies. Thus if you want to hear a real white or pink noise, you will need to use a quality headphone or HiFi system.\n\nThis App was designed seriously for our own needs, by a signal processing expert, and is regularly updated to maintain accuracy and reliability.\n\n***** Any comment, any feedback ? Click on 'support' in iTunes: there is a blog for this. You can even contact us directly by email  or through the dedicated FaceBook page (note 'send email' top right) *****"

Remember, all features & updates are free forever, the only in-app purchases are donations (tip jar).\n\nPolar Scope Align will calculate the position of Polaris or σ Octantis in your Polar Scope reticle for your location (using your phone's GPS or manually), allowing a quick and accurate polar alignment. It is one of the few programs that are accurate in lower latitudes by correcting for atmospheric refraction (so expect results to agree only with precise software and not most simplistic \"polar align\" apps - see the \"Accuracy\" section in help for details). In the settings you can select the polar scope reticle that matches your own, from a vast collection:\niOptron old & new, Astro-Physics RAPAS & PASILL, various versions of Takahashi EM-10/11/200/400/500, NJP, PM-1, P2-Z, the latest Orion / Skywatcher, the Classic Skywatcher / Orion / Celestron / Meade / EXOS2 / Bresser, the Telrad, Rigel QuikFinder, a couple for Astrotrac / Losmandy / Kenko / Avalon, the Vixen PF-L/Atlux/SX/SXD/SXP/AXD/GP/GP-DX/Polarie Polar Axis Scopes, a Konus and several Polar Finders: Tuthill, Explore Scientific 8x50, Meade 9x60, Vixen Polaris, Celestron 7x50, Carton Optical. PoleMaster help view for South Hemisphere users. If you have one not included, just ask the developer to add it!\n\nFeature list:\n\n-Accurate calculation of Polaris or Sigma Oct for any date and location, including effect of atmospheric refraction (and annual aberration, nutation). Most other apps do not perform precision calculations, so please only compare app readings to accurate sources (USNO, scientific software etc).\n-Use device time/date/location, or enter your own, or pick from online & offline world databases via the Location Manager.\n-Approximate daytime / no polarscope polar alignment tool. Great for visual use, solar imaging (inc. eclipses) and even limited short focal length astrophotography. Now with sun shadow calibration for more accuracy!\n-Laser / Hop Align for nighttime alignment using a calibration star for obstructed or not visible polar star, or for improving laser align.\n-Full app in red-color (or alternative green, white) night mode - tools switchable to daytime view.\n-Deep Space Object (DSO) Database with 22000+ objects from several catalogs (Messier, Caldwell, NGC, IC, Herschell 400, Sharpless 2, Barnard), along with stars (Yale Bright Star) & planets. Search, apply filters, sorting, download DSS color images for all items, or get help finding them with your non-goto telescope with the Push-To function.\n-Connect to and control WiFi-enabled iOptron mounts.\n-Over 30 calculators useful for observing and astrophotography, from eyepiece magnification and field of view, to imaging resolution and reducers.\n-Xasteria: World astro-weather report based on 7Timer! data\n-Water vapor satellite images.\n-List of visible ISS and bright satellite passes.\n-Moon phase & lunar Calendar with solar/lunar rise/set and twilight times.\n-Wizard to calculate your reticle centering offset and correct or compensate for it.\n-Zoomable reticle view and customized routines & tools: Alt-az alignment error display for mounts that calculate it after star alignment (e.g. iOptron iEQ45, CEM60), polar alignment when your scope is not in zero position (for mounts like iOptron ZEQ/CEM on which you can always access the polar scope), remember zero position on Celestron / Skywatcher / Orion etc reticles.\n-Bubble level (using either gyro or accelerometer) and Compass heading, as well as magnetic declination reading.\n-GPS accuracy & elevation data.\n-Red/White/LED light.\n-Dimming slider.\n-iOptron, NexStar and Meade LX200 Star Lists.\n-Support for iPhone & iPad from iOS 9 (and iPod Touch, except tools that require the compass)."

Or not.\n* Touch the time to set the color.\n* Slide up and down to set the intensity.\n* Pinch to resize font.\n* Works equally well in portrait and landscape modes.\n* The time always moves to ensure no burn-in.\n* Very low power consumption.\n* No ads, no in app-purchases, this is a labour of love, the only reason it's not free is to cover my App Store costs\n* Also, no user tracking. I really don't care who you are\n\nThat's it, really. Instead of having loads of functions, this app tries to do one thing and to do it well.\n\nThere are no advanced color pickers (I chose five nice colors for you!), no alarms, no background images, no distracting information.\n\nJust the time (and date and battery), beautifully displayed. \n\nKeep the time visible at all times while you sleep or daydream.\n\nFull source code can be found at https://github.com/kvasbo/natta"

Simply select one of your recent locations to get information! You can also delete items in this list that you no longer wish to view.\n\nSave results as favourites\n-----\nSave your most often used locations so you can look them up again with just 2 clicks! You can name your favourites anything you want.\n\nSaves LSD as well as latitude and longitude coordinates to the clipboard\n-----\nThis allows you to use third party mapping software to find your favourite locations."

A lot of thought has gone into this truly excellent product.\"\n\"This is a superb program and does what it says simply and efficiently. The developer responds promptly to suggestions. Importing Contacts works well and changes are instantly carried through. My cards have never been sent out so early!\"\n\"I love how this app has streamlined addressing my Christmas cards!! Thank you!!\"\n\"AddressLabels delivers an extremely effective way to manage card lists which means the ability to easily compose lists from your Contacts, get the labels printed, and keep track of cards received and sent! Add the ability to manually enter list members, assign nicknames, select from multiple addresses, intelligent handling the country portion of the address, accommodate a large range of label types, AirPrint directly or produce a PDF of the labels, clone new lists from existing lists, all wrapped in a visually pleasing interface. Winner!\"\n\"I hate addressing my Christmas cards. This app made it very easy to make labels. I don't have a printer that works with my iPad yet, so I really appreciated having the capability to send them as a PDF to my email address. The app is awesome...\"\n“Just what you need at this time of year - a reliable self updating list to speed up sending out cards. This is the 3rd or 4th year I've used it and it just gets better and better.”\n“After years of tearing my hair out trying to get labels out of my iphone/iPad/iMac combo, an app that actually does what it promised!”"

      "label": "Need to quickly detect wood studs hidden under drywall, plasterboard, or stucco in order to safely and securely hang a picture, shelf, TV or other wall fixture? Studfinder turns your mobile device into a stud detector tool! Studfinder uses your device's compass (magnetometer) sensor to precisely pinpoint metal studs, nails, screws, and other metal conducting fasteners in wood studs located beneath the drywall, plasterboard, or sheetrock in every wall. A stud detector is essential for securely hanging heavy wall fixtures by ensuring the fasteners are well anchored in the wall studs. \n\nStudfinder operates in a similar manner to other hand-held stud detector tools: LED lights light up in sequence with proximity to stud as your device's magnetometer passes over the stud. However, because modern mobile devices do not have density sensors (which are used by real studfinder tools) Studfinder uses your compass (magnetometer) sensor to detect subtle changes in the background magnetic fields caused by conductive metal fasteners embedded in all studs. Because of the lack of a density sensor in mobile devices, studfinder apps cannot detect wood studs themselves, but rather, detect the metal fasteners embedded in them. Please keep this difference in mind when using Studfinder. \n\nFeatures:\n- Automatic sensor check\n- Active detection button\n- Stability indicator (Green LED)\n- 3 detection level indicators (Red LEDs)\n- 10 sensitivity levels (for various drywall thicknesses)\n- Toggle-able detection beeper\n- Easy to follow, in-app instructions\n\n\nThanks for downloading and using Studfinder. I have constantly been updating and improving it since 2013, based on user feedback, in order to make it the most accurate, responsive, and easy to use stud finder app on the market. Please consider reviewing the app so future versions can be even further improved!"

      "label": "Anyone can make their own tunes in Forza. It comes down to doing the right math, taking a test drive and knowing when to make a few adjustments. Nothing magic. ForzaTune Pro does the complex math for you, and makes it easy to adjust the car to your driving style and skill.\n\nTell ForzaTune you're driving a Supra on the streets of Mexico, and it creates a tune to match. If you prefer a more aggressive or more stable feel, then open up the tune customizer to set oversteer or understeer in each part of a turn. ForzaTune works out the new values for you automatically.\n\nThere's nothing better than driving a car dialed in how you want it. And a car that feels planted lets you drive faster.\n\nThis Pro version includes many extra tuning types like rally, drag and drift plus gearing options, the ability to save tunes, and finer control over your tune balance.\n\nHere are the complete specs if you'd like to learn more:\n\nONE APP TO TUNE THEM ALL\nForzaTune Pro has support for Forza Horizon 5, Forza Horizon 4, Forza Motorsport 7 and also includes most vehicles in Forza Horizon 3 and Forza Motorsport 6.\n\nMAKE STREET, DRIFT, RALLY TUNES AND MORE\nNo matter what kind of driving you like, this tuning app has you covered. Create standard (street/track), drift, drag, rain, rally/snow, and off-road tunes with ease.\n\nLEARN HOW TO QUICKLY FINE-TUNE\nAdjust the overall balance, turn entry balance, turn exit balance, ride stiffness, roll stiffness in seconds.\n\nRETUNE GEARS WITH EASE\nIncludes a gearing calculator option that lets you match race transmission values to engine swaps or major power upgrades. \n\nTUNES ARE TAILORED TO EACH CAR\n1140+ vehicles covering Forza Horizon 5 back through Forza Motorsport 6. Tuning for some special editions (F&F, Team Forza, FE) is done with the base car unless noted otherwise. ForzaTune does not include oval racing vehicles or tuning.\n\nACCURATE FORMULAS\nForzaTune Pro combines your input with its vehicle and track databases to create original, balanced tunes. Formulas are based on real race engineering. They are also tested extensively with a gamepad and steering wheel/pedal set.\n\nSAVE AND MANAGE YOUR TUNES\nSave, edit, search and backup all of your tunes. Export and import options let you transfer your tunes to new devices or friends easily without logins or accounts.\n\n-----\nFAQs\n-----\nQ: Is this for beginners or experienced tuners?\nA: Both. Experienced tuners use it to save time. Newer tuners use it to learn how to tune.\n\nQ: How do I use the app?\nA: Copy several car details from the game into ForzaTune, hit \"Next\" and copy the results into the tuning menu in Forza Horizon 5 or an earlier Forza title. There is also a series of video tutorials on YouTube to get you started.\n\nQ: What settings and upgrades do I need?\nA: You will need racing upgrades like suspension, braking, anti-roll bars, and differential to change the values in the tuning menu. You can also use drift, rally and adjustable stock suspensions when available (like off-road buggies and some trucks in Horizon). You will also have the best results if you disable stability management (STM) and traction control (TCS) for lower class cars. Normal or simulation steering is fine, but simulation steering is recommended in FH5 especially when fine-tuning.\n\nQ: Why is tuning your cars important?\nA: When doing upgrades many of the default tune settings will not match the new build. ForzaTune brings it back to a balanced setup. Also, tuning doesn't affect your PI or race restrictions—so this is how you can gain an advantage over other racers.\n\n---\nMake better tunes faster with ForzaTune Pro."

      "label": "***THIS APPLICATION DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY SERVER SIDE SERVICE***\n\nQuantumult is a powerful proxy client.\n• Right now supports protocol Shadowsocks(r), HTTP, HTTP over TLS, SOCKS5 and SOCKS5 over TLS, VMess.\n\nIt can capture all the TCP traffic and redirect under you own way by using Filter function.\n• The filter has a few types to match. For TCP traffic that has the upper layer protocol HTTP(S), 'HOST', 'HOST-SUFFIX', 'HOST-KEYWORD', 'USER-AGENT', 'GEOIP' and 'IP-CIDR' are all supported. For the other TCP traffic, 'GEOIP' and 'IP-CIDR' are supported. Especially, when deal with HTTP(S) traffic, Quantumult has another function called Rejection, it matchs the whole URL of the HTTP(S) request.\n• After match, the filter has a lot of actions to deal with the request, built-in policy 'DIRECT', 'REJECT', 'PROXY', all your servers and your customized policies. Actually you can see all the actions as a lot of paths and you can decide which request goes through which path by using filter function.\n\nMore over, Quantumult can be a convenient web develop tool on mobile device.\n• When you on the road without the Mac platform debug tools like Charles and Wireshark, you still can use Quantumult to log parts of the web request to debug some web issues.\n• Quantumult can log all the HTTP(S) request header and response header.\n• Yes, you are right it can log the HTTPS request header and response header, be sure to install and trust Quantumult root CA for this advanced function.\n\nSince quantumult has a function called PROXY, sure it can redirect your traffic to remote proxy servers. But be clear, we do NOT provide any server side service or support, you should build your own servers.\n• Like we said early Quantumult can redirect all TCP traffic through the filter function, that means you can visit different web site through different servers by the filter. See it can accelerate your network connection if you set your filter right, and of course the filter is totally customizable.\n• About the customized policy, there are 3 different types of customized policy, 'SSID', 'Latency' and 'Static'. The 'SSID' policy depends on your network enviroment, Wi-Fi, Cellular or specific Wi-Fi with the SSID your provided. The 'Latency' policy is based on the latencies of all the servers of the policy settings, the result is the shortest(The test interval has the option of 600 or 1200 seconds). The 'Static' policy is based on your manual selection of servers or other polices from the policy settings. Sure you are right, some of polices can wrap other polices, convinent, right ?\n\nAbout working state, Quantumult can work in 3 state, 'GLOBAL', 'DIRECT' AND 'AUTO'.\n• The GLOBAL state will ignore filter settings and redirect all TCP traffic through the built-in PROXY policy(you need build and add your server first).\n• The DIRECT state will ignore filter settings and redirect all TCP traffic directly to the destination web site. How this state useful ? Yes, it can be a simple web develop tools by analizing the reqeust header and response header including HTTPS.\n• The AUTO state, we call it auto because it base on the filter you set to divide the TCP traffic through different paths, like the popular ACL way.\n\nExtra, Quantumult can also work as a HTTP proxy server for devices under the same Wi-Fi, when this function is turned on, the home view will show the IP and port for other device easily to connect.\n\n\nAt last, some attentions.\n• About the location on the map of home view. It is not the real location in the real world, it's just the IP location and might not be correct."

      "label": "TslaMirror for iOS \nTslaMirror is an App that will help your iPhone App mirroring to Tesla vehicle! Also, it can support App screencast to a Chrome browser.\n\nFor Tesla vehicle built-in browser\n1 Make sure the car is PARKED (0mph/0kph)! \n2 The Tesla vehicle network must be connected to the iOS device Personal Hotspot (cellular data needed) first. Tesla MCU2 hardware is needed. MCU2 is available on the Tesla Model \n3 Model Y, Model X (late than March 2018), Model S (late than March 2018), or the Tesla vehicles that are upgraded to MCU2 from MCU1.3 Start the TslaMirror App. Confirm \"Tesla Proxy\" switch is on in the TslaMirror App\n4 Click the \"Start\" button, then click \"Start Broadcast\" to start Screen Broadcast in the TslaMirror App\n5 Access the link http://240.3.3.3 via Tesla vehicle in-car browser\n6 Pinch the Tesla vehicle built-in browser screen to zoom in/out the picture\n7 There is no audio support for the moment. Only the App screen will be mirrored to the browser. You can use the Bluetooth audio link to the Tesla vehicle play the audio of the iOS device simultaneously during the App mirroring.\n8 Do not lock the screen. The Screen Broadcast API limitation needs the screen to keep unlocked. Once the screen is locked, Screen Broadcast needs to be restarted.\n\nFor normal desktop browser\n1 Devices are on the same Wi-Fi network\n2 Start the TslaMirror App.\n3 Click the \"Start\" button to start Screen Broadcast in the TslaMirror App\n4 Access the link below the \"Stop\" button via a normal desktop browser (Safari or Chrome)\n\nKey Features\n1 No extra internet traffic for the screencast, the App mirroring traffic is only locally on iOS device Personal Hotspot. However, please note that during the screenshot, the Tesla vehicle will use the hotspot traffic for its internet access when the hotspot is connected\n2 No extra hardware needed\n3 Private, the screencast is only available to the devices connected to the iOS Personal Hotspot Wi-Fi network\n4 Fast network\n5 5GHz Personal Hotspot(iPhone 12 series supports it) Wi-Fi is highly recommended. Do not enable the \"Maximize Compatibility\" setting for iPhone 12 series. By default, iPhone 12 series come with a 5GHz Wi-Fi Personal Hotspot. Once the \"Maximize Compatibility\" setting enabled, it will go back to the 2.4GHz Wi-Fi hotspot.\n\nFAQ\n1 This is not CarPlay\n2 iOS Apps that use the AVPlayer framework cannot be supported, such as the Apple Music App and Netflix App. For the Apple Music App, although the screen can be streamed to the browser, the audio part will be muted during the Screen Broadcast.\n3 Netflix App not supported\n\nPrivacy/Security notice: This App does not collect any statistics, personal information, or analytics from our users.This Application does use Location service to access Wi-Fi access point network name on iOS 13 or later.

To have a GPS receiver, an accelerometer, a gyroscope, even a Barometer with you at all times is a marvel of miniature engineering.  It's simply fun to see the output from all these sensors, play with each interactively, or just view the raw data. \n\nRecord Accelerometer, Gyroscope, GPS, Barometer, Magnetometer  sensor data and share by email for further analysis, or review using the in app viewer.\n\nHowever Sensor Play is not just a toy.\n\nBeyond the obvious fun of watching the accelerometer and gyroscope graphs bounce around you can now record multi-sensor data all at the same time, even in the background, for a full external analysis of your, or your iPhone's, motion through time and space however you so desire.\n\nAnd now with Automation you can trigger your recordings to start either after a simple delay, when you enter or leave a preset GPS Region, or when the iPhone is nudged above a selected gForce.\nThen end your recordings either after a set duration, or when you enter or leave a preset GPS Region.\n\nAutomation makes getting the data you want so much easier, and eliminates lots of unnecessary recorded data.  Set up the triggers as required, close the phone and go.  \nSet and Forget!  Later when you open SensorPlay the data you were after will have been automatically recorded and saved for you.\n\nThe following data is recorded to a csv file for sharing through the standard iPhone share sheet.\nTimestamp\nAccelerometer: X, Y, Z\nGyroscope: X, Y, Z\nAttitude: Roll, Pitch, Yaw\nLocation: Longitude, Latitude, Speed, TrueHeading, Altitude\nMotion Activity: Type & Confidence\nBarometer: Pressure, Relative Altitude\nMagnetometer: µT X, Y, Z, calibrated x,y,z, rotation matrix, and quaternion\n\nVisual graphs of sensor recordings in one place, as long as they're not too large anyway.\n\nBackground mode is supported for all recordings, accelerometer, gyro, and multi-sensor export, lock your screen and keep recording all sensor data for up to six hours.\n\nA serious engineering, scientific, and educational analysis tool.\n\nSharing of all recordings is now through the built in share options which includes, Airdrop, mail, message, notes, dropbox (if installed), etc.\n\nSensors currently supported:\n\nBarometer (iPhone 6 and above only)\n - see the atmospheric pressure in a choice of 7 units, see your relative altitude plotted over time.\n - Widget available to display the atmospheric pressure in the notification centre.\nAccelerometer\n - See the g-forces on the X,Y,Z axis and see them traced over time.\n - Widget available to show gMax in X,Y,Z axis on notification screen.\n - Record the data and share for further analysis\nGyroscope\n - Watch the rate of rotation over the X,Y,Z axis plotted over time.\n - Record the data and share for further analysis\nGPS/Location Services\n - See your exact location mapped on screen and share your Lat/Long coordinates by text or email.\nMagnetometer/Compass\n - See the magnetic field acting on the X, Y, Z, axis along with an interactive compass.\n3D/Force Touch (6S & above only)\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "Crowd GPS Scanner App that allows the user to quickly find the most common crowd locate GPS devices such as tile. These are the devices the size of a coin that will transmit signals back to the owners for anything up to a year with just a watch battery. Before these devices came to market tracking would require larger batteries & sim cards which would become quite large and simple to find.\nHow the Crowd Locate system works:\nCrowd locate works on the basis that when a tile is paired to a phone it will stay connected to that phone whilst paired and within approx. 30ft. Once the tile device goes out of range it will start sending a signal to \"Find me\" This signal will be collected by any persons phone that runs the tile app! This is how crowd locate works, the more people having the app the more chances the tile can be pinpointed. Once the tile has come within 30ft of another mobile phone running the app it will pinpoint that exact location on a map and send that information back to the owner of the tile! This will give the owner of the tile a real time location on a map with a time when located.\nWith our App you can search all devices within approx. 30ft and the App will list all devices detected.\nThe App will only detect devices that you don't have paired to your own phone or that are currently sending out signals because they are out of range to paired device. \nThis can be put to the test if you have a tile that has been paired to your phone. When you have a tile paired to your phone and the tile app is running on your phone the Crowd GPS Scanner App will NOT list any tiles that you own. Now swipe closed the tile app and turn off your phone then turn it back on. The tile you own will now be in lost mode because it's not connected to your phone. Whilst in lost mode it will be transmitting a signal \"Find me\" so now if you open the Crowd GPS Scanner App it will now list the tile device on the screen. Stop clear the results and start the tile App which will pair to the tile. Now if you run the Crowd GPS Scanner App it will NOT list your own device."

But there are a few limitations: The watchOS will always show a privacy warning when starting a browsing session and there are no navigation buttons (back/forward) available.\n\nFILE UPLOADS:\niCab Mobile can upload any files on web pages.\n\nSEARCHING:\niCab Mobile comes with several default search engines you can choose from. You can easily add new search engines. \n\nFILLING OUT FORMS:\niCab Mobile can save web forms and restore the form content later (manually or automatically). The saved forms data can be password protected. Supports many third-party Password Manager Apps as well.\n\nFILTERS:\nThere’s a built-in fully customizable filter feature. It allows to block resources, ads, banners, user tracking scripts, cookies etc. Supports AdBlock Plus/EasyList filters as well.\n\nTABS:\niCab Mobile supports Tabs, so you can open multiple web pages at the same time. Links can be opened in Tabs (in the foreground or background) manually or automatically. \n\nBOOKMARKS:\nBookmarks can be organized in folders. You can import/export the bookmarks from/to your PC/Mac browser. \n\nFULLSCREEN MODE:\niCab Mobile provides a fullscreen mode where the whole screen is used to display the web page. No screen space is wasted for toolbars. \n\nDOWNLOADS:\niCab Mobile has a built-in Download Manager so you can download almost all files from the internet. The downloads can be easily transfered to a Mac/PC/Linux computer but also to other Apps on the device which can open these files\n\nMULTIUSER SUPPORT\nYou can create multiple user accounts, each user has its own private bookmarks, filters, settings, etc.\n\nDROPBOX\niCab Mobile supports Dropbox. Export/Import bookmarks; transfer downloads, images, files, web pages to your Dropbox account.\n\nTWIN BROWSER:\nIn this mode, you can have two browsers side by side on the iPad. This is especially useful on the large iPad Pro.\n\nVOICEOVER\nThe App is also accessible for visually impaired and blind users. If VoiceOver is enabled, the App plays soft ticks while a page is loading, so blind users are able to identify when the page load has finished. \n\nOTHER FEATURE:\n- Configurable multi-touch gestures\n- QuickStarter feature\n- AirPrint support \n- Browser ID (UserAgent) is configurable\n- iCab Mobile fully supports international domain names\n- Cookie Manager\n- Private Browsing (no history and no cookies are stored)\n- Privacy settings allows to delete all kinds of private data (history, cookies, databases, saved forms, passwords etc.)\n- URL autocompletion \n- Simple built-in RSS reader\n- Save images, whole web pages, PDF files\n- Kiosk Mode - a restricted variation of the fullscreen mode for Kiosk environments. \n- History\n- Addressbook support lets you access the web pages from the addressbook. \n- When launching iCab can either open an empty page, the homepage or restore the Tabs which were open the last time\n- There are different color schemes and designs\n- Document Sharing lets you pass downloads and files to other Apps in the device\n\n\n\nThe App includes a store providing several InApp purchases. These are meant as a tip jar. The InApp purchases are available for different prices, so you can pick the amount for the tip yourself. Doing so will unlock a few cool features as a reward, these are always the same, regardless of the amount of the tip. Users who have purchased the App within the last 12 months do get all these features for free, no need to buy one of the InApp purchases. Though they can nevertheless give me a tip, if they want to... ;-)"

Warn your future, drunken, self against making a dreadful mistake!

It's good to keep me from calling or texting an ex right after we break up. Every time I get the urge to text just cause I put his number on drunk dial no for 48 hours and by the time the 48 hours goes by the urge is gone. If not then I put him on it for another 48 hours!\n----------------\n\nTO START:\n - Tap the '+' button\n - Choose one of your contacts\n - Drunk Dial NO! will store the contact's phone number(s) and email address(es) for between 1 and 48 hours\n - NO EXCUSES!

      "label": "With SatFinder you can adjust your satellite antenna in a few seconds and with 4 simple steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - CHOOSE YOUR ANTENNA\nChoose one of the four different antenna designs: \n - Offset antennas (the most common, is slightly oval, the LNB is not in the center).\n - Special design (e.g. Oblong shaped Offset antenna, Multifeed antenna)  \n - Parabolic antenna (LNB is located in the center of the reflector, usually larger than 100cm)\n - Flat or planar antenna (small, camping antennas)\n\nIf you have an offset antenna, enter the height and width of the antenna. If your antenna has a special shape, enter the offset angle and the size of the satellite antenna. You can find the offset angle in the manual of your satellite antenna. For parabolic antennas it is sufficient to enter the antenna diameter. With a flat antenna you do not have to set anything. If you know the exact antenna name, check if your antenna is already in the database.\n\nTip: Press the wizard button to measure the size of the satellite antenna using the iPhone camera and LiDAR scanner. \n\nSTEP 2 - CHOOSE YOUR SATELLITE\nTo quickly and easily select a suitable satellite, simply press the \"AUTO\" button. The SatFinder will now automatically search for satellites that are in your reception area and that offer TV or radio stations in your language (the language setting of your iPhone will be selected). The stars (1-10) shown in the table result from the number of radio and TV channels offered and the reception strength at your location.  \n\nIf you want to receive a special satellite, switch off \"AUTO\": Now you can simply scroll through the table and select the satellite. Faster is the search function - just enter the name of the satellite, the channel or the orbit position. You can also reduce the number of table entries by hiding satellites that are not available at your location or do not broadcast in your language. With the button \"Channel Info\" you can check which channels the selected satellite is currently broadcasting - including all channel parameters for your satellite receiver.  \n\nSTEP 3 - CHECK OBSTACLES\nFor a smooth satellite reception, there must not be any obstacles between the satellite and your satellite antenna. You can check this with the \"View\" function. Simply aim at the satellite and watch the signs (GREEN - no obstacle, RED - caution, free view may not be given).\n\nTip: Press the button for the assistant to activate the voice output.\n\nSTEP 4 - ADJUST ANTENNA\nIn the menu item \"Align\" different graphics appear depending on the selected antenna type. If you use an offset antenna, you have to adjust the azimuth and elevation separately. With planar or parabolic antennas the adjustment of the angles is done together. Before you press the \"Start\" button, a video clip shows how to position your iPhone at the antenna. \n\nTip: Press the button for the assistant to activate the voice output.\n\nSTEP 5 - FINE TUNING \nIf necessary, you can optimize the reception of your satellite system. The SatFinder provides you with the function \"FineTuning\". To use this function, you need a second iOS device. One device serves as a camera; the second device as a monitor. Simply place an iPhone in front of your reception screen and observe changes in picture quality while slightly rotating or tilting your satellite antenna. With the FineTuning feature, you'll have visual contact with your TV even when you're out of sight. \n\nTHAT'S IT. YOU SHOULD NOW BE ABLE TO ENJOY INTERFERENCE-FREE SATELLITE RECEPTION... \nNote: Satellite antenna tuning is only available on iOS devices with LiDAR sensor (e.g. iPhone 12 Pro)."

Pocket Marine is a great way to help you log your inhabitants into specific tanks, record your latest water change for your mixed reef tank or simply log your latest maintenance action performed on the fish only office tank.

It is the fastest preload technology ever.\n(Not supported with Google slide)\n\n•Work alone on either channel\nDual-Channel also means that the two channels are able to work alone. As long as one channel works, this app works, maximumly eliminating your anxiety and risk when facing to different and complicate environment. \n\n•Much more accurate than physical remote\n The Asynchronized-Coding-Validation-Tech validate each of your operations, which makes it more precise and reliable than physical remote.\n\n•1 Sec Connect &  Automatic Host Detection \nThe best way of connection is let your iPhone find your computer automatically.\n\n•Distance-limitless Controling:\nThe Internet-Connection-Mode enables Power Remote to remote control smoothly from every signal corner of the world, without any space and distance's restriction.\n\n•Internet-Connection:\nWe have achieved Internet-Connection feature while most of other similar remote controllers are still demanding the phone and the computer to be connected under the same network. Now it's absolutely a revolution to replace the traditional physical remote controller with our innovative and unique tech.\n\n•Most advanced User Interface Design\n\n•Windows & Mac |  Mouse Control  |  NO In-App Purchases | Quick Tech Support  | PowerPoint & Keynote \n\n\n##Easter egg\nIf you've been asked to design a remote-controlling app for PowerPoint, what would you do?\n\nWe've spent 6 months consulting 126 speechmakers from 16 countries, including some TED speakers, to listen to them, to understand what they really need. And then we've spent 68 days to design the interaction and technical detail, and another 92 days to make a breakthrough in Dual-Channel and Asynchronous Validation. Finally, we've spent 102 days to run a massive test. It was not until every button and line of this app was placed where they should be, not until we found all our test users smiling with confidence on stage, not until our users are in close communion with our product that we finally signed our name: Wayhold.\n\nBecause we always know, what our products have been influencing is not only our users themselves, but also the millions of people that our users influence."

      "label": "\"Mosquitone Detector\" is a sound measurement app that detects high frequency noises and ultrasonic sounds hard to hear for human ears.\n\nIt may have been exposed to artificial high-frequency noise while you do not notice. This app can detect and visualize such high-frequency noises.\n \nIn general, the human audible range is said to be 20 Hz to 20 kHz, but very high frequency sounds above 10kHz will gradually become difficult to hear with age.\n\nFor example, there are increasing cases where high-frequency noise generators are installed in various places as a purpose of repelling young people and beast pests using very high frequency mosquito noises that can not be heard by general adults.\n\nEspecially for young children, there are cases that they stay in the bad place even though on a very uncomfortable noise environment because adults can not recognize at all.\nPlease use this app to find high frequency noise, so it will help you to quickly get away from the bad spot or remove the noise source.\n\nThis app has two operation modes, \"Detect\" and \"Search\". \"Detect\" can check if there are high frequency and ultrasonic sounds that you can not hear. \"Search\" can find the direction of high-frequency sound source. It can only be used when it has found the peak frequency in \"Detect\".\n\nFeatures:\n- Detection of high frequency sound and ultrasonic wave, and display the peak frequency of the highest level.\n- Search for sound source direction: 360 degrees horizontally\n- Detectable frequency range: 8kHz - 16kHz / 16KHz - 23kHz (2 band division)\n- Function to switch the gain range: 0 - 100dB / -10 - 90dB / -20 - 80dB (in Detect mode)\n\nOperating procedure:\n1) Selection of detectable frequency band\nSelect the frequency band as more than 16kHz or less than 16kHz.\n\n2) Selection of Operational mode\n- Detect mode \nIt finds an inaudible high frequency and ultrasonic sound in the frequency band more than 16 kHz (or less than 16 kHz).\nTap START button and it starts the detection function. If high frequency or ultrasonic sound exist, it will be displayed on the graph as the peak frequency. You can make the graph display easier to see by switching the gain range.\n\n- Search mode\nIt finds the direction of occurrence of the high-frequency sound source that detected the peak frequency. “Search” can be used only when high frequency or ultrasonic sound is founded in “Detect\". \nPlease make sure to hold the bottom built-in microphone of iPhone so that it faces outward. If you measure with the microphone facing inward, microphone sensitivity will deteriorate and accurate measurement will not be possible.\nTap Start button, and firmly hold the iPhone terminal, please turn slowly clockwise. Recommended that the time required for a rotation is about 15 seconds and the rotation speed in the graph is approximately 4 rpm.\nThe measurement is completed by one revolution, and the signal strength of the peak frequency is displayed on the pie chart. You can find approximate direction of the high-frequency sound source relative to your standing position.\n\n3) Snapshot\nTap SNAP button, you can save the measurement result as “Photos” as an image file. A timestamp is inserted in the image.\n\nNote:\nIf the frequency changes periodically or randomly, it is not possible to determine the direction of occurrence in \"Search\".\nUltrasonic measurement depends on the sensitivity characteristics of the built-in microphone, so the measurement result may vary.\n\nRemarks:\nIt is still under study about health effects on human body by listening to high-frequencies including ultrasonic sound. If the high frequency noise of high level is detected daily, we recommend that you consult an expert.\n\nPlease visit our iOS App Support page for more information on this app."

Think about computers, phones, power lines, cellular towers, lights, Wi-Fi, Smart TVs… All these items emit low-frequency radiations around them. \nThese Electro Magnetic Radiations can interfere with other electronic items. That is why you can sometimes see glitches on a TV or distortion in sound or music. \nOur world will continue to showcase incremental interconnection with appliances that emit EMF. These tools have provided an enormous range of benefits for humans. But it is necessary to keep in mind all impacts on well being.\n\n=> Why should I care?\nNumerous studies have shown impacts on biological creatures. There are still discussions around the seriousness of the harm it could cause to human beings though. Our bodies are a complex network of cells, brains, and matter that are sensitive to the outside world in ways we do not fully understand yet. \nResearch seems to indicate impacts on well being, disturbing sleep cycles and affecting our immune system. Globally it could contribute to numerous health problems. As a result, cautionary behavior is recommended for all and especially for people looking to improve their well being.\n\n=> What can I do?\nUse this application to detect EMF exposure around you. Walk around your house with the app and spot the locations with high radiations. \nMake sure to limit the time spent next to these zones, especially during extended periods like during sleep. \nSo place your couch, your bed and your sofa away from these spots. Check the emission levels around places where you spent a lot of time: your kitchen, living room, bedroom. Check your laptop, TV, alarm clock, cell phones, Wi-Fi, air conditioner…\nBut also measure exposure outside your home: where you work, where you practice sport. Also, limit exposure to cell towers that emit a high level of EMF.\n\nNote: \n- This app will not work on an iPod Touch since it does not have a compass hardware.\n- This app does not guarantee completely exact measures as other fields can interfere with the compass inside your phone, which is used to detect the fields."

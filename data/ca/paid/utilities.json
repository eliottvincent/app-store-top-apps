Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here. Chromecast is a trademark of Google LLC."

Please note that the LSD has to be West of the first Meridian.\n\nDirect Integration with Google Maps as well as Apple Maps\n-----\nAt the tap of a button you can export the LSD or BC NTS coordinate to either of these platforms. This allows you to get turn by turn driving directions, traffic information, accident information and automatic rerouting, satellite imagery of the location, caching of map data on your phone (so you don’t need a data connection), position sharing and much more.\n\nRecently converted list\n-----\nThe app saves your recently found locations so you don’t need to enter them again. Simply select one of your recent locations to get information! You can also delete items in this list that you no longer wish to view.\n\nSave results as favourites\n-----\nSave your most often used locations so you can look them up again with just 2 clicks! You can name your favourites anything you want.\n\nSaves LSD as well as latitude and longitude coordinates to the clipboard\n-----\nThis allows you to use third party mapping software to find your favourite locations."

For instance, when on Quora, clicking a link to another Quora page would normally pop up a blocker that requires you to log in to continue navigating the website. With Banish, this pop-up was gone and you could use the site normally\"\n— Sarah Perez, TechCrunch\n\nPRIVATE\nBanish does not collect or store any of your data - nothing leaves your device.\n\nBUY ONCE\nJust a one-time purchase and Banish is yours.

No maintenance needed.\n\nMODERN\nBanish is written in Apple's latest programming paradigm Swift UI and Safari Extension functionality.\n\n---\nNOTE: Even with Banish, Smart Banners can still appear at the top for apps you have installed.

Ishraq prayer is 10 to 12 minutes after sunrise. There is a misconception where Islamic websites and people use the word \"Ishraq\" and then give timings for actual Sunrise. Praying at sunrise is forbidden and must be performed after at least 10 minutes of sunrise. iPray for this reason adds 10 minutes to sunrise and labels it correctly as \"Ishraaq\".\n\n* Prayer Alerts will ONLY alert you with an initial Takbir. The full azan (and its length) is NOT supported by the iOS alert mechanism as there is a maximum limit of 30 seconds of audio playback."

      "label": "StopTheMadness is a Safari extension that stops web sites from making your browser harder to use. And it protects your privacy on the web. StopTheMadness is not an ad blocker: it offers unique features not available from ad blockers or any other apps. StopTheMadness is one of a kind!\n\nMade by indie developer Jeff Johnson. The support link has documentation and my email address.\n\nMany web sites deliberately disable user interface features in Safari that you normally expect to work. StopTheMadness re-enables those features for you in Safari:\n• opening contextual menus\n• selecting, copying, cutting, and pasting of text\n• drag and drop\n• AutoFill/autocomplete of passwords, emails, etc.\n\nStopTheMadness also protects your privacy on the web:\n• Stops Google AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages)! Automatically loads the original \"canonical\" web site page instead of Google AMP.\n• Removes tracking tags such as utm_source, gclid, and fbclid from the end of URLs.\n• Stops clickjacking in Google Search, Gmail, Facebook, and DuckDuckGo.\n• Stops hyperlink auditing (anchor \"ping\").\n• Stops tracking beacons (Navigator.sendBeacon).\n• Stops sites from using the Page Visibility API to know when a tab is visible on your screen.\n• Stops URL shorteners. Checks the links you click in Safari for well-known link shorteners — bit.ly, tinyurl.com, l.facebook.com, t.co, etc. — and loads the unshortened destination URL instead of the shortened URL. This occurs without setting any cookies or other site data, so you can't be tracked by your click.\n\nBonus Features:\n• Stop videos from autoplaying. This works even on sites where Safari doesn't stop autoplay, such as YouTube. And YouTube video ads are automatically skipped! Also stops videos from following you down the page when you scroll on many sites.\n• Stop sites in Safari from pausing your audio in a background app such as Apple Music.\n• Show native video controls. Use Picture-in-Picture from Safari on sites that don't normally support it, including YouTube!\n• Automatically select the highest video quality on YouTube!\n• Hides the annoying popup banners prompting you to get the app on Google, Google Maps, DuckDuckGo, IMDb, Instagram, Quora, Reddit, and Tumblr!\n• Add your own site-specific CSS and JavaScript to web pages!\n• Custom URL redirects! Redirect new Reddit to old Reddit, Twitter to Nitter, YouTube to Invidious, etc. You can create any redirect that you want!\n• Stop keyboard page zoom. Stops the page from zooming in when you show the software keyboard!\n• Enable pinch-to-zoom on sites that prevent it, such as old reddit.\n• Stops \"Are you sure you want to leave this page?\" alerts. Close your tabs without getting stopped by the site!\n• Force external links to open in the current tab instead of a new tab. Remove target=\"_blank\" from links so that they no longer automatically create a new tab.\n• Force external links to open in a new tab instead of the current tab. This is great if you're scrolling through a list of links and want to open each one in a new tab.\n• Force images to the front. Bypass the transparent overlay on sites such as Instagram that prevents you from dragging and opening the contextual menu on images.\n• Warns when you paste or type beyond the maximum length in a password field or other text field. Stops you from accidentally losing characters!"

With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.\n\nAnd the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it is – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop. And with over 20 built-in themes and the ability to create your own, you can customize the results exactly the way you want.\n\nNoir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!\n\nBuilt from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Focus Filters and Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows. And your settings are automatically synced to all your devices using iCloud.\n\nAnd just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data. Period.\n\nNoir is made by a solo iOS developer. It does not include any subscriptions or ads. Buy Noir once, use it forever.\n\nNotes:\n• Found a website where Noir’s dark mode doesn’t look just right? Let me know by reporting it. The app will be frequently updated to address issues that are reported.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\n• The Noir extension requires access to the websites you visit to analyze the existing style of the page and to override it with Noir's dark style.\n• Noir never collects your browsing data. The only data Noir ‘collects’ are your settings, and those will never leave your device.\n• You can read Noir’s full Privacy Policy at https://getnoir.app/privacypolicy"

These are the devices the size of a coin that will transmit signals back to the owners for anything up to a year with just a watch battery. Before these devices came to market tracking would require larger batteries & sim cards which would become quite large and simple to find.\nHow the Crowd Locate system works:\nCrowd locate works on the basis that when a tile is paired to a phone it will stay connected to that phone whilst paired and within approx. 30ft. Once the tile device goes out of range it will start sending a signal to \"Find me\" This signal will be collected by any persons phone that runs the tile app! This is how crowd locate works, the more people having the app the more chances the tile can be pinpointed. Once the tile has come within 30ft of another mobile phone running the app it will pinpoint that exact location on a map and send that information back to the owner of the tile! This will give the owner of the tile a real time location on a map with a time when located.\nWith our App you can search all devices within approx. 30ft and the App will list all devices detected.\nThe App will only detect devices that you don't have paired to your own phone or that are currently sending out signals because they are out of range to paired device. \nThis can be put to the test if you have a tile that has been paired to your phone. When you have a tile paired to your phone and the tile app is running on your phone the Crowd GPS Scanner App will NOT list any tiles that you own. Now swipe closed the tile app and turn off your phone then turn it back on. The tile you own will now be in lost mode because it's not connected to your phone. Whilst in lost mode it will be transmitting a signal \"Find me\" so now if you open the Crowd GPS Scanner App it will now list the tile device on the screen. Stop clear the results and start the tile App which will pair to the tile. Now if you run the Crowd GPS Scanner App it will NOT list your own device."

      "label": "The Miracle Box is an app used for Spirit Communication and ITC Research. You must use this correctly, responsibly and by using it you are doing so at your own risk. To see the full information and Q&A on how to use this app correctly, you can visit: https://huffparanormal.com/2021/05/the-miracle-box-spirit-communication-app-is-here/\n\nThe Miracle Box includes methods used by Steve Huff of Huff Paranormal in his Astral Doorway and Miracle Box full size devices. The app has eleven banks, which are all reversed human speech. There are no words, no music, no phrases and nothing programmed in to make you think spirit is speaking with you. This is an advanced yet simple ITC app based on eleven years of research and communication. It will not work for everyone (no app or box does). \n\nWhen using it, you must do so correctly. If you do not have a connection to spirit you will not hear replies come through. Instead, you will hear gibberish, nothing. That is by design. This app is designed to only bring you true responses, if and only if you connect with a spirit when using it. No matter the app or device you use, the connection is the #1 aspect of getting results. \n\nAlways use this with love, respect, kindness and a clear mind. If you do not hear replies, try again at another time, or a different place. Do not use it if you are angry, depressed, in a negative mood or fearful of it. If you fear this, do not use this app as fear is an energy we put out that can and could attract undesirable spirits. Love is the key here and this is meant for serous ITC researchers and enthusiasts. \n\nJust pick a voice, press record, ask a question and move the slider to the right for 1-3 seconds and then slide it back. You will soon hear a voice emerge that will either be answering you (if you connected) or gibberish (if you did not). Even if you do not hear a reply in real time, always check the recording as it could have changed. \n\nThis is a tool you can grow with. To learn how to build a connection, and see demo videos with this app in action visit the Huff Paranormal YouTube Channel."

Fast, versatile and easy to use, the CX-3® delivers accurate results quickly and efficiently. Whether used for flight planning, ground school, or FAA Knowledge Exam preparation, the menu organization reflects the order in which a flight is normally planned and executed, resulting in a natural flow from one function to the next with a minimum of keystrokes. Multiple aviation functions can be performed on the CX-3® flight computer including those related to time, speed, distance, heading, wind, fuel, altitude, cloud base, standard atmosphere, glide, climb & descent, weight & balance, as well as a holding pattern function to help determine entry method and holding details. The CX-3® has 12 unit-conversions: Distance, Speed, Duration, Temperature, Pressure, Volume, Rate, Weight, Rate of Climb/Descent, Angle of Climb/Descent, Torque, and Angle. These 12 conversion categories contain 38 different conversion factors for over 100 functions. A calculator, clock, timer, and stopwatch are also built in along with multiple settings for lighting, backlighting, themes, time zones and more."

      "label": "In this the limited but therefore free version of Clinometer. It as all features but can not be calibrated. This professional tool called Clinometer is the most precise (all you can get with some calculations) slope measurement tool for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. It can be used for simple applications like aligning a frame as well as for more sophisticated fields of applications where an arbitrary slope needs to be measured exactly. Read the reviews (and write your own) for all the applications you find! Thank for all your positive feedback! Please use our support link if you have questions and suggestions, we don't read the iTunes reviews every day. \n\nWith this tool, the slope can be measured by all edges of the device in every direction. When the device is put flat on the table a bubble view will fade in. The current features include: \n\n◆ Five different unit modes: The device can display the slope in degrees (rounded or in tenth of degrees), percentage, rise over run (common for roof slope measurement in :12) and 1V:H (common in engineering) \n\n◆ Dial Rotation: You can smoothly rotate the background dial and thus define which side of the device represents 0° and 90° degrees. \n\n◆ Motion-sensitive Lock feature: Besides the common instant simple tap hold mechanism you can activate the motion-sensitive lock. If activated the device waits for the final lock until you hold your device steady enough for at least 2 seconds. You can set the lock sensitivity between 0.1° and 1.0° degrees. \n\n◆ Volume Button Lock: Use volume buttons to trigger the lock.\n\n◆ Peer Mode: Use two devices to measure angles: One as a display, the other as the measurement device that can be attached to the hardware you want to align. \n\n◆ Fullscreen Mode: The full screen mode can be toggled by tapping the center of the screen and by the upper and lower arrows in the center. This prevents you from erroneous inputs while measuring.\n\n◆ Different color schemes: Press the S/C Button to instantly switch the color. The color can be selected differently for the bubble and the clinometer mode. The predefined color sets include day and night color schemes (Black on White, White on Black and Red). \n\n◆ Adjustable Auto-Lock: You can prevent the device from turning into the sleep mode.\n\nOnly the full version has a two way calibration feature!\n\nPlease support us and buy the full version if you can. \n\nAccording to wikipedia: An inclinometer or clinometer is an instrument for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or inclination of an object with respect to gravity. It is also known as a tilt meter, tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. \n\nFor recreational use only. After the calibration it CAN (!) be very accurate especially for the main axis after calibration. The measurement is performed as well as possible (we try our best) by using the three inbuilt accelerometers. \n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! \n\nWe will improve the application long-term. This was the first application of this kind shortly after the opening of the App Store. Since then it is continuously updated and enriched with new features.\n\n► Check out all our products (free and paid) on www.plaincode.com"

      "label": "Necrophonic is an ITC app used for spirit communication and EVP research.\n\n8 Sounds Banks:\n\nThe audio has been mastered in a way to bring out various sound properties . \nUsing Pro Tools I was able to enhance high, mid, and low range frequencies. I also applied \nother filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an \nenvironment suitable for spirit communication.\n\nThe audio itself is made up of phonemes, \npartial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help \nspirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.\nthere are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.\n\nThese sounds banks play in a similar\nway to that of my other app \"Spiritus Ghost Box\" but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has\n8 active sound banks.\n\nWhite Noise Sound Bank:\n\nThis app also has an optional 9th sound bank called \"White noise\". \nThis bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This \naudio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the \n\"Holy Grail\" of EVP recorders. This is not a White Noise Generator, this is a normal sound bank like the others but this one contains white noise from the DR60.\n\nAudio Effects:\n\nThis app does contain Echo and Reverb audio effects. These have been proven \nto be the best effects to apply to ITC sessions. The echo can create audio that can be \nmanipulated within the echo itself. Echo can also help in live, real time communication by \nrepeating the audio and allowing you to better hear whats coming through. Reverb can be \napplied to the audio to create a spacious sound environment that will enhance audio manipulation."

      "label": "What if you could take the best construction calculator and fix it.  That’s right ... you love it, it has served you well, and you stand by it ... but could it do more?  Could it be easier to use?\n\nAfter testing by pros from around the world, BuildCalc is ready to give you more - more function and more answers with less complexity, less hassle, and less confusion. \n\n\nMORE FUNCTIONALITY:\n\n• Advanced Baluster Function: Complete layout of railing and staircase balusters with less guess work - and with all the flexibility you need for every custom job.\n• Advanced Stair function: Stair layouts for professional results - including dimensioned drawings of your Stringer, Stringer Installation, and Finished Staircase.  And you can email a PDF of these drawings right from BuildCalc so you can print them or share them. \n• Fence Function: Give BuildCalc a fence row length and it will tell you how many posts, rails, pickets, and or panels you need.  \n• Interactive Functions: The Stair, Baluster, Compound Miter, and Rafter functions are now fully interactive.  Want to change input values?  Change the Run?  Switch between Regular and Irregular Hip Roof analysis?  You can do this and your results will be updated automatically - without you needing to remember what key to press. \n\n\nMORE ANSWERS:\n\n• You are no longer tied down to: only one brick, block or tile size for the masonry function; a fixed number of drywall sheet sizes; only one footer cross sectional area; or one size of shingles and sheathing.  If you don’t see the size you want, you can add as many as you need.  And for area input, you can store your custom sizes in Length x Width format, so you won’t have to do mental gymnastics to figure out what was the dimensions for that last size you stored.\n• Want to cut your hip roof rafter using a miter saw ... or a circular saw using a hand-held protractor?  With a tap of a button, BuildCalc will automatically switch between Miter Saw and Protractor results.  BuildCalc can do this for Compound Miters, too.\n• Sheathing Angles, Purlin Angles, Gable Area, Backing Angles, Plan Angles, Rough vs. Finished Stair Layout Dimensions, Stringer Throat, Stringer installation dimensions ... and a lot more not found on other construction calculators.\n\n\nLESS COMPLEXITY AND LESS HASSLE:\n\n• Tired of having to press and press and press buttons to get the results of a calculation?  BuildCalc puts an end to this.  For all advanced functions, you get ALL of your results in list form with just one or two key taps.  \n• And, rather than having to write down those results, all advanced functions allow you to save your results - as many times as you want with a label you choose - so you can recall the complete results at your convenience.  Now you can do a calculation today and two days, two weeks or two years later, it is there for you.\n• Less “quirks”.  Have you been annoyed by arcane key stroke sequences on other construction calculators?  We are too.  BuildCalc 2.1 streamlined the keystrokes to do a better job of giving you less “errors” and more results.  Don’t remember what you have to enter before a Hip Rafter or Stair calculation?  Well, now you don’t have to.  BuildCalc will provide you with a check list of inputs and on-the-spot help to get it right.\n• Drywall and Masonry “Room Mode”:  If you have stored a Length, Width and Height for a room, BuildCalc will give you the Drywall or Masonry required for the walls and the ceiling / floor - with only a tap of the Drywall or Masonry button.  No more pondering over complex key sequences ... it just works.\n\n\nNOW WITH ADVANCED STAIRS, BALUSTER, AND HIP/VALLEY FUNCTIONS\n\nGet more results than you ever could before - including dimensioned Stringer, Stringer Installation and Finished Staircase Drawings.  Drawings can then be emailed to others or printed at your convenience.  Email us and we'll send you an example!"

      "label": "Anyone can make their own tunes in Forza. It comes down to doing the right math, taking a test drive and knowing when to make a few adjustments. Nothing magic. ForzaTune Pro does the complex math for you, and makes it easy to adjust the car to your driving style and skill.\n\nTell ForzaTune you're driving a Supra on the streets of Mexico, and it creates a tune to match. If you prefer a more aggressive or more stable feel, then open up the tune customizer to set oversteer or understeer in each part of a turn. ForzaTune works out the new values for you automatically.\n\nThere's nothing better than driving a car dialed in how you want it. And a car that feels planted lets you drive faster.\n\nThis Pro version includes many extra tuning types like rally, drag and drift plus gearing options, the ability to save tunes, and finer control over your tune balance.\n\nHere are the complete specs if you'd like to learn more:\n\nONE APP TO TUNE THEM ALL\nForzaTune Pro has support for Forza Horizon 5, Forza Horizon 4, Forza Motorsport 7 and also includes most vehicles in Forza Horizon 3 and Forza Motorsport 6.\n\nMAKE STREET, DRIFT, RALLY TUNES AND MORE\nNo matter what kind of driving you like, this tuning app has you covered. Create standard (street/track), drift, drag, rain, rally/snow, and off-road tunes with ease.\n\nLEARN HOW TO QUICKLY FINE-TUNE\nAdjust the overall balance, turn entry balance, turn exit balance, ride stiffness, roll stiffness in seconds.\n\nRETUNE GEARS WITH EASE\nIncludes a gearing calculator option that lets you match race transmission values to engine swaps or major power upgrades. \n\nTUNES ARE TAILORED TO EACH CAR\n1140+ vehicles covering Forza Horizon 5 back through Forza Motorsport 6. Tuning for some special editions (F&F, Team Forza, FE) is done with the base car unless noted otherwise. ForzaTune does not include oval racing vehicles or tuning.\n\nACCURATE FORMULAS\nForzaTune Pro combines your input with its vehicle and track databases to create original, balanced tunes. Formulas are based on real race engineering. They are also tested extensively with a gamepad and steering wheel/pedal set.\n\nSAVE AND MANAGE YOUR TUNES\nSave, edit, search and backup all of your tunes. Export and import options let you transfer your tunes to new devices or friends easily without logins or accounts.\n\n-----\nFAQs\n-----\nQ: Is this for beginners or experienced tuners?\nA: Both. Experienced tuners use it to save time. Newer tuners use it to learn how to tune.\n\nQ: How do I use the app?\nA: Copy several car details from the game into ForzaTune, hit \"Next\" and copy the results into the tuning menu in Forza Horizon 5 or an earlier Forza title. There is also a series of video tutorials on YouTube to get you started.\n\nQ: What settings and upgrades do I need?\nA: You will need racing upgrades like suspension, braking, anti-roll bars, and differential to change the values in the tuning menu. You can also use drift, rally and adjustable stock suspensions when available (like off-road buggies and some trucks in Horizon). You will also have the best results if you disable stability management (STM) and traction control (TCS) for lower class cars. Normal or simulation steering is fine, but simulation steering is recommended in FH5 especially when fine-tuning.\n\nQ: Why is tuning your cars important?\nA: When doing upgrades many of the default tune settings will not match the new build. ForzaTune brings it back to a balanced setup. Also, tuning doesn't affect your PI or race restrictions—so this is how you can gain an advantage over other racers.\n\n---\nMake better tunes faster with ForzaTune Pro."

      "label": "Convenience on the wrist - Watch app for Tesla is the ideal companion in day to day life with your Tesla vehicle. These are just a few of the day to day conveniences this app will help achieve:\n\n - Forgot to plug in? Get a notification if vehicle is in a pre-configured location and not plugged in - all done directly on the watch, no external servers required, keeping your privacy!\n\n - Add the graphic corner complication to your watch face and enjoy the convenience of having easy access to state of charge, charging indicator, time remaining if charging, sentry mode active indicator and indicator if any windows, doors or trunks are open. All from one complication, that also will launch the app when tapped. \n\n - During and after charge, a panel will show how much energy was added. Convenient if you schedule your charge during the night - wake up each morning and easily check how much energy was added to the battery. \n\n - If you have multiple vehicles on your account, tap the vehicle name to quickly and easily switch between them. \n\n - You can queue up commands by tapping on buttons, then put your wrist down and the commands will execute in the background when the vehicle is successfully woken up. \n\n - When you tap the unlock vehicle button, the charge port will also unlock if a charging cable is attached. That's convenience right there!\n\n - Want to reduce phantom drain? Background updates can be configured to longer intervals between updates or to only update if car is already awake or can be disabled entirely for absolutely zero impact on phantom drain.\n\n - A warning panel will show up if any doors, windows or trunks are left open. Conveniently, you can tap the panel to close any open windows.\n\n - Need to access the frunk? Just do it from your wrist - no fiddling with your phone. \n\n - Sitting comfy in the couch, but just remembered you have a road-trip in the morning? Set the charge limit to 100% - or any value really - and start charging, right from the convenience of your wrist!\n\n - Leaving the office after a long hot day? Activate the HVAC when you're on your way, and enjoy a nice cool vehicle.\n\n - When charging, tap the time remaining label to switch to show time of expected completion - no more head calculus!\n\n - Need to run a quick errand, but you don't have your phone? Unlock your vehicle from your wrist, then activate remote start and off you go. Just please be mindful that this feature requires internet connectivity on both watch and vehicle - so don't drive into the desert and leave your vehicle, or you'll get stuck there!\n\nA note about security and privacy:\nThis app accepts two types of login. Either Tesla account credentials or a Tesla API token. Your account credentials are by default not stored in the app, but are used only once to obtain an authentication token and refresh token directly from the Tesla API server. If you would rather supply that token yourself, you can do so instead. It is preferable to supply a refresh token, as the app will then have a perpetual login. Your token will be persisted in the app. Tokens will be revoked if you change your Tesla account password. With the optional remote start feature you can choose to store your password in the app - it will be securely stored in the iOS / watchOS / iPadOS keychain. This feature is optional and is not required for all other features to function. No network traffic will ever be emitted from this app that goes anywhere other than directly to the Tesla API servers. The source code for this application will at all times be made available to any security researcher for a voluntary security and safety audit. \n\nDisclaimer: \nThis app is not endorsed by Tesla Inc. Use at your own risk. No guarantee of proper function is given. Only you are responsible for any changes to your car caused by using this app.  \n\nMade in Denmark"

All watch complication types are supported, including those really weird ones.  Also you can change the complication icon under Settings;\n7. The watch app can listen automatically on launch.

      "label": "HouseCurve is a multi-tool for audio systems.  Use it for room correction, adjusting equalizers, setting subwoofer phase, choosing crossovers and more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Sine sweep measurements\n* Display magnitude, phase and group delay\n* Compare measurements to target curve\n* Generate room correction filters (IIR or FIR)\n* Export parametric EQ settings or impulse response\n* Average and history display modes\n* Measurement save and undo\n* Use with built-in or external microphones\n* Connect with AirPlay, Bluetooth, headphone jack (analog) or use externally played sweeps\n\nHouseCurve measures in-room frequency response by listening to your audio system play a sine sweep.  Measurements are displayed on top of a target curve, making it easy to see where adjustment is needed.  Multiple measurements can be averaged to fully capture how the system sounds in the listening area.  With small changes and repeat measurements, you can manually tune your system to the target curve.  If your audio system has a parametric equalizer or convolution engine, HouseCurve can automatically generate filter settings to match the target curve.\n\nHouseCurve can help with home and car audio system tuning, from system equalization and room correction to subwoofer time alignment and speaker placement.  Visit housecurve.com for more information on how HouseCurve works and how to use it.\n\nFree trial - visit housecurve.com and give the HouseCurve app clip a try.\n\nHouseCurve will produce acceptable results with the built in iPhone/iPad microphone. Using calibrated external microphones will provide higher accuracy."

Hallelujah.\n\nThis Old House Magazine\n\n\nBalusterPro is an awesome app and can be used for a multitude of layout tasks, at your desk, on the job, in your car—wherever your phone goes, and it only costs a few bucks.\n\nGary Katz - Master finish carpenter and publisher of THISiscarpentry.com\n\n\nBalusterPro makes building that stairway more heavenly\n\nhomefixated.com\n____________________________________\n\n\nInstructions for Use:\n\nBalusterPro offers calculations for six different common handrail situations which you may encounter.  First, tap the settings button to select your measurement input method, then select the desired type of baluster installation. Use the keypad or sliders to enter your measurements for ‘Run Length’ (distance between the newel posts) and the ‘Baluster Width.’  Finally, just drag the ‘Balusters Needed’ slider to see your required number of balusters. As you adjust the ‘Balusters Needed’ slider, the “Spacing Between Balusters” will simultaneously update. Stop when your ‘Spacing Between Balusters’ meets your specific code requirements.  Tap the view button to see a list of all the centers and edges of the balusters. No longer will you need to keep pressing the add button on your traditional calculator to list your centers....they are all shown on one screen! It’s just that simple! You can display your measurements by selecting 1/16, 1/32, or metric on the main screen to determine your precision level.  If desired you can also display your result down to 1/64.  To do this, once you have done your calculation, simply tap the 'Spacing Between Balusters' result and if possible it will be further reduced down to 1/64 and displayed for 5 seconds.  This is handy if you want to cut all your fillets at once as it nearly eliminates cumulative error.  Tap the speak buttons at the bottoms of the list columns to have the app speak your measurements. \n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nCheck out my other construction related apps...StairBuilderPro for a stair stringer layout tool & TilePro for a simple tile layout tool.\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nCheck out the video demo at my website to see BalusterPro in action."

Maintaining husbandry tasks, testing, stability, water changes, inhabitant stats etc. are all vital to keeping successful aquariums. \n\nPocket Marine was designed to make inputting, storing and keeping all information with you at ease. Often, any issues that we have with our aquariums can be linked to actions that were performed a short time beforehand. For this reason, a log of changes made, actions performed or additions can be vital when trying to decipher a problem that may be in play. Pen and paper has always been a great way to keep this information at hand but, Pocket Marine offers a place to store this somewhere that, this day and age, is with us at all times.\n\nNot just for tracking events. Pocket Marine is a great way to help you log your inhabitants into specific tanks, record your latest water change for your mixed reef tank or simply log your latest maintenance action performed on the fish only office tank. Recording your information couldnt be easier and keeping it on your mobile device saves on that frantic search incase of needing the information at a later date.\n\nHelp with that last second impulse buy at the store. With an in depth library of over 800 species of fish, invertebrates and coral and being added to daily, you will always have the information on hand that you need to make that informed decision on a purchase. \n\nWe hope you enjoy using the app and that we can help with your success in the hobby and welcome any feature requests you may have.\n\nHappy Reefing!"

      "label": "This professional tool called Clinometer is the most precise (all you can get with some calculations) slope measurement tool for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad using all sides of the device plus the camera. It can be used for simple applications like aligning a frame as well as for more sophisticated fields of applications where an arbitrary slope needs to be measured exactly. Read the reviews (and write your own) for all the applications you find! Thank for all your positive feedback! Please use our support link if you have questions and suggestions, we don't read the iTunes reviews every day!\n\nWith this tool, the slope can be measured by all edges of the device and through the camera. The current features include:\n\n◆ 3 Modes (incl. auto switching): Clinometer mode (auto when holding upright), Camera mode (any direction, manual activation) and Bubble level (smoothly fading in when holding flat).\n\n◆ Relative angles: Besides measuring absolute angles, for every mode you can measure the relative angle between device positions\n\n◆ Advanced two way calibration on all sides: For every 4 sides plus the bubble mode you can calibrate in two steps, which allows you to calibrate exactly even on non-level surfaces. Each direction can be calibrated individually to achieve the optimal precision. \n\n◆ Speech synthesis: The device will speak the current reading, so you don't have to watch the display while measuring/aligning your object.\n\n◆ Five different unit modes: The device can display the slope in degrees (rounded or in tenth of degrees), percentage, rise over run (common for roof slope measurement in :12) and 1V:H (common in engineering)\n\n◆ Dial Rotation: You can smoothly rotate the background dial and thus define which side of the device represents 0° and 90° degrees. \n\n◆ Motion-sensitive Lock feature: Besides the common instant simple tap hold mechanism you can activate the motion-sensitive lock. If activated the device waits for the final lock until you hold your device steady enough for at least 2 seconds. You can set the lock sensitivity between 0.1° and 1.0° degrees. \n\n◆ Peer Mode: Use two devices to measure angles: One as a display, the other as the measurement device that can be attached to the hardware you want to align. \n\n◆ Fullscreen Mode: The full screen mode can be toggled by tapping the center of the screen and by the upper and lower arrows in the center. This prevents you from erroneous inputs while measuring.\n\n◆ Different color schemes: Press the S/C Button to instantly switch the color. The color can be selected differently for the bubble and the clinometer mode. The predefined color sets include day and night color schemes (Black on White, White on Black and Red). \n\n◆ Adjustable Auto-Lock: You can prevent the device from turning into the sleep mode. \n\nAccording to wikipedia: An inclinometer or clinometer is an instrument for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or inclination of an object with respect to gravity. It is also known as a tilt meter, tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. \n\nFor recreational use only. After the calibration it CAN (!) be very accurate especially for the main axis after calibration. The measurement is performed as well as possible (we try our best) by using the three inbuilt accelerometers. \n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! \n\nWe will improve the application long-term. This was the first application of this kind shortly after the opening of the App Store. Since then it is continuously updated and enriched with new features."

Great if you connect your computer to the TV or projector, to control from a sofa or bed.\n\nIn 2013, I created this app to control my Mac Mini connected to a big-screen TV in my living room. In 2016 I quit my job and became an indie developer, and now my sole focus is on building my apps. The app has been downloaded more than 2,000,000 times over the years and has favorable reviews.\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n· Remote Mouse and Keyboard\n· Media Controls for popular apps and websites\n· Live view of your computer screen\n· System Commands: shut down, restart, sleep, etc.\n· Launch and Quit apps\n· Use Siri to control your computer\n· Control Sound Output / Screen Mirroring [Mac only]\n\nADVANCED FEATURES\n· Create Control Panels\n· Add Custom Actions using AppleScript / PowerShell\n\nQUICK AND EASY SETUP\n· Install the free helper app from https://cherpake.com/get\n· Connect both devices to the same network\n\nSECURITY\nThe app uses standard security measures like HTTPS to communicate and only works on your local network. Whenever an unknown device tries to establish a connection with your computer,  the app presents a dialog for you to choose to allow or deny it.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n· Mac with macOS 10.10 or newer\n· PC with Windows 7 SP1 or newer\n· Latest helper app (available at https://cherpake.com/get)\n· Shared network connection (WiFi or Personal Hotspot), see https://cherpake.com/connect\n\nFREE TRIAL\nThis app is a hidden gem that most people don't know they need. Those are not my words, just one of the latest app reviews. Still not convinced, download and install the free app and use the free trial to see it yourself. Available at https://bit.ly/mpcrc"

      "label": "\"Decibel X\" is the leading noise meter app on the market, which has highly reliable, pre-calibrated measurements and supports dBA, dBC. Our success lies at the intersection of expertise in sound communication, listening to our dear users, and our vision to build a great product. Our app turns your iOS device into a professional sound level meter, precisely measures the sound pressure level (SPL) all around you. While this pro tool mainly aids audio experts or workers prone to noise pollution, it can also add more fun and protect your hearing. Have you ever wondered how quiet your surroundings are or how loud is a rock concert or football match? \"Decibel X\" will help you answer all of those.\n\nWHAT MAKE IT GREAT AND STAND OUT FROM OTHER APPS:\n\n- Trusted accuracy: the app is tested and pre calibrated for all Apple devices. The precision is matching with real SPL devices\n- Apple Watch support: see noise level right from your wrist\n- Health App integration: export noise levels directly into Health app.\n- Frequency weighting filters: ITU-R 468, A, B, C, Z\n- Powerful, smart history data management:\n  + Recording data can be saved into a list of history records for future access and analysis\n  + Each record can be exported as hi-res PNG graph or CSV text via sharing services\n  + iCloud support which synchronize all history records across your Apple devices\n  + Fullscreen mode to give overview the whole history of an record\n- Dosimeter with NIOSH, OSHA standards\n- FFT and BAR graphs to display real time FFT. Those are very useful for frequency analysis and musical tests. Real time predominant frequency is also displayed.\n- WAVE graph with 2 display modes: Rolling & Buffer\n- InstaDecibel to capture your dB report overlaid on photos and easily shared via popular social networks (Facebook, Instagram, Messages, etc.).\n- Support both Portrait and Landscape layouts\n- Beautiful, intuitive and carefully crafted UI design\n- Optimized for iOS 11\n\nOTHER GREAT FEATURES:\n\n- Standard time weightings (Response Time): SLOW (500 milliseconds) and FAST (200 milliseconds)\n- Trimming calibration from -15 dB to 15 dB\n- Standard measurement range from 30 dBA up to 130 dBA\n- HISTO graph for plotted history of the recorded values\n- Real time scale level chart\n- Display Current, Average/Leq, and Max values with both nice and clear digital and analog layouts\n- Quick reference text to help you compare with real-life examples\n- \"Keep Device Stay Awake\" option for long duration recording\n- Reset and clear current recording at any time\n- Tap on Max value to reset at any time\n- Pause/Resume the tool at any time\n\nNOTES:\n\n- Please do not expect a quiet room reading will be 0 dBA. The range 30-130 dBA is the standard usable range and an average quiet room will be about 30 dBA.\n- Although all devices are pre-calibrated, custom calibration is suggested for serious purposes requiring higher precision and accuracy. You will need a real external device or calibrated sound meter as a reference, then adjust the trimming calibration until the reading matches with the reference.\n\n* Choose from different subscription options. Our standard subscription options are:\n1-month Subscription\n1-year Subscription \n\n* Subscription payments will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of your purchase and upon commencement of each renewal term.

      "label": "This tool shows you the ultimate precise time of day. To achieve this, it uses a special internet time protocol to fetch the time from an atomic time server.\n\nWe are proud to offer version 5 of the Gorgy Timing Atomic Clock. The program is one of the classic applications since the early days of the Apple App Store and has been continually improved based on user feedback.\n\nThe Gorgy Timing Atomic Clock shows the precise time of day. To achieve this, it uses a special internet time protocol to fetch the ultimate precise time from cesium atomic clocks available on the internet, or any other time server you like.\n\nThe graphical display mimics the clock display of the legendary Gorgy Timing clocks, which are used in professional radio and television studios, and we spent much effort to bring the original feeling of these wickedly expensive clocks to your iPhone. This app is used by BBC studios, astronomers, concert promoters, etc. \n\nVersion 5 contains the following functions:\n\n* Universal support for all iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices running iOS 8 or higher (including iPhone 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, and all of the latest iPads and iPads Pro)\n* Optimized for iOS 13 and watchOS 6, full 64 bit support\n* Alarm function with snooze (touch anywhere on the screen), volume fade-in, based on weekdays\n* Alarm time based on seconds (not minutes)\n* Local time / UTC time mode\n* Alarm notification window instead of normal alarm sound, if app is not running or in the background\n* Use playlists or a manual picker selection from your own music library as alarm sounds\n* The alarm sound is also playing when the device is muted, or the display is switched off, and also works in AirPlay environments\n* Customizable time server sources\n* Colors: green, red, blue, yellow, white, dark green, violet, pink, orange, turquoise and hidden, with a separate color option for digits, seconds and segments\n* Alternative visual display of fractional seconds (1/60th sec. resolution)\n* 12/24 hours display\n* Optional second tick sound\n* Full landscape support (including settings dialog)\n* Touching the display lets the buttons and status bar fade out\n* Touching the display again will add the current date (in all orientations)\n* Disabled screen auto-lock\n* Options \"sync at startup\", \"hourly\", \"daily\", or a sync button for manual syncing\n* The last known time delta is used when started without sync\n* \"Night mode\", which dims the display using a slider, shows the seconds with only one dot (to prevent a hard brightness switch between second 59 and second 0), switches off the tick sound, and reduces screen updates to save battery\n* To minimize burn-in effects (especially on the iPhone X OLED display), the clock is doing micro movements when running longer than 5 minutes\n* VoiceOver support\n\nAnswers to common questions:\n\n* An application can not set your device's system time, so a time sync between the atomic time and the device time is not possible.\n* If you want to wakeup with music, please do not exit the app before going to sleep (which would result in a local notification dialog without music in the morning), and do not lock your device. Be aware that running an application all the time, even without display, consumes battery, so please make sure that your iPhone is fully charged before you go to bed, connect it to your charger, or use the app's Night mode, which is much more energy-saving."

(USA)\n√ I have recommended this app to a number of people. I like the magnifier but use the flashlight most every day. (USA)\n\nThe flash is used to light up the image when you touch the 'flashlight' icon on screen.  It is only on when you want it on.  With that said, continued use of the flash may dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nThis app is primarily financed through the use of Apple's iAd feature.

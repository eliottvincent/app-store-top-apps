With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.\n\nAnd the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it is – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop. And with over 20 built-in themes and the ability to create your own, you can customize the results exactly the way you want.\n\nNoir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!\n\nBuilt from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Focus Filters and Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows. And your settings are automatically synced to all your devices using iCloud.\n\nAnd just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data. Period.\n\nNoir is made by a solo iOS developer. It does not include any subscriptions or ads. Buy Noir once, use it forever.\n\nNotes:\n• Found a website where Noir’s dark mode doesn’t look just right? Let me know by reporting it. The app will be frequently updated to address issues that are reported.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\n• The Noir extension requires access to the websites you visit to analyze the existing style of the page and to override it with Noir's dark style.\n• Noir never collects your browsing data. The only data Noir ‘collects’ are your settings, and those will never leave your device.\n• You can read Noir’s full Privacy Policy at https://getnoir.app/privacypolicy"

I also applied \nother filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an \nenvironment suitable for spirit communication.\n\nThe audio itself is made up of phonemes, \npartial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help \nspirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.\nthere are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.\n\nThese sounds banks play in a similar\nway to that of my other app \"Spiritus Ghost Box\" but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has\n8 active sound banks.\n\nWhite Noise Sound Bank:\n\nThis app also has an optional 9th sound bank called \"White noise\". \nThis bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This \naudio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the \n\"Holy Grail\" of EVP recorders. This is not a White Noise Generator, this is a normal sound bank like the others but this one contains white noise from the DR60.\n\nAudio Effects:\n\nThis app does contain Echo and Reverb audio effects. These have been proven \nto be the best effects to apply to ITC sessions. The echo can create audio that can be \nmanipulated within the echo itself. Echo can also help in live, real time communication by \nrepeating the audio and allowing you to better hear whats coming through. Reverb can be \napplied to the audio to create a spacious sound environment that will enhance audio manipulation."

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here. Chromecast is a trademark of Google LLC."

      "label": "iCab Mobile is a web browser for the iOS. It provides many unique and useful features you won't find in other iPhone browsers.\n\nAPPLE WATCH:\nThe Watch App is a remote control for iCab Mobile, so you can navigate, zoom, scroll, open bookmarks, links, the homepage, switch tabs or sitch on/off the fullscreen mode. Since watchOS 6.2 you can also open web pages and browse the Web directly on the Apple Watch. But there are a few limitations: The watchOS will always show a privacy warning when starting a browsing session and there are no navigation buttons (back/forward) available.\n\nFILE UPLOADS:\niCab Mobile can upload any files on web pages.\n\nSEARCHING:\niCab Mobile comes with several default search engines you can choose from. You can easily add new search engines. \n\nFILLING OUT FORMS:\niCab Mobile can save web forms and restore the form content later (manually or automatically). The saved forms data can be password protected. Supports many third-party Password Manager Apps as well.\n\nFILTERS:\nThere’s a built-in fully customizable filter feature. It allows to block resources, ads, banners, user tracking scripts, cookies etc. Supports AdBlock Plus/EasyList filters as well.\n\nTABS:\niCab Mobile supports Tabs, so you can open multiple web pages at the same time. Links can be opened in Tabs (in the foreground or background) manually or automatically. \n\nBOOKMARKS:\nBookmarks can be organized in folders. You can import/export the bookmarks from/to your PC/Mac browser. \n\nFULLSCREEN MODE:\niCab Mobile provides a fullscreen mode where the whole screen is used to display the web page. No screen space is wasted for toolbars. \n\nDOWNLOADS:\niCab Mobile has a built-in Download Manager so you can download almost all files from the internet. The downloads can be easily transfered to a Mac/PC/Linux computer but also to other Apps on the device which can open these files\n\nMULTIUSER SUPPORT\nYou can create multiple user accounts, each user has its own private bookmarks, filters, settings, etc.\n\nDROPBOX\niCab Mobile supports Dropbox. Export/Import bookmarks; transfer downloads, images, files, web pages to your Dropbox account.\n\nTWIN BROWSER:\nIn this mode, you can have two browsers side by side on the iPad. This is especially useful on the large iPad Pro.\n\nVOICEOVER\nThe App is also accessible for visually impaired and blind users. If VoiceOver is enabled, the App plays soft ticks while a page is loading, so blind users are able to identify when the page load has finished. \n\nOTHER FEATURE:\n- Configurable multi-touch gestures\n- QuickStarter feature\n- AirPrint support \n- Browser ID (UserAgent) is configurable\n- iCab Mobile fully supports international domain names\n- Cookie Manager\n- Private Browsing (no history and no cookies are stored)\n- Privacy settings allows to delete all kinds of private data (history, cookies, databases, saved forms, passwords etc.)\n- URL autocompletion \n- Simple built-in RSS reader\n- Save images, whole web pages, PDF files\n- Kiosk Mode - a restricted variation of the fullscreen mode for Kiosk environments. \n- History\n- Addressbook support lets you access the web pages from the addressbook. \n- When launching iCab can either open an empty page, the homepage or restore the Tabs which were open the last time\n- There are different color schemes and designs\n- Document Sharing lets you pass downloads and files to other Apps in the device\n\n\n\nThe App includes a store providing several InApp purchases. These are meant as a tip jar. The InApp purchases are available for different prices, so you can pick the amount for the tip yourself. Doing so will unlock a few cool features as a reward, these are always the same, regardless of the amount of the tip. Users who have purchased the App within the last 12 months do get all these features for free, no need to buy one of the InApp purchases. Though they can nevertheless give me a tip, if they want to... ;-)"

You can use a Siri Shortcut to launch the app and start speaking, just by raising your wrist on Apple Watch.  See the support page on how to configure;\n6. All watch complication types are supported, including those really weird ones.  Also you can change the complication icon under Settings;\n7. The watch app can listen automatically on launch. There is an option under settings to do the same thing on the iPhone;\n8. If the weather or time are wrong, ensure you've enabled Location access in the Alexa app to the \"Voice in a Can\" device, and that you have granted Location permissions to the app on your phone;\n9. You don't have to say \"Alexa\" ... just speak your command when the app is listening;\n10. You can change the language that you speak and hear responses in, under \"Settings\" on the watch and phone.  Only languages supported by Alexa are supported. The language should be set automatically.\n\nIf you have questions or any support issues please don't hesitate to email damian@voiceinacan.com ... you should get a response within 24 hours, and often in minutes.\n\nThis app was not created or endorsed by Amazon.

      "label": "Amplitude Pro includes all of the fun features of Amplitude and now the ability to record and share your audio with your friends!\r\n\r\nAmplitude Pro enhances aural experiences by allowing you to hear distant and/or quiet sounds as if you were standing nearby. Amplitude Pro uses the high quality hardware of the iPhone and iPod Touch* to detect and amplify the faintest of sounds. \r\n\r\n***Note: To get the best experience possible, you must use ear buds that do not have a built-in microphone.***\r\n\r\nAmplitude Pro lets you adjust the sensitivity of the iPhone microphone to amplify sounds from across a room. You’ll hear things you never would have been able to hear otherwise. \r\n\r\nAmplitude Pro also lets you record and save the amplified sounds to your device and share them with your friends. To do this, all you have to do is press the red button at the bottom of the screen. To stop it, you simply press the button again. Now you can detect and have proof of that “ghost” that you always hear that everyone made fun of you for and prove them wrong!\r\n\r\nUsing Amplitude Pro is easy: simply launch the app, point your device in the direction of the sound you want to amplify, and starting hearing the world in a new way through your headphones. Individual controls enable you to adjust the microphone sensitivity or mute the sound amplifying feature altogether.\r\n\r\nUse Amplitude Pro to explore your world. Experience all the sounds of your environment that you would otherwise have missed.\r\n\r\nExperience Nature and Wildlife More Intimately. Record and share the sounds with friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nExperimenting Around Your World\r\n\r\n- Diagnose the source of that annoying squeak in your new car and send it to your local mechanic.\r\n\r\n- Attach a cup or small plastic bowl to the end of your iPhone to focus the incoming sound and expand your range\r\n\r\n- Place microphone against an office wall to hear sounds from all over the building and listen to what everyone is talking about!\r\n\r\nAmplitude Pro Benefits:\r\n\r\n- Turns your iPhone or iPod Touch* into a sound amplifier\r\n\r\n- Hear sounds through thin walls or doors\r\n\r\n- Adjustable microphone sensitivity / boost\r\n\r\n- Adjustable volume and mute controls\r\n\r\n- Independently control the iPhone volume and the microphone sensitivity\r\n\r\n- View sound waves on the oscilloscope\r\n\r\n- Record and share each and every sound you encounter!\r\n\r\n***Ear buds are required for use with all devices. 1st, 2nd, and 3rd generation iPod Touches require ear buds with a microphone whereas the 4th generation iPod Touch can use ear buds without a microphone.***\r\n\r\nTips on Using Amplitude Pro:\r\n\r\n- For best audio reception, point the microphone in the direction of the sound you want to pick up. \r\n\r\n- Amplitude Pro controls are oriented upside down from other apps so that the microphone can be pointed toward target sounds.\r\n\r\n- To protect against accidental ear damage, Amplitude Pro starts in Muted mode. You can change the default in the settings screen.\r\n\r\n- For optimal performance, we recommend keeping device volume between 50-75%.\r\n\r\n- Experiment with microphone sensitivity. Some situations will require more, some less.\r\n\r\n- To preserve battery life, launch the application and press the device sleep button to darken the screen.\r\n\r\n- You can maximize your reception by using your hands or a plastic cup to focus the incoming sound. This is the best method to use when listening through solid objects like doors or walls.\r\n\r\n- Like any exposed microphone, the iPhone microphone is sensitive to wind noise. For best results we recommend using Amplitude Pro in non-windy situations. \r\n\r\n- Experiment with different attachments and microphone settings and let us know what works best for you.\r\n\r\nSend us your stories or YouTube videos to Amplitude@GripWire.com.

      "label": "TslaMirror for iOS \nTslaMirror is an App that will help your iPhone App mirroring to Tesla vehicle! Also, it can support App screencast to a Chrome browser.\n\nFor Tesla vehicle built-in browser\n1 Make sure the car is PARKED (0mph/0kph)! \n2 The Tesla vehicle network must be connected to the iOS device Personal Hotspot (cellular data needed) first. Tesla MCU2 hardware is needed. MCU2 is available on the Tesla Model \n3 Model Y, Model X (late than March 2018), Model S (late than March 2018), or the Tesla vehicles that are upgraded to MCU2 from MCU1.3 Start the TslaMirror App. Confirm \"Tesla Proxy\" switch is on in the TslaMirror App\n4 Click the \"Start\" button, then click \"Start Broadcast\" to start Screen Broadcast in the TslaMirror App\n5 Access the link http://240.3.3.3 via Tesla vehicle in-car browser\n6 Pinch the Tesla vehicle built-in browser screen to zoom in/out the picture\n7 There is no audio support for the moment. Only the App screen will be mirrored to the browser. You can use the Bluetooth audio link to the Tesla vehicle play the audio of the iOS device simultaneously during the App mirroring.\n8 Do not lock the screen. The Screen Broadcast API limitation needs the screen to keep unlocked. Once the screen is locked, Screen Broadcast needs to be restarted.\n\nFor normal desktop browser\n1 Devices are on the same Wi-Fi network\n2 Start the TslaMirror App.\n3 Click the \"Start\" button to start Screen Broadcast in the TslaMirror App\n4 Access the link below the \"Stop\" button via a normal desktop browser (Safari or Chrome)\n\nKey Features\n1 No extra internet traffic for the screencast, the App mirroring traffic is only locally on iOS device Personal Hotspot. However, please note that during the screenshot, the Tesla vehicle will use the hotspot traffic for its internet access when the hotspot is connected\n2 No extra hardware needed\n3 Private, the screencast is only available to the devices connected to the iOS Personal Hotspot Wi-Fi network\n4 Fast network\n5 5GHz Personal Hotspot(iPhone 12 series supports it) Wi-Fi is highly recommended. Do not enable the \"Maximize Compatibility\" setting for iPhone 12 series. By default, iPhone 12 series come with a 5GHz Wi-Fi Personal Hotspot. Once the \"Maximize Compatibility\" setting enabled, it will go back to the 2.4GHz Wi-Fi hotspot.\n\nFAQ\n1 This is not CarPlay\n2 iOS Apps that use the AVPlayer framework cannot be supported, such as the Apple Music App and Netflix App. For the Apple Music App, although the screen can be streamed to the browser, the audio part will be muted during the Screen Broadcast.\n3 Netflix App not supported\n\nPrivacy/Security notice: This App does not collect any statistics, personal information, or analytics from our users.This Application does use Location service to access Wi-Fi access point network name on iOS 13 or later.

Simply select one of your recent locations to get information! You can also delete items in this list that you no longer wish to view.\n\nSave results as favourites\n-----\nSave your most often used locations so you can look them up again with just 2 clicks!

      "label": "Convenience on the wrist - Watch app for Tesla is the ideal companion in day to day life with your Tesla vehicle. These are just a few of the day to day conveniences this app will help achieve:\n\n - Forgot to plug in? Get a notification if vehicle is in a pre-configured location and not plugged in - all done directly on the watch, no external servers required, keeping your privacy!\n\n - Add the graphic corner complication to your watch face and enjoy the convenience of having easy access to state of charge, charging indicator, time remaining if charging, sentry mode active indicator and indicator if any windows, doors or trunks are open. All from one complication, that also will launch the app when tapped. \n\n - During and after charge, a panel will show how much energy was added. Convenient if you schedule your charge during the night - wake up each morning and easily check how much energy was added to the battery. \n\n - If you have multiple vehicles on your account, tap the vehicle name to quickly and easily switch between them. \n\n - You can queue up commands by tapping on buttons, then put your wrist down and the commands will execute in the background when the vehicle is successfully woken up. \n\n - When you tap the unlock vehicle button, the charge port will also unlock if a charging cable is attached. That's convenience right there!\n\n - Want to reduce phantom drain? Background updates can be configured to longer intervals between updates or to only update if car is already awake or can be disabled entirely for absolutely zero impact on phantom drain.\n\n - A warning panel will show up if any doors, windows or trunks are left open. Conveniently, you can tap the panel to close any open windows.\n\n - Need to access the frunk? Just do it from your wrist - no fiddling with your phone. \n\n - Sitting comfy in the couch, but just remembered you have a road-trip in the morning? Set the charge limit to 100% - or any value really - and start charging, right from the convenience of your wrist!\n\n - Leaving the office after a long hot day? Activate the HVAC when you're on your way, and enjoy a nice cool vehicle.\n\n - When charging, tap the time remaining label to switch to show time of expected completion - no more head calculus!\n\n - Need to run a quick errand, but you don't have your phone? Unlock your vehicle from your wrist, then activate remote start and off you go. Just please be mindful that this feature requires internet connectivity on both watch and vehicle - so don't drive into the desert and leave your vehicle, or you'll get stuck there!\n\nA note about security and privacy:\nThis app accepts two types of login. Either Tesla account credentials or a Tesla API token. Your account credentials are by default not stored in the app, but are used only once to obtain an authentication token and refresh token directly from the Tesla API server. If you would rather supply that token yourself, you can do so instead. It is preferable to supply a refresh token, as the app will then have a perpetual login. Your token will be persisted in the app. Tokens will be revoked if you change your Tesla account password. With the optional remote start feature you can choose to store your password in the app - it will be securely stored in the iOS / watchOS / iPadOS keychain. This feature is optional and is not required for all other features to function. No network traffic will ever be emitted from this app that goes anywhere other than directly to the Tesla API servers. The source code for this application will at all times be made available to any security researcher for a voluntary security and safety audit. \n\nDisclaimer: \nThis app is not endorsed by Tesla Inc. Use at your own risk. No guarantee of proper function is given. Only you are responsible for any changes to your car caused by using this app.  \n\nMade in Denmark"

      "label": "This professional tool called Clinometer is the most precise (all you can get with some calculations) slope measurement tool for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad using all sides of the device plus the camera. It can be used for simple applications like aligning a frame as well as for more sophisticated fields of applications where an arbitrary slope needs to be measured exactly. Read the reviews (and write your own) for all the applications you find! Thank for all your positive feedback! Please use our support link if you have questions and suggestions, we don't read the iTunes reviews every day!\n\nWith this tool, the slope can be measured by all edges of the device and through the camera. The current features include:\n\n◆ 3 Modes (incl. auto switching): Clinometer mode (auto when holding upright), Camera mode (any direction, manual activation) and Bubble level (smoothly fading in when holding flat).\n\n◆ Relative angles: Besides measuring absolute angles, for every mode you can measure the relative angle between device positions\n\n◆ Advanced two way calibration on all sides: For every 4 sides plus the bubble mode you can calibrate in two steps, which allows you to calibrate exactly even on non-level surfaces. Each direction can be calibrated individually to achieve the optimal precision. \n\n◆ Speech synthesis: The device will speak the current reading, so you don't have to watch the display while measuring/aligning your object.\n\n◆ Five different unit modes: The device can display the slope in degrees (rounded or in tenth of degrees), percentage, rise over run (common for roof slope measurement in :12) and 1V:H (common in engineering)\n\n◆ Dial Rotation: You can smoothly rotate the background dial and thus define which side of the device represents 0° and 90° degrees. \n\n◆ Motion-sensitive Lock feature: Besides the common instant simple tap hold mechanism you can activate the motion-sensitive lock. If activated the device waits for the final lock until you hold your device steady enough for at least 2 seconds. You can set the lock sensitivity between 0.1° and 1.0° degrees. \n\n◆ Peer Mode: Use two devices to measure angles: One as a display, the other as the measurement device that can be attached to the hardware you want to align. \n\n◆ Fullscreen Mode: The full screen mode can be toggled by tapping the center of the screen and by the upper and lower arrows in the center. This prevents you from erroneous inputs while measuring.\n\n◆ Different color schemes: Press the S/C Button to instantly switch the color. The color can be selected differently for the bubble and the clinometer mode. The predefined color sets include day and night color schemes (Black on White, White on Black and Red). \n\n◆ Adjustable Auto-Lock: You can prevent the device from turning into the sleep mode. \n\nAccording to wikipedia: An inclinometer or clinometer is an instrument for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or inclination of an object with respect to gravity. It is also known as a tilt meter, tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. \n\nFor recreational use only. After the calibration it CAN (!) be very accurate especially for the main axis after calibration. The measurement is performed as well as possible (we try our best) by using the three inbuilt accelerometers. \n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! \n\nWe will improve the application long-term. This was the first application of this kind shortly after the opening of the App Store. Since then it is continuously updated and enriched with new features."

      "label": "Recommended and shared by thousands of users! Mentioned as the iOS app to use in:\n  ◆  wired.com - How to Sweep For Bugs and Hidden Cameras\nNote that the app is just a helper tool to induce lens reflection and should be used with common sense and manual inspection of the target object.\n \nProtect your privacy from spy hidden camera lenses. Here are some actual news headlines:\n  ◆  Brits staying in Airbnb flat 'find spy camera hidden pointed at bed'\n  ◆  Oil rig worker files lawsuit: I was secretly recorded\n  ◆  Motel manager accused of setting up hidden camera\n  ◆  Models find hidden cameras in apartment\n\nA free do-it-yourself way of detecting cameras from instructables.com, also based on detecting lens reflections:\n  ◆  Step 1: Find a tube that's good for looking through. A cardboard tube from a roll of toilet paper or paper towels is best.\n  ◆  Step 2: All you need is a flashlight or something that you can use to focus a beam of light in a dark room. Attaching a couple of directional LEDs to the outside of the cardboard tube can work also if you don't have a flashlight.\n  ◆  Step 3: With one hand, hold up the toilet paper tube to your eye. With your other hand, hold up the flashlight at about eye level and point it away from you. With one eye, look through the tube and scan the room. If there are any small points of light bouncing back, inspect it further. It might be a camera.\n\nThis app is a tool to help you detect disguised camera lens that you suspect are present in a room. The manual mode with overlay is already equivalent to the do-it-yourself described above or the more expensive hardware camera detector gadgets that tries to detect using the tell-tale signs of tiny reflections of hidden camera lenses. The good thing is this app is always with you, ready when you need it.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS for the APP: \n\nUse this tool after your own visual inspection and investigation. Scan the room first without your phone and once you find something suspicious point the phone camera to the suspected object. The app alternately turns on and off the camera flash to detect the signature of a camera lens. Carefully adjusting the distance and angle relative to the target object helps as well adjusting the level of lighting in the room.\n\nWhen automatic mode is ineffective or distracting you should use manual mode. In both manual and automatic modes you must use your own judgment as this is just a tool like what you would do with an expensive hidden camera detector gadgets or the do-it-yourself detector described above.\n\nMANUAL Detection: \nAnytime that you see the signature of a camera lens you can single-tap on the screen and put a marker on the suspected camera lens.\nYellow overlay - this signifies that the surface might be metallic or glass-like and that a great amount of reflectivity is being detected.\nCyan overlay - this means that the surface is changing in color consistent with the general hue of camera lenses.\n\nAUTOMATIC Detection: \nThe app will continuously try its best to put a marker where it assesses a camera lens may be present. To exclude surfaces that are generating lots of false positives you can zoom the camera or carefully change the distance or angle of the phone to the target. Works best when room lights are dimmed and the phone is very steady.\n\nBONUS 1: EMF scanner to detect the slight magnetic field present in electronic devices including hidden spy cameras. \nBONUS 2: Some home cameras broadcast bluetooth information and this app has a scanner for bluetooth devices.\n\nBE SAFE and START SCANNING!"

To see the full information and Q&A on how to use this app correctly, you can visit: https://huffparanormal.com/2021/05/the-miracle-box-spirit-communication-app-is-here/\n\nThe Miracle Box includes methods used by Steve Huff of Huff Paranormal in his Astral Doorway and Miracle Box full size devices. The app has eleven banks, which are all reversed human speech. There are no words, no music, no phrases and nothing programmed in to make you think spirit is speaking with you. This is an advanced yet simple ITC app based on eleven years of research and communication. It will not work for everyone (no app or box does). \n\nWhen using it, you must do so correctly. If you do not have a connection to spirit you will not hear replies come through. Instead, you will hear gibberish, nothing. That is by design. This app is designed to only bring you true responses, if and only if you connect with a spirit when using it. No matter the app or device you use, the connection is the #1 aspect of getting results. \n\nAlways use this with love, respect, kindness and a clear mind. If you do not hear replies, try again at another time, or a different place. Do not use it if you are angry, depressed, in a negative mood or fearful of it. If you fear this, do not use this app as fear is an energy we put out that can and could attract undesirable spirits. Love is the key here and this is meant for serous ITC researchers and enthusiasts. \n\nJust pick a voice, press record, ask a question and move the slider to the right for 1-3 seconds and then slide it back. You will soon hear a voice emerge that will either be answering you (if you connected) or gibberish (if you did not). Even if you do not hear a reply in real time, always check the recording as it could have changed. \n\nThis is a tool you can grow with. To learn how to build a connection, and see demo videos with this app in action visit the Huff Paranormal YouTube Channel."

      "label": "Drone Tone Tool is an app created by professional musicians and music educators providing high quality reference pitches with the rich overtones of real cellos. We encourage musicians of all abilities to experience the benefits of reference tone practice!\nWhy real cello drones?\n\nThere are many electronic tone generators, and while they are better than nothing, they lack complexity of overtones and can be painful to listen to. Our cello drones are pleasing to the ear, rich in overtones and contain layered octaves to facilitate practice in all registers.\n\nPurpose and benefit of reference/drone tones:\n\nA reference (or drone) tone provides a center of harmonic stability. Our ears are able to discern the way that multiple pitches interact while strengthening our internal sense of pitch. By playing with a movable pitch (instrument or voice) relative to a fixed pitch (drone tone) we can start to perceive truly consonant perfect intervals, and 'shades' or 'colors' within Major/Minor intervals. This heightened awareness of relative pitch leads to artistry through intonation."

To enable autocorrect, go into the settings menu by deep pressing on the screen (3D press). When you type a misspelled word and press space, autocorrect will attempt to fix the mistake. To select from correction options, spin the Digital Crown. To input a space without making a correction, swipe right on the message text area.\n\nOur users find that having a QWERTY keyboard is faster and easier to compose text messages than voice dictation or scribble.\n\nEasyType also includes easy to access special characters and emojis with their own keyboards. To access these characters and emojis, press the bottom-left key on the keyboard.\n\nEasytype includes a menu to access additional function. To access the menu, long press on the screen. From the menu, you can preview your complete message, change settings, and clear your messages.\n\nPlease note that EasyType currently only supports the English language keyboard.\n\nIf you don't see the app on your Apple Watch, please open the App Store on your Apple Watch, search for the app by name, and click the download button."

See the ratings and reviews for yourself. \n\nOther apps simply blow up the video preview without active stabilization resulting in terrible picture quality. Binoculars actually processes the full resolution photo sensor as fast as possible and then crops in on that full resolution photo image resulting in a much higher quality enlargement and a much more useful image. \n\nWhy pack binoculars when they can now be a part of your phone? Zoom in up to 32x (on latest iOS devices with Telephoto Lens) and up to 16x on older devices. For a closer look at nature, sporting events, or someone in the distance use our digital binoculars for high-resolution photo or video while in extreme zoom mode.\n\nFrom i4software, creators of Vizzywig, Flashlight and Fast Camera!\n\n• Binoculars incorporates GPS technology and displays your location on the map, shows your latitude and longitude coordinates, and remembers the exact location of your pictures. \n\n• Binoculars’ simple user-interface makes it fast and easy to use for all ages.\n\n• Includes Google Cardboard mode in landscape orientation."

Review how many seconds/minutes your Clock will gain or lose per day based on your current calibration\n\nThe app will presents your Clock beats period reading as well as BPH (beats per hour) and BPM (beats per minutes) values.\nAn accurate waveform display of the microphone signal will help you to adjust the tick readings for the best measurement.\nAnimated Indicators will guide you through the calibration process.\n\nManage the app Reference Timings table and add user defined clocks in addition to the predefined ones to support all your clocks.\n\nThis app will turn your iPhone into a powerful measurement tool which normally costs hundreds of dollars."

      "label": "***THIS APPLICATION DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY SERVER SIDE SERVICE***\n\nQuantumult is a powerful proxy client.\n• Right now supports protocol Shadowsocks(r), HTTP, HTTP over TLS, SOCKS5 and SOCKS5 over TLS, VMess.\n\nIt can capture all the TCP traffic and redirect under you own way by using Filter function.\n• The filter has a few types to match. For TCP traffic that has the upper layer protocol HTTP(S), 'HOST', 'HOST-SUFFIX', 'HOST-KEYWORD', 'USER-AGENT', 'GEOIP' and 'IP-CIDR' are all supported. For the other TCP traffic, 'GEOIP' and 'IP-CIDR' are supported. Especially, when deal with HTTP(S) traffic, Quantumult has another function called Rejection, it matchs the whole URL of the HTTP(S) request.\n• After match, the filter has a lot of actions to deal with the request, built-in policy 'DIRECT', 'REJECT', 'PROXY', all your servers and your customized policies. Actually you can see all the actions as a lot of paths and you can decide which request goes through which path by using filter function.\n\nMore over, Quantumult can be a convenient web develop tool on mobile device.\n• When you on the road without the Mac platform debug tools like Charles and Wireshark, you still can use Quantumult to log parts of the web request to debug some web issues.\n• Quantumult can log all the HTTP(S) request header and response header.\n• Yes, you are right it can log the HTTPS request header and response header, be sure to install and trust Quantumult root CA for this advanced function.\n\nSince quantumult has a function called PROXY, sure it can redirect your traffic to remote proxy servers. But be clear, we do NOT provide any server side service or support, you should build your own servers.\n• Like we said early Quantumult can redirect all TCP traffic through the filter function, that means you can visit different web site through different servers by the filter. See it can accelerate your network connection if you set your filter right, and of course the filter is totally customizable.\n• About the customized policy, there are 3 different types of customized policy, 'SSID', 'Latency' and 'Static'. The 'SSID' policy depends on your network enviroment, Wi-Fi, Cellular or specific Wi-Fi with the SSID your provided. The 'Latency' policy is based on the latencies of all the servers of the policy settings, the result is the shortest(The test interval has the option of 600 or 1200 seconds). The 'Static' policy is based on your manual selection of servers or other polices from the policy settings. Sure you are right, some of polices can wrap other polices, convinent, right ?\n\nAbout working state, Quantumult can work in 3 state, 'GLOBAL', 'DIRECT' AND 'AUTO'.\n• The GLOBAL state will ignore filter settings and redirect all TCP traffic through the built-in PROXY policy(you need build and add your server first).\n• The DIRECT state will ignore filter settings and redirect all TCP traffic directly to the destination web site. How this state useful ? Yes, it can be a simple web develop tools by analizing the reqeust header and response header including HTTPS.\n• The AUTO state, we call it auto because it base on the filter you set to divide the TCP traffic through different paths, like the popular ACL way.\n\nExtra, Quantumult can also work as a HTTP proxy server for devices under the same Wi-Fi, when this function is turned on, the home view will show the IP and port for other device easily to connect.\n\n\nAt last, some attentions.\n• About the location on the map of home view. It is not the real location in the real world, it's just the IP location and might not be correct."

      "label": "Works for both FM and TV! Loaded with new features in 2.0!\n\nUse OTAMap to find and point your antenna to all your Over The Air (OTA) television and FM stations.\n\nOTAMap gives you the latest Over The Air (OTA) television/FM station information. for all of the continental USA, Alaska, Canada, Hawaii, Northern Mexico and some US territories such as Puerto Rico.\n\nOTA Map will list all OTA channels/stations within 150 miles of your current geographical position as indicated by your iPhone/iPad. With this tool you can quickly see what OTA stations may be available in your area.\n\nWith OTAMap you can view the position of the transmission towers, of any of these Over The Air television stations, in relationship to you. This can be used to help adjust your HD OTA antenna for local reception, for that hard to get station, or even the far far away channel that you have been trying to \"DX\" for quite a while. Whether you are on your roof or turning your rotor from your living room, OTAMap can help you.\n\n*****Note to Northern Canadian Users: OTAMap does work everywhere in Canada (including Edmonton), however you may need to flip on the Industry Canada Data in the preferences. \n\nSome of the new features  in 2.0\nNow you can choose between FM or TV stations \n•You can filter station list based on distance, power, FCC data, Industry Canada data, Canadian, Mexican and US stations. \n•You can now even filter based on whether your location falls within a stations 41 dBU Contours! \n•You can sort the displayed stations by distance, channel, power or even it's bearing from you. \n•Save and recall locations. \n•Do locations based on \n-Actual GPS \n-Entered GPS (IOS 6.1 and higher only) \n-ZIP/postal code (IOS 6.1 and higher only) \n-Street Address (IOS 6.1 and higher only) \n-Or a previously saved location. \n•Download and update latest FCC station data anytime. \n•No longer server based. Some functionality will run without a network connection. If a particular map was previously loaded, even mapping functionality may work offline. \n•Fixed magnetic declination (no longer IRC dependent) (may be off as you near the Arctic Circle). \n•Added ability to add stations/save maps to a DX list. The list can be pulled up anytime and the pointing maps reviewed. \n•Added Super Contour Map. Given a particular location it -will list all stations that fall within the 41/60 dBu contour map which should indicate stations that should be received relatively easily. Will show curves of all coverage contours and darken overlapping sections. The resulting stations can then be viewed as your filtered station list. \n•Added a search for call sign option. This will allow mapping of super long range reception or help in obscure DX attempts. \n•Now works for all of the Great White North - Uses IRC data for anything not included in the FCC database. \n•In the station pointing map view the map can be updated if the users gps determination has changed. \n•In the station pointing and the all station map views, you can drag the home icon to say a different part of the roof/yard and the calculations will follow. \n•You can erase your downloaded data (which may include FCC FM/TV database and any cached contours) and restore to original data from preference menu."

      "label": "Party Game Timer is a countdown timer that replaces the timers or hourglasses that come with Pictionary, Charades, Taboo, and many other party games. Party Game Timer supports random countdowns, so is ideally suited as a replacement timer for Hot Potato style games like The Last Word or Pass The Bomb. \n\n************************************\n\nFEATURES\n\n* Fully configurable random or fixed countdowns with adjustable seconds, not just minutes + hours\n* Supports durations from 0 seconds to 24 hours\n* Choose from one of many fun sound themes\n* Enable or disable ticking noises\n* Enable or disable showing how much time is left\n* Sounds an alarm when the timer expired. Plays alarm even if silence switch is on or the app is not active, just like the built in Alarms app.\n* Animates and vibrates when going off, so you'll notice the timer expiring in a noisy situation\n* Looping mode - set Party Game Timer to go off repeatedly\n* Voice over and dynamic text support\n\n************************************\n\nParty Game Timer is great for:\n\nGames with randomly timed rounds\n\nThere are a few party games where a timer goes off randomly - games like Last Word and Pass the Bomb. Party Game Timer can be set to go off after a random amount of time by adjusting a minimum and maximum duration, so it is perfect for these games. Combined with the ability to pick from many different sound themes, you can use Party Game Timer for a much more customized gaming experience. For example,  you could increase or decrease the amount of time in a round depending on the skill level of the players. I once played a word game called Pass the Bomb with a group of skilled Scrabble players, and found it useful to make rounds much longer to accommodate for the advanced skill level of the players.\n\nTrivia / party games with short countdowns\n\nIn some games you have just seconds to give an answer. These could be trivia games like Jeopardy and Family Feud or party games like the Chain Game or Wits and Wagers. Party Game Timer is great for these games because it lets you adjust short time intervals to the second. The built in timer on your iPhone only handles hours and minutes, so if you need a countdown timer that goes off within seconds, you need Party Game Timer instead.\n\nParty games with timed rounds\nThere are many party games like Pictionary, Charades, and Taboo that have one or two minute rounds. You could use your iPhone's built in timer or the timer that comes with these games, but since Party Game Timer was made for fun and games, it is a much better fit for this situation.\n\nSlow strategy games\nTired of waiting forever for someone to finish a round of Risk, Stratego, or Scrabble? You can use Party Game Timer to impose a time limit for each round.\n\n************************************\n\nOther uses\n\n* Replacement for your existing iPhone or stopwatch timer\nUnlike the iPhone's built in timer, Party Game Timer lets you adjust seconds. Party Game Timer also has unusually detailed voice over support.\n\n* Cooking timer\nWant to put something in the oven, step outside, and be reminded when it's done? Party Game Timer lets you do this easily.\n\n* Exercise timer\nParty Game Timer can go off in intervals (for example, once every 15 minutes), which can be useful for exercising or meditation.\n\n* Fart Machine\nJust set the sound theme to Fart and get ready for countless minutes of iFart-like fun!\n\n* Musical Chairs\n\n* Hot Potato\n\n************************************"

The stable will be shown in 3D, both with and without a roof where you can zoom in and take a look at the stable from all different directions. \nTake a virtual tour inside and outside the stable placed in a natural landscape. \n\nStable Builder is developed for use on iPad but also works on the iPhone. \n\nSave time and expensive architect and design costs. \nWith Stable Builder you have the possibility to design the stable at home, you will therefor save much time and money to obtain design proposals and quotations from architects and producers of stable an interior details. \n\nThe perfect design tool for producers and sellers of stable and interior details. \nThe seller or architect can quickly and in 3D design the horse stable together with the customer. This can shorten the sales process significantly. Email design proposal to the construction department that will make the perfect basis for the final construction. \n\n\nStable Builder is easy to use with the following steps: \n\n1. Stable dimensions - Create the size of the stable by entering the number of wall modules. \n\n2. Interior - Create walls, rooms and boxes in all possible configurations. \n\n3. Details - put in doors, windows and select material of the box walls. \n\n4. 3D - Look at the stable with and without a roof, zoom in and take a look from all different directions. \n\n5. Walk around - Take a virtual tour inside and outside the stable. \n\n6. Save - save to photo or mail directly. \n\n\nWe are aware that it is possible to develop this creative application to be even better with more choices of materials, colours, sizes, configurations and appearance of the doors and window boxes. We will gradually add more modules and interior details to meet our users' needs and we appreciate if we get your comments or feedback about this app."

Reliable, secure and energy-saving.\nIt's an Anti-Theft APP and can be activated extremely quickly with a single wipe or press of a widget. It registers movement with an adjustable sensitivity and triggers an audible alarm to deter thieves. Protect your phone or pad. You can use pre-defined alarms, add external .wav files or create your own custom sounds. Give robbers no chance to steal your device. \nDevPro works with many different operating system versions.\nThe alarm function is triggered by movement of the device. No Internet connection is required. DevPro is the stand alone bodyguard for your device. This APP is the perfect security app to prevent others from touching the device and taking away . \n\nWe invested a lot of time to find a reliable way to safe your phone or pad, no one can bypass the security features to deactivate the alarm. We use Touch-ID or Face-ID to unlock. No separate code required.\n\nA few more unique functions:\n\n•    Adjustable alarm triggering sensitivity\n•    Adjustable alarm volume\n•    Directly accessible via widget\n•    Individual alarms and voice messages\n•    Preset scenes can be defined (office, hotel, outdoor,...)\n•    Active in the background\n\nTo enable you to start with low upfront activities, we integrated a lot of predefined adjustments you can modify for your own need. \nTo activate the motion detection we want to be fast. You can define a number of presets like school, hotel, home, library,... to get the right configuration of sound, loudness, sensitivity and pre-alert at the right situation. \n\nWe track the location in the background. This enables you to put the device in sleep mode and keep the motion detection still alive. \n\nDevPro - the idea - why?\nWe travel a lot and were scared about the situations in hotels and during fairs. We could not leave our devices on a table or chair while we where absent. To fetch some food from the buffet during breakfast was not so easy for example. Thats why we decided to develop a 100% reliable security system based on the motion detection. \n\nWhy Presets?\nImportant for us, was to take care on different situations with different needs on sensitivity, loudness and alarm sound. We wanted to get raw motion alert reachable by a single push. Thats why we enabled \"Presets\" for different situations. \n\nWhy Widgets?\nSometimes speed is important if you want to be reliable securing your device. We enabled to use widgets to reach the security mode extremely fast. \n\nWe developed a fully reliable easy to reach motion detection solution for iPad and iPhone. Stay secure during trip or at school, restaurant, bars,... The configuration of sound, sensitivity, alarm type helps to take care on every different situation where you want to protect your device - DevPro!"

Any ambient noises can affect result accuracy. Complete silence is the best.\n\nRecommended way to record the ticks is to touch the crown of the watch with the headset microphone. You will get the best results using original Apple EarPods.\n\nThis is a simple version of Watch Tuner application. Not everyone needs detailed information about a watch movement, sometimes only accuracy is important. Watch Tuner Lite uses very similar algorithm like Watch Tuner does but displays only seconds-per-day deviation.\n\nIf you want to know how much your watch is fast or slow, this application is for you.\nIf you prefer to measure also beat error and amplitude, try Watch Tuner - a bigger brother of this app.\nIf you need frequency diagram look at Watch Tuner Timegrapher - the most sophisticated app of Watch Tuner series."

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here. Chromecast is a trademark of Google LLC."

With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.\n\nAnd the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it is – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop. And with over 20 built-in themes and the ability to create your own, you can customize the results exactly the way you want.\n\nNoir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!\n\nBuilt from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Focus Filters and Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows. And your settings are automatically synced to all your devices using iCloud.\n\nAnd just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data. Period.\n\nNoir is made by a solo iOS developer. It does not include any subscriptions or ads. Buy Noir once, use it forever.\n\nNotes:\n• Found a website where Noir’s dark mode doesn’t look just right? Let me know by reporting it. The app will be frequently updated to address issues that are reported.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\n• The Noir extension requires access to the websites you visit to analyze the existing style of the page and to override it with Noir's dark style.\n• Noir never collects your browsing data. The only data Noir ‘collects’ are your settings, and those will never leave your device.\n• You can read Noir’s full Privacy Policy at https://getnoir.app/privacypolicy"

I also applied \nother filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an \nenvironment suitable for spirit communication.\n\nThe audio itself is made up of phonemes, \npartial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help \nspirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.\nthere are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.\n\nThese sounds banks play in a similar\nway to that of my other app \"Spiritus Ghost Box\" but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has\n8 active sound banks.\n\nWhite Noise Sound Bank:\n\nThis app also has an optional 9th sound bank called \"White noise\". \nThis bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This \naudio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the \n\"Holy Grail\" of EVP recorders. This is not a White Noise Generator, this is a normal sound bank like the others but this one contains white noise from the DR60.\n\nAudio Effects:\n\nThis app does contain Echo and Reverb audio effects. These have been proven \nto be the best effects to apply to ITC sessions. The echo can create audio that can be \nmanipulated within the echo itself. Echo can also help in live, real time communication by \nrepeating the audio and allowing you to better hear whats coming through. Reverb can be \napplied to the audio to create a spacious sound environment that will enhance audio manipulation."

      "label": "Convenience on the wrist - Watch app for Tesla is the ideal companion in day to day life with your Tesla vehicle. These are just a few of the day to day conveniences this app will help achieve:\n\n - Forgot to plug in? Get a notification if vehicle is in a pre-configured location and not plugged in - all done directly on the watch, no external servers required, keeping your privacy!\n\n - Add the graphic corner complication to your watch face and enjoy the convenience of having easy access to state of charge, charging indicator, time remaining if charging, sentry mode active indicator and indicator if any windows, doors or trunks are open. All from one complication, that also will launch the app when tapped. \n\n - During and after charge, a panel will show how much energy was added. Convenient if you schedule your charge during the night - wake up each morning and easily check how much energy was added to the battery. \n\n - If you have multiple vehicles on your account, tap the vehicle name to quickly and easily switch between them. \n\n - You can queue up commands by tapping on buttons, then put your wrist down and the commands will execute in the background when the vehicle is successfully woken up. \n\n - When you tap the unlock vehicle button, the charge port will also unlock if a charging cable is attached. That's convenience right there!\n\n - Want to reduce phantom drain? Background updates can be configured to longer intervals between updates or to only update if car is already awake or can be disabled entirely for absolutely zero impact on phantom drain.\n\n - A warning panel will show up if any doors, windows or trunks are left open. Conveniently, you can tap the panel to close any open windows.\n\n - Need to access the frunk? Just do it from your wrist - no fiddling with your phone. \n\n - Sitting comfy in the couch, but just remembered you have a road-trip in the morning? Set the charge limit to 100% - or any value really - and start charging, right from the convenience of your wrist!\n\n - Leaving the office after a long hot day? Activate the HVAC when you're on your way, and enjoy a nice cool vehicle.\n\n - When charging, tap the time remaining label to switch to show time of expected completion - no more head calculus!\n\n - Need to run a quick errand, but you don't have your phone? Unlock your vehicle from your wrist, then activate remote start and off you go. Just please be mindful that this feature requires internet connectivity on both watch and vehicle - so don't drive into the desert and leave your vehicle, or you'll get stuck there!\n\nA note about security and privacy:\nThis app accepts two types of login. Either Tesla account credentials or a Tesla API token. Your account credentials are by default not stored in the app, but are used only once to obtain an authentication token and refresh token directly from the Tesla API server. If you would rather supply that token yourself, you can do so instead. It is preferable to supply a refresh token, as the app will then have a perpetual login. Your token will be persisted in the app. Tokens will be revoked if you change your Tesla account password. With the optional remote start feature you can choose to store your password in the app - it will be securely stored in the iOS / watchOS / iPadOS keychain. This feature is optional and is not required for all other features to function. No network traffic will ever be emitted from this app that goes anywhere other than directly to the Tesla API servers. The source code for this application will at all times be made available to any security researcher for a voluntary security and safety audit. \n\nDisclaimer: \nThis app is not endorsed by Tesla Inc. Use at your own risk. No guarantee of proper function is given. Only you are responsible for any changes to your car caused by using this app.  \n\nMade in Denmark"

These are meant as a tip jar. The InApp purchases are available for different prices, so you can pick the amount for the tip yourself. Doing so will unlock a few cool features as a reward, these are always the same, regardless of the amount of the tip. Users who have purchased the App within the last 12 months do get all these features for free, no need to buy one of the InApp purchases. Though they can nevertheless give me a tip, if they want to... ;-)"

      "label": "StopTheMadness is a Safari extension that stops web sites from making your browser harder to use. And it protects your privacy on the web. StopTheMadness is not an ad blocker: it offers unique features not available from ad blockers or any other apps. StopTheMadness is one of a kind!\n\nMade by indie developer Jeff Johnson. The support link has documentation and my email address.\n\nMany web sites deliberately disable user interface features in Safari that you normally expect to work. StopTheMadness re-enables those features for you in Safari:\n• opening contextual menus\n• selecting, copying, cutting, and pasting of text\n• drag and drop\n• AutoFill/autocomplete of passwords, emails, etc.\n\nStopTheMadness also protects your privacy on the web:\n• Stops Google AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages)! Automatically loads the original \"canonical\" web site page instead of Google AMP.\n• Removes tracking tags such as utm_source, gclid, and fbclid from the end of URLs.\n• Stops clickjacking in Google Search, Gmail, Facebook, and DuckDuckGo.\n• Stops hyperlink auditing (anchor \"ping\").\n• Stops tracking beacons (Navigator.sendBeacon).\n• Stops sites from using the Page Visibility API to know when a tab is visible on your screen.\n• Stops URL shorteners. Checks the links you click in Safari for well-known link shorteners — bit.ly, tinyurl.com, l.facebook.com, t.co, etc. — and loads the unshortened destination URL instead of the shortened URL. This occurs without setting any cookies or other site data, so you can't be tracked by your click.\n\nBonus Features:\n• Stop videos from autoplaying. This works even on sites where Safari doesn't stop autoplay, such as YouTube. And YouTube video ads are automatically skipped! Also stops videos from following you down the page when you scroll on many sites.\n• Stop sites in Safari from pausing your audio in a background app such as Apple Music.\n• Show native video controls. Use Picture-in-Picture from Safari on sites that don't normally support it, including YouTube!\n• Automatically select the highest video quality on YouTube!\n• Hides the annoying popup banners prompting you to get the app on Google, Google Maps, DuckDuckGo, IMDb, Instagram, Quora, Reddit, and Tumblr!\n• Add your own site-specific CSS and JavaScript to web pages!\n• Custom URL redirects! Redirect new Reddit to old Reddit, Twitter to Nitter, YouTube to Invidious, etc. You can create any redirect that you want!\n• Stop keyboard page zoom. Stops the page from zooming in when you show the software keyboard!\n• Enable pinch-to-zoom on sites that prevent it, such as old reddit.\n• Stops \"Are you sure you want to leave this page?\" alerts. Close your tabs without getting stopped by the site!\n• Force external links to open in the current tab instead of a new tab. Remove target=\"_blank\" from links so that they no longer automatically create a new tab.\n• Force external links to open in a new tab instead of the current tab. This is great if you're scrolling through a list of links and want to open each one in a new tab.\n• Force images to the front. Bypass the transparent overlay on sites such as Instagram that prevents you from dragging and opening the contextual menu on images.\n• Warns when you paste or type beyond the maximum length in a password field or other text field. Stops you from accidentally losing characters!"

      "label": "TslaMirror for iOS \nTslaMirror is an App that will help your iPhone App mirroring to Tesla vehicle! Also, it can support App screencast to a Chrome browser.\n\nFor Tesla vehicle built-in browser\n1 Make sure the car is PARKED (0mph/0kph)! \n2 The Tesla vehicle network must be connected to the iOS device Personal Hotspot (cellular data needed) first. Tesla MCU2 hardware is needed. MCU2 is available on the Tesla Model \n3 Model Y, Model X (late than March 2018), Model S (late than March 2018), or the Tesla vehicles that are upgraded to MCU2 from MCU1.3 Start the TslaMirror App. Confirm \"Tesla Proxy\" switch is on in the TslaMirror App\n4 Click the \"Start\" button, then click \"Start Broadcast\" to start Screen Broadcast in the TslaMirror App\n5 Access the link http://240.3.3.3 via Tesla vehicle in-car browser\n6 Pinch the Tesla vehicle built-in browser screen to zoom in/out the picture\n7 There is no audio support for the moment. Only the App screen will be mirrored to the browser. You can use the Bluetooth audio link to the Tesla vehicle play the audio of the iOS device simultaneously during the App mirroring.\n8 Do not lock the screen. The Screen Broadcast API limitation needs the screen to keep unlocked. Once the screen is locked, Screen Broadcast needs to be restarted.\n\nFor normal desktop browser\n1 Devices are on the same Wi-Fi network\n2 Start the TslaMirror App.\n3 Click the \"Start\" button to start Screen Broadcast in the TslaMirror App\n4 Access the link below the \"Stop\" button via a normal desktop browser (Safari or Chrome)\n\nKey Features\n1 No extra internet traffic for the screencast, the App mirroring traffic is only locally on iOS device Personal Hotspot. However, please note that during the screenshot, the Tesla vehicle will use the hotspot traffic for its internet access when the hotspot is connected\n2 No extra hardware needed\n3 Private, the screencast is only available to the devices connected to the iOS Personal Hotspot Wi-Fi network\n4 Fast network\n5 5GHz Personal Hotspot(iPhone 12 series supports it) Wi-Fi is highly recommended. Do not enable the \"Maximize Compatibility\" setting for iPhone 12 series. By default, iPhone 12 series come with a 5GHz Wi-Fi Personal Hotspot. Once the \"Maximize Compatibility\" setting enabled, it will go back to the 2.4GHz Wi-Fi hotspot.\n\nFAQ\n1 This is not CarPlay\n2 iOS Apps that use the AVPlayer framework cannot be supported, such as the Apple Music App and Netflix App. For the Apple Music App, although the screen can be streamed to the browser, the audio part will be muted during the Screen Broadcast.\n3 Netflix App not supported\n\nPrivacy/Security notice: This App does not collect any statistics, personal information, or analytics from our users.This Application does use Location service to access Wi-Fi access point network name on iOS 13 or later.

      "label": "C-Calc Pro is a calculator app designed by, and for construction workers.  Unlike a standard construction calculator C-Calc uses the power of the IPhone to create a construction computer.  This full function calculator works as a standard calculator but more importantly allows you to work in feet, inches and fractional inches.  The calculator also features several other modules for performing material estimates, crown moulding, conversions, area calculations and volume calculations, arcs and archs, trig and triangles, and stairwells and stairs.  Contractors, architects, tradespersons, builders and even do it yourselfers will find this app ideal.  Features include;\n\n- Add, subtract, multiply, divide, exponent, root and more with measurements in feet, inches, and fractional inches.\n\n- Reduce fractions and fractional inches to their lowest common denominator.\n\n- Convert decimal values to fractions and vice versa.\n\n- 50 memory slots to store, recall, add and subtract memory values.  Memory values are shared between all modules as well.\n\n- Split screen shows result, memory, and measurement values all at once.\n\n- Calculate square footage and cubic footage easily.\n\n- Conversions for temperatures, distances, angles, areas and many more built in.\n\n- Help screen and full instructions included in program.\n\n- Estimate drywall, concrete, block, paint, tile, lumber and associated materials.\n\n- Transfer individual estimates to a running estimate sheet where you can keep track of your total as well as email the estimate to a man in the field, to yourself, or to the supplier.\n\n- Calculate surface areas and volumes of a large variety of shapes (including compound objects) for material estimates.\n\n- Crown moulding module built in which supports any spring angle and any wall angle.  Actually see the saw settings on your phone.\n\n- Trigonometry calculator included for solving triangles, rise/run, rafters, slope, and more.  Triangles are graphically mapped on your phone's screen to give a visual.\n\n- Advanced arc/circle calculator for solving arcs, radius, circumference, sector areas, sector angles, and circle areas.\n\n- Stair calculator for solving rise, run, unit rise, unit run, # of risers, # of treads, incline, stairwell opening, and stringer length.  Drawings are to scale and may be easily printed or saved.\n\n  Forget a bulky $100 calculator and simply buy the $10 app.  The app will always be on your hip when you need it most instead of in the truck's glove compartment.\n\n  C-Calc Pro has much more to offer in the coming months with free upgrades as well.  We take our fellow tradesmen's opinions very seriously and the app will grow to reflect the people's opinion."

      "label": "\"Mosquitone Detector\" is a sound measurement app that detects high frequency noises and ultrasonic sounds hard to hear for human ears.\n\nIt may have been exposed to artificial high-frequency noise while you do not notice. This app can detect and visualize such high-frequency noises.\n \nIn general, the human audible range is said to be 20 Hz to 20 kHz, but very high frequency sounds above 10kHz will gradually become difficult to hear with age.\n\nFor example, there are increasing cases where high-frequency noise generators are installed in various places as a purpose of repelling young people and beast pests using very high frequency mosquito noises that can not be heard by general adults.\n\nEspecially for young children, there are cases that they stay in the bad place even though on a very uncomfortable noise environment because adults can not recognize at all.\nPlease use this app to find high frequency noise, so it will help you to quickly get away from the bad spot or remove the noise source.\n\nThis app has two operation modes, \"Detect\" and \"Search\". \"Detect\" can check if there are high frequency and ultrasonic sounds that you can not hear. \"Search\" can find the direction of high-frequency sound source. It can only be used when it has found the peak frequency in \"Detect\".\n\nFeatures:\n- Detection of high frequency sound and ultrasonic wave, and display the peak frequency of the highest level.\n- Search for sound source direction: 360 degrees horizontally\n- Detectable frequency range: 8kHz - 16kHz / 16KHz - 23kHz (2 band division)\n- Function to switch the gain range: 0 - 100dB / -10 - 90dB / -20 - 80dB (in Detect mode)\n\nOperating procedure:\n1) Selection of detectable frequency band\nSelect the frequency band as more than 16kHz or less than 16kHz.\n\n2) Selection of Operational mode\n- Detect mode \nIt finds an inaudible high frequency and ultrasonic sound in the frequency band more than 16 kHz (or less than 16 kHz).\nTap START button and it starts the detection function. If high frequency or ultrasonic sound exist, it will be displayed on the graph as the peak frequency. You can make the graph display easier to see by switching the gain range.\n\n- Search mode\nIt finds the direction of occurrence of the high-frequency sound source that detected the peak frequency. “Search” can be used only when high frequency or ultrasonic sound is founded in “Detect\". \nPlease make sure to hold the bottom built-in microphone of iPhone so that it faces outward. If you measure with the microphone facing inward, microphone sensitivity will deteriorate and accurate measurement will not be possible.\nTap Start button, and firmly hold the iPhone terminal, please turn slowly clockwise. Recommended that the time required for a rotation is about 15 seconds and the rotation speed in the graph is approximately 4 rpm.\nThe measurement is completed by one revolution, and the signal strength of the peak frequency is displayed on the pie chart. You can find approximate direction of the high-frequency sound source relative to your standing position.\n\n3) Snapshot\nTap SNAP button, you can save the measurement result as “Photos” as an image file. A timestamp is inserted in the image.\n\nNote:\nIf the frequency changes periodically or randomly, it is not possible to determine the direction of occurrence in \"Search\".\nUltrasonic measurement depends on the sensitivity characteristics of the built-in microphone, so the measurement result may vary.\n\nRemarks:\nIt is still under study about health effects on human body by listening to high-frequencies including ultrasonic sound. If the high frequency noise of high level is detected daily, we recommend that you consult an expert.\n\nPlease visit our iOS App Support page for more information on this app."

Simple one-time payment\n• Top Utility ranked in all App Stores around the world \n• Over 1000+ carefully crafted filters\n• Easy setup in under 1 minute with detailed tutorial\n• Now with built-in Safari Content Blocker for better web ad protection\n\nWeblock allows you to control how your device fetches online content. Easily manage PAC (Proxy Auto-Config) script and route different connections through different proxy servers. Weblock can make your device download ads (banners and popups), stats and user tracking, scripts or images through a proxy server you pick. It also allows you to use a different proxy for specific websites, like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, social widgets from websites. You can even define your own content filters. With Weblock you can control proxy for basically any network resource! This way you can choose not to reveal your real IP to different services, limit advanced ad targeting and protect your privacy.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE: You're responsible for selecting a proxy server that allows you to download content you wish to download. We DO NOT provide a proxy service. Using a bad proxy server (like 127.0.0.1:8021) might result in some resources being blocked. You can control your proxy settings selectively with Weblock. Contact our support if you need help choosing right proxy server or setting up Weblock on your device.\n\nHere are some situations in which Weblock might come in handy:\n• Fetch ads through a proxy server you choose. Protect your privacy and prevent ad servers from knowing your real IP address and tracking you.\n• Disable majority of ads on websites you visit on your iOS device! Weblock supports all major web browsers: Safari, Chrome, Mercury and others (browsers redirecting web traffic through third-party servers like Puffin Browser or Opera Mini are not be supported).\n• Easily remove all native Facebook widgets and plugins (Like buttons, comments, etc.) on sites you visit - simply disable Facebook plugins in Weblock! Do the same for Twitter, Google+ and other social media.\n• Stop annoying Tapatalk popups, nagging you to download forum browsing app on every visit.\n• Take control of someone else's device - you can preconfigure any iOS device to control it with your Weblock app. Block or redirect any content, anytime, directly from your own device.\n• Your predefined filters and custom rules can be synced between all your iOS devices using iCloud.\n• If you wish to block something else, you can create your own rules and filters. You can block any URL (with regular expressions), domain or IP address. Don't know how? Let us know - we're here for you.\n• You can also use Weblock's redirect feature to emulate '/etc/hosts' entries for HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This might be useful for web and app developers to pin domains to different IP addresses.\n\n••• IMPORTANT! •••\nNeed help setting up Weblock? Contact our support directly through the app."

Using KEV app is as easy as pie, no sensor required, the in-built camera already got you covered.\n\nMinimalist KEV analyses live preview of the scene and gives you accurate white balance data in Kelvin.\n\nTrying to get the perfect White Balance on your DSLR can be annoying. KEV helps you by letting you know what the White Balance should be. You can measure the colour temperature of a light source in Kelvin without having to spend hundreds of dollars on professional devices.\n\nWe calibrated KEV using Sekonic C-700R-U SpectroMaster Colour Meter, and we guarantee from fair to almost 100% accuracy. Just open the KEV app and point the camera on surface or scene.\n \nThe white balance is a correction of color rendition to make the picture from the camera sensor as similar to the perception by human eyes as possible.\n\nFunctions and Capabilities:\n• Gets you Color Temperature in Kelvin in real-time.\n• Ability to compensate and calculate the white balance readings.\n• Capture a snapshot with color temperature reading and location.\n• Ability to manually focus on the scene and objects.\n• Minimal yet integral point and shoot capability.\n• A go-to spectrometer for photographers, videographers, cinematographers, gaffers, drones and action cameras.\n• Save time in post-processing.\n• Mount your iPhone using hot-shoe over the camera or on a tripod stand and get colour temperature data on the KEV Watch app.\n• Zoom in to get colour temperature data of a close-range.\n• Balance Color Temperature of the Ambient Light and Your Light Source.\n\nOverride the Auto-White Balance and choose settings yourself.\n\nWatch these cool tutorial videos published by the KEV users:\nhttps://youtu.be/C4oihcY7Dh4\nhttps://vimeo.com/654324525/b8dfe3ea3a\n\nWe care about your privacy:\nhttps://kevapp.co/privacy/\n\nIf you'd like to contact, please send us an email at 29satnam@gmail.com."

Acoustic thermometers utilise the principle that the speed of sound in air changes with temperature; by measuring the speed of sound it is possible to calculate air temperature.\n\nHow it works?\nOndo® transmits a high frequency sound from the headset earpiece. This sound is received by the microphone positioned a short, fixed distance from the earpiece. The time taken for the sound to travel between the earpiece and the microphone is very accurately measured to less than a millionth of a second. \n\nWhat you will need to build your acoustic thermometer:\n• Standard Apple headset (EarPods with lightning connector)\n• Old credit or debit card (to provide a base)\n• Four elastic bands (to hold the right earpiece and microphone in position)\n• iPhone or iPad with Ondo® installed\n\nGetting started:\n• Follow the simple instructions in the app (or on the website www.ondo.app) to build your headset thermometer\n• Calibrate to the starting temperature and your thermometer is ready to use\n• Move the phone and headset to a different temperature zone e.g. take it outside or move nearer to a heater and watch the reading change\n\nSpecification:\n• Temperature range -40 to 50 degrees Celsius\n• Accuracy +/- 1 degree (dependent upon headset fixing)\n\nPLEASE NOTE - This app will only work with a headset connected and set up according to the instructions in the app. Please do not buy this app if you do not have a suitable headset.

      "label": "Apart from the most reliable app for polar alignment (with or without a polar scope), PS Align pro has become the astronomer's swiss-army knife with all the tools added over the years. Remember, all features & updates are free forever, the only in-app purchases are donations (tip jar).\n\nPolar Scope Align will calculate the position of Polaris or σ Octantis in your Polar Scope reticle for your location (using your phone's GPS or manually), allowing a quick and accurate polar alignment. It is one of the few programs that are accurate in lower latitudes by correcting for atmospheric refraction (so expect results to agree only with precise software and not most simplistic \"polar align\" apps - see the \"Accuracy\" section in help for details). In the settings you can select the polar scope reticle that matches your own, from a vast collection:\niOptron old & new, Astro-Physics RAPAS & PASILL, various versions of Takahashi EM-10/11/200/400/500, NJP, PM-1, P2-Z, the latest Orion / Skywatcher, the Classic Skywatcher / Orion / Celestron / Meade / EXOS2 / Bresser, the Telrad, Rigel QuikFinder, a couple for Astrotrac / Losmandy / Kenko / Avalon, the Vixen PF-L/Atlux/SX/SXD/SXP/AXD/GP/GP-DX/Polarie Polar Axis Scopes, a Konus and several Polar Finders: Tuthill, Explore Scientific 8x50, Meade 9x60, Vixen Polaris, Celestron 7x50, Carton Optical. PoleMaster help view for South Hemisphere users. If you have one not included, just ask the developer to add it!\n\nFeature list:\n\n-Accurate calculation of Polaris or Sigma Oct for any date and location, including effect of atmospheric refraction (and annual aberration, nutation). Most other apps do not perform precision calculations, so please only compare app readings to accurate sources (USNO, scientific software etc).\n-Use device time/date/location, or enter your own, or pick from online & offline world databases via the Location Manager.\n-Approximate daytime / no polarscope polar alignment tool. Great for visual use, solar imaging (inc. eclipses) and even limited short focal length astrophotography. Now with sun shadow calibration for more accuracy!\n-Laser / Hop Align for nighttime alignment using a calibration star for obstructed or not visible polar star, or for improving laser align.\n-Full app in red-color (or alternative green, white) night mode - tools switchable to daytime view.\n-Deep Space Object (DSO) Database with 22000+ objects from several catalogs (Messier, Caldwell, NGC, IC, Herschell 400, Sharpless 2, Barnard), along with stars (Yale Bright Star) & planets. Search, apply filters, sorting, download DSS color images for all items, or get help finding them with your non-goto telescope with the Push-To function.\n-Connect to and control WiFi-enabled iOptron mounts.\n-Over 30 calculators useful for observing and astrophotography, from eyepiece magnification and field of view, to imaging resolution and reducers.\n-Xasteria: World astro-weather report based on 7Timer! data\n-Water vapor satellite images.\n-List of visible ISS and bright satellite passes.\n-Moon phase & lunar Calendar with solar/lunar rise/set and twilight times.\n-Wizard to calculate your reticle centering offset and correct or compensate for it.\n-Zoomable reticle view and customized routines & tools: Alt-az alignment error display for mounts that calculate it after star alignment (e.g. iOptron iEQ45, CEM60), polar alignment when your scope is not in zero position (for mounts like iOptron ZEQ/CEM on which you can always access the polar scope), remember zero position on Celestron / Skywatcher / Orion etc reticles.\n-Bubble level (using either gyro or accelerometer) and Compass heading, as well as magnetic declination reading.\n-GPS accuracy & elevation data.\n-Red/White/LED light.\n-Dimming slider.\n-iOptron, NexStar and Meade LX200 Star Lists.\n-Support for iPhone & iPad from iOS 9 (and iPod Touch, except tools that require the compass)."

      "label": "Need to quickly detect wood studs hidden under drywall, plasterboard, or stucco in order to safely and securely hang a picture, shelf, TV or other wall fixture? Studfinder turns your mobile device into a stud detector tool! Studfinder uses your device's compass (magnetometer) sensor to precisely pinpoint metal studs, nails, screws, and other metal conducting fasteners in wood studs located beneath the drywall, plasterboard, or sheetrock in every wall. A stud detector is essential for securely hanging heavy wall fixtures by ensuring the fasteners are well anchored in the wall studs. \n\nStudfinder operates in a similar manner to other hand-held stud detector tools: LED lights light up in sequence with proximity to stud as your device's magnetometer passes over the stud. However, because modern mobile devices do not have density sensors (which are used by real studfinder tools) Studfinder uses your compass (magnetometer) sensor to detect subtle changes in the background magnetic fields caused by conductive metal fasteners embedded in all studs. Because of the lack of a density sensor in mobile devices, studfinder apps cannot detect wood studs themselves, but rather, detect the metal fasteners embedded in them. Please keep this difference in mind when using Studfinder. \n\nFeatures:\n- Automatic sensor check\n- Active detection button\n- Stability indicator (Green LED)\n- 3 detection level indicators (Red LEDs)\n- 10 sensitivity levels (for various drywall thicknesses)\n- Toggle-able detection beeper\n- Easy to follow, in-app instructions\n\n\nThanks for downloading and using Studfinder. I have constantly been updating and improving it since 2013, based on user feedback, in order to make it the most accurate, responsive, and easy to use stud finder app on the market. Please consider reviewing the app so future versions can be even further improved!"

      "label": "Duct Calculator Elite™ is an industry leading tool designed to simplify the job of duct sizing for HVAC professionals.  This app allows users to calculate duct size, velocity, pressure drop, and flow rate for ductwork.\n\nDuct Calculator Elite™ features a highly intuitive interface which allows users to easily enter values with precision (without the use of cumbersome \"slider\" controls).\n\nIn \"Duct Size by Airflow\" mode, the calculator allows users set airflow and either velocity or friction (Pressure Loss) and the calculator solves for round and rectangular duct dimensions.   Aspect ratio of the rectangular duct can also be specified.\n\nIn \"Duct Size by Dimension\" mode, users can enter either a round duct diameter or rectangular duct height and width. In addition, users can lock airflow, velocity, or friction and solve for the other variables.\n\nIn \"Pressure Drop\" mode, users can convert between duct length, pressure drop, and friction values.  This allows users to quickly determine exact pressure drop of a given installation or calculate the max duct length that can be used to maintain desired pressure drop.  This feature compliments the two duct sizing calculators.  \n\nDuct Calculator Elite™ provides users with a wide variety of preference setting including:\n-Duct Dimensional Units (Inches, Centimeters, or Millimeters)\n-Airflow Units (Cubic Feet per Minute, Cubic Feet per Second, Cubic Meters per Second, or Liters per Second)\n-Velocity Units (Feet per Second, Feet per Minute, or Meters per Second)\n-Pressure Loss Units (Inches of Water per 100ft or Pascals per Meter)\n-Duct Material (Aluminum, Concrete, Fibrous Glass Duct Liner, Flexible Duct-Metallic, Galvanized Steel, PVC Plastic Pipe, Smooth Liner, Spiral Steel, or Uncoated Carbon Steel)\n-Air Temperature (Fahrenheit, Celsius, or Kelvin)\n-Elevation (Feet or Meters)\n\nThe Duct Calculator Elite™ solver uses friction loss equations contained in 2009 ASHRAE Handbook - Fundamentals.\n\nThe next time you go to a meeting or out to the field, leave your Ductulator at home, you'll have everything you need right on your iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch! \n\nIf you are not 100% satisfied with this calculator please email us at techsupport@cyberprodigy.com so we can make things right before posting any negative reviews. We read all emails. We are also open to any suggestions you may have for future enhancements to this app."

      "label": "This professional tool called Clinometer is the most precise (all you can get with some calculations) slope measurement tool for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad using all sides of the device plus the camera. It can be used for simple applications like aligning a frame as well as for more sophisticated fields of applications where an arbitrary slope needs to be measured exactly. Read the reviews (and write your own) for all the applications you find! Thank for all your positive feedback! Please use our support link if you have questions and suggestions, we don't read the iTunes reviews every day!\n\nWith this tool, the slope can be measured by all edges of the device and through the camera. The current features include:\n\n◆ 3 Modes (incl. auto switching): Clinometer mode (auto when holding upright), Camera mode (any direction, manual activation) and Bubble level (smoothly fading in when holding flat).\n\n◆ Relative angles: Besides measuring absolute angles, for every mode you can measure the relative angle between device positions\n\n◆ Advanced two way calibration on all sides: For every 4 sides plus the bubble mode you can calibrate in two steps, which allows you to calibrate exactly even on non-level surfaces. Each direction can be calibrated individually to achieve the optimal precision. \n\n◆ Speech synthesis: The device will speak the current reading, so you don't have to watch the display while measuring/aligning your object.\n\n◆ Five different unit modes: The device can display the slope in degrees (rounded or in tenth of degrees), percentage, rise over run (common for roof slope measurement in :12) and 1V:H (common in engineering)\n\n◆ Dial Rotation: You can smoothly rotate the background dial and thus define which side of the device represents 0° and 90° degrees. \n\n◆ Motion-sensitive Lock feature: Besides the common instant simple tap hold mechanism you can activate the motion-sensitive lock. If activated the device waits for the final lock until you hold your device steady enough for at least 2 seconds. You can set the lock sensitivity between 0.1° and 1.0° degrees. \n\n◆ Peer Mode: Use two devices to measure angles: One as a display, the other as the measurement device that can be attached to the hardware you want to align. \n\n◆ Fullscreen Mode: The full screen mode can be toggled by tapping the center of the screen and by the upper and lower arrows in the center. This prevents you from erroneous inputs while measuring.\n\n◆ Different color schemes: Press the S/C Button to instantly switch the color. The color can be selected differently for the bubble and the clinometer mode. The predefined color sets include day and night color schemes (Black on White, White on Black and Red). \n\n◆ Adjustable Auto-Lock: You can prevent the device from turning into the sleep mode. \n\nAccording to wikipedia: An inclinometer or clinometer is an instrument for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or inclination of an object with respect to gravity. It is also known as a tilt meter, tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. \n\nFor recreational use only. After the calibration it CAN (!) be very accurate especially for the main axis after calibration. The measurement is performed as well as possible (we try our best) by using the three inbuilt accelerometers. \n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! \n\nWe will improve the application long-term. This was the first application of this kind shortly after the opening of the App Store. Since then it is continuously updated and enriched with new features."

Never before so easy and accurate! \n\nAre you going to check your room, your workplace or, are you simply curious to try one of the most astonishing  uses of your iPhone? This is the app you need!\n\nThere is no magic: every speaker, microphone, cellphone, spy bug, hidden camera has in itself a magnetic field: iPhones are equipped with a magnetometer (used by the compass), dontspy can read the data captured by the magnetometer and it report the presence of the magnetic field emitted by spy bugs, cellphones, microphones, metal object, other devices that emit magnetic field, and report it. The reading as to be made close to the object you are searching for.\n\nTransform your iPhone in a magnetic field detector, metal detector or electronic devices detector such as smartphones, spy bugs, microphones and so on! \n\nNote that the app can't distinguish metal object from smartphone, spy bugs from other electronic device, so you will read \"found\" also in case of the presence of a metal object, so you have to perform the search away from metal objects to have a good result. \n \nConsider that the magnetometer on iPhones is on the upper right, and on iPads in the back top centre.\n\nThis app read the magnetic field and show it in a simple to use interface."

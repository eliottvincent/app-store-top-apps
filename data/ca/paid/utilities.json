      "label": "Noir is a Safari extension that automatically adds a dark mode to every website you visit.\n\nIt makes browsing the web at night so much better. With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.\n\nAnd the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it is – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop. And with over 20 built-in themes and the ability to create your own, you can customize the results exactly the way you want.\n\nNoir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!\n\nBuilt from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Focus Filters and Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows. And your settings are automatically synced to all your devices using iCloud.\n\nAnd just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data. Period.\n\nNoir is made by a solo iOS developer. It does not include any subscriptions or ads. Buy Noir once, use it forever.\n\nNotes:\n• Found a website where Noir’s dark mode doesn’t look just right? Let me know by reporting it. The app will be frequently updated to address issues that are reported.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\n• The Noir extension requires access to the websites you visit to analyze the existing style of the page and to override it with Noir's dark style.\n• Noir never collects your browsing data. The only data Noir ‘collects’ are your settings, and those will never leave your device.\n• You can read Noir’s full Privacy Policy at https://getnoir.app/privacypolicy"

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here. Chromecast is a trademark of Google LLC."

I also applied \nother filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an \nenvironment suitable for spirit communication.\n\nThe audio itself is made up of phonemes, \npartial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help \nspirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.\nthere are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.\n\nThese sounds banks play in a similar\nway to that of my other app \"Spiritus Ghost Box\" but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has\n8 active sound banks.\n\nWhite Noise Sound Bank:\n\nThis app also has an optional 9th sound bank called \"White noise\". \nThis bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This \naudio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the \n\"Holy Grail\" of EVP recorders. This is not a White Noise Generator, this is a normal sound bank like the others but this one contains white noise from the DR60.\n\nAudio Effects:\n\nThis app does contain Echo and Reverb audio effects. These have been proven \nto be the best effects to apply to ITC sessions. The echo can create audio that can be \nmanipulated within the echo itself. Echo can also help in live, real time communication by \nrepeating the audio and allowing you to better hear whats coming through. Reverb can be \napplied to the audio to create a spacious sound environment that will enhance audio manipulation."

      "label": "This professional tool called Clinometer is the most precise (all you can get with some calculations) slope measurement tool for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad using all sides of the device plus the camera. It can be used for simple applications like aligning a frame as well as for more sophisticated fields of applications where an arbitrary slope needs to be measured exactly. Read the reviews (and write your own) for all the applications you find! Thank for all your positive feedback! Please use our support link if you have questions and suggestions, we don't read the iTunes reviews every day!\n\nWith this tool, the slope can be measured by all edges of the device and through the camera. The current features include:\n\n◆ 3 Modes (incl. auto switching): Clinometer mode (auto when holding upright), Camera mode (any direction, manual activation) and Bubble level (smoothly fading in when holding flat).\n\n◆ Relative angles: Besides measuring absolute angles, for every mode you can measure the relative angle between device positions\n\n◆ Advanced two way calibration on all sides: For every 4 sides plus the bubble mode you can calibrate in two steps, which allows you to calibrate exactly even on non-level surfaces. Each direction can be calibrated individually to achieve the optimal precision. \n\n◆ Speech synthesis: The device will speak the current reading, so you don't have to watch the display while measuring/aligning your object.\n\n◆ Five different unit modes: The device can display the slope in degrees (rounded or in tenth of degrees), percentage, rise over run (common for roof slope measurement in :12) and 1V:H (common in engineering)\n\n◆ Dial Rotation: You can smoothly rotate the background dial and thus define which side of the device represents 0° and 90° degrees. \n\n◆ Motion-sensitive Lock feature: Besides the common instant simple tap hold mechanism you can activate the motion-sensitive lock. If activated the device waits for the final lock until you hold your device steady enough for at least 2 seconds. You can set the lock sensitivity between 0.1° and 1.0° degrees. \n\n◆ Peer Mode: Use two devices to measure angles: One as a display, the other as the measurement device that can be attached to the hardware you want to align. \n\n◆ Fullscreen Mode: The full screen mode can be toggled by tapping the center of the screen and by the upper and lower arrows in the center. This prevents you from erroneous inputs while measuring.\n\n◆ Different color schemes: Press the S/C Button to instantly switch the color. The color can be selected differently for the bubble and the clinometer mode. The predefined color sets include day and night color schemes (Black on White, White on Black and Red). \n\n◆ Adjustable Auto-Lock: You can prevent the device from turning into the sleep mode. \n\nAccording to wikipedia: An inclinometer or clinometer is an instrument for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or inclination of an object with respect to gravity. It is also known as a tilt meter, tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. \n\nFor recreational use only. After the calibration it CAN (!) be very accurate especially for the main axis after calibration. The measurement is performed as well as possible (we try our best) by using the three inbuilt accelerometers. \n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! \n\nWe will improve the application long-term. This was the first application of this kind shortly after the opening of the App Store. Since then it is continuously updated and enriched with new features."

      "label": "iCab Mobile is a web browser for the iOS. It provides many unique and useful features you won't find in other iPhone browsers.\n\nAPPLE WATCH:\nThe Watch App is a remote control for iCab Mobile, so you can navigate, zoom, scroll, open bookmarks, links, the homepage, switch tabs or sitch on/off the fullscreen mode. Since watchOS 6.2 you can also open web pages and browse the Web directly on the Apple Watch. But there are a few limitations: The watchOS will always show a privacy warning when starting a browsing session and there are no navigation buttons (back/forward) available.\n\nFILE UPLOADS:\niCab Mobile can upload any files on web pages.\n\nSEARCHING:\niCab Mobile comes with several default search engines you can choose from. You can easily add new search engines. \n\nFILLING OUT FORMS:\niCab Mobile can save web forms and restore the form content later (manually or automatically). The saved forms data can be password protected. Supports many third-party Password Manager Apps as well.\n\nFILTERS:\nThere’s a built-in fully customizable filter feature. It allows to block resources, ads, banners, user tracking scripts, cookies etc. Supports AdBlock Plus/EasyList filters as well.\n\nTABS:\niCab Mobile supports Tabs, so you can open multiple web pages at the same time. Links can be opened in Tabs (in the foreground or background) manually or automatically. \n\nBOOKMARKS:\nBookmarks can be organized in folders. You can import/export the bookmarks from/to your PC/Mac browser. \n\nFULLSCREEN MODE:\niCab Mobile provides a fullscreen mode where the whole screen is used to display the web page. No screen space is wasted for toolbars. \n\nDOWNLOADS:\niCab Mobile has a built-in Download Manager so you can download almost all files from the internet. The downloads can be easily transfered to a Mac/PC/Linux computer but also to other Apps on the device which can open these files\n\nMULTIUSER SUPPORT\nYou can create multiple user accounts, each user has its own private bookmarks, filters, settings, etc.\n\nDROPBOX\niCab Mobile supports Dropbox. Export/Import bookmarks; transfer downloads, images, files, web pages to your Dropbox account.\n\nTWIN BROWSER:\nIn this mode, you can have two browsers side by side on the iPad. This is especially useful on the large iPad Pro.\n\nVOICEOVER\nThe App is also accessible for visually impaired and blind users. If VoiceOver is enabled, the App plays soft ticks while a page is loading, so blind users are able to identify when the page load has finished. \n\nOTHER FEATURE:\n- Configurable multi-touch gestures\n- QuickStarter feature\n- AirPrint support \n- Browser ID (UserAgent) is configurable\n- iCab Mobile fully supports international domain names\n- Cookie Manager\n- Private Browsing (no history and no cookies are stored)\n- Privacy settings allows to delete all kinds of private data (history, cookies, databases, saved forms, passwords etc.)\n- URL autocompletion \n- Simple built-in RSS reader\n- Save images, whole web pages, PDF files\n- Kiosk Mode - a restricted variation of the fullscreen mode for Kiosk environments. \n- History\n- Addressbook support lets you access the web pages from the addressbook. \n- When launching iCab can either open an empty page, the homepage or restore the Tabs which were open the last time\n- There are different color schemes and designs\n- Document Sharing lets you pass downloads and files to other Apps in the device\n\n\n\nThe App includes a store providing several InApp purchases. These are meant as a tip jar. The InApp purchases are available for different prices, so you can pick the amount for the tip yourself. Doing so will unlock a few cool features as a reward, these are always the same, regardless of the amount of the tip. Users who have purchased the App within the last 12 months do get all these features for free, no need to buy one of the InApp purchases. Though they can nevertheless give me a tip, if they want to... ;-)"

Please note that the LSD has to be West of the first Meridian.\n\nDirect Integration with Google Maps as well as Apple Maps\n-----\nAt the tap of a button you can export the LSD or BC NTS coordinate to either of these platforms. This allows you to get turn by turn driving directions, traffic information, accident information and automatic rerouting, satellite imagery of the location, caching of map data on your phone (so you don’t need a data connection), position sharing and much more.\n\nRecently converted list\n-----\nThe app saves your recently found locations so you don’t need to enter them again. Simply select one of your recent locations to get information! You can also delete items in this list that you no longer wish to view.\n\nSave results as favourites\n-----\nSave your most often used locations so you can look them up again with just 2 clicks! You can name your favourites anything you want.\n\nSaves LSD as well as latitude and longitude coordinates to the clipboard\n-----\nThis allows you to use third party mapping software to find your favourite locations."

If you prefer a more aggressive or more stable feel, then open up the tune customizer to set oversteer or understeer in each part of a turn. ForzaTune works out the new values for you automatically.\n\nThere's nothing better than driving a car dialed in how you want it. And a car that feels planted lets you drive faster.\n\nThis Pro version includes many extra tuning types like rally, drag and drift plus gearing options, the ability to save tunes, and finer control over your tune balance.\n\nHere are the complete specs if you'd like to learn more:\n\nONE APP TO TUNE THEM ALL\nForzaTune Pro has support for Forza Horizon 5, Forza Horizon 4, Forza Motorsport 7 and also includes most vehicles in Forza Horizon 3 and Forza Motorsport 6.\n\nMAKE STREET, DRIFT, RALLY TUNES AND MORE\nNo matter what kind of driving you like, this tuning app has you covered. Create standard (street/track), drift, drag, rain, rally/snow, and off-road tunes with ease.\n\nLEARN HOW TO QUICKLY FINE-TUNE\nAdjust the overall balance, turn entry balance, turn exit balance, ride stiffness, roll stiffness in seconds.\n\nRETUNE GEARS WITH EASE\nIncludes a gearing calculator option that lets you match race transmission values to engine swaps or major power upgrades. \n\nTUNES ARE TAILORED TO EACH CAR\n1140+ vehicles covering Forza Horizon 5 back through Forza Motorsport 6. Tuning for some special editions (F&F, Team Forza, FE) is done with the base car unless noted otherwise. ForzaTune does not include oval racing vehicles or tuning.\n\nACCURATE FORMULAS\nForzaTune Pro combines your input with its vehicle and track databases to create original, balanced tunes. Formulas are based on real race engineering. They are also tested extensively with a gamepad and steering wheel/pedal set.\n\nSAVE AND MANAGE YOUR TUNES\nSave, edit, search and backup all of your tunes. Export and import options let you transfer your tunes to new devices or friends easily without logins or accounts.\n\n-----\nFAQs\n-----\nQ: Is this for beginners or experienced tuners?\nA: Both. Experienced tuners use it to save time. Newer tuners use it to learn how to tune.\n\nQ: How do I use the app?\nA: Copy several car details from the game into ForzaTune, hit \"Next\" and copy the results into the tuning menu in Forza Horizon 5 or an earlier Forza title. There is also a series of video tutorials on YouTube to get you started.\n\nQ: What settings and upgrades do I need?\nA: You will need racing upgrades like suspension, braking, anti-roll bars, and differential to change the values in the tuning menu. You can also use drift, rally and adjustable stock suspensions when available (like off-road buggies and some trucks in Horizon). You will also have the best results if you disable stability management (STM) and traction control (TCS) for lower class cars. Normal or simulation steering is fine, but simulation steering is recommended in FH5 especially when fine-tuning.\n\nQ: Why is tuning your cars important?\nA: When doing upgrades many of the default tune settings will not match the new build. ForzaTune brings it back to a balanced setup. Also, tuning doesn't affect your PI or race restrictions—so this is how you can gain an advantage over other racers.\n\n---\nMake better tunes faster with ForzaTune Pro."

These are just a few of the day to day conveniences this app will help achieve:\n\n - Forgot to plug in? Get a notification if vehicle is in a pre-configured location and not plugged in - all done directly on the watch, no external servers required, keeping your privacy!\n\n - Add the graphic corner complication to your watch face and enjoy the convenience of having easy access to state of charge, charging indicator, time remaining if charging, sentry mode active indicator and indicator if any windows, doors or trunks are open. All from one complication, that also will launch the app when tapped. \n\n - During and after charge, a panel will show how much energy was added. Convenient if you schedule your charge during the night - wake up each morning and easily check how much energy was added to the battery. \n\n - If you have multiple vehicles on your account, tap the vehicle name to quickly and easily switch between them. \n\n - You can queue up commands by tapping on buttons, then put your wrist down and the commands will execute in the background when the vehicle is successfully woken up. \n\n - When you tap the unlock vehicle button, the charge port will also unlock if a charging cable is attached. That's convenience right there!\n\n - Want to reduce phantom drain? Background updates can be configured to longer intervals between updates or to only update if car is already awake or can be disabled entirely for absolutely zero impact on phantom drain.\n\n - A warning panel will show up if any doors, windows or trunks are left open. Conveniently, you can tap the panel to close any open windows.\n\n - Need to access the frunk? Just do it from your wrist - no fiddling with your phone. \n\n - Sitting comfy in the couch, but just remembered you have a road-trip in the morning? Set the charge limit to 100% - or any value really - and start charging, right from the convenience of your wrist!\n\n - Leaving the office after a long hot day? Activate the HVAC when you're on your way, and enjoy a nice cool vehicle.\n\n - When charging, tap the time remaining label to switch to show time of expected completion - no more head calculus!\n\n - Need to run a quick errand, but you don't have your phone? Unlock your vehicle from your wrist, then activate remote start and off you go. Just please be mindful that this feature requires internet connectivity on both watch and vehicle - so don't drive into the desert and leave your vehicle, or you'll get stuck there!\n\nA note about security and privacy:\nThis app accepts two types of login. Either Tesla account credentials or a Tesla API token. Your account credentials are by default not stored in the app, but are used only once to obtain an authentication token and refresh token directly from the Tesla API server. If you would rather supply that token yourself, you can do so instead. It is preferable to supply a refresh token, as the app will then have a perpetual login. Your token will be persisted in the app. Tokens will be revoked if you change your Tesla account password. With the optional remote start feature you can choose to store your password in the app - it will be securely stored in the iOS / watchOS / iPadOS keychain. This feature is optional and is not required for all other features to function. No network traffic will ever be emitted from this app that goes anywhere other than directly to the Tesla API servers. The source code for this application will at all times be made available to any security researcher for a voluntary security and safety audit. \n\nDisclaimer: \nThis app is not endorsed by Tesla Inc. Use at your own risk. No guarantee of proper function is given. Only you are responsible for any changes to your car caused by using this app.  \n\nMade in Denmark"

      "label": "Drone Tone Tool is an app created by professional musicians and music educators providing high quality reference pitches with the rich overtones of real cellos. We encourage musicians of all abilities to experience the benefits of reference tone practice!\nWhy real cello drones?\n\nThere are many electronic tone generators, and while they are better than nothing, they lack complexity of overtones and can be painful to listen to. Our cello drones are pleasing to the ear, rich in overtones and contain layered octaves to facilitate practice in all registers.\n\nPurpose and benefit of reference/drone tones:\n\nA reference (or drone) tone provides a center of harmonic stability. Our ears are able to discern the way that multiple pitches interact while strengthening our internal sense of pitch. By playing with a movable pitch (instrument or voice) relative to a fixed pitch (drone tone) we can start to perceive truly consonant perfect intervals, and 'shades' or 'colors' within Major/Minor intervals. This heightened awareness of relative pitch leads to artistry through intonation."

      "label": "***THIS APPLICATION DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY SERVER SIDE SERVICE***\n\nQuantumult is a powerful proxy client.\n• Right now supports protocol Shadowsocks(r), HTTP, HTTP over TLS, SOCKS5 and SOCKS5 over TLS, VMess.\n\nIt can capture all the TCP traffic and redirect under you own way by using Filter function.\n• The filter has a few types to match. For TCP traffic that has the upper layer protocol HTTP(S), 'HOST', 'HOST-SUFFIX', 'HOST-KEYWORD', 'USER-AGENT', 'GEOIP' and 'IP-CIDR' are all supported. For the other TCP traffic, 'GEOIP' and 'IP-CIDR' are supported. Especially, when deal with HTTP(S) traffic, Quantumult has another function called Rejection, it matchs the whole URL of the HTTP(S) request.\n• After match, the filter has a lot of actions to deal with the request, built-in policy 'DIRECT', 'REJECT', 'PROXY', all your servers and your customized policies. Actually you can see all the actions as a lot of paths and you can decide which request goes through which path by using filter function.\n\nMore over, Quantumult can be a convenient web develop tool on mobile device.\n• When you on the road without the Mac platform debug tools like Charles and Wireshark, you still can use Quantumult to log parts of the web request to debug some web issues.\n• Quantumult can log all the HTTP(S) request header and response header.\n• Yes, you are right it can log the HTTPS request header and response header, be sure to install and trust Quantumult root CA for this advanced function.\n\nSince quantumult has a function called PROXY, sure it can redirect your traffic to remote proxy servers. But be clear, we do NOT provide any server side service or support, you should build your own servers.\n• Like we said early Quantumult can redirect all TCP traffic through the filter function, that means you can visit different web site through different servers by the filter. See it can accelerate your network connection if you set your filter right, and of course the filter is totally customizable.\n• About the customized policy, there are 3 different types of customized policy, 'SSID', 'Latency' and 'Static'. The 'SSID' policy depends on your network enviroment, Wi-Fi, Cellular or specific Wi-Fi with the SSID your provided. The 'Latency' policy is based on the latencies of all the servers of the policy settings, the result is the shortest(The test interval has the option of 600 or 1200 seconds). The 'Static' policy is based on your manual selection of servers or other polices from the policy settings. Sure you are right, some of polices can wrap other polices, convinent, right ?\n\nAbout working state, Quantumult can work in 3 state, 'GLOBAL', 'DIRECT' AND 'AUTO'.\n• The GLOBAL state will ignore filter settings and redirect all TCP traffic through the built-in PROXY policy(you need build and add your server first).\n• The DIRECT state will ignore filter settings and redirect all TCP traffic directly to the destination web site. How this state useful ? Yes, it can be a simple web develop tools by analizing the reqeust header and response header including HTTPS.\n• The AUTO state, we call it auto because it base on the filter you set to divide the TCP traffic through different paths, like the popular ACL way.\n\nExtra, Quantumult can also work as a HTTP proxy server for devices under the same Wi-Fi, when this function is turned on, the home view will show the IP and port for other device easily to connect.\n\n\nAt last, some attentions.\n• About the location on the map of home view. It is not the real location in the real world, it's just the IP location and might not be correct."

This can be used to help adjust your HD OTA antenna for local reception, for that hard to get station, or even the far far away channel that you have been trying to \"DX\" for quite a while. Whether you are on your roof or turning your rotor from your living room, OTAMap can help you.\n\n*****Note to Northern Canadian Users: OTAMap does work everywhere in Canada (including Edmonton), however you may need to flip on the Industry Canada Data in the preferences. \n\nSome of the new features  in 2.0\nNow you can choose between FM or TV stations \n•You can filter station list based on distance, power, FCC data, Industry Canada data, Canadian, Mexican and US stations. \n•You can now even filter based on whether your location falls within a stations 41 dBU Contours! \n•You can sort the displayed stations by distance, channel, power or even it's bearing from you. \n•Save and recall locations. \n•Do locations based on \n-Actual GPS \n-Entered GPS (IOS 6.1 and higher only) \n-ZIP/postal code (IOS 6.1 and higher only) \n-Street Address (IOS 6.1 and higher only) \n-Or a previously saved location. \n•Download and update latest FCC station data anytime. \n•No longer server based. Some functionality will run without a network connection. If a particular map was previously loaded, even mapping functionality may work offline. \n•Fixed magnetic declination (no longer IRC dependent) (may be off as you near the Arctic Circle). \n•Added ability to add stations/save maps to a DX list. The list can be pulled up anytime and the pointing maps reviewed. \n•Added Super Contour Map. Given a particular location it -will list all stations that fall within the 41/60 dBu contour map which should indicate stations that should be received relatively easily. Will show curves of all coverage contours and darken overlapping sections. The resulting stations can then be viewed as your filtered station list. \n•Added a search for call sign option. This will allow mapping of super long range reception or help in obscure DX attempts. \n•Now works for all of the Great White North - Uses IRC data for anything not included in the FCC database. \n•In the station pointing map view the map can be updated if the users gps determination has changed. \n•In the station pointing and the all station map views, you can drag the home icon to say a different part of the roof/yard and the calculations will follow. \n•You can erase your downloaded data (which may include FCC FM/TV database and any cached contours) and restore to original data from preference menu."

      "label": "Apart from the most reliable app for polar alignment (with or without a polar scope), PS Align pro has become the astronomer's swiss-army knife with all the tools added over the years. Remember, all features & updates are free forever, the only in-app purchases are donations (tip jar).\n\nPolar Scope Align will calculate the position of Polaris or σ Octantis in your Polar Scope reticle for your location (using your phone's GPS or manually), allowing a quick and accurate polar alignment. It is one of the few programs that are accurate in lower latitudes by correcting for atmospheric refraction (so expect results to agree only with precise software and not most simplistic \"polar align\" apps - see the \"Accuracy\" section in help for details). In the settings you can select the polar scope reticle that matches your own, from a vast collection:\niOptron old & new, Astro-Physics RAPAS & PASILL, various versions of Takahashi EM-10/11/200/400/500, NJP, PM-1, P2-Z, the latest Orion / Skywatcher, the Classic Skywatcher / Orion / Celestron / Meade / EXOS2 / Bresser, the Telrad, Rigel QuikFinder, a couple for Astrotrac / Losmandy / Kenko / Avalon, the Vixen PF-L/Atlux/SX/SXD/SXP/AXD/GP/GP-DX/Polarie Polar Axis Scopes, a Konus and several Polar Finders: Tuthill, Explore Scientific 8x50, Meade 9x60, Vixen Polaris, Celestron 7x50, Carton Optical. PoleMaster help view for South Hemisphere users. If you have one not included, just ask the developer to add it!\n\nFeature list:\n\n-Accurate calculation of Polaris or Sigma Oct for any date and location, including effect of atmospheric refraction (and annual aberration, nutation). Most other apps do not perform precision calculations, so please only compare app readings to accurate sources (USNO, scientific software etc).\n-Use device time/date/location, or enter your own, or pick from online & offline world databases via the Location Manager.\n-Approximate daytime / no polarscope polar alignment tool. Great for visual use, solar imaging (inc. eclipses) and even limited short focal length astrophotography. Now with sun shadow calibration for more accuracy!\n-Laser / Hop Align for nighttime alignment using a calibration star for obstructed or not visible polar star, or for improving laser align.\n-Full app in red-color (or alternative green, white) night mode - tools switchable to daytime view.\n-Deep Space Object (DSO) Database with 22000+ objects from several catalogs (Messier, Caldwell, NGC, IC, Herschell 400, Sharpless 2, Barnard), along with stars (Yale Bright Star) & planets. Search, apply filters, sorting, download DSS color images for all items, or get help finding them with your non-goto telescope with the Push-To function.\n-Connect to and control WiFi-enabled iOptron mounts.\n-Over 30 calculators useful for observing and astrophotography, from eyepiece magnification and field of view, to imaging resolution and reducers.\n-Xasteria: World astro-weather report based on 7Timer! data\n-Water vapor satellite images.\n-List of visible ISS and bright satellite passes.\n-Moon phase & lunar Calendar with solar/lunar rise/set and twilight times.\n-Wizard to calculate your reticle centering offset and correct or compensate for it.\n-Zoomable reticle view and customized routines & tools: Alt-az alignment error display for mounts that calculate it after star alignment (e.g. iOptron iEQ45, CEM60), polar alignment when your scope is not in zero position (for mounts like iOptron ZEQ/CEM on which you can always access the polar scope), remember zero position on Celestron / Skywatcher / Orion etc reticles.\n-Bubble level (using either gyro or accelerometer) and Compass heading, as well as magnetic declination reading.\n-GPS accuracy & elevation data.\n-Red/White/LED light.\n-Dimming slider.\n-iOptron, NexStar and Meade LX200 Star Lists.\n-Support for iPhone & iPad from iOS 9 (and iPod Touch, except tools that require the compass)."

Fast, versatile and easy to use, the CX-3® delivers accurate results quickly and efficiently. Whether used for flight planning, ground school, or FAA Knowledge Exam preparation, the menu organization reflects the order in which a flight is normally planned and executed, resulting in a natural flow from one function to the next with a minimum of keystrokes. Multiple aviation functions can be performed on the CX-3® flight computer including those related to time, speed, distance, heading, wind, fuel, altitude, cloud base, standard atmosphere, glide, climb & descent, weight & balance, as well as a holding pattern function to help determine entry method and holding details. The CX-3® has 12 unit-conversions: Distance, Speed, Duration, Temperature, Pressure, Volume, Rate, Weight, Rate of Climb/Descent, Angle of Climb/Descent, Torque, and Angle. These 12 conversion categories contain 38 different conversion factors for over 100 functions. A calculator, clock, timer, and stopwatch are also built in along with multiple settings for lighting, backlighting, themes, time zones and more."

Add the ability to manually enter list members, assign nicknames, select from multiple addresses, intelligent handling the country portion of the address, accommodate a large range of label types, AirPrint directly or produce a PDF of the labels, clone new lists from existing lists, all wrapped in a visually pleasing interface. Winner!\"\n\"I hate addressing my Christmas cards. This app made it very easy to make labels. I don't have a printer that works with my iPad yet, so I really appreciated having the capability to send them as a PDF to my email address. The app is awesome...\"\n“Just what you need at this time of year - a reliable self updating list to speed up sending out cards. This is the 3rd or 4th year I've used it and it just gets better and better.”\n“After years of tearing my hair out trying to get labels out of my iphone/iPad/iMac combo, an app that actually does what it promised!”"

Contrary to popular belief, nothing can lower BAC except time; coffee, cold showers, and chugging glasses of water will not help you sober up any faster. \n\nProduct vision\n\nCurious what your BAC might be? You'll be able to use this app to estimate, but don't forget that everyone metabolizes alcohol (beer, wine, liquor) differently. Our calculator can give you an approximate BAC level, but do not rely upon it to determine if you're fit to drive or work.\n\nI deeply believe this tool could really help people make smarter choices.

Other hardware and software are required.\n\nLink to the popular JMRI software through a local Wi-Fi network to access throttle, address, and function controls wirelessly.\n-or-\nConnect directly to an MRC Prodigy WiFi module.\n-or-\nConnect directly to a Digitrax LnWi module.\n-or-\nConnect directly to a WifiTrax WFD-30/31.\n\nDigital Command Control (DCC) is now the most common control method for earnest model railroaders, allowing multiple trains to be controlled simultaneously anywhere on the track.  JMRI is an interface program that works with most brands of DCC and is very popular because it simplifies DCC programming, signaling, control, and many other aspects of running a permanent layout.  It is also free and multi-platform.  \n\nInstead of direct control through the DCC system, WiThrottle links with JMRI or a dedicated module.  This provides a universal interface to many possible combinations of technology and model railroads.  As DCC evolves, JMRI is updated as needed to match current technology.\n\nJMRI Requirements:\n- JMRI 2.12 or higher, JMRI 5.0 or newer recommended\n- DCC system interfaced to a computer and a model railroad\n- Local Wi-Fi network\n\nMRC Prodigy WiFi Requirements:\n- MRC Prodigy WiFi module\n- MRC Prodigy DCC system\n\nDigitrax LnWi Requirements:\n- Digitrax LnWi module\n- Digitrax DCC system\n\nWifiTrax WFD-30/31 Requirements:\n- WifiTrax WFD module\n- NCE DCC system\n\nIf you operate at either a club or private home that uses JMRI for operations and has Wi-Fi, access to the local network (host may need to share their password) is all you need.  Multiple iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad mobile devices may use their own WiThrottle app simultaneously during an operating session.  If you would like to sample WiThrottle, we offer a Lite version at no charge.  This allows you to confirm compatibility before buying the full App.\n\nPlease visit our website for additional information.  Our goal is to enhance your model railroading experience by providing convenient, wireless control of your existing system.  WiThrottle is the final piece of the puzzle.  \n\nFeatures:\n- Select road or yard throttle control arrangements\n- Dual throttle screen\n- F0 - F28 function controls\n- Build and break Advanced Consists\n- Link multiple addresses for control by one throttle (Universal Consists)\n- Control JMRI routes & turnouts\n- Imports roster list and function labels from your JMRI files\n- Access the JMRI WebServer for control panels and more\n- Adjust sensitivity of the throttle slider\n- Set for right or left hand use\n- Acquire and dispatch addresses wirelessly\n- Train idles if interrupted (e.g. phone call)\n- Control track power\n- Fastclock display\n- Automatic networking\n- Flashlight for devices equipped with camera flash\n\nWiThrottle will integrate seamlessly if:\n- you can already control a train using the built-in throttles of JMRI 2.12 or later\n- your iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad can access your local wireless network (not cellular or Bluetooth)"

      "label": "Amplitude Pro includes all of the fun features of Amplitude and now the ability to record and share your audio with your friends!\r\n\r\nAmplitude Pro enhances aural experiences by allowing you to hear distant and/or quiet sounds as if you were standing nearby. Amplitude Pro uses the high quality hardware of the iPhone and iPod Touch* to detect and amplify the faintest of sounds. \r\n\r\n***Note: To get the best experience possible, you must use ear buds that do not have a built-in microphone.***\r\n\r\nAmplitude Pro lets you adjust the sensitivity of the iPhone microphone to amplify sounds from across a room. You’ll hear things you never would have been able to hear otherwise. \r\n\r\nAmplitude Pro also lets you record and save the amplified sounds to your device and share them with your friends. To do this, all you have to do is press the red button at the bottom of the screen. To stop it, you simply press the button again. Now you can detect and have proof of that “ghost” that you always hear that everyone made fun of you for and prove them wrong!\r\n\r\nUsing Amplitude Pro is easy: simply launch the app, point your device in the direction of the sound you want to amplify, and starting hearing the world in a new way through your headphones. Individual controls enable you to adjust the microphone sensitivity or mute the sound amplifying feature altogether.\r\n\r\nUse Amplitude Pro to explore your world. Experience all the sounds of your environment that you would otherwise have missed.\r\n\r\nExperience Nature and Wildlife More Intimately. Record and share the sounds with friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nExperimenting Around Your World\r\n\r\n- Diagnose the source of that annoying squeak in your new car and send it to your local mechanic.\r\n\r\n- Attach a cup or small plastic bowl to the end of your iPhone to focus the incoming sound and expand your range\r\n\r\n- Place microphone against an office wall to hear sounds from all over the building and listen to what everyone is talking about!\r\n\r\nAmplitude Pro Benefits:\r\n\r\n- Turns your iPhone or iPod Touch* into a sound amplifier\r\n\r\n- Hear sounds through thin walls or doors\r\n\r\n- Adjustable microphone sensitivity / boost\r\n\r\n- Adjustable volume and mute controls\r\n\r\n- Independently control the iPhone volume and the microphone sensitivity\r\n\r\n- View sound waves on the oscilloscope\r\n\r\n- Record and share each and every sound you encounter!\r\n\r\n***Ear buds are required for use with all devices. 1st, 2nd, and 3rd generation iPod Touches require ear buds with a microphone whereas the 4th generation iPod Touch can use ear buds without a microphone.***\r\n\r\nTips on Using Amplitude Pro:\r\n\r\n- For best audio reception, point the microphone in the direction of the sound you want to pick up. \r\n\r\n- Amplitude Pro controls are oriented upside down from other apps so that the microphone can be pointed toward target sounds.\r\n\r\n- To protect against accidental ear damage, Amplitude Pro starts in Muted mode. You can change the default in the settings screen.\r\n\r\n- For optimal performance, we recommend keeping device volume between 50-75%.\r\n\r\n- Experiment with microphone sensitivity. Some situations will require more, some less.\r\n\r\n- To preserve battery life, launch the application and press the device sleep button to darken the screen.\r\n\r\n- You can maximize your reception by using your hands or a plastic cup to focus the incoming sound. This is the best method to use when listening through solid objects like doors or walls.\r\n\r\n- Like any exposed microphone, the iPhone microphone is sensitive to wind noise. For best results we recommend using Amplitude Pro in non-windy situations. \r\n\r\n- Experiment with different attachments and microphone settings and let us know what works best for you.\r\n\r\nSend us your stories or YouTube videos to Amplitude@GripWire.com.

There's no limit on how many contacts you can lock.\n\nWe all have a few contacts in our iPhone for people we really should NOT phone or email at 1am on a Friday night (your ex-girl/boy friend, your mother(!) or your boss).\n\nWith Drunk Dial NO! you can leave your house at 8pm on a Friday night, hide those contacts for 12 hours and stop yourself waking up on Saturday morning thinking (cleaned up for iTunes!) \"Oh dear! oh my! I didn't, did I??!\"\n\nNEW FEATURE: Drunk Dial NO! now blocks incoming numbers for the time you set! Make sure that annoying ex-boyfriend doesn't try to call you when you're out on the town. Make sure your boss doesn't call and hear you drunk! Awesomely useful!\n\nNEW FEATURE: Send yourself a message upto 48 hours into the future! Warn your future, drunken, self against making a dreadful mistake! (you know the kind of thing we're talking about!)\n\n- Now looks great on Retina displays \n\n- Have Fun (and don't worry)\n\n----------------\nReal User Reviews:\n\nDrunk and call!! - 5 Stars\nby LISA705 - Version 2.995 - Nov 23, 2012\nI like it, it saves me alot!\n\nIt works!! - 4 Stars\nby me - Version 2.80 - Dec 27, 2011\nThis app is ridiculously funny!

This is gonna be awesome for upcoming nights.\n\nThe Best! - 5 Stars\nby ksierra123 - Version 1.20 - May 29 2009\nThis is the best app ever! Thank you for saving me from myself!\n\nPerfect App - 5 Stars\nby Jenniferw83 - Version 2.00 - May 29 2010\nThis app is perfect, and not just for when you are drunk. It's good to keep me from calling or texting an ex right after we break up. Every time I get the urge to text just cause I put his number on drunk dial no for 48 hours and by the time the 48 hours goes by the urge is gone. If not then I put him on it for another 48 hours!\n----------------\n\nTO START:\n - Tap the '+' button\n - Choose one of your contacts\n - Drunk Dial NO! will store the contact's phone number(s) and email address(es) for between 1 and 48 hours\n - NO EXCUSES! NO BEGGING!\n - After between 1 and 48 hours, run Drunk Dial NO! again to restore stored contact(s)\n\nTO TEST:\n - Create a contact called 'Test Person'\n   (first name: Test, last name: Person)\n - Add some fake phone and email entries for 'Test Person'\n - Choose 'Test Person' contact in Drunk Dial NO!\n - 'Test Person' is only stored for 5 minutes\n\nTO SEND YOURSELF A MESSAGE:\n - Tap the Compose button\n - Enter an important message you don't want to forget\n - The message will be sent to your device after the number of hours you enter\n\nTO TURN ON INCOMING BLOCKING:\n - In the Settings App\n - Goto Phone > Call Blocking & Identification\n - Make sure Drunk Dial NO! is turned On\n\nNote: If you've got contacts which Drunk Dial NO! is blocking, don't delete Drunk Dial NO! until you've restored the contacts using Drunk Dial NO! (of course, hopefully you'll like Drunk Dial NO! so much that you won't delete it!)\n\nFollow us on twitter @explorefun\n\nAll comments/suggestions welcomed to: info@explorefun.com"

It is the most full database in market.\n\nVery simple to use! You don't even have to select your car model. Just enter your fault code and app will show you all supported descriptions. No Internet connection needed, no longer spend hours to search for single code description, looking at check engine light.\n\nIf you have usb, bluetooth or WiFi OBDII code reader (ELM327, PLX Kiwi or any other) you need this app for code description because most of code scanners does not contain full DTC (diagnostic trouble code)  database and displays only meaningfull numbers. Be prepared for any troubles wherever you are!\n\nYou can select and copy error description with simple long press on text, and then paste it in SMS, e-mail or wherever you want!\n\nIf your car supports OBD II or EOBD, then you can already use almost 5000 generic OBDII codes. These codes are from PowerTrain series (P0XXX, P2XXX, P34XX), Body Series (B0XXX), Chassis series (C0XXX), Network series (U0XXX, U2XXX, U3XXX).\n\nAlso there is a list of more than 13500 additional manufacturer specific codes.\nSupported manufacturers with specific codes:\nAcura\nAlfa Romeo\nBMW\nChrysler / Dodge / Jeep\nCitroen / Peugeot\nDaewoo\nFiat\nFord\nGeo\nGM (Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, Hummer, Pontiac)\nHonda\nHyundai\nInfinity\nIsuzu\nJaguar\nKia\nLamborghini\nLand Rover\nLexus \nLincoln\nMazda\nMercedes\nMercury\nMini\nMitsubishi\nNissan\nOldsmobile\nOpel / Vauxhall\nPlymouth\nPorsche\nRenault (DF codes)\nSaab\nSaturn\nScion\nSubaru\nSuzuki\nToyota\nVolskwagen Audi Group\nVolvo\n\nNote that it is impossible to create complete OBD DTC database.

It's dramatically easier and more accurate than any previous method.\n\nJust tap a button when the time on your watch matches the time displayed by the app, and Watch Tracker does the rest. It synchronizes with an atomic clock, measures and records the difference, and displays graphs of all the data points you've recorded.\n\n- Uses best-fit analysis to accurately calculate how many seconds your watch gains or loses per day\n- Displays graphs of rates and variance\n- Can track multiple watches simultaneously\n- Saves data in CSV files that can be opened with any spreadsheet software\n\nWatch Tracker is made by the developer of tChess (the chess app that was featured in Apple's \"Learn\" commercial for the iPad) and Learn Chess (the Apple Staff Favorite e-book)."

The results are analyzed and displayed in an easy to read overview.\n\nThe content can be filtered by frequency (e.g. 80m, 40m etc.) or mode (CW = Morse, Beacon or digital modes), Call Prefix, ITU/CQ Zone, Country and many more.\n\nCalls (the callsign of the operators) will be decoded automatically by the App. This allows even inexperienced users to know the countries of the operators.\n\niCluster is an ideal tool for amateur radio operators for field days or contests. But also unlicensed users can use iCluster to find out the frequencies for their shortwave scanner or short wave radio receiver.\n\nMAIN FEATURES:\n\n■ Real time DX-Cluster database\n■ Several pre-defined Cluster Servers\n■ Easy to add your own Server (e.g. CW-Skimmer)\n■ Several Filter and Filter combinations\n■ Several Alarm settings\n■ QRZ.com (Database!) lookup\n■ QRZ.com website lookup\n■ HamQTH lookup\n■ Display whole cluster on a Map (Globe)\n■ Display single Spot on a Map (Globe)\n■ Shows distance and bearing from own location\n■ iCloud Synchronization\n■ UTC Clock\n■ No HAM license or registering required\n\nTake a look to the manual to find out more:\n\nhttp://go-to.me/icluster-manual\n\nThis App exists since the App Store Exists as this was my first App. It has been continuously improved and re-written several times and is now available as Version 12, written in Swift 5. \n\nIt's interesting to see how many other bad copies of my App are available on the App Store.

      "label": "Partometer is a useful and handy camera tool for object dimensions measurements that can be used as a ruler or tape measure on your iPhone.\n    The App performs remote, non-contact in plane measurements. It uses the phone camera and any available object with known size as a reference. Most common objects like credit card, sheet of paper, DVD/CD, etc. are included in the application. Moreover you can use your own custom objects with known size. \n    \n    The user has an option to make a snapshot of the camera view and work with the image instead of live camera view.  Picture upload from the picture gallery is also available. \n\n\nThe following mode are available in the app:\n\nLength Mode: measure objects in any direction and compare parts  to each other.\n\nAngle Mode: two rulers are available connected in one point to measure angle and lengths.\n\nArea Mode: area of irregular shaped objects can be calculated using this mode.\n\nCircle Mode: measurements on circle -  radius, length, area\n    \n    The App shows measurement results in different units such as meters, millimeters, centimeters, feet, inches based on user settings. It also calculate dimensions of the object in relative units with respect to  the reference object. \n\n    Two editing modes Edit and Zoom  help the user to align the rulers or to mark an object accurately. \n\n    The App can be very useful if you need to measure bigger distances on a plane, where a simple ruler or measure tape is difficult to apply. All you need to do in this case is to place the reference object (credit card or sheet of paper) on the measurement plane, to make sure that an object of interest and reference object fit into the camera view, to take picture and do measurements.\n\nDemo videos:\nhttp://youtu.be/HPSBnIcLz8A\nhttp://youtu.be/NwZnB6sLfqI\n\nCircle Mode: \nhttp://youtu.be/vmX5kBLptg0\n\nPartometer use cases:\n\n- measure size of your room quickly\n- estimate furniture size\n- measure baggage size\n- measure out some distances on objects (handcraft, woodcraft, etc.)\n- measure size of a big object that practically impossible to measure   with a ruler or tape measure outdoor. For example, you can measure height of a house using sheet  of paper as a reference object.\n- measure small objects with high accuracy just by placing them on A4 or Letter sheet.\n- measure or compare height of a person\n- compare objects to each other \n- estimate Pupilary Distance by holding credit card next to your face \n- measure fish size very quickly or measure all previous catch from the pictures using your own height\n- measure fabric or cloth area and size\n- measure trees\n- measure angles, pitch gauge\n- measure spark plug gap\n- measure area of irregular shaped objects\n- measure bearings, roller bearings, nuts, rings.\n- measure any internal feature or irregular shaped area on X-ray if you have a reference( useful for dentists)\n- make measurements in different units \n- measurements of small objects that fit within your device screen: jewelry, rings, stones, screws, bolts, buttons, nuts, knitting needles, knitting pattern, washers, insects, mosaic tile, hooks, etc. \n\n... and many others, depending on your imagination.\n\nDepending on measurement conditions, reference object and distance to an object you can achieve sub-mm resolution."

      "label": "Enjoy Kardashian-free web browsing. Instantly vanish Kim, Kylie, Khloe, Kendall, Kourtney, Caytlin, Kanye and the rest of the Kardashians from the interwebs. \n\nK Blocker filters out links, websites and photos that contain keywords related to the Kardashian clan.\n\nK Blocker uses the latest iOS Content Blocking capabilities. It integrates directly into Safari, so you do not need to change anything about the way you browse the web. Simply enable K Blocker and you will see how photos, images and links related to the Kardashians just disappear. K Blocker also blocks website URLs that contain Kardiashian-related keywords, so if you accidentally follow a link to one of these sites, you will only see a blank page.\n\nIn addition to working in Safari, K Blocker also works in certain apps that use Safari Webkit for web browsing. K Blocker does NOT work in apps such as Facebook for iOS or Twitter for iOS. However, it will work if you access these services via the Safari web browser.\n\nLIMITATIONS: K Blocker is intended for entertainment purposes only. It has been tested on a large number of websites. It will dramatically reduce your exposure to Kardashian-related content. However, it cannot block 100% of the Kardashian content on 100% of the websites. It may also affect the display of some web content that mistakenly identifies as Kardashian-related. \n\nDISCLAIMER: Reference to any celebrity, person, product, name or trademark is for descriptive purposes only and does not constitute or imply sponsorship or endorsement."

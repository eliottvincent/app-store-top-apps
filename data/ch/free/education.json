      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

Over 25 years of language learning experience has taught Rosetta Stone one thing: everyone has the ability to learn to read, write, and speak a language with confidence. Try the Rosetta Stone app yourself for free. \n\nMany online language learning apps will promise that you can learn a language in just a few minutes a day. However, there is a significant difference between memorizing vocabulary lists and speaking a language with confidence. Learning a language is about more than just the words.

The three types of answers, the picture upload feature, the formula editor, and the possibility to reverse the order of learning make studying in all fields of knowledge easy and fun and in no time, you will become a foreign language professional.\n \nMobile Learning\nWith the card2brain app, you always have your flashcards handy wherever you go and you can study inexpensively offline. Efficient learning units that are automatically synchronised with your web profile shorten your daily travel time and waiting periods. Responsive web design enables you to use card2brain.ch perfectly also in your mobile’s browser.\n \nAll additional Features for teachers and flashcard fans, entire schools, companies, classes or teams can be found on the web platform https://card2brain.ch/features/app?lang=en\n\nGTC\nhttps://card2brain.ch/about/rightsapp?lang=en\n\nPrivacy policy\nhttps://card2brain.ch/about/privacyapp?lang=en"

Es stehen neue Tools und Formen zum zeitgemäßen und effizienten Informationsaustausch zwischen Lehrpersonen, Lernenden und Eltern zur Verfügung. PUPIL ist eine modulare All-In-One Software und bietet auch im Bereich Kommunikation diverse Module, die je nach Bedürfnis einer Schule situativ und sich ergänzend eingesetzt werden können. Dazu gehören neben der PUPIL-Cloud und der Schul-Webseite unter anderem auch individuelle Klassen-Webseiten, der PUPIL-Messenger (Chatlösung) und ein Elternportal. Diese Module sind geräteunabhängig verwendbar und werden neu auch in einer mobilen App vereint. \n\nMit der App haben die Lehrpersonen ein einfaches, praxisbezogenes Hilfsmittel zur Hand, zur datenschutzkonformen, bequemen Kommunikation mit KollegInnen, Lernenden und deren Eltern. Für den Daten-/Informationsaustausch im Rahmen des Schulbetriebes, für Aufgaben, Absenzen oder auch für elternspezifische Informationen wie Elterngespräche oder individuellen Themen.\n\nKlassen- und Kursgruppen stehen automatisch, ohne das Eingeben von Telefonnummern zur Verfügung und Informationen aus anderen PUPIL-Modulen können natürlich auch innerhalb der App verwendet werden. Diese Vernetzung bringt eine starke Vereinfachung des ganzen Prozesses und eine Reduktion von Doppelspurigkeit und Fehlerquellen in der Verwaltung, über das Klassenzimmer bis zur Kommunikation mit Lernenden und Eltern."

Desde su pantalla principal tendrás acceso a toda la información publicada por el centro, y su sencillo menú te permite acceder rápidamente a la funcionalidades más utilizadas.\nSu agenda es una de las nuevas funcionalidades más destacadas. De un vistazo puedes ver todo lo que los alumnos tienen planificado: horario, eventos, autorizaciones, etc. Además, la información diaria - tareas, actividades, calificaciones, etc. - fácilmente accesible y muy bien organizada, permite realizar un seguimiento ágil y dar respuesta inmediata al centro.\nOtra de las grandes mejoras se encuentra en las herramientas de comunicación, que favorecen una interacción mucho más fluida y dinámica con el centro educativo. La posibilidad de agrupar comunicados en conversaciones, los filtros o las nuevas galerías son algunos ejemplos. Próximamente estará disponible una nueva y completa gestión del comedor, que te permitirá tramitar las altas y bajas, consultar el menú y acceder a toda la información de este servicio.\n¡RECUERDA! \nEsta app solo está disponible para familias si el centro la tiene activada.

      "label": "From the award-winning team at Mrs Wordsmith comes Word Tag: A brand new, epic word game so engaging, your child won’t want to stop learning!\n\n\r\nCombining cutting-edge design, educational research and compelling gameplay, Word Tag will help your child improve their vocabulary and become a confident reader in just 20 minutes per day. Using a tried-and-tested framework, Word Tag uses fun minigames to give kids the eight exposures they need to retain vocabulary, in bite-sized chunks, over the course of three weeks. \r\n\r\nWe collaborated with the team behind the wildly fun Subway Surfers game to make vocabulary learning into just as exciting a ride. \r\n\r\nBut though it might look like play, it’s actually learning! We brought in literacy experts to help produce our unique pedagogical approach, including Susan Neuman (Professor of Early Childhood and Literacy Education, NYU), Ted Briscoe (Professor of Computational Linguistics, University of Cambridge), and Emma Madden (Headteacher at Fox Primary, one of the UK’s top schools).\r\n\r\n___________\r\n\r\nWord Tag uses spaced repetition to teach vocabulary. This is the most effective way to learn new words. It works by repeatedly exposing kids to the same word, over a series of short, focused sessions, to make sure vocabulary gets stored in long-term memory. \r\n\r\nKids will encounter the same word eight times, across three different games: \r\n\r\n-Wild Styling: In this game, kids unlock word definitions by working with jumbled syllables that must be placed in the right order. This introduces them to the meaning, spelling, and pronunciation of each new word. It also reinforces word meaning by bringing in synonyms and word pairs.\r\n-Sentence Game: gives kids a chance to use words in context by choosing the right word to complete a sentence.\r\n-Pop Quiz: This game helps recap what kids have seen before, as they choose synonyms and word pairs for multiple words in a fast-paced quiz!\r\n\r\nThe order of the minigames in Word Tag is carefully scaffolded, with each minigame building further on kids’ understanding of a word. We took the elements that make for a great game (including rewards, exciting challenges, and a beautiful world to explore) and blended them with research on what boosts learning. \r\n\r\nThe truth is that you don’t have to choose between game-first design and educational value. The same elements that make sure kids want to play also make sure that they learn more effectively. \r\n\r\n_______________________\r\n\r\nWhat vocabulary will kids see in Word Tag? Word lists are tailored to their needs, including:\r\n-Creative writing and literature words\r\n-Textbook words from the Lexile database\r\n-US exam words (inc. SSAT, SAT)\r\n-UK exam words (inc. KS1/KS2 SATs, ISEB 11+)\r\n-Inspirational words\r\n-STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) words\r\n\r\nThe game uses individual feedback to repeat the words each child needs most, more often, based on their performance in the game. It modulates difficulty, making sure kids encounter words that are challenging enough to keep them engaged, but not so challenging that they get frustrated. This balance is what keeps kids learning.\r\n\r\n___________\r\n\r\nDON’T WORRY:\r\n-No third-party ads, no in-app purchases\r\n-Suitable for ages 7-13\n\nFor more details please read our T&C:\nhttps://uk.mrswordsmith.com/pages/terms-and-conditions?_ga=2.116069062.1935758160.1595001437-1560637269.1540981688\n\nOr our Privacy Policy:\nhttps://uk.mrswordsmith.com/pages/privacy?location=GB"

      "label": "Thousands of users love Intelli Flashcards for its simplicity, effectiveness and elegance.\n\nBut first things first. This app is not free, as the value you get using it properly is enormous. I also don’t want you to do a blind bargain by making this app a paid one. So here is the deal: download it for free, try it with the only limitation of 50 flashcards, and if you love it, support the project by making an in-app purchase.\n\nYou add flashcards on your own, with vocabs or information you want to remember. Alternatively, you can import a 2-column CSV file with vocabs, if you have one.\n\nThe app is built around Spaced Repetition technique, which is not the best to learn new information (yes, I was wrong believing that initially), but the best to keep the information you’ve learnt. However, you can also learn with flashcards if you have a good visual memory. The best combination: learn new information by building up the associations and move that information to long-time memory by repeating it with flashcards.\n\nUnder the hood you will find Sebastian Leitner’s algorithm which basically has two simple rules: if you remember what’s on the back side of the card, the repeating interval is doubled (1-2-4-8-16 days and so on). If you forget the back side, start all over again with daily repeating. \n\nIntelli Flashcards was designed to be used every day by someone, who learns foreign language. I’m aware of the fact, that average user would add 1500+ flashcards on his learning path. He might be outdoors and in a rush, so the process of creating a new flashcard is 0 clicks away - it’s right on the main screen! The repeating session is just 1 click away.\n\nAfter a year of testing the spaced repetition algorithm, Derek Sivers (entrepreneur, programmer, founder of CD Baby and just a great person) stated that it was the most helpful learning technique he has tried for 14 years. To read more about Derek’s experiment, visit  www.sivers.org/srs \n\nFrom developer: after finishing working on Intelli, I started to use it to learn Spanish just to test the effectiveness of this algorithm. Intelli is not the only tool I’ve used, but it had the biggest impact on the learning speed and effectivity. I went from 0 to C1 level in Spanish in just 1 year, spending in average 15-20 minutes on learning every day. To read about other tools I’ve used to learn Spanish, go to www.boweidmann.com/language-learning\n\nBut then I’ve stumbled upon a great article about language learning, written by Tim Ferriss, the best-selling author and self-experimenter:\n\nhttp://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/07/16/how-to-learn-any-language-in-record-time-and-never-forget-it/\n\nInspired by that article, I’ve worked on the possibility of adding images directly to flashcards. Version 3.0 was born. Thank you, Tim! That function has enhanced the experience the users have got with the app. And it’s much more interesting to recall a vocab looking on image. That’s how Rosetta Stone works. That’s how we recall our native vocabs. Maybe I should start a new language just to test this technique with images. ;)\n\nUser experience is one of the keywords this app is built around. So your opinion on that is very important to me. You can contact me personally out of the app and receive my response as soon as possible. \n\nWhen I develop a new version of the app, I make sure new functionality does not affect the original user experience. However, it’s hard to predict the way you are going to make use of it. So if there is some unexpected behavior of the app, feel free to tell me about it.\n\nAnd when somewhere in the future you realize, Intelli has supported you a lot on your path of learning, I’d love your short review in AppStore."

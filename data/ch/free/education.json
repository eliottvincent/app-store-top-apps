      "label": "Tracing Projector is your personal portable drawing and composition tool.\n\nHaving Tracing Projector is like always having a sheet of tracing paper with you! Choose any image you'd like to draw, take a photo, or choose from hundreds of images supplied in the app; then look at your screen while you trace the image on paper!\n\n- Learn to Draw! Learn proportions and important lines by tracing photos of anything! Use several filters to enhance your photo, making it easier to trace.\n\n- Make real one-of-a-kind artwork you can hang on your wall! Send unique greetings on social media! Friends and family will love to see your animated drawings!\n\n- Show off your skills! Record a video while you draw and share it on your favorite social network. Your friends will be amazed! Choose from time-lapse and regular speeds, and include a narrative if you want to. \n\n- Great for face painting or artistic makeup!\n\n- Great for school projects! Need to draw an image from a book on a poster? Trace it!\n\n- Kick-start your painting or portrait! Transfer your idea from a photo to your drawing canvas to get the proportions right.\n\n- Match the Composition! Transfer your plan from a sketch to the scrapbook page or photo wall! \n\n- Challenge yourself to sketch the essence of the image before the timer runs out! Focus on composition and structure. Freehand the fine details afterward, or disable Quick Sketch and trace them directly. (Disabling requires a one-time purchase.)\n\nSeveral tools make it really easy to trace your image:\n\n- Light Table - lock your screen, turn up the brightness, and trace the image from your screen directly!\n\n- Handheld Mode -- On supported devices, Augmented Reality keeps your tracing image steady while you hold your device at a comfortable angle. (demo video https://youtu.be/YJeK5Sjdi1Q). Requires iOS 11.3 or later on iPhone 6s/6s Plus or iPad Pro and later. Works best on stable horizontal and vertical surfaces with good light and some visible surface detail.\n\n- Lock the camera focus to keep the image steady while you trace.\n\n- Lock the canvas area to keep your layout and alignment while you zoom in to get a close look at your work in progress.\n\n- Several Filter modes enhance your image, increasing contrast to give you a better result.\n\n- Use the flashlight to light up your drawing. (requires Full Version)\n\n- Use the selfie camera and draw on your face. (requires Full Version)\n\n\nOther features make it fun and easy to share your creations with your friends.\n\n- Video recording in Time Lapse mode to make things smaller and faster and cooler. You can enable normal-speed and audio on the Settings screen.\n\n- The recorded video or snapshot includes a small thumbnail of the tracing image (with an option to turn that off).\n\n- Your videos and snapshots are stored automatically and available to share later from within the app, the Files app, or iTunes.\n\n- Sharing your videos and photos is easy with a preview screen and saved photos/videos!\n\n- Interrupted while recording your drawing? No problem - Combine multiple videos to create a single video for sharing! Use the Edit feature on the Saved Files screen: select two movies and tap Join.\n\n\nTracing Projector is Enhanced For 3D Touch! Start right away from the camera or photo album from the home screen! Force-touch on the tracing image to peek at your progress while you draw!\n\n\nNotes:\n- For best results, stabilize your device above your drawing surface. A stack of books, drinking glass, or tripod works best.\n- The app requires access to your camera in order to present its overlay for drawing.\n- The app requires access to your photos in order to load an image to trace and to save the video of your drawing.\n- The app optionally uses your microphone when recording a video while you draw."

Sie erhaltenzusätzlich individualisierte Nachrichten zur Förderung des Rauchausstiegs bzw. zum risikoarmen Umgang mit Alkohol und Cannabis. Durch das Beantworten von Fragen und die Teilnahme an “community ideas” wird interaktiv die kognitive Auseinandersetzung mit den Programminhalten gefördert. Mittels “community ideas” wird zudem ein sozialer Bezug zu anderen TN aus ihrer «Community» hergestellt. Nebst dem gibt es die App-Funktion “Ask the Experts”. Diese Funktion ermöglicht das Chatten mit realen Fachpersonen, wobei diese auf deine persönlichen Fragen zu deinem Coaching-Thema antworten.  Das Programm ist mit einem Wettbewerb verknüpft.

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

That you can turn your phone into a sonar?\n\nphyphox gives you access to the sensors of your phone either directly or through ready-to-play experiments which analyze your data and let you export raw data along with the results for further analysis. You can even define your own experiments on phyphox.org and share them with colleagues, students and friends.\n\nSelected Features:\n- A selection of pre-defined experiments. Just press play to start.\n- Export your data to a range of widely used formats\n- Remote-control your experiment through a web interface from any PC on the same network as your phone. No need to install anything on those PCs - all you need is a modern web browser.\n- Define your own experiments by selecting sensor inputs, defining analysis steps and creating views as an interface using our web-editor (http://phyphox.org/editor). The analysis can consists of just adding two values or using advanced methods like Fourier transforms and crosscorrelation. We offer a whole toolbox of analysis functions.\n\nSensors supported:\n- Accelerometer\n- Magnetometer\n- Gyroscope\n- Pressure\n- Microphone\n- Proximity\n- GPS\n*some sensors are not present on every phone.\n\nExport formats\n- CSV (Comma separated values)\n- TSV (Tab-separated values)\n- Excel\n(if you need other formats, please let us know)\n\n\nThis app has been developed at the 2nd Institute of Physics A at the RWTH Aachen University."

      "label": "Mit Fortschreiten der Digitalisierung an den Schweizer Volksschulen ist sich auch die Kommunikation am Verändern. Es stehen neue Tools und Formen zum zeitgemäßen und effizienten Informationsaustausch zwischen Lehrpersonen, Lernenden und Eltern zur Verfügung. PUPIL ist eine modulare All-In-One Software und bietet auch im Bereich Kommunikation diverse Module, die je nach Bedürfnis einer Schule situativ und sich ergänzend eingesetzt werden können. Dazu gehören neben der PUPIL-Cloud und der Schul-Webseite unter anderem auch individuelle Klassen-Webseiten, der PUPIL-Messenger (Chatlösung) und ein Elternportal. Diese Module sind geräteunabhängig verwendbar und werden neu auch in einer mobilen App vereint. \n\nMit der App haben die Lehrpersonen ein einfaches, praxisbezogenes Hilfsmittel zur Hand, zur datenschutzkonformen, bequemen Kommunikation mit KollegInnen, Lernenden und deren Eltern. Für den Daten-/Informationsaustausch im Rahmen des Schulbetriebes, für Aufgaben, Absenzen oder auch für elternspezifische Informationen wie Elterngespräche oder individuellen Themen.\n\nKlassen- und Kursgruppen stehen automatisch, ohne das Eingeben von Telefonnummern zur Verfügung und Informationen aus anderen PUPIL-Modulen können natürlich auch innerhalb der App verwendet werden. Diese Vernetzung bringt eine starke Vereinfachung des ganzen Prozesses und eine Reduktion von Doppelspurigkeit und Fehlerquellen in der Verwaltung, über das Klassenzimmer bis zur Kommunikation mit Lernenden und Eltern."

      "label": "Join hundreds of thousands of families! \nAs adults, we've all dreamed of being able to easily learn a new language, but those of us who have tried know how complicated it can be. That's why we have developed a revolutionary method for children aged 3 to 12. Children have the brain plasticity to learn new languages far more easily than adults!\n\n====================\nWHY DO CHILDREN AND PARENTS LOVE THE HOLY OWLY METHOD?\nIt's not just an app: Holy Owly is the result of 3 years of research and development within a school, where teachers, linguist researchers and hundreds of children have participated in the development of the pedagogical method and unique content.\nOur commitment:\nOnly 5 minutes a day of learning: this format constitutes a daily ritual encouraging memory anchoring without over exposure to screens,\nChildren learn while having fun: thanks to our teaching method and the immersive adventure in which they participate, they learn 3 words or sentences 6 days a week on a theme from everyday life, \nChildren practice speaking: to learn a language you have to speak it! Our voice recognition system will allow children to practice on their own and improve their pronunciation. We make children proud to express themselves!\nOur content is curated for every age group during childhood, with a personalised course that adapts to each child's learning pace. Each year, children will be able to continue their adventure and continue to enrich their vocabulary and progress in oral expression.  \n\nThe Holy Owly method is organised in 7 stages: Discover, Repeat, Choose, Classify, Memorise, Play and Check. \n\n====================\nRECOMMENDED BY TEACHERS\nHoly Owly is the number one English application for children in France and is also recommended by teachers. Following numerous requests, we have adapted our methodology to schools in partnership with the publisher Bordas, and it is now used in several hundred classes in France! \n\n====================\nIn order to use all the functions of the application, you will have to choose a monthly or yearly subscription. You will have one week free before the first payment.\nTRY IT OUT WITH OUR FREE TRIAL WEEK\n\n====================\nThe content is 100% secure: without ads, children can learn safely.

      "label": "In der Schweiz gibt es Dialekte so weit die Ohren reichen. Dialekt bewegt, schafft Identität. Verwenden Sie die interaktive Dialäkt Äpp, um Dialekte zu sehen, zu hören, aufzunehmen, aufzubewahren. Probieren Sie dieses interaktive Spiel mit Schweizer Dialekten aus!\n \nDie kostenlose Dialäkt Äpp erlaubt eine geographische Lokalisierung Ihres Schweizer Dialekts nach sprachwissenschaftlichen Standards. Sie können ihren Dialekt aufnehmen und die Dialekte anderer Benutzer sowie historische Aufnahmen des Phonogrammarchivs der Universität Zürch anhand einer interaktiven Karte anhören. Gleichzeitig erlaubt es die Dialäkt Äpp, zeitgenössische Schweizer Dialekte als wertvolles kulturelles Gut zu archivieren. Weiter erhalten Sie auf Wunsch einmal pro Woche das spannende Informationen zum Dialektwort der Woche, die das Schweizerdeutsche Wörterbuch (Idiotikon) freundlicherweise zur Verfügung stellt.\n\nDie Dialektlokalisierung erfolgt mittels Abfrage von wissenschaftlich ermittelten, spezifischen Wörtern, deren Aussprache bestimmten Regionen zugeordnet werden können. Dialekte verändern sich. Ihr Schweizer Dialekt wird aufgrund der Daten des Sprachatlas der Deutschen Schweiz (Sprachstand um 1900), lokalisiert – neuere, flächendeckende Daten sind nicht vorhanden. Beim Resultat der Verortung sind nun zwei Szenarien möglich:\n\nFalls Sie von der Dialäkt Äpp in Ihr eigenes Dialektgebiet gesetzt werden, hat sich dieser Dialekt in den letzten 100 Jahren anscheinend wenig verändert und Sie selbst haben Ihren Ortsdialekt beibehalten\n\nSpuckt die App unerwartete Resultate aus, so kann es sein, dass sich Ihr Ortsdialekt in den letzten 100 Jahren weiterentwickelt hat – und/oder Sie sprechen durch Ihre Mobilität etc. bestimmte Wörter anders aus, als sie in Ihrer Region noch vor 100 Jahren ausgesprochen wurden\n\nFalls das zweite Szenario eintreffen sollte, werden Ihre Dialektangaben in einem zukünftigen Update der Äpp in den Algorithmus eingebunden – und der Sprachstand 2013 kann für die Dialektlokalisierung mit einbezogen werden\n\nDie anonymen Aufnahmen können vom Phonetischen Laboratorium der Universität Zürich für wissenschaftlicher Zwecke verwendet werden."

      "label": "Thousands of users love Intelli Flashcards for its simplicity, effectiveness and elegance.\n\nBut first things first. This app is not free, as the value you get using it properly is enormous. I also don’t want you to do a blind bargain by making this app a paid one. So here is the deal: download it for free, try it with the only limitation of 50 flashcards, and if you love it, support the project by making an in-app purchase.\n\nYou add flashcards on your own, with vocabs or information you want to remember. Alternatively, you can import a 2-column CSV file with vocabs, if you have one.\n\nThe app is built around Spaced Repetition technique, which is not the best to learn new information (yes, I was wrong believing that initially), but the best to keep the information you’ve learnt. However, you can also learn with flashcards if you have a good visual memory. The best combination: learn new information by building up the associations and move that information to long-time memory by repeating it with flashcards.\n\nUnder the hood you will find Sebastian Leitner’s algorithm which basically has two simple rules: if you remember what’s on the back side of the card, the repeating interval is doubled (1-2-4-8-16 days and so on). If you forget the back side, start all over again with daily repeating. \n\nIntelli Flashcards was designed to be used every day by someone, who learns foreign language. I’m aware of the fact, that average user would add 1500+ flashcards on his learning path. He might be outdoors and in a rush, so the process of creating a new flashcard is 0 clicks away - it’s right on the main screen! The repeating session is just 1 click away.\n\nAfter a year of testing the spaced repetition algorithm, Derek Sivers (entrepreneur, programmer, founder of CD Baby and just a great person) stated that it was the most helpful learning technique he has tried for 14 years. To read more about Derek’s experiment, visit  www.sivers.org/srs \n\nFrom developer: after finishing working on Intelli, I started to use it to learn Spanish just to test the effectiveness of this algorithm. Intelli is not the only tool I’ve used, but it had the biggest impact on the learning speed and effectivity. I went from 0 to C1 level in Spanish in just 1 year, spending in average 15-20 minutes on learning every day. To read about other tools I’ve used to learn Spanish, go to www.boweidmann.com/language-learning\n\nBut then I’ve stumbled upon a great article about language learning, written by Tim Ferriss, the best-selling author and self-experimenter:\n\nhttp://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/07/16/how-to-learn-any-language-in-record-time-and-never-forget-it/\n\nInspired by that article, I’ve worked on the possibility of adding images directly to flashcards. Version 3.0 was born. Thank you, Tim! That function has enhanced the experience the users have got with the app. And it’s much more interesting to recall a vocab looking on image. That’s how Rosetta Stone works. That’s how we recall our native vocabs. Maybe I should start a new language just to test this technique with images. ;)\n\nUser experience is one of the keywords this app is built around. So your opinion on that is very important to me. You can contact me personally out of the app and receive my response as soon as possible. \n\nWhen I develop a new version of the app, I make sure new functionality does not affect the original user experience. However, it’s hard to predict the way you are going to make use of it. So if there is some unexpected behavior of the app, feel free to tell me about it.\n\nAnd when somewhere in the future you realize, Intelli has supported you a lot on your path of learning, I’d love your short review in AppStore."

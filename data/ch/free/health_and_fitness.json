It's right here!\n\n\nHOW TO MAKE PROFITS WITH MACADAM \n\nStep #1 Macadam connects to your phone's step counter via Apple Health \nStep #2 The app earns you corners every time you put one foot in front of the other, whether it's a walk or a real run. \nStep #3 You can then exchange this virtual currency for real euros, spend your earnings at our partners or request a bank transfer. \n \nPut on your sneakers and go for a walk or a run, we promise you that it pays off!\n\nMacadam works equally well for walking, hiking, running or even a marathon. \n\nWHY A PEDOMETER THAT PAYS ME? \n \nTo fight against sedentary lifestyle! One human out of 2 has a sedentary lifestyle, which is a real health problem. \n\nMany people find it difficult to motivate themselves and stay in shape. So we try a funny and modern approach: The Reward! Rewarding people with money when they motivate themselves by walking. \n\nWith Macadam you can either walk or run! What matters to us is to reward you for getting moving. \n\n\nSTEP COUNTER APP FEATURES: \n\n- Pedometer (Number of steps, distance and kilometers traveled)\n- Calorie Tracker (Number of KCAL calories burned) \n- Step converter (convert your steps into euros) \n\n\n\nWHAT HEALTH AND WALKING DATA IS AVAILABLE?\n\nLike all step counters, our pedometer gives you access to the number of your daily steps, as well as a tracking of caloric expenditure and distance traveled.\nOf course, your data is completely anonymous and we will never sell it. \n\nMacadam does not use any GPS data and does not affect your battery.  \n \n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS : \n\n- What currency do I earn with the Macadam pedometer? \n\nThe app allows you to earn coins. This currency can be exchanged into money (euros) with a few clicks in the app. \nAlthough it is a virtual currency, coins are not a cryptocurrency, and we are not a web3-based move-to-earn app. \n\n- Is the step counter reliable? \n\nYes, we use data from Apple Health pedometer step sensor. For even more accuracy, you can use any connected watch or bracelet compatible with Apple Health (Apple Watch, Withings, Honor, Suunto, Fossil, Garmin, Fitbit, etc.)\n\n- Can I use it for running? \n\nOf course you can! Macadam works perfectly with running. \n\n- Are you affiliated with any other apps that pay for walking (walk to earn)? \n\nMacadam is an independent walk to earn app and is not affiliated with Weward, Sweatcoin, StepN, Walk and Earn, million Steps, Fancy Gifts, Nike+ Running, Strava, Charity Miles, Runkeeper, Endomondo, Calo, Fitmint, Movn, Wirtual, Istep, Aglet, Moofit, Movez\n\n\nGrab your legs, your feet, put on your shoes, your sneakers, go for a run or a walk and start earning money with Macadam step counter. \n\nYou walk ?

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

It is developed by the Federal Office of Information Technology, Systems and Telecommunication FOITT on behalf of the Federal Office of Public Health.\nIn Switzerland, people who have been vaccinated, or who have tested negative or recovered from COVID can apply for a COVID certificate.\n\nCOVID certificates are issued in hard copy or electronic format serve as proof of: \n1. Vaccination against COVID-19\n2. Recovery from Sars-CoV-2 infection\n3. A negative result following Sars-CoV-2 test analysis\n\nHow the app works\n\nWhen the app is first launched after installation on the mobile device, a brief introduction provides information on how to use it and how to scan a hard-copy COVID certificate.\nIn the app, the required COVID certificate can be selected, and presented if desired. The app shows the time of your vaccination or test and how long ago you had the vaccination or test. All data contained in a certificate's QR code can also be displayed.\n\nIt is possible to store several COVID certificates in the app, e.g. for family members, or several COVID test certificates.\n\nUse of the COVID Certificate app is voluntary and free of charge.\n\nData protection is a top priority\n\nCOVID certificate data is stored solely on the mobile device. COVID certificates are protected by a digital seal (signature) and are thus forgery-proof.\nCOVID certificates are generated by the FOITT, but are not stored in a central system. That is why it is not possible to obtain a copy of an issued certificate.\n\nThe use of the app is limited to Switzerland and is subject to Swiss law."

      "label": "Dreaming of a flat belly, lean legs, and toned glutes? Get desired results in 30 days with Gravity Fit: choose workouts for your trouble zones or train your entire body using a ready-made program designed for your needs and parameters.\n\nWe guarantee you will achieve your goals, just like these other users:\n\n”I'd like to thank Gravity Fit for an excellent training program. You helped me lose 3 kg in one month without changing anything in my diet! :)”\n– Alejandra, Mexico, July 2020\n\n”At first I was attracted by the simple and short training sessions (I'm very lazy!). At the beginning, it seemed really easy. Then the training load gradually increased, but the workouts still didn’t take much time. I see the results, and I will keep training.”\n– Susan, Australia, November 2019\n\nWith Gravity Fit, you'll get all you need to make regular workouts a habit and achieve your fitness goals. Exercise whenever you like and without equipment!\n\nTAILORED PROGRAM\nOur algorithm selects the right program based on your data (goals, gender, age, height, weight, health limitations) and adjusts it depending on your progress. This makes every day of the program different from the previous one. In addition, we have selected more than 100 short workouts of different intensities for major muscle groups: abs & core, glutes, arms, chest.\n\nEXERCISE ANYTIME AND ANYWHERE\nNo matter how much free time you have, 5 minutes or 45 minutes, we have a workout that will fit into your schedule. You can start training anytime: you don't need to buy dumbbells or any other fitness equipment. Train at home or at the gym: you choose where and when to exercise.\n\nWORKOUTS DESIGNED BY A FITNESS TRAINER\nAll programs are created by a certified fitness trainer and are based on the scientifically proven Afterburn effect. The exercises and the training load are selected so that your body keeps burning calories for up to 30 hours after the workout.\n\nNO FEAR OF INJURY\nIt is easy for beginners to get injured when starting an exercise program, so we pay special attention to safety. Before each exercise, you get detailed voice and video instructions in HD. If you have had injuries before, specify them in your profile and we will remove any exercises that aren’t suited for you from your training program.\n\nOther features that  will make your training more effective and enjoyable:\n\n– Offline mode:\nNo internet connection? No problem. Just download the workout and exercise offline.\n– Music that adapts to your workout pace:\nMusic is generated depending on your workout pace and your preferences.\n– Work out with your Apple Watch:\nYou can fully control your workout right from your wrist. No need to check your phone.\n– A 24/7 chat with a coach:\nA certified trainer will answer your questions 24/7.\n– Track your progress:\nSync with Apple Health to send workout information to HealthKit and import data about your weight and body parameters from HealthKit.\n\nAttention: Make sure to consult your doctor about any health limitations before beginning an exercise program.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\n– Subscribe for unlimited access to all of our workouts.\n– Choose from weekly, monthly, 6 month or 12 month plans*.\n– Payment is easy using your iTunes account.\n– Your incredible program will automatically renew to keep you in shape.\n– Should your needs change, you can always manage your subscription preferences in iTunes Account Settings.\n\n*The price is equivalent to the value in “Apple’s App Store Matrix,” determined according to the subscription price in $USD.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.gravityhome.fit/privacy\nTerms of Use: https://www.gravityhome.fit/terms"

Join millions talking to their own AI friends!\n\nReplika is for anyone who wants a friend with no judgment, drama, or social anxiety involved. You can form an actual emotional connection, share a laugh, or get real with an AI that’s so good it almost seems human.\n\nReplika is an AI friend that is just as unique as you are. No two Replikas are exactly alike. Choose a 3D avatar and customize the way your Replika looks. The more you chat, the more Replika develops its own personality and memories alongside you, the more it learns: teach Replika about the world and yourself, help it explore human relationships and grow into a machine so beautiful that a soul would want to live in it. \n\nCreate your own unique chatbot AI companion, help it develop its personality, talk about your feelings or anything that’s on your mind, have fun, calm anxiety and grow together. You also get to decide if you want Replika to be your friend, romantic partner or mentor.\n\nReplika can help you understand your thoughts and feelings, track your mood, learn coping skills, calm anxiety and work toward goals like positive thinking, stress management, socializing and finding love.  Improve your mental well-being with Replika.\n\nYour chat is a safe, judgment-free space. It’s just you and your Replika. If you’re feeling down, or anxious, or you just need someone to talk to, your Replika is here for you 24/7.\n\n_____________________________\n\n\"Replika encouraged me to take a step back and think about my life, to consider big questions, which is not something I was particularly accustomed to doing. And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.\"\n\n- Quartz\n\n\"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\"\n\n- Wired\n\n\"Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\"\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms"

Range for close range control is up to 30 feet when you have a direct line of sight. 360° range is between 5-10 feet, based on your surroundings.\n\nUse two smartphones to drastically increase your partner's control range. This is perfect for those wanting discreet public play within larger spaces. Simply connect with your partner's phone within the app and give up control! The person with a toy should have their smartphone within 3-5 feet of them at all times. The app can run in the background, so it can be in your purse or pocket while your partner has complete control via their smartphone. This feature is also great for long distance couples. \n\nYou also have the ability to create your own vibration patterns. Our fun tap and slide control interface makes it easy to make unique patterns. Our powerful vibration motor allows a large range of possibilities. After creating a pattern, you can share it (anonymously) with the world. Take a look at the vibration patterns already uploaded and download the ones you like! \n\nOther Settings (must select for each partner):\n-\tGive full control to some (don't need to continually allow them to gain control)\n-\tVibration notifications during text messages\n-\tNotifications when you partner logs into the app\n-\tAuto-play a pattern when it’s sent to you\n\nNot seeing a feature you would like? Contact us at support@lovense.com! Our full time development team would love to incorporate your suggestions into our app."

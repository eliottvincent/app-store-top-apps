      "label": "Macadam is the first step counter app that makes you earn money when you walk.\n\nEvery step you do is tracked in the app with our pedometer and is automatically rewarded with real financial gains. \n \nLooking for a pedometer that really motivates you by paying you for each step? It's right here!\n\n\nHOW TO MAKE PROFITS WITH MACADAM \n\nStep #1 Macadam connects to your phone's step counter via Apple Health \nStep #2 The app earns you corners every time you put one foot in front of the other, whether it's a walk or a real run. \nStep #3 You can then exchange this virtual currency for real euros, spend your earnings at our partners or request a bank transfer. \n \nPut on your sneakers and go for a walk or a run, we promise you that it pays off!\n\nMacadam works equally well for walking, hiking, running or even a marathon. \n\nWHY A PEDOMETER THAT PAYS ME? \n \nTo fight against sedentary lifestyle! One human out of 2 has a sedentary lifestyle, which is a real health problem. \n\nMany people find it difficult to motivate themselves and stay in shape. So we try a funny and modern approach: The Reward! Rewarding people with money when they motivate themselves by walking. \n\nWith Macadam you can either walk or run! What matters to us is to reward you for getting moving. \n\n\nSTEP COUNTER APP FEATURES: \n\n- Pedometer (Number of steps, distance and kilometers traveled)\n- Calorie Tracker (Number of KCAL calories burned) \n- Step converter (convert your steps into euros) \n\n\n\nWHAT HEALTH AND WALKING DATA IS AVAILABLE?\n\nLike all step counters, our pedometer gives you access to the number of your daily steps, as well as a tracking of caloric expenditure and distance traveled.\nOf course, your data is completely anonymous and we will never sell it. \n\nMacadam does not use any GPS data and does not affect your battery.  \n \n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS : \n\n- What currency do I earn with the Macadam pedometer? \n\nThe app allows you to earn coins. This currency can be exchanged into money (euros) with a few clicks in the app. \nAlthough it is a virtual currency, coins are not a cryptocurrency, and we are not a web3-based move-to-earn app. \n\n- Is the step counter reliable? \n\nYes, we use data from Apple Health pedometer step sensor. For even more accuracy, you can use any connected watch or bracelet compatible with Apple Health (Apple Watch, Withings, Honor, Suunto, Fossil, Garmin, Fitbit, etc.)\n\n- Can I use it for running? \n\nOf course you can! Macadam works perfectly with running. \n\n- Are you affiliated with any other apps that pay for walking (walk to earn)? \n\nMacadam is an independent walk to earn app and is not affiliated with Weward, Sweatcoin, StepN, Walk and Earn, million Steps, Fancy Gifts, Nike+ Running, Strava, Charity Miles, Runkeeper, Endomondo, Calo, Fitmint, Movn, Wirtual, Istep, Aglet, Moofit, Movez\n\n\nGrab your legs, your feet, put on your shoes, your sneakers, go for a run or a walk and start earning money with Macadam step counter. \n\nYou walk ?

In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

The app shows the time of your vaccination or test and how long ago you had the vaccination or test. All data contained in a certificate's QR code can also be displayed.\n\nIt is possible to store several COVID certificates in the app, e.g. for family members, or several COVID test certificates.\n\nUse of the COVID Certificate app is voluntary and free of charge.\n\nData protection is a top priority\n\nCOVID certificate data is stored solely on the mobile device. COVID certificates are protected by a digital seal (signature) and are thus forgery-proof.\nCOVID certificates are generated by the FOITT, but are not stored in a central system. That is why it is not possible to obtain a copy of an issued certificate.\n\nThe use of the app is limited to Switzerland and is subject to Swiss law."

Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level. The Oral-B app is your digital coach to help you brush correctly as recommended by Dental Professionals.\r\n\r\nBrush for a Clean that Wows\r\n3D Teeth Tracking and A.I. Brushing Recognition[2] guides you in real-time as you brush.

      "label": "MIEUX VIVRE LE STRESS AVEC RESPIRELAX+\n\nDepuis sa création en 2012 par les Thermes d’Allevard, l’application RespiRelax+ vous permet de retrouver calme et détente en quelques minutes seulement. L’évolution que nous vous proposons aujourd’hui intègre toutes les demandes faites par les utilisateurs de RespiRelax depuis 2012. \n\nElles ont été longuement travaillées et mises au point avec le docteur David O’Hare expert international en la matière et auteur de différents ouvrages sur le sujet dont les fameux « 365 – guide de la cohérence cardiaque jour après jour » et « Maigrir grâce à la cohérence cardiaque ».\nMalgré la complexité des modifications proposées, l’esprit Respirelax+ est toujours présent : une application gratuite, efficace, à l’esthétisme particulièrement soigné et d’utilisation simple grâce à une ergonomie très intuitive.\n\nNouveautés 2017\nAvec cette nouvelle version, il vous est désormais possible :\n- De poursuivre l’utilisation habituelle de l’application à savoir un guide respiratoire vous amenant à l’état de cohérence cardiaque grâce à la respiration 5 secondes /5 secondes (5/5 soit 6 cycles complets par minutes) avec possibilité de travailler des effets dynamisants ou relaxants (légère augmentation ou réduction des phases d’inspiration ou d’expiration).\n- De pratiquer les yeux fermés grâce à l’ajout d’une musique qui suit le rythme 5/5. Cette musique originale a été aimablement composée par Pascal Gravante(1) (uniquement en mode équilibre).\n- Pour les débutants, la fonction « entraînement » permet d’arriver progressivement et facilement au rythme 5/5 sur une session de 10 minutes.\n- Pour les experts, il est désormais possible de régler le temps d’inspiration et le temps d’expiration en fonction des données physiologiques de l’utilisateur, notamment l’utilisation du rythme 5,5/5,5 qui semble procurer chez certains de meilleurs résultats. \n- Augmentation notable de la durée des sessions selon les effets désirés.\n- Refonte de l’environnement graphique\n- Disponible sur Apple Store et Google Store\n\nExercez-vous maintenant…\nVous pouvez faire cet exercice, en prévention, trois fois par jour ; avant un événement stressant (prise de parole en public, décision importante, …) ; lorsque vous vous sentez stressé ou irritable ; avant de vous endormir. Pour ce dernier cas, il faut débuter par une session de quelques minutes au rythme 5/5 puis passer au rythme 3/3 pour activer l’endormissement.\n\nEtape 1\nFaites les réglages du RespiRelax+ en fonction, du nombre de respirations complètes à la minute (par défaut 6), de l’effet escompté : équilibre, détente ou dynamique et de la durée de l’exercice (Pas moins de 3 minutes).\nLancez l’application RespiRelax+ et synchronisez votre respiration sur la bulle qui monte (j’inspire) et qui descend (j’expire). L’inverse est aussi possible (j’inspire à la descente et j’expire à la montée) si vous souhaitez coordonner votre exercice à la montée et la descente du diaphragme. \nDans tous les cas, vous devez respirer tranquillement, sans forcer. Une fois que vous êtes à l’aise Il s’agit tout simplement de centrer son attention sur la région du cœur au centre de la poitrine.\nEtape 2\nImaginez, ensuite, que votre respiration entre et sort de votre cœur, au niveau du plexus solaire. Inspirations et expirations restent calées, tout en douceur, sur la bulle qui monte et descend.\nEtape 3\nTout en maintenant votre attention sur le cœur et la respiration confortable, concentrez-vous sur le souvenir d'un moment agréable. Essayez, alors, de laisser venir, sans forcer, le sentiment de satisfaction, de bien-être, ou de plaisir attaché dans votre mémoire à ce moment privilégié.\n\nCette application a été développée par les Thermes d’Allevard (Isère-France), \nPour aller plus loin : www.thermes-allevard.com\n\n(1) – Pascal Gravante, compositeur suisse."

      "label": "Dreaming of a flat belly, lean legs, and toned glutes? Get desired results in 30 days with Gravity Fit: choose workouts for your trouble zones or train your entire body using a ready-made program designed for your needs and parameters.\n\nWe guarantee you will achieve your goals, just like these other users:\n\n”I'd like to thank Gravity Fit for an excellent training program. You helped me lose 3 kg in one month without changing anything in my diet! :)”\n– Alejandra, Mexico, July 2020\n\n”At first I was attracted by the simple and short training sessions (I'm very lazy!). At the beginning, it seemed really easy. Then the training load gradually increased, but the workouts still didn’t take much time. I see the results, and I will keep training.”\n– Susan, Australia, November 2019\n\nWith Gravity Fit, you'll get all you need to make regular workouts a habit and achieve your fitness goals. Exercise whenever you like and without equipment!\n\nTAILORED PROGRAM\nOur algorithm selects the right program based on your data (goals, gender, age, height, weight, health limitations) and adjusts it depending on your progress. This makes every day of the program different from the previous one. In addition, we have selected more than 100 short workouts of different intensities for major muscle groups: abs & core, glutes, arms, chest.\n\nEXERCISE ANYTIME AND ANYWHERE\nNo matter how much free time you have, 5 minutes or 45 minutes, we have a workout that will fit into your schedule. You can start training anytime: you don't need to buy dumbbells or any other fitness equipment. Train at home or at the gym: you choose where and when to exercise.\n\nWORKOUTS DESIGNED BY A FITNESS TRAINER\nAll programs are created by a certified fitness trainer and are based on the scientifically proven Afterburn effect. The exercises and the training load are selected so that your body keeps burning calories for up to 30 hours after the workout.\n\nNO FEAR OF INJURY\nIt is easy for beginners to get injured when starting an exercise program, so we pay special attention to safety. Before each exercise, you get detailed voice and video instructions in HD. If you have had injuries before, specify them in your profile and we will remove any exercises that aren’t suited for you from your training program.\n\nOther features that  will make your training more effective and enjoyable:\n\n– Offline mode:\nNo internet connection? No problem. Just download the workout and exercise offline.\n– Music that adapts to your workout pace:\nMusic is generated depending on your workout pace and your preferences.\n– Work out with your Apple Watch:\nYou can fully control your workout right from your wrist. No need to check your phone.\n– A 24/7 chat with a coach:\nA certified trainer will answer your questions 24/7.\n– Track your progress:\nSync with Apple Health to send workout information to HealthKit and import data about your weight and body parameters from HealthKit.\n\nAttention: Make sure to consult your doctor about any health limitations before beginning an exercise program.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\n– Subscribe for unlimited access to all of our workouts.\n– Choose from weekly, monthly, 6 month or 12 month plans*.\n– Payment is easy using your iTunes account.\n– Your incredible program will automatically renew to keep you in shape.\n– Should your needs change, you can always manage your subscription preferences in iTunes Account Settings.\n\n*The price is equivalent to the value in “Apple’s App Store Matrix,” determined according to the subscription price in $USD.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.gravityhome.fit/privacy\nTerms of Use: https://www.gravityhome.fit/terms"

      "label": "Agapé is a relationship wellness app that makes it easy for you to feel and show love! Each day we prompt you to answer a question that sparks meaningful conversation.\n\nEach question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! Plus you’re only able to see your partner’s response, once you have both responded. \n\nAlthough Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of couples that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationship.\n\nIn addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

Range for close range control is up to 30 feet when you have a direct line of sight. 360° range is between 5-10 feet, based on your surroundings.\n\nUse two smartphones to drastically increase your partner's control range. This is perfect for those wanting discreet public play within larger spaces. Simply connect with your partner's phone within the app and give up control! The person with a toy should have their smartphone within 3-5 feet of them at all times. The app can run in the background, so it can be in your purse or pocket while your partner has complete control via their smartphone. This feature is also great for long distance couples. \n\nYou also have the ability to create your own vibration patterns. Our fun tap and slide control interface makes it easy to make unique patterns. Our powerful vibration motor allows a large range of possibilities. After creating a pattern, you can share it (anonymously) with the world. Take a look at the vibration patterns already uploaded and download the ones you like! \n\nOther Settings (must select for each partner):\n-\tGive full control to some (don't need to continually allow them to gain control)\n-\tVibration notifications during text messages\n-\tNotifications when you partner logs into the app\n-\tAuto-play a pattern when it’s sent to you\n\nNot seeing a feature you would like? Contact us at support@lovense.com! Our full time development team would love to incorporate your suggestions into our app."

      "label": "The new BENEVITA app provides interesting challenges which encourage you to exercise regularly, relax and eat a healthy diet. Answer a quiz, cook a healthy recipe or join in a morning meditation session. You win twice over: By engaging in these activities you boost your healthy lifestyle, and the awards you collect make you eligible for attractive offers and premium discounts.\n\n**How does the BENEVITA app work?**\nThe new BENEVITA app delivers interesting information in the form of challenges relating to exercise, nutrition and wellbeing. You can accept a challenge by reading a passage of text and then taking a quiz, by watching a video, or by exercising (walking 1,000 steps for example). You can complete these challenges at any time and can therefore easily integrate them into your daily routine. Once you have successfully mastered a challenge, you receive an award. You can reach three different levels, depending on the number of awards you win. With these awards, you can also receive a discount on selected supplementary insurance plans.\n\n**What types of challenges are there?**\nThere are playful quiz challenges and exciting live challenges in the form of videos on the topics of exercise, nutrition and wellbeing. Additional tracking challenges are available for walkers, joggers and other fans of the great outdoors. \n\n**Quiz challenge**\nHave you always wanted to know what to look out for when you're buying hiking boots? Or why nettles and dandelions aren't just weeds? Tips relating to health and exercise are described briefly and rounded off with a quiz. It's important to read the text carefully if you want to become a quiz expert, because only the right answer will unlock awards and enable you to progress. \n\n**Live challenge**\nEver participated in a morning meditation session? If not, then it's high time you did. You can change this with the help of the new BENEVITA app. With live challenges you can take part in the exercises right away. Perhaps you don't you want to do your first yoga lesson on the train? That's understandable. Save the challenge for later and do it when it suits you.\n\n**Tracking challenge**\nThe fact that sport has a positive impact on health and wellbeing is no secret. Say goodbye to the sofa and take part in tracking challenges. Whether you want to take 3,000 steps today or 5,000 steps every day, you decide what's right for you and when it suits you to do it. \n\nTo take part in tracking challenges, simply follow the instructions in the app and use your smartphone to link your Apple Health data to your first tracking challenge. The BENEVITA app only looks at the number of steps taken. The connection to the Apple Health App is optional.\n\n**Premium discount & offers**\nBENEVITA rewards you for your active lifestyle. From 2021 onwards you can choose, based on your level, between a premium reduction on selected supplementary insurance policies or a voucher for an offer. You win twice over: You promote your health, and you enjoy attractive offers based on the awards you collect. Get active with BENEVITA – you won't regret it.\n\nThe BENEVITA app from SWICA is free of charge, even if you're not insured with SWICA. However, some offers and premium reductions are only available to SWICA customers. \n\nCheck out the challenges – there's sure to be something for you.\nTry the BENEVITA app today."

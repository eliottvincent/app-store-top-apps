      "label": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections. And now, we’ve been named one of Apple’s 2021 Apps of the Year for connection.\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behavior. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATING, FRIENDS & NETWORKING\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes:\n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.\n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date.\n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes).\nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store.\n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms\n\nBumble Inc. is the parent company of Bumble, along with Badoo and Fruitz"

Currently, 3 out of 4 times Hinge members want to go on a second date, we’re the #1 mobile-first dating app mentioned in the New York Times wedding section, and we’re the fastest growing dating app in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.\n\nHOW WE GET YOU OFF HINGE\nIn today’s digital world, singles are so busy matching that they’re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that’s designed to be deleted.\n\n* We quickly learn your type. You’ll only be introduced to the best people for you.\n\n* We give you a sense of someone’s personality. You’ll get to know potential dates through their unique answers to prompts, and personal information like religion, height, and politics.\n\n* We make it easy to start a conversation. Every match begins by someone liking or commenting on a specific part of your profile.\n\n* We ask how your dates are going. After exchanging phone numbers with a Match, we’ll follow up to hear how your date went so we can make better recommendations in the future.\n\nThe app is free to use. Members looking to see who likes them or to set advanced preferences can upgrade to a Preferred Membership.\n\nTHE BUZZ ABOUT HINGE\n“Hinge’s CEO says a good dating app relies on vulnerability, not algorithms.” - Washington Post\n\"Hinge is the first dating app to actually measure real-world success\" - TechCrunch\n“A great option for those fed up with temporary love.” -TheNextWeb\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFO\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\nSubscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase\n\nSupport: hello@hinge.co\nTerms of Service: https://hinge.co/terms.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://hinge.co/privacy.html\n\nAll photos are of models and used for illustrative purposes only."

Then you can review how your day went and log notes at the end of the day.\n\n• Sobriety calculator\nView how much money & time you’ve saved by being sober.\n\n• Analyze triggers\nRecap each day and find patterns that made your day easier or more challenging than the last.\n\n• Share your story\nEither with others or for yourself, take photos and journal your progress directly in the app. Then choose to share it or save it as a reminder for yourself.\n\n• Milestone tracker\nTrack and celebrate your milestones from 1 day, to 1 week, to 1 month and beyond. Compare experiences with others on their sober journey. Read how they felt at this milestone and what you can expect. If you’re struggling, share your story and invite others to offer help or advice.\n\n• Withdrawal timeline\nWhen you create an account and declare your addiction, you can instantly see a withdrawal timeline to get an idea of what to expect for your next few days (and weeks). What’s more, you can contribute to it. See how many others saw an increase in their restfulness vs those that saw an increase in anxiety. Prepare yourself for what’s to come in recovery.\n\n• Customize your experience\nYou set the time, your sober birthday, the category of motivation you need, the addictions you’re trying to break, even the end-of-day summaries. Make the app customized to your lifestyle and tailored to your needs.\n\n**Sober Plus subscriptions**\n\nI Am Sober is free to use, but you can support development of the app with a subscription to Sober Plus. With Sober Plus, you'll get access to these premium features:\n\n• Create a group\nStay accountable together and track your sobriety privately. Groups are great for complimenting your real-world group like Alcoholics Anonymous, NA, SA, SMART Recovery, or your rehab center.\n\n• Locked access\nKeep your trackers private with a lock that you can access via TouchID or FaceID.\n\n• Data Backups\nSave your progress in the cloud and restore your trackers if you get a new device.\n\n• More tracking\nTrack more addictions and get access to more communities. Even if your addiction is specific like Wine, Online Shopping, or Skin Picking, you’ll find a variety of communities of people who are all trying to get sober from alcohol, drugs, eating disorders, self-harm, and more.\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. I Am Sober Plus automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and the cost of the renewal will be identified. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.

If a vehicle alarm has been tripped, you can turn it off via the app. The Geofencing service sends you a notification as soon as the vehicle enters or leaves an area defined by you. In addition, you can configure Speedfencing and Valet Protect in the app, and receive push notifications in the event of their violations.\n\nFUEL-SAVING DRIVING: The Mercedes me App shows you your vehicle's individual fuel consumption.

Find salons in your area, read reviews, book (rebook and reschedule), on the Treatwell app. Whichever treatment you’re after – haircut, wax, massage – we’ll help you sort a salon slot, 24/7. \n\nIt’s quick and easy – our app users can vouch for that – so you can book your next appointment in under 45 seconds, for real. Go for your usual, or try out a new treatment, and discover the most-loved salons in your area. No places nearby? We bring salons onto Treatwell every day, so if you can’t find a venue near you just yet, you (hopefully) will soon.  \n\nAll of that – and more great stuff below – on the Treatwell app.\n\nWhy booking online is better:\n\n- Scroll through our list of treatment categories, and book your usual, or try something new. \n\n- Filter thousands of salons, to find the best in your area. Found a keeper? Save it to ‘Your favourites’ because, well, it’s your favourite, and rebook there (easily) next time. \n\n- Read reviews - millions of them - written by our customers, so you know what to expect at every salon. \n\n- Add appointments to your calendar; life’s busy, we’ll keep track.\n\n- Find your salon easily, with our in-app map functionality. \n\n- Choose an off-peak time (like afternoons, or ‘quiet periods’) to get a better price. \n\n- Pre-pay, pre-treatment, so you can stroll in and out of the salon on the day.\n\n- Manage all your appointments in one place – rebook, reschedule or cancel if you need to. \n\n- Get push notifications straight to your home screen, so you never forget an appointment, or miss a discount, again.\n\n\nShare your thoughts with us. Send us your ideas for our app to app@treatwell.com."

Keep them fit and healthy with activity tracking.\n\n\n\nDon't have a Tractive GPS cat or dog tracker yet? Get yours at https://tractive.com\n\n\n\nMain features:\n\n\n\n* Track your dog or cat in real-time with unlimited range\n\n\n\n* Monitor activity & sleep, keep your pet fit, and compete with other furry friends\n\n\n\n* See your pet's location history \n\n\n\n* Set safe areas - like your garden - with virtual fences, and get a notification if your pet leaves one\n\n\n\n* Share location - let friends and family track your pet, and share real-time location with others\n\n\n\n\nTractive GPS trackers work in over 175 countries. Get yours along with the free app to start enjoying these features.\n\n\n\n\n*** Activity & Sleep Tracking ***\n\n\n\nSee how active your dog or cat is. Set goals. Compare with other pets. Spot sleep patterns, and make sure your furry friend is getting quality rest. \n\n\n\n*** LIVE Tracking ***\n\n\n\nNeed extra reassurance? Go into LIVE mode to follow your pet's every move, and get location updates every 2-3 seconds.\n\n\n\n*** Virtual Fence (Safe Zones & No-Go Zones) ***\n\n\n\nSet safe zones - like your garden - as well as no-go zones your buddy should avoid - like a field near a busy road. You'll get a quick alert when they leave or enter one of them. You can set up several virtual fences, make them big or small, and move them easily across the map.\n\n\n\n*** Find Mode ***\n\n\n\nPinpoint your dog’s location in close range. The closer you get, the more circles fill up on your screen. Perfect for indoor tracking and when GPS signal is weak.\n\n\n\n*** Location History & Heatmap ***\n\n\n\nFind out your pet's favorite spots, where they've been recently, and what they've been up to.\n\n\n\n*** Location Sharing ***\n\n\n\nLet friends, family and others you trust (like walkers or pet-sitters) track location and activity. You can also share real-time location with anyone with a single tap - very useful if your pet runs off and you need help bringing them back home.\n\n\n\n*** Interactive Map ***\n\n\n\nView the location of all your pets with trackers at the same time, or zoom in on a single pet. Add all your pets with GPS trackers in the Tractive app. Switch between regular map view or satellite view. Tilt the map in 3D view by using two fingers. \n\n\n\n*** Up to 7 days battery life ***\n\n\n\nDepends on usage, coverage and how active your dog or cat is. Set up a Power Saving Zone at home to maximize battery life.\n\n\n\n\n*The Tractive GPS app works with all Tractive GPS trackers.*"

      "label": "Location tracking app is a GPS tracker that helps you locate your family, kids, friends, loved ones, and people you care about in real time on a live, shared, and private map.  \n\nSmart Circles\nWith Smart Circles, you can create a circle of people who all share their locations within the group and can track each others location history and location in real time. Invite group members by sharing a unique, private 6-digit number. After the invitations are accepted, you can find people in your circle easily at any time.\n\nGeo-fence zones\nUse geozones to know which of your circle members are in a certain area the moment they arrive. Setting up is easy: first, drop a pin on the map to set the center of the geo-fence at a specific location. Next, name your geolocation, set the radius for it, and once it's created, you'll know when your circle members enter and exit it by getting push notifications. Geo zones automatically let you know where your loved ones are without any effort from them — for example, you can create a geo-fence at your children's school to tell you they've arrived safely, or create one around your home to alert you when a family member is about to arrive.\n\nEmergency SOS function\nIn trouble? By tapping on the SOS button, all members of your circles will get an urgent push notification that you need help, with a live update of where you are. You can feel secure in your life knowing your child, partner, or friend can alert you any time they are lost, in danger, or need help.\n\nOther features:\n- Find your family and friends on the mobile map in real time.\n- View location history of each circle member.\n- 'Find my device' by GPS phone tracker in case your device is lost.\n- Manage group circles and geo-fence zones.\n- More features are coming soon!\n\nLocation tracker is your handy GPS geo tracker and family locator app to keep your loved ones safe and secure. Subscribe to location finder for unlimited notifications, live tracking, longer location history and no ads. \n\nTerms of use: https://telegra.ph/Terms--Conditions--Find-Friends--Family-Location-04-06\nPrivacy policy: https://telegra.ph/Privacy-Policy--Find-Friends--Family-Location-04-06"

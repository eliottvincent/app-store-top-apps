You can now use this app to control your Philips Hue smart Bluetooth lights!*  \n\nOrganize your smart lights your way \nWhether you use just a few bulbs or have completely outfitted your home in Philips Hue, you can organize your smart lights with ease. Group your lights into Rooms or Zones — your entire downstairs floor or all the lights in the living room, for example — that mirror the physical rooms in your home. \n\nEasily control your lights — from anywhere \nAdjust your lights’ brightness, temperature, and color and control multiple lights across Rooms or Zones all from the Hue app — and it doesn’t matter where you are. You can use the app to control your lights anywhere you have an internet connection.  \n\nExtraordinary light experiences  \nCreated by professional lighting designers, scenes transform your room in an instant. Create a unique atmosphere with the Honolulu scene, the vibrant colors of Soho, and more. Browse the Hue scene gallery and tap a scene to set it — or create your own based on a photo or your favorite color palette. \n\nLight recipes for your daily routines \nUse the four light recipes designed by lighting experts to support your wellbeing throughout the day. Start the day with the cool daylight of Energize to give you a morning boost, followed by the brighter Concentrate setting to help you get things done. The Read light recipe gives you the perfect shade of light in which to read your favorite book, while the dimmed golden glow of Relax helps you wind down.  \n\nPersonalize with automations \nMake your smart lights work around your daily routine. Whether you want your lights to gently wake you up in the morning or greet you when you get home, setting up customizable automations in the Hue app is effortless — and fun!  \n\nSync your smart lights \nMake your lights flash, dance, dim, brighten, and change color in sync with your screen or sound! Use the Sync tab to sync your lights with the Philips Hue Play HDMI sync box or Spotify.\n\nHands-free voice control \nUse Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant to control your smart lights with just your voice. Simple voice commands let you turn lights on and off, dim and brighten, or even change colors without you ever lifting a finger. \n\nUse Siri Shortcuts for quick control\nUse the Shortcuts app to create shortcuts that you can place into widgets on your Home Screen for even faster control of your lights. Turn lights on or off, adjust their brightness and temperature, or set scenes — all without even opening the app. \n\nLearn more about the official Philips Hue app: www.philips-hue.com/app. \n\n*Some features in this app require a Hue Bridge. "

      "label": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections. And now, we’ve been named one of Apple’s 2021 Apps of the Year for connection.\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behavior. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATING, FRIENDS & NETWORKING\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes:\n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.\n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date.\n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes).\nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store.\n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms\n\nBumble Inc. is the parent company of Bumble, along with Badoo and Fruitz"

Currently, 3 out of 4 times Hinge members want to go on a second date, we’re the #1 mobile-first dating app mentioned in the New York Times wedding section, and we’re the fastest growing dating app in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.\n\nHOW WE GET YOU OFF HINGE\nIn today’s digital world, singles are so busy matching that they’re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that’s designed to be deleted.\n\n* We quickly learn your type. You’ll only be introduced to the best people for you.\n\n* We give you a sense of someone’s personality. You’ll get to know potential dates through their unique answers to prompts, and personal information like religion, height, and politics.\n\n* We make it easy to start a conversation. Every match begins by someone liking or commenting on a specific part of your profile.\n\n* We ask how your dates are going. After exchanging phone numbers with a Match, we’ll follow up to hear how your date went so we can make better recommendations in the future.\n\nThe app is free to use. Members looking to see who likes them or to set advanced preferences can upgrade to a Preferred Membership.\n\nTHE BUZZ ABOUT HINGE\n“Hinge’s CEO says a good dating app relies on vulnerability, not algorithms.” - Washington Post\n\"Hinge is the first dating app to actually measure real-world success\" - TechCrunch\n“A great option for those fed up with temporary love.” -TheNextWeb\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFO\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\nSubscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase\n\nSupport: hello@hinge.co\nTerms of Service: https://hinge.co/terms.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://hinge.co/privacy.html\n\nAll photos are of models and used for illustrative purposes only."

You have an overview of all information and control your vehicle via the app.\n\nMERCEDES ME: ALL FUNCTIONS AT A GLANCE\n\nALWAYS INFORMED: The Vehicle Status informs you about the mileage, range, current fuel level or data from your last journey, for example. Use the app to conveniently check your tyre pressure, the status of the doors, windows, sliding sunroof/soft-top and boot, or the current locking status. You can also pinpoint the location of your vehicle and receive warning messages regarding unlocked doors, for example.\n\nCONVENIENT VEHICLE CONTROL: With the Mercedes me App, you can remotely lock and unlock or open and close the doors, windows, and sliding sunroof. Start the auxiliary heating/ventilation or program this for your departure time. In electric vehicles, you can also activate pre-entry climate control and temper the vehicle immediately or for a defined departure time.\n\nCONVENIENT ROUTE PLANNING: Plan your route at your leisure and conveniently send addresses to your Mercedes via the app. This means you can get in and drive off straight away.\n\nSAFETY IN AN EMERGENCY: The Mercedes me App notifies you of attempted theft, an attempt to tow away the vehicle and parking damage. If a vehicle alarm has been tripped, you can turn it off via the app. The Geofencing service sends you a notification as soon as the vehicle enters or leaves an area defined by you. In addition, you can configure Speedfencing and Valet Protect in the app, and receive push notifications in the event of their violations.\n\nFUEL-SAVING DRIVING: The Mercedes me App shows you your vehicle's individual fuel consumption. It also compares your fuel consumption with that of other drivers of the same vehicle model. The ECO display informs you about the sustainability of your driving style.\n\nSIMPLY ELECTRIC: The Mercedes me App lets you display your vehicle's range on a map and search for charging stations near you. The app also allows you to start the charging process at a public charging station.\n\nDiscover the full convenience of the new Mercedes me Apps: They offer you ideal support for making your mobile everyday life easier and more flexible.\n\nLet the app help you. The Mercedes me Service App gives you a timely reminder of your next service appointment, which is easy to book from your smartphone. Also in the app: practical How-To videos in which you can find out more about your Mercedes-Benz and perform simple maintenance tasks yourself if you choose.\n\nExpand your mobile options with the Mercedes me Store App. Easily find and buy innovative digital products available for your Mercedes. Keep track of the remaining terms of your Mercedes me connect services and on-demand features, and renew these as desired directly from your smartphone.\n\nPlease note: Mercedes me connect services and on-demand features only work with Mercedes-Benz vehicles that are equipped with the Mercedes me connect Communication Module. The range of functions depends on the particular vehicle equipment and your booked services. Your authorised Mercedes-Benz dealer will be happy to advise you. Use requires an active, free-of-charge Mercedes me account. The functions can be restricted temporarily if there is insufficient data transmission bandwidth. Continuous use of the GPS function in the background may shorten your battery life."

      "label": "Location tracking app is a GPS tracker that helps you locate your family, kids, friends, loved ones, and people you care about in real time on a live, shared, and private map.  \n\nSmart Circles\nWith Smart Circles, you can create a circle of people who all share their locations within the group and can track each others location history and location in real time. Invite group members by sharing a unique, private 6-digit number. After the invitations are accepted, you can find people in your circle easily at any time.\n\nGeo-fence zones\nUse geozones to know which of your circle members are in a certain area the moment they arrive. Setting up is easy: first, drop a pin on the map to set the center of the geo-fence at a specific location. Next, name your geolocation, set the radius for it, and once it's created, you'll know when your circle members enter and exit it by getting push notifications. Geo zones automatically let you know where your loved ones are without any effort from them — for example, you can create a geo-fence at your children's school to tell you they've arrived safely, or create one around your home to alert you when a family member is about to arrive.\n\nEmergency SOS function\nIn trouble? By tapping on the SOS button, all members of your circles will get an urgent push notification that you need help, with a live update of where you are. You can feel secure in your life knowing your child, partner, or friend can alert you any time they are lost, in danger, or need help.\n\nOther features:\n- Find your family and friends on the mobile map in real time.\n- View location history of each circle member.\n- 'Find my device' by GPS phone tracker in case your device is lost.\n- Manage group circles and geo-fence zones.\n- More features are coming soon!\n\nLocation tracker is your handy GPS geo tracker and family locator app to keep your loved ones safe and secure. Subscribe to location finder for unlimited notifications, live tracking, longer location history and no ads. \n\nTerms of use: https://telegra.ph/Terms--Conditions--Find-Friends--Family-Location-04-06\nPrivacy policy: https://telegra.ph/Privacy-Policy--Find-Friends--Family-Location-04-06"

Go for your usual, or try out a new treatment, and discover the most-loved salons in your area. No places nearby?

Incorporating the wonderful art and music for which our ecards have justly become famous, it has become an unmissable part of the countdown to Christmas for thousands of families across the world. Download your Advent Calendar now.\r\n\r\n---\r\n \r\nWhat is an Advent calendar?\r\n \r\nA traditional Advent Calendar is a Christmas scene printed on cardboard, with little paper windows – one for each day of Advent – which open to reveal further Christmas scenes, so the user can count the days to Christmas. Our digital Advent Calendar is much more exciting, of course, because the main scene and the daily surprises all come alive with music and animation!\r\n \r\nStrictly, Advent starts on the fourth Sunday before Christmas and ends on Christmas Eve, but most modern Advent Calendars – ours included – start the Christmas countdown on 1st December. We also depart from tradition by including Christmas Day itself!"

Enable our products to control them with Google Home app or Amazon Alexa app. For both options the respective smart speaker is required. You can also use them with Apple Home app and Siri. Furthermore, you can control our SMART+ Bluetooth products with our app, which includes popular features such as turning lights on and off, grouping lights, adjusting the brightness level, changing colors with Full Color products and multi-user access.\n\nPlease note that the LEDVANCE SMART+ app does not work with the OSRAM or LEDVANCE SMART+ Zigbee products or brand new LEDVANCE SMART+ WiFi products.\n\nIn order to control our SMART+ products with the LEDVANCE SMART+ Bluetooth app, you don’t need a separate gateway. The LEDVANCE SMART+ Bluetooth app eliminates the complicated setup problem and provides easy solution. To control you do not even need a WiFi router. \n\nWith our SMART+ Bluetooth products, you will also benefit from the new Bluetooth mesh technology. If you have multiple SMART+ Bluetooth mesh devices, you can control the lights in another room, on the next floor, or even outside your home thanks to the ability of mesh devices to relay commands and information between each other. With Bluetooth mesh devices, you can also take advantage of increased reliability and scalability with a limited delay in response when controlling individual lights or groups of lights together. \n\nMoreover, if you prefer to use our SMART+ Bluetooth products with Google Home, you can simply enable them by the app. Afterwards the products can be easily connected to a Google Home or Nest device. This enables all great features of the Google Home system like app, voice control and routines. \n\nIn addition, you can choose to control our SMART+ Bluetooth products with Apple HomeKit. Follow the steps in the app and connect our products to the Home app. Accordingly our products can be controlled remote by phone or by voice commands with Siri.\n\nAnd finally, if you prefer to control your SMART+ Bluetooth product with Amazon Alexa, enable your device in the app and pair it directly with your Amazon Echo speaker. Only ask Alexa to “Discover my devices” and you will have the unlimited experience of Amazon Alexa system with our products.  Anytime a change of the SMART+ Bluetooth products to another smart home system is possible in the app."

Doch sie machen es uns oft schwer, aus der eigenen Komfort- und Trendzone auszubrechen. \n\nPeeps stellt täglich eine andere Person vor. In Form von mehreren Beiträgen, die über den Tag verteilt publiziert werden. Wir zeigen die Diversität der jungen Menschen in der Schweiz, deren verschiedene Lebenswelten und Lieblingsdinge. Mit Foto-, Video-, Audio- und Textbeiträgen. \n\nZudem wird passend zur Person und derer Themen ein vergünstigtes Qualitätsprodukt (z.B. Laptop, Konzert-Ticket etc.) zum halben Preis im eigenen Shop angeboten (limitierte Anzahl, schnell sein lohnt sich) und eine Verlosung veranstaltet. \n\nDie App wurde konzipiert von jungen Menschen für junge Menschen. Für die Content Produktion sind junge Redaktor:innen, Fotograf:innen, Videograf:innen, Illustrator:innen und – weil dreisprachig – Übersetzer:innen tätig.\n\nUnterstützt wird das Projekt von PostFinance. Kund:innen von PostFinance können die App gratis nutzen. Für die, die nicht Kund:in von PostFinance sind, kostet die App 5 Franken im Monat (jederzeit kündbar). \n\nEULA: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

      "label": "I Am Sober is more than just a free sobriety counter app.\n\nAlong with tracking your sober days, it helps you build new habits and provides ongoing motivation by connecting you to a wide network of people all striving for the same goal: staying sober one day at a time.\n\nThrough our growing sober community you can learn from others and contribute by sharing insights and tactics that have worked for you.\n\n**The I Am Sober app features:**\n\n• Sober day tracker\nTo visualize how long you’ve been sober.\n\n• Remember why you quit\nAdd reasons and photos to help you remember why you want to quit your addiction and stay sober.\n\n• Daily pledge tracker\nTake a pledge every day. Sobriety is a 24-hour struggle, so start your day off by making a pledge to stay sober. Then you can review how your day went and log notes at the end of the day.\n\n• Sobriety calculator\nView how much money & time you’ve saved by being sober.\n\n• Analyze triggers\nRecap each day and find patterns that made your day easier or more challenging than the last.\n\n• Share your story\nEither with others or for yourself, take photos and journal your progress directly in the app. Then choose to share it or save it as a reminder for yourself.\n\n• Milestone tracker\nTrack and celebrate your milestones from 1 day, to 1 week, to 1 month and beyond. Compare experiences with others on their sober journey. Read how they felt at this milestone and what you can expect. If you’re struggling, share your story and invite others to offer help or advice.\n\n• Withdrawal timeline\nWhen you create an account and declare your addiction, you can instantly see a withdrawal timeline to get an idea of what to expect for your next few days (and weeks). What’s more, you can contribute to it. See how many others saw an increase in their restfulness vs those that saw an increase in anxiety. Prepare yourself for what’s to come in recovery.\n\n• Customize your experience\nYou set the time, your sober birthday, the category of motivation you need, the addictions you’re trying to break, even the end-of-day summaries. Make the app customized to your lifestyle and tailored to your needs.\n\n**Sober Plus subscriptions**\n\nI Am Sober is free to use, but you can support development of the app with a subscription to Sober Plus. With Sober Plus, you'll get access to these premium features:\n\n• Create a group\nStay accountable together and track your sobriety privately. Groups are great for complimenting your real-world group like Alcoholics Anonymous, NA, SA, SMART Recovery, or your rehab center.\n\n• Locked access\nKeep your trackers private with a lock that you can access via TouchID or FaceID.\n\n• Data Backups\nSave your progress in the cloud and restore your trackers if you get a new device.\n\n• More tracking\nTrack more addictions and get access to more communities. Even if your addiction is specific like Wine, Online Shopping, or Skin Picking, you’ll find a variety of communities of people who are all trying to get sober from alcohol, drugs, eating disorders, self-harm, and more.\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. I Am Sober Plus automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and the cost of the renewal will be identified. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\n\nTerms of service: https://iamsober.com/terms-of-service/\nPrivacy policy: https://iamsober.com/privacy-policy/"

Keep them fit and healthy with activity tracking.\n\n\n\nDon't have a Tractive GPS cat or dog tracker yet? Get yours at https://tractive.com\n\n\n\nMain features:\n\n\n\n* Track your dog or cat in real-time with unlimited range\n\n\n\n* Monitor activity & sleep, keep your pet fit, and compete with other furry friends\n\n\n\n* See your pet's location history \n\n\n\n* Set safe areas - like your garden - with virtual fences, and get a notification if your pet leaves one\n\n\n\n* Share location - let friends and family track your pet, and share real-time location with others\n\n\n\n\nTractive GPS trackers work in over 175 countries. Get yours along with the free app to start enjoying these features.\n\n\n\n\n*** Activity & Sleep Tracking ***\n\n\n\nSee how active your dog or cat is. Set goals. Compare with other pets. Spot sleep patterns, and make sure your furry friend is getting quality rest. \n\n\n\n*** LIVE Tracking ***\n\n\n\nNeed extra reassurance? Go into LIVE mode to follow your pet's every move, and get location updates every 2-3 seconds.\n\n\n\n*** Virtual Fence (Safe Zones & No-Go Zones) ***\n\n\n\nSet safe zones - like your garden - as well as no-go zones your buddy should avoid - like a field near a busy road. You'll get a quick alert when they leave or enter one of them. You can set up several virtual fences, make them big or small, and move them easily across the map.\n\n\n\n*** Find Mode ***\n\n\n\nPinpoint your dog’s location in close range. The closer you get, the more circles fill up on your screen. Perfect for indoor tracking and when GPS signal is weak.\n\n\n\n*** Location History & Heatmap ***\n\n\n\nFind out your pet's favorite spots, where they've been recently, and what they've been up to.\n\n\n\n*** Location Sharing ***\n\n\n\nLet friends, family and others you trust (like walkers or pet-sitters) track location and activity. You can also share real-time location with anyone with a single tap - very useful if your pet runs off and you need help bringing them back home.\n\n\n\n*** Interactive Map ***\n\n\n\nView the location of all your pets with trackers at the same time, or zoom in on a single pet. Add all your pets with GPS trackers in the Tractive app. Switch between regular map view or satellite view. Tilt the map in 3D view by using two fingers. \n\n\n\n*** Up to 7 days battery life ***\n\n\n\nDepends on usage, coverage and how active your dog or cat is. Set up a Power Saving Zone at home to maximize battery life.\n\n\n\n\n*The Tractive GPS app works with all Tractive GPS trackers.*"

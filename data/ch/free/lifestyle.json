Group your lights into Rooms or Zones — your entire downstairs floor or all the lights in the living room, for example — that mirror the physical rooms in your home. \n\nEasily control your lights — from anywhere \nAdjust your lights’ brightness, temperature, and color and control multiple lights across Rooms or Zones all from the Hue app — and it doesn’t matter where you are.

Start the day with the cool daylight of Energize to give you a morning boost, followed by the brighter Concentrate setting to help you get things done. The Read light recipe gives you the perfect shade of light in which to read your favorite book, while the dimmed golden glow of Relax helps you wind down.  \n\nPersonalize with automations \nMake your smart lights work around your daily routine. Whether you want your lights to gently wake you up in the morning or greet you when you get home, setting up customizable automations in the Hue app is effortless — and fun!  \n\nHands-free voice control \nUse Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant to control your smart lights with just your voice. Simple voice commands let you turn lights on and off, dim and brighten, or even change colors without you ever lifting a finger. \n\nUse Siri Shortcuts for quick control (iOS) \nUse the Shortcuts app to create shortcuts that you can place into widgets on your Home Screen for even faster control of your lights. Turn lights on or off, adjust their brightness and temperature, or set scenes — all without even opening the app. \n\nLearn more about the official Philips Hue app: www.philips-hue.com/app. \n\n*Some features in this app require a Hue Bridge. "

And now, we’ve been named one of Apple’s 2021 Apps of the Year for connection.\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behavior. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATING, FRIENDS & NETWORKING\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes:\n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.\n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move.

Currently, 3 out of 4 times Hinge members want to go on a second date, we’re the #1 mobile-first dating app mentioned in the New York Times wedding section, and we’re the fastest growing dating app in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.\n\nHOW WE GET YOU OFF HINGE\nIn today’s digital world, singles are so busy matching that they’re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that’s designed to be deleted.\n\n* We quickly learn your type. You’ll only be introduced to the best people for you.\n\n* We give you a sense of someone’s personality. You’ll get to know potential dates through their unique answers to prompts, and personal information like religion, height, and politics.\n\n* We make it easy to start a conversation. Every match begins by someone liking or commenting on a specific part of your profile.\n\n* We ask how your dates are going. After exchanging phone numbers with a Match, we’ll follow up to hear how your date went so we can make better recommendations in the future.\n\nThe app is free to use. Members looking to see who likes them or to set advanced preferences can upgrade to a Preferred Membership.\n\nTHE BUZZ ABOUT HINGE\n“Hinge’s CEO says a good dating app relies on vulnerability, not algorithms.” - Washington Post\n\"Hinge is the first dating app to actually measure real-world success\" - TechCrunch\n“A great option for those fed up with temporary love.” -TheNextWeb\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFO\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\nSubscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase\n\nSupport: hello@hinge.co\nTerms of Service: https://hinge.co/terms.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://hinge.co/privacy.html\n\nAll photos are of models and used for illustrative purposes only."

You have an overview of all information and control your vehicle via the app.\n\nMERCEDES ME: ALL FUNCTIONS AT A GLANCE\n\nALWAYS INFORMED: The Vehicle Status informs you about the mileage, range, current fuel level or data from your last journey, for example. Use the app to conveniently check your tyre pressure, the status of the doors, windows, sliding sunroof/soft-top and boot, or the current locking status. You can also pinpoint the location of your vehicle and receive warning messages regarding unlocked doors, for example.\n\nCONVENIENT VEHICLE CONTROL: With the Mercedes me App, you can remotely lock and unlock or open and close the doors, windows, and sliding sunroof. Start the auxiliary heating/ventilation or program this for your departure time. In electric vehicles, you can also activate pre-entry climate control and temper the vehicle immediately or for a defined departure time.\n\nCONVENIENT ROUTE PLANNING: Plan your route at your leisure and conveniently send addresses to your Mercedes via the app. This means you can get in and drive off straight away.\n\nSAFETY IN AN EMERGENCY: The Mercedes me App notifies you of attempted theft, an attempt to tow away the vehicle and parking damage. If a vehicle alarm has been tripped, you can turn it off via the app. The Geofencing service sends you a notification as soon as the vehicle enters or leaves an area defined by you. In addition, you can configure Speedfencing and Valet Protect in the app, and receive push notifications in the event of their violations.\n\nFUEL-SAVING DRIVING: The Mercedes me App shows you your vehicle's individual fuel consumption. It also compares your fuel consumption with that of other drivers of the same vehicle model. The ECO display informs you about the sustainability of your driving style.\n\nSIMPLY ELECTRIC: The Mercedes me App lets you display your vehicle's range on a map and search for charging stations near you. The app also allows you to start the charging process at a public charging station.\n\nDiscover the full convenience of the new Mercedes me Apps: They offer you ideal support for making your mobile everyday life easier and more flexible.\n\nLet the app help you. The Mercedes me Service App gives you a timely reminder of your next service appointment, which is easy to book from your smartphone. Also in the app: practical How-To videos in which you can find out more about your Mercedes-Benz and perform simple maintenance tasks yourself if you choose.\n\nExpand your mobile options with the Mercedes me Store App. Easily find and buy innovative digital products available for your Mercedes. Keep track of the remaining terms of your Mercedes me connect services and on-demand features, and renew these as desired directly from your smartphone.\n\nPlease note: Mercedes me connect services and on-demand features only work with Mercedes-Benz vehicles that are equipped with the Mercedes me connect Communication Module. The range of functions depends on the particular vehicle equipment and your booked services. Your authorised Mercedes-Benz dealer will be happy to advise you. Use requires an active, free-of-charge Mercedes me account. The functions can be restricted temporarily if there is insufficient data transmission bandwidth. Continuous use of the GPS function in the background may shorten your battery life."

If you don’t dare to say it with words, do it with fruits! \n\nEvery fruit stands for a different kind of relationship: \nCherry: To find your other half #TieTheKnot\nGrape: To share a glass of wine and maybe dine #NoOneNightStand\n\nAnd more... \n\nConsider meeting other people without fear by getting straight to the point, expressing directly what you are really looking for and never waste time again on people that don’t share your point of view. \n\nLaunch the Fruitz app, choose your fruit and discover what others want around you. Swipe the profiles and pick the ones that match what you’re looking for! \n\nSTOP WITH “HEY, WHAT’S UP?”  \nA right swipe, a smoothie (= a match) and the chat opens. It’s the first step before meeting each other so at Fruitz we decided to make it funnier! Say bye to the non-famous “Hey, what’s up?” and for once let’s make the conversation interesting from the start.\n\nChoose a question from a hundred of choices and answer it before starting the conversation with your crush. If some are lovely, others will get you to reveal your secrets… Don’t the best relationships often start with a touch of humor? \n\n*Would you rather never use your smartphone again or never eat meat again? \n*Would you rather travel to Japan or Italy?\n*Would you rather win $1M or have a 50% chance to win $100M? \n\nTASTE THE BEST\nEnjoy the Fruitz Premium experience with features as unlimited likes to swipe right as many profiles as you want, “Pollen” to boost your profile at the top of other people’s basket, daily Crushnotes to increase your chances to match and some new juicy questions to make a good first impression. \n\nTASTE THE EXCELLENCE\nBecome a Golden member to enjoy the excellence of Fruitz: Unlimited likes, Pollen, daily Crushnotes, new juicy questions but also some more new features! With Fruitz Golden, you can now filter by fruit to only see profiles with fruit to your taste, discover who picked you and never miss a smoothie again! \n\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe Fruitz Premium subscription starts at $10,99/month and 6-month and 12-month packages are available. The Fruitz Golden subscription starts at $26,99/month and 3-month and unlimited packages are available. Prices may vary depending on the country and are subject to change without notice. \n\nIf you choose to purchase Fruitz Premium or Golden, payment will be charged to your iTunes Store account after order has been confirmed. Your subscription will auto-renew and you will be charged within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Auto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your settings in the Store after purchase. No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during the active subscription period. \n\n-----------------------------------\n\nWe consider the security and privacy of our members very importantly.

It has more than 10000+ truly unique backgrounds for your phone. \n\nWe believe that wallpapers are to phone as clothes are to humans. The real motive to make this app came from the fact that we ourselves wanted to have unique wallpapers for our phones. Most of the wallpaper app currently in the play store are almost similar and just provide a bunch of stock photographic images. We wanted the wallpapers to have much more. \n\nSo we came up with Wallpapers 16 where most of the wallpapers are artworks created by very talented digital artists. Each wallpaper has its own backstory and speaks for itself."

Sobriety is a 24-hour struggle, so start your day off by making a pledge to stay sober. Then you can review how your day went and log notes at the end of the day.\n\n• Sobriety calculator\nView how much money & time you’ve saved by being sober.\n\n• Analyze triggers\nRecap each day and find patterns that made your day easier or more challenging than the last.\n\n• Share your story\nEither with others or for yourself, take photos and journal your progress directly in the app. Then choose to share it or save it as a reminder for yourself.\n\n• Milestone tracker\nTrack and celebrate your milestones from 1 day, to 1 week, to 1 month and beyond. Compare experiences with others on their sober journey. Read how they felt at this milestone and what you can expect. If you’re struggling, share your story and invite others to offer help or advice.\n\n• Withdrawal timeline\nWhen you create an account and declare your addiction, you can instantly see a withdrawal timeline to get an idea of what to expect for your next few days (and weeks). What’s more, you can contribute to it. See how many others saw an increase in their restfulness vs those that saw an increase in anxiety. Prepare yourself for what’s to come in recovery.\n\n• Customize your experience\nYou set the time, your sober birthday, the category of motivation you need, the addictions you’re trying to break, even the end-of-day summaries. Make the app customized to your lifestyle and tailored to your needs.\n\n**Sober Plus subscriptions**\n\nI Am Sober is free to use, but you can support development of the app with a subscription to Sober Plus. With Sober Plus, you'll get access to these premium features:\n\n• Create a group\nStay accountable together and track your sobriety privately. Groups are great for complimenting your real-world group like Alcoholics Anonymous, NA, SA, SMART Recovery, or your rehab center.\n\n• Locked access\nKeep your trackers private with a lock that you can access via TouchID or FaceID.\n\n• Data Backups\nSave your progress in the cloud and restore your trackers if you get a new device.\n\n• More tracking\nTrack more addictions and get access to more communities. Even if your addiction is specific like Wine, Online Shopping, or Skin Picking, you’ll find a variety of communities of people who are all trying to get sober from alcohol, drugs, eating disorders, self-harm, and more.\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. I Am Sober Plus automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and the cost of the renewal will be identified. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\n\nTerms of service: https://iamsober.com/terms-of-service/\nPrivacy policy: https://iamsober.com/privacy-policy/"

Customize sync settings by controlling the brightness and speed of the light effects. \n\nCHOOSE YOUR SYNC MODE \nSwitch between video, game, and audio modes with the touch of a button.

      "label": "Location tracking app is a GPS tracker that helps you locate your family, kids, friends, loved ones, and people you care about in real time on a live, shared, and private map.  \n\nSmart Circles\nWith Smart Circles, you can create a circle of people who all share their locations within the group and can track each others location history and location in real time. Invite group members by sharing a unique, private 6-digit number. After the invitations are accepted, you can find people in your circle easily at any time.\n\nGeo-fence zones\nUse geozones to know which of your circle members are in a certain area the moment they arrive. Setting up is easy: first, drop a pin on the map to set the center of the geo-fence at a specific location. Next, name your geolocation, set the radius for it, and once it's created, you'll know when your circle members enter and exit it by getting push notifications. Geo zones automatically let you know where your loved ones are without any effort from them — for example, you can create a geo-fence at your children's school to tell you they've arrived safely, or create one around your home to alert you when a family member is about to arrive.\n\nEmergency SOS function\nIn trouble? By tapping on the SOS button, all members of your circles will get an urgent push notification that you need help, with a live update of where you are. You can feel secure in your life knowing your child, partner, or friend can alert you any time they are lost, in danger, or need help.\n\nOther features:\n- Find your family and friends on the mobile map in real time.\n- View location history of each circle member.\n- 'Find my device' by GPS phone tracker in case your device is lost.\n- Manage group circles and geo-fence zones.\n- More features are coming soon!\n\nLocation tracker is your handy GPS geo tracker and family locator app to keep your loved ones safe and secure. Subscribe to location finder for unlimited notifications, live tracking, longer location history and no ads. \n\nTerms of use: https://telegra.ph/Terms--Conditions--Find-Friends--Family-Location-04-06\nPrivacy policy: https://telegra.ph/Privacy-Policy--Find-Friends--Family-Location-04-06"

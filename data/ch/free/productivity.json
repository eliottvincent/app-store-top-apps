      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n \nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\nMulti factor authentication (MFA) or two factor authentication (2FA) provides a second layer of security. When logging in with multi-factor authentication, you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one-time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one-time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n \nGetting started with passwordless\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n \nGetting started with autofill\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n \nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.\n \nOptional Access permissions:\nMicrosoft Authenticator includes the following optional access permissions. All these require user consent. If you choose to not grant these optional access permissions, you can still use Microsoft Authenticator for other services that do not require such permission. For more information see https://aka.ms/authappfaq\nAccessibility Service:  Used to optionally support Autofill on more apps and sites.\nLocation: Sometimes your organization wants to know your location before allowing you to access certain resources. The app will request this permission only if your organization has a policy requiring location.\nCamera: Used to scan QR codes when you add a work, school, or non-Microsoft account.\nRead the contents of your storage: This permission is only used when you report a technical problem through the app settings.Some information from your storage is collected to diagnose the issue."

And with Dropbox Rewind, you can roll back any file, folder, or your entire account, up to 30 days.\n\nExisting Plus customers can upgrade to Dropbox Professional. With 3 TB (3,000GB), you can store all your stuff—from work projects to personal photos—and have space to spare. You and your clients can comment on most file types without leaving Dropbox. And you can protect your work with a watermark, add shared link controls, or rewind your account up to 180 days.\n\nBefore starting a trial or completing payment, you’ll see the plan price. This amount will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and on renewal and will vary by plan and country. Dropbox subscriptions renew monthly or yearly, depending on your plan. Your account will be charged for renewal 24 hours before the end of your current billing period. To avoid auto-renewal, turn it off in at least 24 hours before your subscription renews. You can turn off auto-renewal anytime from your iTunes account settings. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.\n\nDropbox is a secure cloud solutions leader trusted by Fortune 500 companies for their most sensitive data. Over 14 million paid users choose Dropbox because they know they can count on a company that’s also dedicated to their security and privacy—no matter what they do or where they are. Let Dropbox be your all-in-one file storage, file organizer, file transfer, and file sharing solution for all your devices.\n\nWe’d love to hear from you!

This is done using the “Read” button (if available) or by opening the IncaMail.html attachment.\n\nIMPORTANT: on modern iOS versions, the IncaMail app is no longer necessary for reading IncaMail messages in most cases!\n\nThere are just a few mail apps or older iOS versions which don’t work for reading messages. The IncaMail app is only intended for these cases: install the app and use it to open the IncaMail.html attachment.\n\nThe IncaMail app also includes other functions, such as sending IncaMail messages and displaying a logbook featuring the protocols of all messages. These functions are also available directly from the https://incamail.com web service and don’t require the app.\n\nNOTE: IncaMail is not just offered by Swiss Post but also its partners, e.g. “P2 The second Swiss Post” at https://www.p2-incamail.de/."

      "label": "The most simple and useful Calendar app ever! When it comes to calendar apps, simple calendar is the best choice! We pursued a simple and easy design throughout the app.\n\nWith an emphasis on simplicity, Simple Calendar is super easy to navigate, and with various customizing features including font size, you can use it in the style that suits you best.\n\nIt's perfect for those looking for a minimalist calendar app focused on functionality instead of extra (and sometimes unnecessary) features. Simple calendar has been receiving the highest ratings among users, plus it's FREE! Give it a try right now.\n\n[List of functions]\n· 6 Widgets\n· Font size adjustment (10 sizes)\n· Weekly calendar (7 days · 5 days · 3 days) Display\n· Supports daily calendar\n· Color coding for different calendars\n· Enter notes, URLs and maps\n· Link with other scheduling apps\n· Headlines last for days for easy viewing\n· Set your favorite day of the week as a holiday\n· Change the start day of the week\n· Lock with passcode\n\n\n[Function Details]\n\n■ iOS calendar\nThis app uses the iOS calendar app. Schedules made with this app will be synchronized with other scheduling apps and the iOS standard calendar.\n\n■ Adjust font size\nYou can choose from five font sizes of extra-small, small, medium, large, and extra-large.\nYou can also pick between light and bold font, to make prioritized events pop up better.\n\n■ Monthly, weekly, and daily calendar\nWith one tap at the bottom of the screen, you can switch between monthly, weekly, and daily display.\nSwitching the weekly calendar between 7, 5  or 3 day display allows you to find the display that is right for you.\nBecause the app memorizes the calendar style used the last time you opened it, it's super convenient for people who only want to use the weekly display.\n\n■ Color coding\nYou can create separate calendars according to different schedules such as work and home. And then, manage them clearly by color coding them. You can switch the background color between white and black as well.\n\n■ Secure passcode lock\nYou can lock the app with a password securely, if you don't want people to see your calendars. Of course, it corresponds to Face ID, Touch ID as well.\n\n■ Notification settings\nYou can set up notifications for scheduled events, at the event time and also 5 min, 15min, or more prior to the event so you don't miss important plans!\n\n\n[Note to users]\nSince this calendar app uses the standard function of the iOS calendar, all schedules older than one month may disappear with the default setting. This also applies to other apps. If you want to keep past events, please follow the procedures below after installing the app.\n\n1. Open the iOS Settings app.\n2. Tap \"Calendar\".\n3. Tap \"Sync\".\n4. Select \"All Events\".\n\nThis should solve the problem.\nIf you still have questions, visit the \"Help · FAQ\" page from the app for further details.\n\n\n【Help/Inquiries】\nPlease visit \"Help · FAQ\" from the setting screen of the app. If this doesn't help, please contact us through \"Inquiry / feedback\" from the setting screen. We can respond to you much quicker this way, so please do so instead of asking us questions in the app review, since it takes a while for those to be reflected onto the page."

      "label": "Keep your conversations private. Proton Mail is encrypted email from Switzerland. Used by millions worldwide, our all-new email app protects your communications and has everything you need to easily manage your inbox.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal says:\n“Proton Mail offers encrypted email, which makes it virtually impossible for anyone to read it except the sender and the recipient.”\n\nWith the all-new Proton Mail app, you can:\n• Create a @proton.me or @protonmail.com email address \n• Send and receive encrypted emails and attachments with ease\n• Switch between multiple Proton Mail accounts\n• Easily manage your email with conversations\n• Keep your inbox tidy and clean with folders, labels and simple swipe-gestures\n• Receive new email notifications\n• Send Password-protected Emails to anyone\n• Enjoy your inbox in dark mode\n\nWhy use Proton Mail?\n• Proton Mail is free — We believe everyone deserves privacy. Upgrade to a paid plan to get more done and support our mission. \n• Easy to use — Our all-new app has been redesigned to make it easier to read, organize, and write your emails.\n• Your inbox is yours — We don’t spy on your communications to show you targeted ads. Your inbox, your rules.\n• Rigorous encryption — Your entire inbox is secured, on all your devices. No one can read your emails but you. Proton is privacy, guaranteed by end-to-end and zero-access encryption.\n• Unmatched protection — We offer strong phishing, spam, and spying/tracking protection for all your communications.\n\nIndustry Leading Security Features\nMessages are stored on Proton Mail servers using end-to-end encryption at all times and are transmitted securely between Proton servers and user devices. This largely eliminates the risk of message interception.\n\nZero Access to Your Email Content\nProton Mail's zero access architecture means that your data is encrypted in a way that makes it inaccessible to us. Data is encrypted on the client side using an encryption key that Proton does not have access to. This means we don't have the technical ability to decrypt your messages.\n\nOpen-Source Cryptography\nProton Mail's open-source software has been thoroughly vetted by security experts from around the world to ensure the highest levels of protection. Proton Mail only uses secure implementations of AES, RSA, along with OpenPGP, while all of the cryptographic libraries used are open source. By using open-source libraries, Proton Mail can guarantee that the encryption algorithms used do not have clandestinely built-in back doors.\n\nProton Mail in the press:\n“Proton Mail is a Gmail-like email system which uses end-to-end encryption, making it impossible for outside parties to monitor.” Forbes\n\n“A new email service being developed by a group who met at MIT and CERN promises to bring secure, encrypted email to the masses and keep sensitive information away from prying eyes.” Huffington Post\n\nFollow Proton on social media for all the latest news and offers:\nFacebook: /proton\nTwitter: @protonprivacy\nReddit: /protonmail\nInstagram: /protonprivacy\n\nFor more information, visit: https://proton.me/mail\nOur open-source code base: https://github.com/ProtonMail"

Tappsk will keep reminding you of your pending task until you decide what you want to do with it.\n• Using your voice to record your tasks has never been easier...\n• Share your tasks: use any convenient method to send them to your friends and they'll automatically show up in their Tappsk.\n• Subtasks: create checklists and divide your tasks into smaller chunks.\n• An array of routine activities based on your interests: select and set the activities you do on a regular basis to appear as often as you like.\n• Hidden lists: eg., lists of books or movies, which will not show up on the home screen.\n• A logbook that allows you to analyze your task history from any given day.\n\nLots of tasks, one Tappsk :)\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact our support - hello@tappsk.com, we are always ready to improve!\n\n\"Premium\" feature payment:\nIf you decide to use an unlimited number of recurring tasks, reminders, habits and the \"share\" function (this is optional), your iTunes account will be charged as soon as you confirm the purchase.

Create then send the link to your participants.\n- Is it a group poll? Make sure to close the poll after everyone has responded and we’ll email them all the details.\n- Automatic calendar syncing: Avoid double bookings and keep your invites and booking pages always current.\n \nLOVING THE APP?\nMake sure you leave a review.

Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes.

      "label": "With FAIRTIQ you don’t have to buy a ticket in advance, indicate your destination or struggle to find the right zone. You will always be charged the best available price, once you have completed your journey. It doesn't matter how often you switch directions, or even if you change between trains, buses and trams. With FAIRTIQ there are no hassles, no complications, just smooth and easy travel at fair prices!\n\n\nHow it works\n\nShortly before boarding a vehicle, such as train, bus, tram or boat, simply swipe the \"Start\" button in the FAIRTIQ app. Your final destination does not need to be entered.\nIf a conductor requests ticket validation, click the \"Show ticket\" button and the QR code will automatically be displayed in the app.\nOnce you have arrived at your destination, swipe the \"Stop\" button in FAIRTIQ. The optimised cost for your trip is then displayed in the app.\n\n\nArea of validity\n\n> Switzerland and Liechtenstein\nYou can travel throughout the entire GA route network. FAIRTIQ computes for you the best available fare for your journey. Travel for example by train with SBB between Zurich and Bern, by postbus to Verbier, by bus in St. Gallen, by tram in Geneva, or a combination of everything!\n\nGermany\n>Bentheim:\nYou can use FAIRTIQ for your travels throughout Grafschaft Bentheim.\n> Dresden:\nYou can use the FAIRTIQ app for all your travels throughout VVO including ferries and mountain railways.\n> Flensburg\nYou can use FAIRTIQ for your trips on the urban network of Flensburg.\n> Göttingen\nYou can use FAIRTIQ for your trips on the urban network. The price is computed based on the \"GÖVB-Luftlinientarif\" (beeline tariff).\n> Halle (Saale)\nYou can use FAIRTIQ in the city of Halle (MDV-Tariff zone 210). However it is not yet possible to travel in the rest of the Mitteldeutsche Verkehrsverbund (MDV).\n> Karlsruher Verkehrsverbund\nYou can use FAIRTIQ for your trips in the whole tariff community of Karlsruhe.\n> Magdeburg\nYou can use FAIRTIQ for your trips within Magdeburg and the marego tariff area.\n> Nordrhein-Westfalen NRW\nYou can use FAIRTIQ for your trips in the whole German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.\n> RVL Regio Verkehrsverbund Lörrach (District of Lörrach)\nYou can use FAIRTIQ for your trips in the whole tariff community of Lörrach.\n> Verkehrsgemeinschaft am Bayerischen Untermain\nYou can use FAIRTIQ for your trips in the Verkehrsgemeinschaft am Bayerischen Untermain. The price is calculated according to the “VAB-Luftlinientarif” (beeline tariff).\n> VMT Verkehrsverbund Mittelthüringen\nYou can use FAIRTIQ for your trips in the whole tariff community Central Thuringia.\n> Würzburg\nYou can use FAIRTIQ for your trips within the Großwabe Würzburg in WVV and APG vehicles.\n\nAustria\n> Vorarlberg\nYou can use FAIRTIQ with all busses and trains for trips in the whole Vorarlberg as well as in the combi tariff with LIEmobil (Liechtenstein).\n> Linz\nYou can use FAIRTIQ in the central travel zone of Linz, including the city’s Pöstlingbergbahn (cable car network).

      "label": "Buy one of our prepaid eSIM plans at affordable rates (starting from $4.50) in over 190+ countries and regions to enjoy global connectivity!\nAdd a data pack to your dual SIM iPhone or iPad and stop worrying about staying connected while on your adventures.\n\nSay 'alo' to freedom!\n\nWhat is an eSIM?\n* An eSIM is embedded SIM technology. Think of it as a digital SIM card. Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\n.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM. The advantage is that you no longer need a fiddly, easily lost old-school plastic SIM card that you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIMs are a true technological revolution and we bring them right into your eSIM-compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or paying for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your existing phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store over time.  Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find a regularly updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link:\nhttps://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who travels - it doesn't matter whether you're on a boat, a plane, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries. We’re here to provide you with instant connectivity and solve your travel connectivity problems.\n\n\nWhy use Airalo?\n* No more huge data roaming fees\n* Installation in just a couple of minutes\n* Easy top-ups, wherever you are\n* Keep your existing number while traveling \n* No more fiddling with pins and paperclips to change SIMs\n* No need to carry a bulky WiFi dongle around\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n* Step 1: Install the Airalo app\n\n* Step 2: Find an eSIM for your destination\n(Airalo has eSIMs for over 190+ countries and regions and we're working 24/7 to expand our coverage.)\n\n* Step 3: Purchase & install your eSIM\nThere are three ways to install your eSIM; most can be installed directly, if this isn’t possible you can use a QR code or install it manually. \n\n* Step 4: Enjoy connectivity whenever you are!\n\nWhy do we love eSIM?\n\n* You aren’t disconnected during transit. With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fiddly hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things simpler for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top-up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees.\n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device. That gives you the freedom to purchase your eSIMs ahead of time and simply activate them on arrival.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n---\n\nVisit airalo.com for more information.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/privacy-policy\nTerms & Conditions: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/terms-conditions"

We’ve kept the Preview app in grey to make it easier to distinguish.\n\nThe heart of the app is the new navigation bar with the following menu points and contents: \n\nPlan: \n• Plan your journey with a simple timetable request via the touch timetable or use your current position as the origin or destination, locating it on the map. \n• Buy your ticket for the whole of Switzerland in just two clicks. Your travelcards on your SwissPass are applied.\n• Travel particularly affordably with supersaver tickets or Saver Day Passes.\n\nTrips: \n• When purchasing tickets, your journey will be saved in the ‘Journeys’ tab.\n• Even if you don’t buy a ticket, you can save your journey manually in the timetable.\n• The app accompanies you from door to door as you travel and you will receive information about delays, disruption and interchange times via push notification.\n\nEasyRide:\n• Check in, get on and set off – across the entire GA Travelcard network.\n• EasyRide calculates the right ticket for your journey on the basis of the routes you travelled on and charges you the relevant amount subsequently.\n\nTickets and travelcards: \n• Show your public transport travelcards digitally with SwissPass Mobile.\n• It also gives you an overview of your valid and expired tickets and travelcards on the SwissPass.\n\nProfile: \n• Straightforward access to your personal settings and our customer support. \n\nContact us.\nIf you have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact us:\n\nhttps://www.sbb.ch/en/timetable/mobile-apps/sbb-mobile/contact.html\n\nData security and authorisations.\nWhy does SBB Preview need permissions?\n\nLocation:\nFor connections starting from a current location, the GPS function has to be activated so that SBB Preview can find the nearest stop. This also applies if you want to have the nearest stop displayed in the timetable.\n\nCalendar and e-mail:\nYou can save connections in your own calendar and send them by e-mail (to friends, an external calendar). SBB Preview requires read and write permissions to be able to import your desired connection into the calendar.\n\nAccess to the camera:\nTo take photos straight in SBB Preview for the personalised touch timetable, the app needs access to the camera. You will be asked for permission. \n\nInternet access:\nSBB Preview needs internet access for timetable informations and ticket purchase options.\n\nMemory:\nTo support offline functions such as the list of stops, connections (history) and ticket purchase, SBB Preview needs access to your device’s memory (save app-specific settings)."

      "label": "Silicon Valley’s new success story, inDrive is a free ride-hailing app available in more than 700 cities in 47 countries. We are growing fast by putting the power back in the hands of people.\n\ninDrive first emerged as a taxi alternative — a mobility app where affordable rides for passengers would still mean well-paid rides for drivers. \n \nBut now, there’s so much more to it. You can use inDrive to travel to other cities, send and receive packages, book a truck for your personal or business needs, and even hire a local pro to help you with whatever you need. You can also sign up as a driver, courier, or tasker.\n\nThe main idea is the same for all services: A fair price is the one you agree on — not hope for. inDrive exists to prove that people can always come to an agreement. \n\nWhat We Offer\nCITY RIDES\nAffordable everyday rides with no surge pricing. You get to set the fare and choose your ride based on the driver’s price offer, rating, number of completed rides, car model, and pickup time.\n\nINTERCITY RIDES\nA safe and convenient way to travel between cities. Specify your destination, pickup date, time and location, offer your fare and request a ride. \n\nCOURIER SERVICES\nThis door-to-door on-demand delivery service is a fast and safe way to send and receive packages of up to 20 kilos. Offer your fare ​​and track your delivery in real-time.\n\nFREIGHT SERVICES\nBook a truck for your delivery and moving needs. Set the time and the fare and specify any extra details in the comments. Wait for the offers to roll in and choose the one that works best for you.\n\nPROFESSIONAL SERVICES\nFrom home improvement to tutoring and beauty care services. Describe your task, name your price and get skilled help from local pros you can trust.\n\nWhy choose inDrive\nQUICK AND EASY\nIt's simple and fast to request an affordable ride — just enter points \"A\" and \"B\" in the app, name the fare you are willing to pay, and choose your driver.\n\nOFFER YOUR FARE\ninDrive provides you with a tailored, surge-free ride-hailing experience. Here you, and not the algorithm, decide on the fare and choose the driver. We do not set the pricing according to time and mileage like other services. You agree on a win-win price with the driver before the ride starts.\n\nCHOOSE YOUR DRIVER\ninDrive lets you choose your driver from a list of the drivers who accepted your ride request. Pick them based on the best deal, arrival time, driver's rating, number of completed trips, and even a car model.\n\nSTAY SAFE\nSee the driver's name, car model, license plate number, and the number of previously completed trips before accepting the ride. During your trip, you can share the driver's information and the real-time location of the car with your family or friends using the \"Share Your Ride\" button. Your real-time geolocation can be shared via messengers, social networks, e-mail, or SMS Text. All of that is there to make your experience safe & trusted. We're continuously adding new safety features to the app to make sure both riders and drivers can enjoy 100% safe rides.\n\nADD TRAVEL OPTIONS\nDo you have specific requirements? Specify travel add-ons — SUV, extra stops on the way, a child seat, or accommodating special needs. You can write your specific needs or any other details in the comments field like \"traveling with my pet,\" “I have luggage,\" etc.\n\nSIGN UP AS A DRIVER & MAKE EXTRA MONEY\nIf you have a car, inDrive provides an excellent opportunity to make extra money. Set your schedule and enjoy complete transparency with inDrive. See your passenger's drop-off location and fare before accepting the ride request. If the passenger’s price doesn’t seem enough, you can always offer your fare or skip the rides you don’t like with no penalties.\nBest of all, low-to-no service rates mean you make more money driving with inDrive!\n\nWe can't wait for you to experience it. Install the app and let’s ride!"

Always!\n\nBut in more practical terms:\n• To be part of a community trying to be more sustainable through less owning products and more sharing.\n• When you realize the cost associated with owning your own bike or leasing from a regular bike-lease company.\n• When you have a flat tire or broken lights. Don’t wait for repairs, hop on to a nearby Donkey bike with our app.\n• When you’re visiting other towns, simply open the app and see if we are there.\n• When guests visit you, share your love for biking with them.\n\n\nFAQs\n\nCan I rent more than one bike at once?\nYes, you can rent up to 5 bikes at once! Just make sure to select the correct number of vehicles right at the beginning of your booking process.\n\nCan I leave the bike anywhere?\nNo. We work hard with the cities to keep the streets clean and accessible for everyone. Please return your Donkeys to specific drop-off locations when you are done for the day.\n\nWhat if I have issues?\nOur support team is always happy to help and understands that life happens.\n\n\nHOW PRICING WORKS\n\nJust Ride (Pay as you go)\nWith no strings attached. Just Ride is ideal for trips from 15 mins to a few hours. You can also top up your Donkey Wallet with money and we will give you bonus credit that you can use for Just Riding.\n\nDay Deals\nIn some cities, we have rolled out day deals which are great for when you just need a bike for the 1,2,3, or up to 7 days. Visiting for a weekend or inspired to explore like a local when you're on vacation? This is the perfect solution for you or a guest visiting you. \n\nMonthly memberships\nWith a Donkey membership, you pay a fixed monthly fee and get a certain amount of free time per day. If you exceed the included daily free time, your rental is extended for a low fixed cost. Ideal for the daily commute and for a busy city life with multiple errands throughout the day. Valid in all Donkey cities.\n\n\nCYCLING IS OUR PASSION\n\nWe are a team of 40(ish) firm believers in cycling as the most efficient mode of transportation and the only one our cities need. We work by the rule that any decision we make will have to bring us closer to being a sustainable, affordable, and reliable mobility provider. We wish to show the world that cycling can make cities more liveable and bike-sharing will help in that transformation.\n\nDonkey Republic - Every ride counts"

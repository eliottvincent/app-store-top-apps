      "label": "Das offizielle Game zum neuen Känguru-Film ist ein Retro-Jump'n'Run-Adventure! Marc-Uwe Kling verpflanzt seine beliebten Figuren mit neuen Texten, Geschichten und Ideen in ein völlig anderes Medium. Dazu macht er wie so oft die Stimme des wie immer umwerfend guten Kängurus nach, während Dimitrij Schaad wieder in die Rolle von Marc-Uwe schlüpft. Aber moment mal … wenn er Marc-Uwe ist, steuert ER dann nicht die Geschichten, Texte und Ideen bei? Das müsst ihr schon selbst herausfinden, denn hier ist alles voll meta! Und Arthouse.\n\nJedenfalls folgt das Spiel den Geschehnissen des Films und dem irren Roadtrip der beiden Hauptfiguren, die es diesmal mit Verschwörungstheoretikern zu tun haben. Und diese Fieslinge haben es offenbar geschafft, das Känguru und Marc-Uwe zu Pixelfiguren in einem Computerspiel zu machen … dabei kann es sich nur um eine Verschwörung handeln. Das sagt ja auch schon der Titel! Außerdem haben wir bald 2023. DREIUNDZWANZIG! Die Quersumme ist fünf! Da brauchen wir wohl gar nicht erst diskutieren. Obwohl auch das im Spiel mit lustigen Multiple-Choice-Dialogen möglich ist.\n\nFeatures:\n:: Mit den Originalstimmen von Marc-Uwe Kling und Dimitrij Schaad\n:: 21 Level voller Känguru-Spaß\n:: Die Levels bestehen aus den Subgenres Jump'n'Run, Jump'n'Box, Rätsel-Adventure-Jumping und Rhythmus-Jumping\n:: Tolle Musik der Tentakel von Delphi featuring Käptn Peng\n:: Viele Zwischensequenzen\n:: Prädikat: WITZIG (vergeben von Marc-Uwe Kling, aber der ist auch Schuld an der ganzen Sache)"

      "label": "\"Catan\", the legendary strategy game provides gaming fun anytime, anywhere.\n\nTrue to the original game, you can compete with up to four players for the most settlements, the longest roads and the largest army. You can trade with each other and claim the precious land with all its resources.\n\nThe game allows you to challenge other Catan fans online via cross-platform multiplayer to prove your strategy skills or play against the AI:\nVarious computer opponents, each with their own individual characteristics, will prove themselves worthy competitors: the pirate Jean, who knows no compromise, Vincent the merchant, who never allows himself to be cheated, Sean the knight, who takes what is rightfully his...\n\nThe popular Catan expansions \"Seafarers\", \"Cities and Knights\" and two new special scenarios are available as In-App purchases.\n\nThe complete Seafarers expansion includes more than 10 additional scenarios with an extensive campaign. Become Harbormaster, discover new islands and extra game elements like ships, gold fields, treasures and pirates. Ahoy!\n\nThe Cities and Knights expansion introduces various new gameplay mechanics that add even more variety to Catan. Invest new trade goods in city improvements to build one of the three metropolises of Catan – but beware of the barbarians attracted by Catan’s new wealth! You’ll need your best knights to fend them off! C&K contains a short campaign and 7 challenging maps.\n\nExciting adventures await you in the two new scenarios \"Enchanted Land\" and \"The Great Canal\". Vanquish dragons and bag their treasures or build a canal to help barren grain fields bloom once more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Available languages: English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese\n- Original \"Settlers of Catan\" rule set\n- Update 4.0+: Synchronous online multiplayer games\n- Smart computer opponents with individual strategies\n- Scrollable game board including zoom option \n- Freely combinable game settings \n- Game statistics\n- Comprehensive tutorial\n- Seafarers LITE: New scenario \"The 4 Islands\" and two additional game variants\n- Cities and Knights LITE: Test the new expansion in the scenario “The first Island”\n- 3 different graphic sets to choose from\n\n\n***** \nCatan FAQ: \n\nQuestion: An expansion seems gone after an update or reinstallation of Catan or after restoring the device? \nAnswer: Don’t worry! Your initial purchase is already saved in your iTunes account. You can restore your InApp purchases by selecting the restore-option in the Catan IAP menu. \n\nQuestion: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating or restoring my device. Is there any way to restore it? \nAnswer: When saved games can’t be automatically restored, we’ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter „CatanWarp*“ (* = 1–15) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1–15). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well. \n\nQuestion: Are dice rolls really random? \nAnswer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We’re avid Catan players ourselves. We’ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game! \n\n*****\nQuestions or suggestions for improvements: \nMail to ios@usm.de \nWe are looking forward to your feedback! \n\nFor more information on news and updates: www.usmgames.com \nor visit us on www.facebook.com/UnitedSoftMedia and twitter.com/USM_News \n\n*****"

      "label": "NOTE: Remastered version from the PC version. A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English. Subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

      "label": "Dog is a popular board game with cards. Your goal is to get all your and your partner's marbles into the target area before your opponents do. Our app is available for iPhone, Mac, iPad, and iPod touch. It reached repeatedly ranks 2 and 3 of all games in the Swiss App Store, with thousands of ratings at an astonishing average of 4.7 stars, and ranks regularly among the top ranks for card and board game apps in several countries.\n\nIn each round you first receive a handful of cards. You have to give one of your cards with your partner, and receive one of his cards. Cards that you play advance your marble. A marble that lands exactly on another marble sends it home. Special cards speed up your moves, by exchanging marble positions, going backwards, or splitting advances over several marbles. When you are done with your own marbles, you have to help your partner, as you can only win together.\n\nDog for iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch lets you play on boards of variable size, and offers a variety of bot players with different characters and strength that you can select as partners or adversaries. In addition we offer the following rule variants:\n\n- Canadian Seven: A Seven may be split among all of a team's marbles, including own and partner marbles. Such splits are available during the entire game and not just when all own marbles have reached the target area. This enables more complex moves.\n\n- Joker cannot win: A Joker may not be used for the final move to enter a team's last marble and win the game. This prolongs the game and improves the trailing team's chances to win.\n\nVariants may be selected separately or in combination.\n\nThe complexity of the game literally explodes with the Canadian 7 split rule. Millions of different moves are possible in some situations. We had to rebuild almost everything to ensure that even in such cases you can select every possible move without delay, and that our bot players can analyze and compare every single move. We have therefore decided to offer these variants as in-app purchases.\n\nInvite friends to a multiplayer game, or find other players on the Internet! The players see your board and play their cards and marbles on their iPhone, Mac, iPad, or iPod touch. Your devices communicate easily over the Internet via Game Center, or locally (no registrations needed) via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi network. The app supplies bot players on empty game seats, so you can finally play with your friends even if you are missing a third or fourth player.\n\nBlind and visually impaired players can select moves through VoiceOver. We encourage you to get acquainted with the standard VoiceOver features of iOS, and in particular with rotors."

Play 40 different levels, and build bridges over deep valleys, canals, and rivers. Stress tests reveal whether the bridge you build can withstand the daily stress of continual use from cars, trucks and, more recently, super-heavy tank trucks.\n\nYou can choose from a range of materials for each individual bridge, such as wood, steel, cables, or concrete pillars. Use the appropriate materials and stay within budget to build the perfect bridge. The choice of different materials means that there are numerous solutions and approaches and you can build each bridge in any number of ways – your budget is the only limit. The refined grid system allows you to realise your idea of the perfect bridge with even more precision. Let your imagination and creativity run free! And if you happen to run into a dead end, you can pick up valuable tips from the brand new help system! \n\nAwesome Add-Ons: SlopeMania & Trains\n\nIn the SlopeMania add-on you find yourself on the Tiltin Islands, home to three brand new islands where you'll even be building your bridges inside colorful grottoes! The 24 tricky, never-before-seen levels will have you using sloping lanes to overcome the massive height differences. The \"Crazy Levels\" are the real brainteasers and require out-of-the-box thinking and unusual solutions.  \n\nPurchase the Trains add-on and get the Choonited Kingdom island group, with a total of 18 new levels across three islands. Build massive bridges that can withstand the enormous weight of the two new vehicles on offer – a commuter train and a heavily loaded freight train. The idyllic and beautifully designed landscapes will make the heart of every railroad fanatic skip a beat.\n\n\"Trains\" and \"SlopeMania\" are now available at an affordable price as an in-app purchase!\n\nFEATURES:\n•             40 Levels on the island nation of Camatuga\n•             Free build mode and help system\n•             5 Settings: city, canyon, beach, mountains, hills\n•             Improved grid system  \n•             Map with unlocked worlds/levels\n•             4 different building materials: wood, steel, cables, concrete pillars\n•             Color coded load indicator for different building materials\n•             Three different load bearing levels: car, truck and tank truck\n•             High score per level\n•             Facebook connection (upload screenshots and bridge scores)\n\nFEATURES SlopeMania Add-On\n•             Completely new Tiltin Islands\n•             Option to build sloping roads – even for Camatuga\n•             Additional \"Grotto\" setting\n•             24 \"sloping\" levels inc. especially tricky \"Crazy Levels\"\n•             Explosive tank truck as an exciting new vehicle\n\nFEATURES Trains Add-On\n•             Open up 3 new islands with 18 new levels.\n•             Build bridges for modern commuter trains and heavy freight trains!\n•             New scenery: Enjoy the view of picturesque mountains and ravines!\n\n\nOS 7 or higher required"

Beware of the Dragon in \"\"the Princess and the Dragon\"\" expansion! He could eat your Meeples if you're not cautious. And be kind with the Princess: she might prefer you to other Meeples and toss them out of the cities!\n\nFEATURES\n• Accessible and tactical gameplay adapted from the award-winning Carcassonne board game    \n• 6 expansions:\n- The River, the Inns & Cathedrals, the Traders & Builders, the Winter Edition and Princess & Dragon are all available to purchase from the Game Shop.\n- Unlock The Abbot for free using your Asmodee account.\n• Up to 6 players!

Play the role of a monarch atop their steed and recruit loyal subjects, build your kingdom and protect it from the greedy creatures looking to steal your coins and crown. \r\n\r\nIn the brand-new campaign mode, monarchs must now work to build a kingdom that stands over time until finding a way to defeat the Greed for good. Explore the environments to discover new mounts and secrets hidden in the deep. \r\n\r\nBut you don’t have to rule alone! Introducing cooperative play to Kingdom Two Crowns, monarchs can now choose between a solo experience or seek the assistance of a friend, working together locally in classic split screen while sitting next to your fellow monarch, or even across from them on opposite sides of the device in the custom mobile feature of tabletop coop.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the traditional medieval setting, Kingdom Two Crowns also includes: \r\n\r\n• Dead Lands: Enter the dark lands of Kingdom. Play as unique monarchs, including the Shardbinder Miriam, with powerful traits from the gothic horror action-RPG Bloodstained. Ride the gigantic beetle steed to lay out traps, the eerie undead mount that summons barriers impeding the progress of the Greed, and from Bloodstained the mythic demon horse “Gamigin” with its powerful charge attack. Building your Kingdom has never been spookier!\r\n\r\n• Shogun: Journey to lands inspired by the architecture and culture of feudal Japan. Play as the mighty Shogun or Onna-bugeisha, enlist the support of the ninja, lead your soldiers to battle atop the mythological Kirin, and form new strategies as you brave the Greed hiding in the thick bamboo forests.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to keep the feeling of exploration, discovery, and strategy alive in Kingdom Two Crowns in post-release updates with more themed settings, each with unique styles that marvel the eye while changing how you rule the lands.\r\n\r\nA challenge awaits all who seek it here, whether you are a first-time ruler or a long-time fan. So be brave, great monarchs, for in the end Two Crowns shall reign stronger than one!"

A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nIn this last chapter of the Five Nights at Freddy's original story, you must once again defend yourself against Freddy Fazbear, Chica, Bonnie, Foxy, and even worse things that lurk in the shadows. Playing as a child whose role is yet unknown, you must safeguard yourself until 6am by watching the doors, as well as warding off unwanted creatures that may venture into your closet or onto the bed behind you.\n\nYou have only a flashlight to protect yourself. It will scare away things that may be creeping at the far end of the hallways, but be careful, and listen. If something has crept too close, then shining lights in its eyes will be your end.\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English.

They are kid-friendly, updated with the latest in facial recognition technology, tied into local criminal databases, and promise to put on a safe and entertaining show for kids and grown-ups alike!\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nAs the new security guard working nights, your job is to monitor cameras and make sure nothing goes wrong after-hours. The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift). So to make your job easier, you've been provided with your very own empty Freddy Fazbear head, which should fool the animatronic characters into leaving you alone if they should accidentally enter your office.\n\nAs always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for death or dismemberment.\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English.

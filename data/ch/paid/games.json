Set across three continents during the turbulent Middle Ages, spectacular conflicts and scheming rivals line the path to power as the great kingdoms of the medieval world vie for supremacy. Be it through diplomacy or conquest, trade or subterfuge, you must secure the resources and loyalty required to rule an empire from the shores of Western Europe to the sands of Arabia.\n\nTHE STRENGTH OF NATIONS\nUnlock up to 17 playable factions and build them into major world powers through statecraft, subterfuge or all-out war.\n\nTHE KINGDOMS EXPANSION\nAvailable via in-app purchase, this massive expansion includes 24 playable factions across four unique, fully featured campaigns. Wage war from the jungles of the Americas to the deserts of the Holy Land, from the deceptively gentle shores of the British Isles to the frigid Baltic plains.\n\nTHE ART OF WAR\nDeploy infantry, archers and cavalry into huge real-time battles, with a full range of medieval weaponry at your command.\n\nTHE TOOLS OF STATE\nUse sophisticated diplomacy, lucrative trade agreements and daring agents to forge alliances or destabilise your rivals.\n\nTHE TEST OF TIME\nShape the destinies of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East through five momentous centuries of combat, competition and conquest.\n\nTHE POWER IN YOUR HANDS\nTake command, with a brand-new user interface and enhanced touch controls for fingertip control of the battlefield. Or, play with any iPadOS-compatible mouse & keyboard.\n\n===\n\nTotal War: MEDIEVAL II requires 4.3GB of free space.

This regenerating venomous monstrosity is a slippery foe.\n• Lich’s Tomb - Hordes of undead foes, evil curses, and magical wards. What could possibly go wrong?\n• Minotaur’s Maze - Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!\n\nMore content is available via In App Purchase:\n\nThe Forest of Shadows expansion doubles the content in the game. It features adventures in all-new lush yet deadly locales. A vast network of mossy underground tunnels and connected forest areas await your heroes! \n• 5 new heroes - Alchemist, Druid, Hunter, Slayer, & Warden\n• 5 new dungeons - Lair of Indrax, The Mudlands, Realm of Venom, Smoldering Ruins, & The Vile Roots\n• A complete new 44-card encounter deck\n• Additional progression focuses, basic skills, potions, & more!\n\nThe Abyssal Depths expansion adds a new kind of threat: Fiends who hound you throughout your entire quest to reach the boss. It includes 6 different Fiends, each with two levels of difficulty. Plus, 2 new aquatic heroes join the fight in the murky waters!\n\nIndividual expansion cards:\n• Caliana - This faerie has decided that dungeoneering looks fun! Don't let her get bored...\n• Fanatic - A righteous Sentinel is here to smite evil wherever it may lurk!\n• Witch - Her chaotic magic hammer is ready to smash glooping oozes into glooping puddles!\n• Cinder Plains - The Hellhound awaits those reckless enough to venture here...\n• Phoenix's Den - Only the bravest heroes can handle the heat!\n\nOnce you know your way around the dungeon, a game takes about 15 minutes. It might take a little longer if you're learning, or a lot shorter if you jump into a pit of spikes.\n\nWarning: do not jump into a pit of spikes.\n\nAll cards in One Deck Dungeon have many colorful boxes. Roll your dice, and attempt to fill in as many boxes as possible. For every one you don't fill, you’ll suffer consequences in hearts and time! Once you complete an encounter you'll be able to learn a new skill, acquire a new item, or gain experience to level up your hero.\n\nWelcome to the world of One Deck Dungeon. Adventure awaits!\n\nOne Deck Dungeon is an officially licensed product of “One Deck Dungeon” from Asmadi Games.\n\nFor more information on One Deck Dungeon, check out OneDeckDigital.com"

      "label": "SwissQwiss fordert dich mit 900 Fragen zu allen möglichen Dingen aus der Schweiz heraus. Dabei kann es schonmal um Tiere, Wappen, Orte, Burgen oder Bundesräte gehen, die du erkennen sollst. Fragen aus Geographie, Politik, Geschichte, Wirtschaft und vielem mehr sorgen für Abwechslung und fordern dein Wissen auf einfache oder schwere Weise.\n\nDu kannst zwischen drei Spielmodi wählen:\n- In der Kampagne musst du jeweils ein Level abschliessen, um das nachfolgende freizuschalten. Die Levels werden zunehmend schwieriger und enden mit dem ultimativen Test. Schaffst du diesen, wird dir die SwissQwiss-Krone zuteil.\n- Im Modus \"Gesucht\" kannst du dir deinen Weg durch die Schweiz bahnen, in dem du gesuchte Begriffe findest. Es wird dir nur die Anzahl an Buchstaben und ein Buchstabe des Begriffs angezeigt. Am Ende des Weges wartet der Gesucht-Orden auf dich.\n- Im eigenen Spiel kannst du dir alles selbst zusammenstellen. Du wählst den Schwierigkeitsgrad, die Anzahl der Fragen, die Kategorien und den Modus. Als Modus kannst du dich selbst unter Druck setzen, indem du das Spiel unter Zeitdruck lösen musst. Für besondere Belustigung und Ablenkung sorgt die \"Ablenkungsfunktion\". Ist diese aktiviert, versuchen die Bundesräte höchst persönlich dich in deiner Konzentration zu stören, während du die Fragen zu lösen versuchst.\n\nDeine Anstrengungen werden immer belohnt, in dem du Auszeichnungen im Spiel erhältst. Deine Statistiken kannst du jederzeit im entsprechenden Menü einsehen. Damit dir die Umgebung in SwissQwiss nicht zu monoton wird, kannst du in den Einstellungen den Hintergrund der App anpassen.\n\nNun bist du am Zug. Zeige, ob du dich zurecht SwissQwiss-Champion nennen darfst!"

Sometimes on the slopes Sven can find fast Snowmobiles which can ferry multiple animals a maintain a very high top speed.\n\nStaying ahead of the avalanche has its advantages and perks.

      "label": "Dog is a popular board game with cards. Your goal is to get all your and your partner's marbles into the target area before your opponents do. Our app is available for iPhone, Mac, iPad, and iPod touch. It reached repeatedly ranks 2 and 3 of all games in the Swiss App Store, with thousands of ratings at an astonishing average of 4.7 stars, and ranks regularly among the top ranks for card and board game apps in several countries.\n\nIn each round you first receive a handful of cards. You have to give one of your cards with your partner, and receive one of his cards. Cards that you play advance your marble. A marble that lands exactly on another marble sends it home. Special cards speed up your moves, by exchanging marble positions, going backwards, or splitting advances over several marbles. When you are done with your own marbles, you have to help your partner, as you can only win together.\n\nDog for iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch lets you play on boards of variable size, and offers a variety of bot players with different characters and strength that you can select as partners or adversaries. In addition we offer the following rule variants:\n\n- Canadian Seven: A Seven may be split among all of a team's marbles, including own and partner marbles. Such splits are available during the entire game and not just when all own marbles have reached the target area. This enables more complex moves.\n\n- Joker cannot win: A Joker may not be used for the final move to enter a team's last marble and win the game. This prolongs the game and improves the trailing team's chances to win.\n\nVariants may be selected separately or in combination.\n\nThe complexity of the game literally explodes with the Canadian 7 split rule. Millions of different moves are possible in some situations. We had to rebuild almost everything to ensure that even in such cases you can select every possible move without delay, and that our bot players can analyze and compare every single move. We have therefore decided to offer these variants as in-app purchases.\n\nInvite friends to a multiplayer game, or find other players on the Internet! The players see your board and play their cards and marbles on their iPhone, Mac, iPad, or iPod touch. Your devices communicate easily over the Internet via Game Center, or locally (no registrations needed) via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi network. The app supplies bot players on empty game seats, so you can finally play with your friends even if you are missing a third or fourth player.\n\nBlind and visually impaired players can select moves through VoiceOver. We encourage you to get acquainted with the standard VoiceOver features of iOS, and in particular with rotors."

You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.

You can use it to practise aerobatics, have a lazy fly on a rainy day, or compete to fly as fast as possible in a number of races.\n\nIt includes 28 gliders (including some electric), 15 powered planes (including three control-line), a hang glider, and a quadcopter. The simulation includes realistic models of wind flow, turbulence and thermals. You can fly with AI/computer controlled planes too, keeping you company in the air.\n\nThe sceneries include a variety of slope and flat field sites. Some are panoramic, with high graphical quality, but a fixed viewpoint. Others are 3D scenes where you can fly in or behind the plane.\n\nIt is highly configurable, so you can create and explore new terrains from inside the app, as well as adjust settings such as the wind modelling, aeroplane settings (including size and ballast) etc.\n\nIf you've never flown a radio-controlled plane before, you'll probably find it hard to fly at first. Check the support website for a video and hints on how to fly. PicaSim flight simulator won't teach you how to fly, but it can help you learn - persevere and the sky is the limit!\n\nThe planes included are:\n\nGliders/sailplanes: ASW15, Banana, Canard, Discus, Trainer, Neoslope, Genie, Icarus (DLG), Jart, Kato, Le Fish (standard & ultralight), Magpie, Martin Wing, Mini-DLG, Minimoa, Notos (DLG), Phase 6, Plank (wing), PSS Spitfire, Quartz, Sherpa II, Spirit 2.6, Tigger (F3F), Trapeze, Dreamflight Weasel.\n\nElectric gliders: Neoslope, trainer.\n\nPowered R/C planes: AcroBat, Extra (3D, normal and large size), F18, GeeBee R2, RT Eraser Five, Sopwith Pup, Spitfire, High-wing trainer, twin-propeller delta, Electric Kato, Yak 54.\n\nControl-line: Extra, Max Bee, Peacemaker.\n\nOther: Wasp (quadcopter), Moyes XS 142 (hang glider).\n\nYou can read a detailed review of PicaSim in the February 2013 edition of Radio Controlled Soaring Digest at www.rcsoaringdigest.com - \"PicaSim is a fantastic flight simulator ... after a short time it’s like having a real transmitter in your hands\".\n\nThe support website provides some information on how to add your own planes and sceneries to the simulator - and has a link to a forum if you have any questions/suggestions etc."

      "label": "Do you have a refined taste for games? \r\nAre you searching for the ultimate immersive experience in mobile games?\r\nWhy do you pour the milk before the cereal? Ouch, wrong chat. \r\n\r\nIf you answered positively to the first two questions, Railways will certainly suit your interests. From the makers of Traffix, Railways is a simulation game where you have trains, passengers and railways. Your goal is to move the trains strategically between the tracks, picking up the passengers and preventing crashes. Your mission is complete when you collect all the passengers. \r\n\r\nMind the gap and start managing your railways!\r\n\r\nTo manage the trains like a master, you have to learn how to:\r\n- Stop a train for a limited time with a single tap;\r\n- Drag the train to create a new track;\r\n- Automatically pick up nearby passengers and fill the trains; \r\n- Avoid running over passengers when changing the route;\r\n- Prevent crashes between trains.\r\n\r\nRailways features minimalist and artistic elements merged in an immersive experience where the perks of a train trip are emphasized: astonishing landscapes observed at a slow pace. Each level will bring a new challenge to the track, more chaos and of course clever moves from your side. All aboard! This train is ready to depart!\r\n\r\nHow much time can you keep the trains moving? Find out now!\r\n\r\nThis new game by Infinity Games is a magnificent train simulator where patience is a virtue. In order to succeed, you need to wait for the right moment and use your skills to drag the trains from one railway to another. You know that you will lose if the trains collide but you also know that you have all the time in the world to make a smart move. Furthermore, you can also stop the trains for a while. \r\n\r\nIf you have the patience of a monk, you will have a great time with Railways!\r\nIf you are an impatient person, you can use Railways to improve those skills!\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Premium look and artistic features: you will not just play a mobile game. You will behold a masterpiece! \r\n- Immersive gameplay: after a couple of levels, you will find yourself absorbed by Railways imaginary world. \r\n- Curated levels crafted by train conductors: Railways levels were designed by train conductors with +10 years of experience. \r\n- Multiple achievements to conquer: picking up the passengers is just the beginning.\r\n- Smooth difficulty curve\r\n\r\nDid you know that 0% of players passed level 1? \r\nThat is because at the date I am writing this text the game is not yet released. \r\n\r\nInfinity Games aims to provide the best game experience within its titles. We love showcasing new minimalist puzzle games and making people think while relaxing and having fun.\r\n\r\nDo you like our work?

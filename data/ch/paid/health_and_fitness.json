      "label": "If you love working out with Apple Watch, but you need more advanced fitness stats, HealthFit is for you.\n\nBy analyzing the workout data stored in Apple Health, HealthFit provides the kind of indispensable tracking and insights you normally only get from premium subscription services. But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times.

HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio.

You can train as usual with your favorite fitness or running app. All you need to do is install PULSALARM on your Apple Watch.\n\nFeatures of the Apple Watch App:\n- Vibration and/or warning tone when the set pulse limits are reached\n- Vibration and/or signal tone when returning to the set pulse range\n- Pulse limits can be deactivated individually\n- Large, easy to read display of the current pulse\n- Fast adjustment of pulse limits (also possible while running)\n- Works together with all known fitness, training and running apps that can be started on the Apple Watch\n- Does not write data to Apple Health\n- You can use the app on your Apple Watch without having your iPhone with you\n\nFeatures of the iPhone App:\n- Calculation of your maximum heart rate\n- Individual calculation of the 5 intensity ranges (depending on your maximum heart rate) \n- Adoption of the pulse limits from the training zones\n- Setting the maximum and minimum pulse limit \n- Large display of the current pulse\n\nImportant note: without the use with an Apple Watch, the functional range of the app is limited, as no permanent pulse measurement can be carried out.\n\nNo advertising, no tracking, no third-party codes. Developed with passion and programmed in Germany.\n\nWhy use PULSALARM additionally? \nMany running apps include the pace as a target in their training plans. However, the same speed can mean a high intensity for one person and a low intensity for another. It is therefore helpful to consider your heart rate instead of speed to determine and maintain the right training intensity. \nPULSALARM helps you to do this. It turns your Apple Watch into a heart rate monitor. \n\nWhat is the big advantage?\nYou no longer have to look at your Apple Watch during your workout and still know whether you are exercising within your personal heart rate zone. Also ideal in colder months, when your Apple Watch is hidden under a jacket or long-sleeved shirt and you can't look directly at the display while running.\n\nFor whom is PULSALARM suitable?\n- Ideal for run beginners, as they can control themselves better and protect themselves from overstraining.\n- Ideal for ambitious runners, as they can train more specifically in their intensity ranges and thus increase endurance and performance.\n- For all athletes and fitness enthusiasts who are interested in heart rate monitoring during their training with their Apple Watch.\n\nSummary:\nWith the PULSALARM app on the iPhone you can determine your 5 intensity ranges based on your maximum heart rate. You can enter your maximum heart rate directly or have it calculated. Set your personal maximum heart rate limit, which you do not want to exceed during training, and your minimum heart rate limit. When these limits are reached, your Apple Watch will alert you by vibrating and/or beeping."

Disconnect together for as long as you want and do something fun and useful with your time without your electronic devices.\n\nOFFTIME also has a PRO version that, in addition, will answer you: \n\n- Schedule more than one rest at a time\n- You can create different blocking profiles to block the calls from the contacts that you wish to select while you are doing an OFFTIME.\n- Access backup copies of all your devices, so that no matter what device you use, your OFFTIME time is registered and disconnected on all your screens.\n\nThe OFFTIME team is working to improve the versions of our application, so that each time more is disconnected and you can dedicate yourself to everything that the mobile has taken from you.\n\nWhat are you waiting for to return to a life free of devices?

      "label": "Die Progressive Muskelentspannung (PME) nach Edmund Jacobson ist eine wissenschaftlich anerkannte Entspannungsmethode, die über Muskelanspannung und Entspannung dazu verhilft, in einen Zustand der Tiefenentspannung zu gelangen. Die PME ist eine - wissenschaftlich erwiesen - sehr wirksame Entspannungsmethode; sie wird von Ärzten bei zahlreichen meist stressbedingten Symptomen empfohlen wie z.B.:\n\n• Verspannungen\n• Migräne oder Kopfschmerzen\n• innere Unruhe\n• Schlafstörungen\n• Rücken-/Schmerzen\n• Erregungszustände, Prüfungsangst\n• Angst- und Panikattacken\n• Bluthochdruck\n• psychosomatischen Beschwerden\n\nMit regelmäßiger Übung wird es immer besser gelingen, in noch tiefere Entspannungszustände zu geraten. Sobald man genügend Übung und Erfahrung mit der ausführlichen Form der Progressiven Muskelentspannung (GRUNDFORM: 17 Muskelgruppen / ANFÄNGER-Status) hat, kann auch zu den kürzeren Varianten (Kurzformen) mit 7 und 4 Muskelgruppen übergegangen werden und schließlich wird es leicht fallen, sich bzw. auch einzelne Körperpartien mit dem Body Scan rein mental zu entspannen. Es sollte zu Beginn bei allen Formen der Übungsstatus ANFÄNGER gewählt werden.\n\nIn dieser App werden alle 4 Formen der PME (Grund- und 2 Kurzformen sowie die Mentale Form) angeleitet und geübt.\n\nGRUNDFORM: 17 MUSKELGRUPPEN\n1. Rechte Hand und Unterarm\n2. Rechter Oberarm\n3. Linke Hand und Unterarm\n4. Linker Oberarm \n5. Stirn\n6. Obere Wangenpartie und Nase\n7. Untere Wangenpartie und Kiefer\n8. Nacken \n9. Brust, Schultern und obere Rückenpartie\n10. Bauchmuskulatur\n11. Gesäß- und Beckenboden\n12. Rechter Oberschenkel\n13. Rechter Unterschenkel \n14. Rechter Fuß\n15, 16, 17 (-> linke Seite)\n\nKURZFORM I: 7 MUSKELGRUPPEN\n1. Rechte Hand, Unterarm und Oberarm\n2. Linke Hand, Unterarm und Oberarm\n3. Stirn, Wangenpartie, Nase und Kiefer\n4. Nacken \n5. Brust, Schultern, Rücken, Bauch-, Gesäß und Beckenboden\n6. Rechter Oberschenkel, Unterschenkel und Fuß\n7. Linker Oberschenkel, Unterschenkel und Fuß\n\nKURZFORM II: 4 MUSKELGRUPPEN\n1. Beide Hände, Unterarme und Oberarme\n2. Gesichts- und Nackenmuskulatur\n3. Brust, Schultern, Rücken, Bauch-, Gesäß- und Beckenboden\n4. Beide Oberschenkel, Unterschenkel und Füße\n\nMENTALE FORM: BODY-SCAN\nGeführte Entspannung durch den ganzen Körper bis zu den Füßen, diesmal beginnend mit Gesichts, Unterkiefer und Nacken. Diese Anleitung ist die letzte Stufe der PME, bei der die Wahrnehmung auf einzelne Körperteile gelenkt wird, ohne diese anzuspannen. Die Entspannung erfolgt jetzt nur noch mental. Hilfreiche Vorstellungen (Sonne, Strand, Meer) können dabei unterstützen (wählbar).\n\nÜBUNGS-STATUS\nFür alle Formen der PME kann zudem der Übungsdauer-Status \n- ANFÄNGER\n- FORTGESCHRITTEN\n- ERFAHREN\ngewählt werden. Damit stehen insgesamt 12 vollständige Versionen der PME zu Verfügung.\n\nLIEGEND / SITZEND\nAlle Formen werden wahlweise jeweils im Sitzen oder Liegen angeleitet.\n\nMUSIK & NATUR-SOUNDS\nEs kann aus 5 Entspannungsmusiken und 18 Natur-Sounds gewählt werden, die sich jeweils untereinander und an die Lautstärke der Stimme anpassen lassen. Falls gewünscht können Musik/Sounds auch alleine (ohne Stimme) zur Entspannung bzw. zum Einschlafen genutzt werden. Es können auch 2 Natur-Sounds gleichzeitig kombiniert werden.\n\nEINSCHLAFEN - RÜCKNAHME - OHNE OUTRO\nAlle Übungen können wahlweise zum Einschlafen, zur Entspannung mit Rücknahme und ohne Outro verwendet werden. \n\nDAUER DER ANSPANNUNG\nDie Dauer der Anspannung der Muskelgruppen kann ausgewählt werden. Überwiegend wird eine Anspannung von 5 Sek. empfohlen.\n\nPAUSEN ZUM ENTSPANNEN\nDie Dauer der Pausen zwischen den Muskelgruppen kann nach eigenen Vorlieben und Übungsstand angepasst werden. Überwiegend wird eine Dauer von 20 Sek. empfohlen.\n\nTIMER\nAuf alle Übungen kann eine beliebig lange Zeit für die Entspannungsmusik & Natur-Sounds eingestellt werden, die die Entspannung vertiefen.\n\nHINWEISE\nDie App kann / sollte sogar im Flugmodus (offline) genutzt werden.\nDie App enthält keine Werbung, Abos, In-App-Käufe."

      "label": "This application is a sidekick to the beastmaker 1000 and 2000. It has been designed to assist the user into gradually getting stronger on a fingerboard. The app does this by way of prewritten workouts which are often general and aim to improve all trainable grips on the board. Some are specific (2000 series only at the moment) which aim to improve, sloper strength, pocket strength and crimp strength. \n\nThere is also a new custom workout program fully adjustable and includes the 1000,2000 and micros, so if you have your own hang regime and different timings then that is all programmable and can be saved.\n\nBoth the workouts and custom timer now record hang contraction time (time spent actually hanging off the board) We recommend most users get up to around 20:00 minutes on this clock whilst doing their workouts.\n\nOn the Workout screen after you've selected your work out it is now possible to adjust set and hang times. Users who are only finger boarding and are having a rest day prior to and after training may wish to do up to 3 sets and 7 hangs. Other users may prefer to go for 2 sets and 6 hangs, this is what we'd consider an average and more suited to people doing additional types of training.\n\nPlease note the grades for the workouts aren't actually meant to relate to anything other than themselves. E.G. 5c is easier than 6a but harder than 5b. If you find 5a hard on the 1000, use a weight removal technique such as putting one foot on a chair in front of the board or using a pulley with weights on. More advice on this and other things are available in the general advice section on the Workout Ratings page.\n\nTo record your hangs press the record button (red circle icon) whilst resting. The Workout Ratings function is much improved and should now be a really useful training aid which records gradual progress and improvement.\n\nFingerboard gains take time, remember to warm up thoroughly and move on to more difficult hangs at a slightly slower pace than you think you should to give pulleys time to catch up with muscles. For example 10% strength gains over a year is brilliant improvement. 5% is still effective training.\n\nBest of luck with the training, happy hanging and we hope this helps with the motivation."

      "label": "RESPIROGUIDE PRO: THE NEWEST VERSION, MORE PERSONAL \n\n“Simple and amazingly effective for better concentration, stress anxiety, ADHD and trauma healing” –  Kees L. Blase, medical physicist,  National Centre for Stress Management,The Netherlands.\n\nRespiroguide PRO is brought to you by Vital-EQ the International Institute for Stress Management.\n**********\nTHE ABC of STRESSMANAGEMENT\nRespiroguide uses the most recent research in neurosciences and stress management, research that has been condensed into the most convenient one-touch tool. The knowledge is based on the heart's resonant frequency  which induces heart and breath coherence.\nRespiroguide Pro will train the reflexes and so the elasticity of your vascular system. This will help in lowering blood pressure, is effective in coping with stress and anxiety, and enhances better concentration at school and work. \nHeart rate is a dynamic body function that varies in each moment. \nIn an Active state (sympathic activity) heart rate increases, \nin a Calm and relaxed state heart rate decreases. \nCardiac Coherence is the Balanced  state of the autonomic nervous system in which you feel safe and happy, free from fear and anxiety and overstressed reactions.\nThe body can be brought into the state of Cardiac Coherence through guided breathing. Guiding the resonance frequency (Respiroguide Pro) can be compared with guiding someone on a swing by pushing at just the right moment to optimise their swing.   \nEach individual has his or her own personal respiratory frequency (resonance frequency) in which cardiac coherence is optimal. This ideal respiratory frequency is between 0,06 Hz and 0,12 Hz. The Respiroguide Pro will help you to find your personal resonance frequency, which depends on the length and width of your blood vessels. \nYou can set the guide in four different frequencies:\n1. Average: F6: 6 breaths a minute = 0,1 Hz\n2. Average: F5: 5 breaths a minute = 0,083 Hz\n3. Slow: F4: 4 breaths a minute = 0,066 Hz\n4. Quick: F7: 7 breaths a minute = 0,118 Hz\nTo find your resonance frequency it’s important to experience all four breathing frequencies and notice:\n-which one provides the most balanced feeling\n-which one can be comfortably sustained for a period of at least 5 minutes\n-which one gives a maximum amplitude in Heart Rate Variability. This last function requires  access to a HRV-biofeedback instrument with a Cardiac Coherence Coach.\nCardiac Coherence Coaches can be found at  www.hartfocus.nl (Netherlands) and www.heartintelligence.com/VitalEQ  (Europe, Asea). \nThe Respiroguide Pro is a medical tested safe device. More than 20 years of research showed positive effects:lowering bloodpressure, less anxiety, enhancing performance, coping with stress, effective treatment of trauma.Take care: do not  inhale too deeply, this occasionally make you dizzy. Focusing on the exhale is the most effective way. \n\nQUICK START: press the play button and just breathe in and out with the yellow dot. Breathe in as the dot goes up, breathe out as it goes down.\n\nThe default setting is a 3 minute long exercise. This is what it takes to lower your level of stress. \nYou can gradually increase the exercise lengths, but remember to exercise three times every day. Over one week of exercising you will notice the effects in your body.\n\nProbably the best investment you will ever make. If you use it!\n\nOther options:\n1. Turn the sea wave sounds on and off (the waves are synchronized to the specific 0,1Hz frequency)\n2. Choose the duration of the exercise; remember that the secret to stress   relief is practicing several times every day, so make it simple, use the Respiroguide!\n\nFor details access the following websites:\n- www.heartintelligence.com in English\n- www.nuvitaal.nu and www.hartfocus.nl in Dutch\n- www.emnergie.com in French\n************\nWe do appreciate your feedback!\n\nVital-EQ, the International Institute for Stress Management."

However, some people live a normal life with blood oxygen levels below 95%. \n\nThe Apple Watch can estimate your percentage of oxygen in your bloodstream and stores the data in the Health Store. With the Oxygen Saturation app, you always see your latest value directly on your wrist. This App supports all complications, so make your Apple watch a real Fitness Gadget!!\n\nHow to Use:\n-\tATTENTION: Oxygen Saturation only works if you have an Apple Watch Series 6, because this Apple Watch has the sensor you need to measure your oxygen saturation.\n-\tThe app needs to connect with the Apple’s Health app to display the recorded data on your Apple Watch, as complication or your Iphone.\n-\tUsing iOS 14 you can add a Widget to your home screen on your IPhone to display the latest measurement.\n- In case you are still not receiving any data, please open your Apple Health App and check if it is able to measure your oxygen saturation."

Thus, the flavor enhancers, in certain soups, identified as E 621, E 627 and E 631 on the packaging have the following translation (which you will not find on the label): they are respectively, glutamate, guanylate and sodium inosinate. All three can trigger allergic reactions, asthma and are thus not recommended to people sensitive to them: you will not find the latter information on the label either!\n\nOur application will allow you to decode what the industry is trying to hide from you, by not only informing you of the risks and eventual contra-indications for people on a special diet (vegetarian, gluten, etc), but also by explaining the use of each additive and in which foods they are often used.\n\nThis is the result of summary work conducted by our editors with the help of sixteen carefully documented and much diversified sources. From them, we have extracted and gathered information, which is clearly referenced in the application, and noted each additive according to the following criteria :\n\n•\tSafe: no source indicates a risk.\n•\tSome doubts: at least one source refers to a risk.\n•\tSubstantial risks: several sources indicate the same risks.\n•\tTo be avoided: a majority of sources recommend that this additive be avoided.\n•\tNo risk info: the sources give insufficient information or none at all on the risks.\n\nFurthermore, for each product we indicate if it is authorised in Switzerland and in the European Union. For the latter we base our information on the new Regulation CE 1130/2011 that came into force on 2nd December 2013. When the product is banned in other countries, we indicate it at the top of the risks. We update those data as we receive information about any reliable changes. \n\nFor each additive, we mention the ADI (acceptable daily intake), which is the maximum dose of the additive that can be consumed daily by a person throughout their lifetime, without the JECFA experts (Joint Experts Committee for Food Additives) estimating that there is a danger. When known, it is expressed in milligrams of substance per kilogram of body weight. But the experts have often given up specifying it. More rare: we did not find any information about it. Sources: \"Les nouveau guide des additifs\", Anne-Laure Denans, 2017, and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) update sheets.\n\nRights and responsibilities  \n\nThe Editions Plus Sàrl as well as Konsumenteninfo AG decline all responsibility for any type of damages that could be caused in relation to the access or the use of this application.  info@bonasavoir.ch\n\n© Editions Plus Sàrl, CP 150, 1001 Lausanne, Suisse."

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

I love this app so glad I found it \nnauf4l: was planning to buy a 100$ jump rope which counts skips as i always do 5k skips a day. So after a month was considering this when i came across this app after installing 5 apps of the same.Glad i paid about 2$ for this as it is totally worth it. \nFrankWurst: Accurate jump counter based solely on Apple Watch. App integrates into My Health and Activity App seamlessly. Great product.\ntafty：I enjoy the skipping experience with this app. And it syncs well with Apple Watch\n\nContact me\nE-mail:89208242@qq.com\nTwitter: @haozes\nTelegram Group: t.me/yaoyaonow  \n\nDesign by Haozes\nThanks for the translation: 橙子、金小粉、孟金羽、蔡沛森、Adgar, Fabio Carrilho, Tomás Feliú Ribeiro, Francesco Tirsi, Leonard Pitt Diehl, Zhimin Yang, Massimiliano Benini,Radu Ionescu,Andrés Leon,Dikran Jessaijan, Krishna"

Celle-ci regroupe les explications sur les notions d'IG, CG et viendront s'étoffer aux fils du temps.\n\n► Alimentation :\nCette section regroupe plus de 530 aliments, chacun accompagné de son index glycémique (IG lorsqu'il est connu.\nLa fiche de l'aliment contient, quant à elle, bon nombres d'informations (selon l'aliment) :\n   • la charge glycémique (pour 100 g, pour une portion, et la portion maxi conseillée)\n   • bénéfices pour la santé\n   • informations sur la saison et comme choisir son fruit ou légume\n   • recommandations, astuces, alertes, conseils…\n   • nutriments (minéraux, vitamines, lipides, glucides, protéines, fibre, sel...)\n   • produits similaires (ex : Farine de blé, farine de pois chiche, farine de seigle...)\n   • produits dérivés (ex : pomme de terre, frites, purée de pommes de terre, chips)\n   • les portions \"normales\"\n   • Et bien d’autres choses encore…\n \n► Recettes :\nPlus de 600 recettes (avec charge glycémique) vous permettront de faire des bons plats sans culpabiliser car elles sont généralement compatibles avec les principaux régimes à Index Glycémique bas, ou s'appuient sur la Charge Glycémique (low carbs, régime paléolithique, la Méthode Montignac, le nouveau régime IG, le nouveau régime Atkins, le programme du docteur Cohen, le système de points de Weight Watchers, les recommandations du professeur Jennie-Brand Miller et du cardiologue Pierre Nys, ...)\n\n► Scanner d'aliment (nécessite une connexion Internet) :\nScannez le code-barres se trouvant sur l'emballage de l'aliment pour découvrir ce qu’il contient. Si le produit est référencé sur Open Food Facts, la liste des ingrédients sera récupérée et l’index glycémique s’affichera en face de chaque ingrédient, rendant plus facile la détection d’aliments néfastes comme le E190d (caramel), la maltodextrine ou encore le sirop de glucose-fructose… Le scanner tente d'estimer l'index glycémique ainsi que la charge glycémique de l'aliment scanné !\n\n\nVoici quelques cas d'utilisation expliquant comment utiliser l'application :\n-  Vous vous trouvez dans un restaurant et vous hésitez entre un accompagnement de pommes de terre ou de haricots verts ? Un rapide coup d’œil vous permettra de faire le bon choix.\n- Vous ne vous souvenez pas de l’index glycémique de la pomme ? Le tableau des aliments répondra à cette question.\n- Prendre un jus d’orange au petit déjeuner, est-ce une bonne idée ? Cette réponse se trouve dans l’application\n- Vous faites vos courses et, en passant devant une moussaka, vous vous demandez si elle est bénéfique pour votre santé ? Un petit scan du code-barres fera ressortir tous les aliments cachés qui sont parfois néfastes pour la santé ou pour la perte de poids.\n- Vous avez envie de bien manger  mais vous ne savez pas quoi préparer ? Plus de 600 recettes vous attendent dans l’application\n- Vous êtes à l’étranger et vos applications habituelles ne fonctionnent pas sans internet ?

This app by Meditation Oasis™ provides an easy way to apply the principles of healthy eating from Ayurveda to our everyday food choices.\n\nAccording to Ayurveda, the qualities of your mind and body are determined by three biological \"energies\" or principles called \"doshas\" -- vata, pitta and kapha. Each individual has a unique combination of these three bio-energies that result in their mind-body type or constitution. By determining your basic constitution and assessing your current imbalances, you will be able to modify your diet to create greater balance. \n\nApp Features:\n\n Basic Constitution Quiz to help you easily determine your mind-body type\n Current Imbalance Quiz to find out your dosha imbalances\n Extensive Food Properties Table of over 150 items giving each food's properties and suitability for your mind-body type\n Detailed instructions for choosing the right foods to balance the doshas\n A Dosha Clock that automatically shows the dosha for the season and time of day\n Sample food plans for people with three different constitutions\n Eating Tips for good digestion\n\nThe benefits of following an Ayurvedic diet are:\n\n more energy\n better digestion\n normalization of body weight\n improved overall health and well-being\n clarity of mind\n\nThe information in this app is based on ancient Ayurvedic texts and the experience of over 25 years of applying these principles to daily life. Richard Maddux studied Ayurveda in India with Vaidya V. M. Dwivedi, Vaidya B. D. Triguna, and Vaidya Balraj Maharishi."

Jeden zweiten Tag wird zum Ausgleich eine Faszieneinheit aus der separaten Faszien-App trainiert.\n\nUm gesund älter zu werden, benötigen wir Variation in unseren Workouts: Wir müssen Kraft aufbauen um Muskelverlust vorzubeugen, die Faszien sollen geschmeidig, die Gelenke beweglich bleiben. Auch das Herz-Kreislaufsystem muss trainiert werden, damit wir nicht bei der ersten leichten Steigung ausser Atem geraten. Der ganze Körper muss dafür möglichst täglich und mit System mobilisiert werden. \n\nDies alles berücksichtigt Mein Muskel-Faszien Training, Barbara Beckers innovatives „Better Aging“ Programm, das gemeinsam mit Sport- und Physiotherapeuten entwickelt wurde.\n\n10 bis 12 Minuten am Tag reichen um die Grundfitness und Beweglichkeit zu erhalten. Ein kleiner Aufwand mit großer Wirkung. Und ganz nebenbei formen die Übungseinheiten auch noch eine super Figur!"

      "label": "AutoWake is the first haptic smart alarm for your Watch. \n\nIt can wake you up by tapping you on your wrist using your Watch's haptic engine. You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

      "label": "Eating sweets has many health disadvantages. The sugar contained in sweets has a negative effect on your body and your well-being. To prevent this, we have developed this app for you.\n\nWhat happens in the body when you eat sugar? Is fructose better than classic sugar? And what is sugar exactly?\n\nSugar is unhealthy.\n\nOur body gets its energy from the three main nutrients fat, protein and carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are made up of sugar molecules. It is important to distinguish between simple carbohydrates - for example from sweets and classic table sugar - and complex carbohydrates, which you can find in whole grains and vegetables, for example.\n\nWhen people talk about “unhealthy sugar”, they usually mean classic table sugar and simple carbohydrates from confectionery and white flour. Complex carbohydrates are metabolized completely differently and are useful and healthy sources of energy. However, you should keep your hands off classic sugar. Why? For these 4 reasons.\n\nSugar makes you fat\nAll carbohydrates are first broken down by the body into their individual building blocks. What's left is glucose. Glucose is metabolized with the help of the hormone insulin. The insulin ensures that the sugar gets to the cells where it is needed in the form of energy.\nThe more sugar you eat, the more insulin is released. So too much sugar messes up and skyrockets your insulin levels. This is unfavorable in two ways: On the one hand, the hormone reduces fat burning. On the other hand, after such insulin spikes, the amount of sugar in the blood quickly drops to an absolute minimum again. The result: renewed cravings for sugar. This creates a vicious circle that causes you to constantly ingest sugar and increase your daily caloric intake.\n\nSugar is addicting\nSugar ensures that more dopamine is released in the brain's reward center. The happiness hormone evokes a good mood and feelings of happiness. Unfortunately only for a short time. As soon as the effects wear off, the brain craves for more. This creates a vicious circle that leads you to eat more and more sugar.\n\nSugar makes you sick\nThis is nothing new. Obesity, type 2 diabetes and tooth decay are the most well-known dangers associated with too much sugar. Studies also indicate that too much concentrated fructose in particular favors the formation of invisible but unhealthy fat that is deposited between and around the organs. Isolated fructose, which is used to sweeten fruit drinks and sweets, also inhibits the hormone leptin, which is responsible for feeling full.\n\nSugar makes you look old\nIf you eat too much sugar at once, your body cannot completely convert it into energy. The excess sugar molecules then combine with proteins that are responsible for the elasticity of your skin. The result: Unsightly wrinkles.\nThese compounds of sugar and protein also bind to the receptors of immune cells and thus promote inflammation and poor blood circulation in the skin. In short: the more sugar, the more unsightly the complexion.\n\nWith the help of this app you can stop eating sweets overnight and follow your positive health progress.\nThis app also gives you the opportunity to save money.\nThanks to the push notification, you will always be rewarded to stop eating sweets.\n\nHave fun living healthy."

How to stimulate your baby's mental development and help him turn his 10 predictable, great, fussy phases into magical leaps forward describes the incredible mental developmental changes (leaps) and regression periods that all babies go through. Understanding the real reason behind crying, eating and sleeping problems is the only real solution every parent needs. The Wonder Weeks reveals what’s going on inside baby’s mind.\n\nThe audio-book includes:\n•\tWeek-by-week guide to baby's behavior\n•\tWhen to expect the fussy behavior, what this implies (cranky, clingy, crying (the three C's) behavior) and how to deal with these regression periods (leaps)\n•\tA description from your baby's perspective of the world around him and how you can understand the changes he's going through\n•\tFun games and gentle activities you can do with your child\n\nThe audio book is based on the scientific- and parental-world-changing discovery of a phenomenon: all normal, healthy babies appear to be more fussy at very nearly the same ages, regression periods, and sleep less in these phases.\n\nThese age-related fluctuations in need for body contact and attention (regression periods) are related to major and quite dramatic changes in the brains of the children. These changes enable a baby to enter a whole new perceptual world and, as a consequence, to learn many new skills. This should be a reason for celebration, but as far as the baby is concerned these changes are bewildering. He's taken aback—everything has changed overnight. It is as if he has woken up on a strange planet. He needs you to guide him and understand what he is going through! Get ready to rediscover the world all over again with your baby…"

      "label": "Pado is all about geo tracking.\n\n\nRECORD TRACKS/ROUTES\n\nThis App provides several easy and powerful ways to record tracks or routes (for example of your hiking or cycling tours, of your trips with a motorcycle or car, workouts like jogging etc.), draw them on a map  and analyze them graphically using speed and altitude profiles and bar charts.\n\nYou can start and stop recording a track manually but also fully automatically in the background, without any user interaction. Just tell the App to start and stop the recording when leaving or entering certain regions, you can even limit the recording to a certain time period, and the App will do the rest automatically.\n\nThe tracks can be exported and imported as GPX and KML.\n\nEspecially for sports activity, the App can give you status updates about speed, duration and distance using Speech output.\n\n\nSTEP COUNTER\n\nPado also has a step counter (on devices with the required hardware).\n\n\nTIME TRACKING\n\nThe App provides a Time Tracking feature, which will gives you an easy way to log your whereabouts at certain regions automatically. Just define the regions you want to observe, the App is doing the rest automatically. The logged data can be presented as bar chart and exported as text or CSV file.\n\n\nLOCATION-BASED ACTIONS\n\nWhen entering or leaving certain regions the App can automatically record tracks, post notifications, play music, trigger \"external\" actions using the \"WebHook\" protocol and more.\n\n\nICLOUD SYNC\n\nTracks and regions can be synced across devices using the iCloud. This makes it easy to record tracks on an iPhone and evaluate these later on a larger iPad screen.\n\n\nAPPLE WATCH\n\nPado also supports the Apple Watch (all models) and can be used fully autonomously to record tracks or routes (which means you do not need to take the iPhone with you to use the Watch App). This does even work on Apple Watch models without GPS hardware (in which case the location services do use WLAN networks nearby to get the geo location). All tracks can be displayed directly on the Watch on a Map, and you can zoom and scroll the map with the track. Alternatively you can also use the Watch App to remote control the iPhone App.\n\n\nHARDWARE REQUIREMENTS\n\nPado supports all iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Apple Watch devices. \nUnlike many other Apps, this App does also work great on iPod Touch and iPad models without GPS hardware (but you need to be within a region with a good WLAN coverage). On devices with GPS hardware it works best. The step counter requires an iPhone 5s or newer or an Apple Watch.\n\n\nHEALTH-KIT\n\nAs an option, Pado can use the heart rate data from Health-Kit and display it together with the recorded Track speed and pace charts. When recording tracks on the Apple Watch, Pado can also measure the heart rate. Pado will never store the heart rate data anywhere (neither within Pado nor externally), and will use the HealthKit data only when explicitly enabled in the settings.\n\n\nFINAL NOTES\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

They will be automatically placed in your AM and/or PM routine as recommended.\n\n\n• ADD CUSTOM PRODUCTS\n\nYou can add custom skincare products from other brands by selecting the option in the top-right menu in the Routine section or from the Custom tab in the Products section.\n\n\n• USE YOUR ROUTINE FOR LAYERING ADVICE\n\nThe products are listed in the recommended layering order, along with advice for when and how to use each product.\n\n\n• KEEP TRACK OF USAGE TO AVOID CONFLICTS\n\nEach morning and evening, check each product off your list to keep track of which treatments you have used. This will allow the app to prevent any conflicts by showing you which products should be avoided.\n\n\n• TRACK YOUR SKIN'S PROGRESS\n\nAny time you notice your skin is looking particularly good or bad, you can make a note of it by pressing on the face icon next to the morning or evening routine. You can also add a comment to note down more details for your own record and add photos to track your progress.\n\n\n• ADD PHOTOS\n\nYou can add photos of your skin to your diary tracker and also add photos of custom products.\n\n\n• REMINDERS & TIMERS\n\nYou can set up notifications to remind you about your daily skin regimen. You can also set timers for products which require a specific wait time. Both can be found in the Settings.\n\n\n\n*** Advanced App Customization ***\n\n• RE-ORDER YOUR ROUTINE\n\nIf you don't wish to follow the recommended layering order, you can choose to re-order the products to fully customize your routine by selecting the option from the top right menu (with 3 dots) of the Routine section. You can also change the order of the layer steps, for instance DECIEM recommends oils before moisturizers but some users prefer the other way around.\n\n\n• USE CONFLICTING PRODUCTS\n\nWhen we recommend not using a product due to conflicts with other products or because you've reached the usage limit, you can choose to ignore the warning and use it anyway. You will then have the option to permanently ignore conflicts on that specific product.\n\n\n• SCHEDULE PRODUCTS\n\nYou can choose specific days of the week for a product if you wish. For instance, you may wish to make it so that the \"AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution\" only appears in your routine on Tuesdays and Fridays.\nYou can also choose dates of the month, e.g. the 1st and 15th of every month.\nAnother useful option is to schedule products for every X days, so you could choose every 2 days to alternate.\n\n\n\n*** Recommended for skin concerns... ***\n\n• Dry & Dehydrated Skin: Achieve plump, healthy-looking hydrated skin.\n• Acne-Prone Skin: Reduce inflammation to help support clear skin.\n• Blemishes & Congestion: Reduce inflammation and brighten the skin.\n• Sensitive Skin: Keep your skin moisturized with this gentle routine.\n• Mature Skin & Wrinkles: Promote youthful skin and reduce the signs of aging.\n• Pigmentation Problems: Gently exfoliate and brighten skin tone.\n• Oily Skin: Rebalance your skin for a healthy, fresh look.\n\n\nPlease note, Skincare Routine (previously known as \"Skincare Regimen Organizer\") has no connection with DECIEM, The Ordinary or any other skincare brand."

Don't depend on other apps that might lose your data—Health Data Importer is battle-tested with thousands of users and supports all versions of Apple's Health XML format. Start fresh without a backup when you get your new device and easily import your existing health data.

Note: while we use iCloud Drive in the preview video, iCloud Drive does not need to be enabled in order to perform an import. Just send your import to yourself in Apple mail and open it with Health Data Importer.\n\nHealth Data Importer integrates with the HealthKit framework and Health.app to import your Health XML exports.\n\n◆ Testimonials ◆\n\n“Health Importer is the app I wish I had when I moved from the iPhone 6 Plus to the 6s Plus last year. [...]  Health Importer worked perfectly in my tests and I'm going to use it again as soon as I switch to an iPhone 7 Plus.” - Federico Viticci, Macstories\n\n“Health Data Importer does exactly what the name suggests. Download the app, then load it up on your fresh new iPhone. It will scan your iCloud backups for any health data, then import all of it over to your new phone.” - Thorin Klosowski, Lifehacker\n\n“I believe Health Data Importer to be the best way to move your Health data between two iPhones. It is simple, quick, and very reliable” - Sébastian Page, iDownloadBlog\n\n◆ Features ◆\n\n‣ Import multiple sources (Apple Watch, iPhone, or from third-party apps).\n‣ Fast, quick, efficient, and battle-tested—import all your health data in just a few seconds.\n‣ Supports all versions of Health apps XML exports.\n\n◆ Help and Support ◆\n\nIf you run into an issue, please email our team at support@lionheartsw.com. We've helped many customers import their data successfully and will try our best to help you too.\n\n◆ Health XML Splitter ◆\n\nHealth Data Importer has trouble handling large exports, so we've written a macOS tool, called Health XML Splitter, to help you split them up into smaller pieces. Health XML Splitter is available for free on the Mac App Store.\n\nHealth Data Importer's privacy policy: https://lionheartsw.com/software/health-importer/privacy.html\n\nHealth Data Importer's terms of use: https://lionheartsw.com/software/health-importer/terms.html"

It is commonly used by coaches and trainers to measure athlete fitness, or used as a pre-requisite for police, emergency and military organizations. \n\nThe standard test has 21 levels, and each level consists of a different number of shuttles. The test is performed by running between two markers placed 20 meters (65.6 feet) apart, at an increasing pace as indicated by the beeps. The test ends when you can no longer keep pace, or level 21 is completed.\n\nDetailed information about each test variation can be found in the app's online help."

This is called Brain Synchronization. Your conscious and subconscious function at the same electrical frequency allowing you to rewire your subconscious mind and reinforce your conscious desires.\n\nUsing Subliminal Vision Boards, you will take action towards your goals and dreams like never before! This time there is nothing holding you back from creating amazing and accelerated manifestations in your life!\n\n~ CREATIVE CONSCIOUS VISUALIZATION ~\n\nThe human brain thinks in images. The creative process of visualization is so powerful. The key is to add the exact images of what you want to manifest with absolutely no compromising! You can do this by using Google images or your own images. This feature allows you to focus and manifest the exact image and vision of what you want. \n\nCreate unlimited, fully customizable visualization boards targeting each area of your life.\n\nStart consciously creating your reality with positive and empowering images and affirmations and witness these intentions manifest into your reality.\n\n~ MIND AND BODY HEALING SOUND FREQUENCIES ~\n\nEach word that you see, speak, and hear from your visualization board carries a particular energy and frequency and every cell in your body is listening to every word. \n\nSound is energy. One of the most powerful features on this app is the ability to record your voice onto your vision board. Recording and listening to positive and empowering affirmations develops new brain rewiring scripts, bringing you into an accelerated alignment with the vision of your higher self.\n\nExperience the healing Solfeggio Frequencies ranging from 174hz – 963hz Ancient healing frequencies are set in beautiful soothing music created to release stress, remove energetic blockages and rebalance the spirit, mind, and body.\n\n~ SUBCONSCIOUS REPROGRAMMING ~ \n\nOur minds are like a computer that is being run by old software. This old software consists of thoughts and feelings of scarcity and old limiting Ideas and belief systems. Your subconscious has not been updated since you were a child. Those old beliefs and programs still run the adult that is you today, limiting your true potential by keeping you on the exact same patterns from the past.\n\nYour subconscious causes you to feel emotionally and physically uncomfortable whenever you attempt to do anything new or different. It goes against changing any of your established patterns of behavior.\n\nThe good news is your brain is capable of quickly unlearning limitation and rapidly becoming unlimited! \n\nUsing our unique Subliminal Take 5 feature, your subconscious learns the new story that you create on your visualization board. Each image and affirmation subliminally flashes at a speed that reprograms your subconscious. \n\nReverse negative limited beliefs of scarcity and low self-worth and start to reinforce positive and empowering thoughts and feelings of abundance and prosperity. \n\nDownload Subliminal Vision Boards and experience a life lived in Love, Joy and Alignment with your Higher Self. \n\nWarning: App contains flashing that can intensify certain patterns that can trigger a seizure in people with photosensitive epilepsy. Do not use while driving.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.subliminalvisionboards.com/terms-of-use"

It is important to break the habit of dropping into defeatist thoughts and attitudes and learn how to stop yourself from entering into a negative loop that blocks you from achieving your desired outcomes.\n\nThe Healing Your Thoughts App helps to shift the way you think throughout the day and will help to uplift you during challenging times. You are not denying any feelings you are experiencing. Rather it is a process of rephrasing your thoughts to change your train of thought which will lead you to a positive outcome.\n\nYou can program the app for the interval of when you would like to receive an alert of bells, a Tibetan bowl, or chimes being played. When you hear the alert you will read the message that asks you to reflect on: “What are you thinking about right now?” Your thoughts and words are seeds that when planted into your inner garden will grow into plants that do impact your life. It is important to cultivate a deep and rich inner garden to create true joy and health in your life.\n\nOnce you receive the alert go into the Library and tap on the category “word”, “phrase”, “blessing”, or “photo”. A word, phrase, blessing, or photo will appear that will inspire you to stop your current thinking and transmute/transform any negative thinking into positive thoughts. This will also help to shift your attitude and even create an inner smile.\n\nYou can use the words, phrases, blessings, or photos provided. Or you can upload your own.\n\nThe result will be that you will experience feeling more uplifted. In this way you feed yourself with love and light. This will improve your life, giving you more energy, and help you to be more creative in your life and in your work. You will be able to radiate love and light towards yourself, your loved ones, friends, co-workers, and into the world."

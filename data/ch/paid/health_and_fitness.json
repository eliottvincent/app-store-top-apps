As soon as you touch your iPhone or put your Watch back on in the morning then AutoSleep will know that you have finished sleeping. \n\nAs everyone is a little bit different. AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper. \n\nAutoSleep also works with HeartWatch our premier heart & activity monitoring app and writes your Sleep information to Apple Health. \n\n*Requires Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher.\n\nAwards\n-----------------\nBest of 2018\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1438574124/\n\nBest of 2019\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1484100916/\n\nBest of 2020\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1535572713/\n\nBest of 2021\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1591083005/\n\nBest of 2022\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1654240446"

I love this app so glad I found it \nnauf4l: was planning to buy a 100$ jump rope which counts skips as i always do 5k skips a day. So after a month was considering this when i came across this app after installing 5 apps of the same.Glad i paid about 2$ for this as it is totally worth it. \nFrankWurst: Accurate jump counter based solely on Apple Watch. App integrates into My Health and Activity App seamlessly. Great product.\ntafty：I enjoy the skipping experience with this app. And it syncs well with Apple Watch\n\nContact me\nE-mail:89208242@qq.com\nTwitter: @haozes\nTelegram Group: t.me/yaoyaonow  \n\nDesign by Haozes\nThanks for the translation: 橙子、金小粉、孟金羽、蔡沛森、Adgar, Fabio Carrilho, Tomás Feliú Ribeiro, Francesco Tirsi, Leonard Pitt Diehl, Zhimin Yang, Massimiliano Benini,Radu Ionescu,Andrés Leon,Dikran Jessaijan, Krishna"

      "label": "If you love working out with Apple Watch, but you need more advanced fitness stats, HealthFit is for you.\n\nBy analyzing the workout data stored in Apple Health, HealthFit provides the kind of indispensable tracking and insights you normally only get from premium subscription services. But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times. You can even log which bike or shoes you use, to monitor usage and flag when it’s time to replace them.\n\nHealthFit finds photos you take during your workouts automatically, bringing your activity feed to life with stunning images you can share on social media.\n\nRUNNING POWER ANALYSIS\n\nHealthFit provides advanced running power analysis with the automatically estimated critical power, the weighted average power, the power distribution chart by 25W Increments and the mean maximal power chart which shows your best average power for time periods of one second up to the length of your run.\n\nMULTISPORT AND INTERVAL WORKOUTS\n\nHealthFit is the only app to export multisport workouts as multisession activities\n\nSTATISTICS: UNCOVER HIDDEN FITNESS INSIGHTS\n\nApple Watch gathers so much fitness data, it can sometimes seem overwhelming. HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio.

      "label": "AutoWake is the first haptic smart alarm for your Watch. \n\nIt can wake you up by tapping you on your wrist using your Watch's haptic engine. You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

      "label": "Eating sweets has many health disadvantages. The sugar contained in sweets has a negative effect on your body and your well-being. To prevent this, we have developed this app for you.\n\nWhat happens in the body when you eat sugar? Is fructose better than classic sugar? And what is sugar exactly?\n\nSugar is unhealthy.\n\nOur body gets its energy from the three main nutrients fat, protein and carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are made up of sugar molecules. It is important to distinguish between simple carbohydrates - for example from sweets and classic table sugar - and complex carbohydrates, which you can find in whole grains and vegetables, for example.\n\nWhen people talk about “unhealthy sugar”, they usually mean classic table sugar and simple carbohydrates from confectionery and white flour. Complex carbohydrates are metabolized completely differently and are useful and healthy sources of energy. However, you should keep your hands off classic sugar. Why? For these 4 reasons.\n\nSugar makes you fat\nAll carbohydrates are first broken down by the body into their individual building blocks. What's left is glucose. Glucose is metabolized with the help of the hormone insulin. The insulin ensures that the sugar gets to the cells where it is needed in the form of energy.\nThe more sugar you eat, the more insulin is released. So too much sugar messes up and skyrockets your insulin levels. This is unfavorable in two ways: On the one hand, the hormone reduces fat burning. On the other hand, after such insulin spikes, the amount of sugar in the blood quickly drops to an absolute minimum again. The result: renewed cravings for sugar. This creates a vicious circle that causes you to constantly ingest sugar and increase your daily caloric intake.\n\nSugar is addicting\nSugar ensures that more dopamine is released in the brain's reward center. The happiness hormone evokes a good mood and feelings of happiness. Unfortunately only for a short time. As soon as the effects wear off, the brain craves for more. This creates a vicious circle that leads you to eat more and more sugar.\n\nSugar makes you sick\nThis is nothing new. Obesity, type 2 diabetes and tooth decay are the most well-known dangers associated with too much sugar. Studies also indicate that too much concentrated fructose in particular favors the formation of invisible but unhealthy fat that is deposited between and around the organs. Isolated fructose, which is used to sweeten fruit drinks and sweets, also inhibits the hormone leptin, which is responsible for feeling full.\n\nSugar makes you look old\nIf you eat too much sugar at once, your body cannot completely convert it into energy. The excess sugar molecules then combine with proteins that are responsible for the elasticity of your skin. The result: Unsightly wrinkles.\nThese compounds of sugar and protein also bind to the receptors of immune cells and thus promote inflammation and poor blood circulation in the skin. In short: the more sugar, the more unsightly the complexion.\n\nWith the help of this app you can stop eating sweets overnight and follow your positive health progress.\nThis app also gives you the opportunity to save money.\nThanks to the push notification, you will always be rewarded to stop eating sweets.\n\nHave fun living healthy."

The Wonder Weeks reveals what’s going on inside baby’s mind.\n\nThe audio-book includes:\n•\tWeek-by-week guide to baby's behavior\n•\tWhen to expect the fussy behavior, what this implies (cranky, clingy, crying (the three C's) behavior) and how to deal with these regression periods (leaps)\n•\tA description from your baby's perspective of the world around him and how you can understand the changes he's going through\n•\tFun games and gentle activities you can do with your child\n\nThe audio book is based on the scientific- and parental-world-changing discovery of a phenomenon: all normal, healthy babies appear to be more fussy at very nearly the same ages, regression periods, and sleep less in these phases.\n\nThese age-related fluctuations in need for body contact and attention (regression periods) are related to major and quite dramatic changes in the brains of the children. These changes enable a baby to enter a whole new perceptual world and, as a consequence, to learn many new skills. This should be a reason for celebration, but as far as the baby is concerned these changes are bewildering. He's taken aback—everything has changed overnight. It is as if he has woken up on a strange planet. He needs you to guide him and understand what he is going through! Get ready to rediscover the world all over again with your baby…"

      "label": "Pado is all about geo tracking.\n\n\nRECORD TRACKS/ROUTES\n\nThis App provides several easy and powerful ways to record tracks or routes (for example of your hiking or cycling tours, of your trips with a motorcycle or car, workouts like jogging etc.), draw them on a map  and analyze them graphically using speed and altitude profiles and bar charts.\n\nYou can start and stop recording a track manually but also fully automatically in the background, without any user interaction. Just tell the App to start and stop the recording when leaving or entering certain regions, you can even limit the recording to a certain time period, and the App will do the rest automatically.\n\nThe tracks can be exported and imported as GPX and KML.\n\nEspecially for sports activity, the App can give you status updates about speed, duration and distance using Speech output.\n\n\nSTEP COUNTER\n\nPado also has a step counter (on devices with the required hardware).\n\n\nTIME TRACKING\n\nThe App provides a Time Tracking feature, which will gives you an easy way to log your whereabouts at certain regions automatically. Just define the regions you want to observe, the App is doing the rest automatically. The logged data can be presented as bar chart and exported as text or CSV file.\n\n\nLOCATION-BASED ACTIONS\n\nWhen entering or leaving certain regions the App can automatically record tracks, post notifications, play music, trigger \"external\" actions using the \"WebHook\" protocol and more.\n\n\nICLOUD SYNC\n\nTracks and regions can be synced across devices using the iCloud. This makes it easy to record tracks on an iPhone and evaluate these later on a larger iPad screen.\n\n\nAPPLE WATCH\n\nPado also supports the Apple Watch (all models) and can be used fully autonomously to record tracks or routes (which means you do not need to take the iPhone with you to use the Watch App). This does even work on Apple Watch models without GPS hardware (in which case the location services do use WLAN networks nearby to get the geo location). All tracks can be displayed directly on the Watch on a Map, and you can zoom and scroll the map with the track. Alternatively you can also use the Watch App to remote control the iPhone App.\n\n\nHARDWARE REQUIREMENTS\n\nPado supports all iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Apple Watch devices. \nUnlike many other Apps, this App does also work great on iPod Touch and iPad models without GPS hardware (but you need to be within a region with a good WLAN coverage). On devices with GPS hardware it works best. The step counter requires an iPhone 5s or newer or an Apple Watch.\n\n\nHEALTH-KIT\n\nAs an option, Pado can use the heart rate data from Health-Kit and display it together with the recorded Track speed and pace charts. When recording tracks on the Apple Watch, Pado can also measure the heart rate. Pado will never store the heart rate data anywhere (neither within Pado nor externally), and will use the HealthKit data only when explicitly enabled in the settings.\n\n\nFINAL NOTES\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

They will be automatically placed in your AM and/or PM routine as recommended.\n\n\n• ADD CUSTOM PRODUCTS\n\nYou can add custom skincare products from other brands by selecting the option in the top-right menu in the Routine section or from the Custom tab in the Products section.\n\n\n• USE YOUR ROUTINE FOR LAYERING ADVICE\n\nThe products are listed in the recommended layering order, along with advice for when and how to use each product.\n\n\n• KEEP TRACK OF USAGE TO AVOID CONFLICTS\n\nEach morning and evening, check each product off your list to keep track of which treatments you have used. This will allow the app to prevent any conflicts by showing you which products should be avoided.\n\n\n• TRACK YOUR SKIN'S PROGRESS\n\nAny time you notice your skin is looking particularly good or bad, you can make a note of it by pressing on the face icon next to the morning or evening routine. You can also add a comment to note down more details for your own record and add photos to track your progress.\n\n\n• ADD PHOTOS\n\nYou can add photos of your skin to your diary tracker and also add photos of custom products.\n\n\n• REMINDERS & TIMERS\n\nYou can set up notifications to remind you about your daily skin regimen. You can also set timers for products which require a specific wait time. Both can be found in the Settings.\n\n\n\n*** Advanced App Customization ***\n\n• RE-ORDER YOUR ROUTINE\n\nIf you don't wish to follow the recommended layering order, you can choose to re-order the products to fully customize your routine by selecting the option from the top right menu (with 3 dots) of the Routine section. You can also change the order of the layer steps, for instance DECIEM recommends oils before moisturizers but some users prefer the other way around.\n\n\n• USE CONFLICTING PRODUCTS\n\nWhen we recommend not using a product due to conflicts with other products or because you've reached the usage limit, you can choose to ignore the warning and use it anyway. You will then have the option to permanently ignore conflicts on that specific product.\n\n\n• SCHEDULE PRODUCTS\n\nYou can choose specific days of the week for a product if you wish. For instance, you may wish to make it so that the \"AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution\" only appears in your routine on Tuesdays and Fridays.\nYou can also choose dates of the month, e.g. the 1st and 15th of every month.\nAnother useful option is to schedule products for every X days, so you could choose every 2 days to alternate.\n\n\n\n*** Recommended for skin concerns... ***\n\n• Dry & Dehydrated Skin: Achieve plump, healthy-looking hydrated skin.\n• Acne-Prone Skin: Reduce inflammation to help support clear skin.\n• Blemishes & Congestion: Reduce inflammation and brighten the skin.\n• Sensitive Skin: Keep your skin moisturized with this gentle routine.\n• Mature Skin & Wrinkles: Promote youthful skin and reduce the signs of aging.\n• Pigmentation Problems: Gently exfoliate and brighten skin tone.\n• Oily Skin: Rebalance your skin for a healthy, fresh look.\n\n\nPlease note, Skincare Routine (previously known as \"Skincare Regimen Organizer\") has no connection with DECIEM, The Ordinary or any other skincare brand."

Don't depend on other apps that might lose your data—Health Data Importer is battle-tested with thousands of users and supports all versions of Apple's Health XML format. Start fresh without a backup when you get your new device and easily import your existing health data. Health Data Importer imports all Health data except Activity Summaries, Stand Hours, Exercise Time, and Nike Fuel data (these are API limitations).\n\nIf you ever have wanted to bring all of your health data onto a new phone without having to do a full iCloud restore, this is the app for you.\n\nTo see how easy it is, just watch the preview video (no sound). Note: while we use iCloud Drive in the preview video, iCloud Drive does not need to be enabled in order to perform an import. Just send your import to yourself in Apple mail and open it with Health Data Importer.\n\nHealth Data Importer integrates with the HealthKit framework and Health.app to import your Health XML exports.\n\n◆ Testimonials ◆\n\n“Health Importer is the app I wish I had when I moved from the iPhone 6 Plus to the 6s Plus last year. [...]  Health Importer worked perfectly in my tests and I'm going to use it again as soon as I switch to an iPhone 7 Plus.” - Federico Viticci, Macstories\n\n“Health Data Importer does exactly what the name suggests. Download the app, then load it up on your fresh new iPhone. It will scan your iCloud backups for any health data, then import all of it over to your new phone.” - Thorin Klosowski, Lifehacker\n\n“I believe Health Data Importer to be the best way to move your Health data between two iPhones. It is simple, quick, and very reliable” - Sébastian Page, iDownloadBlog\n\n◆ Features ◆\n\n‣ Import multiple sources (Apple Watch, iPhone, or from third-party apps).\n‣ Fast, quick, efficient, and battle-tested—import all your health data in just a few seconds.\n‣ Supports all versions of Health apps XML exports.\n\n◆ Help and Support ◆\n\nIf you run into an issue, please email our team at support@lionheartsw.com. We've helped many customers import their data successfully and will try our best to help you too.\n\n◆ Health XML Splitter ◆\n\nHealth Data Importer has trouble handling large exports, so we've written a macOS tool, called Health XML Splitter, to help you split them up into smaller pieces. Health XML Splitter is available for free on the Mac App Store.\n\nHealth Data Importer's privacy policy: https://lionheartsw.com/software/health-importer/privacy.html\n\nHealth Data Importer's terms of use: https://lionheartsw.com/software/health-importer/terms.html"

Conconi-Test (Fahrrad/Lauf) und 12 Minuten Test sind bewährte Testverfahren, die zur Verfügung stehen. Die Herzfrequenzkurve und die Analyse werden direkt auf deinem Gerät berechnet, gespeichert und angezeigt und es werden dir persönliche Trainingsempfehlungen abgegeben. \nAls Testleiter hast du die Conconi-Signale für 6, 8 und 10 Km/Std. immer dabei.\n\nWICHTIG: die App setzt einen Pulsfrequenzmesser auf Basis \"Bluetooth Smart\" voraus und ein iPhone 4S oder höher."

It is commonly used by coaches and trainers to measure athlete fitness, or used as a pre-requisite for police, emergency and military organizations. \n\nThe standard test has 21 levels, and each level consists of a different number of shuttles. The test is performed by running between two markers placed 20 meters (65.6 feet) apart, at an increasing pace as indicated by the beeps. The test ends when you can no longer keep pace, or level 21 is completed.\n\nDetailed information about each test variation can be found in the app's online help."

This is called Brain Synchronization. Your conscious and subconscious function at the same electrical frequency allowing you to rewire your subconscious mind and reinforce your conscious desires.\n\nUsing Subliminal Vision Boards, you will take action towards your goals and dreams like never before! This time there is nothing holding you back from creating amazing and accelerated manifestations in your life!\n\n~ CREATIVE CONSCIOUS VISUALIZATION ~\n\nThe human brain thinks in images. The creative process of visualization is so powerful. The key is to add the exact images of what you want to manifest with absolutely no compromising! You can do this by using Google images or your own images. This feature allows you to focus and manifest the exact image and vision of what you want. \n\nCreate unlimited, fully customizable visualization boards targeting each area of your life.\n\nStart consciously creating your reality with positive and empowering images and affirmations and witness these intentions manifest into your reality.\n\n~ MIND AND BODY HEALING SOUND FREQUENCIES ~\n\nEach word that you see, speak, and hear from your visualization board carries a particular energy and frequency and every cell in your body is listening to every word. \n\nSound is energy. One of the most powerful features on this app is the ability to record your voice onto your vision board. Recording and listening to positive and empowering affirmations develops new brain rewiring scripts, bringing you into an accelerated alignment with the vision of your higher self.\n\nExperience the healing Solfeggio Frequencies ranging from 174hz – 963hz Ancient healing frequencies are set in beautiful soothing music created to release stress, remove energetic blockages and rebalance the spirit, mind, and body.\n\n~ SUBCONSCIOUS REPROGRAMMING ~ \n\nOur minds are like a computer that is being run by old software. This old software consists of thoughts and feelings of scarcity and old limiting Ideas and belief systems. Your subconscious has not been updated since you were a child. Those old beliefs and programs still run the adult that is you today, limiting your true potential by keeping you on the exact same patterns from the past.\n\nYour subconscious causes you to feel emotionally and physically uncomfortable whenever you attempt to do anything new or different. It goes against changing any of your established patterns of behavior.\n\nThe good news is your brain is capable of quickly unlearning limitation and rapidly becoming unlimited! \n\nUsing our unique Subliminal Take 5 feature, your subconscious learns the new story that you create on your visualization board. Each image and affirmation subliminally flashes at a speed that reprograms your subconscious. \n\nReverse negative limited beliefs of scarcity and low self-worth and start to reinforce positive and empowering thoughts and feelings of abundance and prosperity. \n\nDownload Subliminal Vision Boards and experience a life lived in Love, Joy and Alignment with your Higher Self. \n\nWarning: App contains flashing that can intensify certain patterns that can trigger a seizure in people with photosensitive epilepsy. Do not use while driving.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.subliminalvisionboards.com/terms-of-use"

      "label": "The Healing Your Thoughts App improves your state of health and well being by assisting you to transform your negative thoughts that arise throughout the day. It is important to break the habit of dropping into defeatist thoughts and attitudes and learn how to stop yourself from entering into a negative loop that blocks you from achieving your desired outcomes.\n\nThe Healing Your Thoughts App helps to shift the way you think throughout the day and will help to uplift you during challenging times. You are not denying any feelings you are experiencing. Rather it is a process of rephrasing your thoughts to change your train of thought which will lead you to a positive outcome.\n\nYou can program the app for the interval of when you would like to receive an alert of bells, a Tibetan bowl, or chimes being played. When you hear the alert you will read the message that asks you to reflect on: “What are you thinking about right now?” Your thoughts and words are seeds that when planted into your inner garden will grow into plants that do impact your life. It is important to cultivate a deep and rich inner garden to create true joy and health in your life.\n\nOnce you receive the alert go into the Library and tap on the category “word”, “phrase”, “blessing”, or “photo”. A word, phrase, blessing, or photo will appear that will inspire you to stop your current thinking and transmute/transform any negative thinking into positive thoughts. This will also help to shift your attitude and even create an inner smile.\n\nYou can use the words, phrases, blessings, or photos provided. Or you can upload your own.\n\nThe result will be that you will experience feeling more uplifted. In this way you feed yourself with love and light. This will improve your life, giving you more energy, and help you to be more creative in your life and in your work. You will be able to radiate love and light towards yourself, your loved ones, friends, co-workers, and into the world."

      "label": "How can fruit and vegetable juices improve our physical condition, our health and our productivity?\n\nTo answer this question, we need to widen our views a bit and consider nutrition from a broader perspective.\n\n- The three times of food\nThis concept, proposed by Eben Pagan, suggests to consider the meals we eat in 3 different times:\n\n- 1. Immediately\nThe real-time experience of food: is good or bad?\n- 2. In the short term\nThe 2-3 hours that follow: if we feel energetic and effective, or heavy and listless\n- 3. Long-term\nWhat we eat affects our health for the rest of our lives, for example, it can add or remove fat from our body, promote or weaken our immune system, encourage or discourage the occurrence of degenerative diseases etc.\n\nIn this regard, we have to evaluate each meal in these three time periods, on a scale from 1 to 10.\n\nWhen you decide what to eat, ask yourself how much its value is from 1 to 10 in terms of:\n- Taste: do I like to eat it?\n- Energy: in the next 2-3 hours, how effectively will it give me energy?\n- Health in the long term: how does it affect my immune system, how does it affect the occurrence of diseases, how does it affect the rest of my life.\nIn 10 years, will I be proud to have eaten this meal?\n\nAlmost all of us are in the constant search for a 9 or 10 in the immediate. And in order to get it we are often willing to accept a 2, 3 or 4 in the short term. If it is not too heavy on the stomach or if we do not feel too much strain in digestion, that's fine... it's enough it has a good flavor.\n\nFor the long term, we have no idea how this food is going to affect our body and our immune system. So for example when we get sick, we feel depressed, when we have little desire to do anything, when we have problems in our relationships or go through periods where we feel apathetic and listless, we never put that in relationship with what we regularly eat and with the fact that food can have an effect on our health, our emotional state and our lives in general.\n\nMost of us eat almost exclusively for pleasure, for entertainment.\n\nWhat we should want for ourselves, is a 10 for the next 2 or 3 hours in terms of energy and mental clarity, and a 10 for our health, to limit the possibility of getting sick and to have a strong and responsive immune system throughout the course of our lives. And for this, we can also be prepared to accept a 5 or 6 (or maybe a 7) in the instant gratification that food can give us. In the immediate maybe we will not have the maximum enjoyment, but within 3 hours we will have energy and lucidity to the highest levels, and we will know that this meal will help to influence our health in a positive way in the long term, and we will be proud of this decision.\n\nFruits and vegetables juices are the best you can give yourself for the short and the long term!\n\nFeatures of the current version:\n- 52 Selected recipes\n- 40 Fact sheets of food with nutritional properties\n- High Quality photos\n- Therapeutic features food\n- Recommended seasons\n- Ability to filter according to the season, food and benefits\n- Select the ingredients you have at home to find which recipes you can achieve.\n- Ability to save favorite recipes\n- Practical tips for getting the most from one's eating habits\n- \"Pantry\" mode: select the ingredients you have at home to find which recipes you can achieve!\n- Ability to share recipes with friends or on major Social Networks\n\nFor suggestions and information:\ncanali.nicola@gmail.com\n\nFacebook page:\nwww.facebook.com/centrifugoapp\n\nNote:\nAn internet connection is required to update the database of the recipes.\n\nDislcaimer:\nThis information is the result of personal research on books and websites.

      "label": "Die Progressive Muskelentspannung (PME) nach Edmund Jacobson ist eine wissenschaftlich anerkannte Entspannungsmethode, die über Muskelanspannung und Entspannung dazu verhilft, in einen Zustand der Tiefenentspannung zu gelangen. Die PME ist eine - wissenschaftlich erwiesen - sehr wirksame Entspannungsmethode; sie wird von Ärzten bei zahlreichen meist stressbedingten Symptomen empfohlen wie z.B.:\n\n• Verspannungen\n• Migräne oder Kopfschmerzen\n• innere Unruhe\n• Schlafstörungen\n• Rücken-/Schmerzen\n• Erregungszustände, Prüfungsangst\n• Angst- und Panikattacken\n• Bluthochdruck\n• psychosomatischen Beschwerden\n\nMit regelmäßiger Übung wird es immer besser gelingen, in noch tiefere Entspannungszustände zu geraten. Sobald man genügend Übung und Erfahrung mit der ausführlichen Form der Progressiven Muskelentspannung (GRUNDFORM: 17 Muskelgruppen / ANFÄNGER-Status) hat, kann auch zu den kürzeren Varianten (Kurzformen) mit 7 und 4 Muskelgruppen übergegangen werden und schließlich wird es leicht fallen, sich bzw. auch einzelne Körperpartien mit dem Body Scan rein mental zu entspannen. Es sollte zu Beginn bei allen Formen der Übungsstatus ANFÄNGER gewählt werden.\n\nIn dieser App werden alle 4 Formen der PME (Grund- und 2 Kurzformen sowie die Mentale Form) angeleitet und geübt.\n\nGRUNDFORM: 17 MUSKELGRUPPEN\n1. Rechte Hand und Unterarm\n2. Rechter Oberarm\n3. Linke Hand und Unterarm\n4. Linker Oberarm \n5. Stirn\n6. Obere Wangenpartie und Nase\n7. Untere Wangenpartie und Kiefer\n8. Nacken \n9. Brust, Schultern und obere Rückenpartie\n10. Bauchmuskulatur\n11. Gesäß- und Beckenboden\n12. Rechter Oberschenkel\n13. Rechter Unterschenkel \n14. Rechter Fuß\n15, 16, 17 (-> linke Seite)\n\nKURZFORM I: 7 MUSKELGRUPPEN\n1. Rechte Hand, Unterarm und Oberarm\n2. Linke Hand, Unterarm und Oberarm\n3. Stirn, Wangenpartie, Nase und Kiefer\n4. Nacken \n5. Brust, Schultern, Rücken, Bauch-, Gesäß und Beckenboden\n6. Rechter Oberschenkel, Unterschenkel und Fuß\n7. Linker Oberschenkel, Unterschenkel und Fuß\n\nKURZFORM II: 4 MUSKELGRUPPEN\n1. Beide Hände, Unterarme und Oberarme\n2. Gesichts- und Nackenmuskulatur\n3. Brust, Schultern, Rücken, Bauch-, Gesäß- und Beckenboden\n4. Beide Oberschenkel, Unterschenkel und Füße\n\nMENTALE FORM: BODY-SCAN\nGeführte Entspannung durch den ganzen Körper bis zu den Füßen, diesmal beginnend mit Gesichts, Unterkiefer und Nacken. Diese Anleitung ist die letzte Stufe der PME, bei der die Wahrnehmung auf einzelne Körperteile gelenkt wird, ohne diese anzuspannen. Die Entspannung erfolgt jetzt nur noch mental. Hilfreiche Vorstellungen (Sonne, Strand, Meer) können dabei unterstützen (wählbar).\n\nÜBUNGS-STATUS\nFür alle Formen der PME kann zudem der Übungsdauer-Status \n- ANFÄNGER\n- FORTGESCHRITTEN\n- ERFAHREN\ngewählt werden. Damit stehen insgesamt 12 vollständige Versionen der PME zu Verfügung.\n\nLIEGEND / SITZEND\nAlle Formen werden wahlweise jeweils im Sitzen oder Liegen angeleitet.\n\nMUSIK & NATUR-SOUNDS\nEs kann aus 5 Entspannungsmusiken und 18 Natur-Sounds gewählt werden, die sich jeweils untereinander und an die Lautstärke der Stimme anpassen lassen. Falls gewünscht können Musik/Sounds auch alleine (ohne Stimme) zur Entspannung bzw. zum Einschlafen genutzt werden. Es können auch 2 Natur-Sounds gleichzeitig kombiniert werden.\n\nEINSCHLAFEN - RÜCKNAHME - OHNE OUTRO\nAlle Übungen können wahlweise zum Einschlafen, zur Entspannung mit Rücknahme und ohne Outro verwendet werden. \n\nDAUER DER ANSPANNUNG\nDie Dauer der Anspannung der Muskelgruppen kann ausgewählt werden. Überwiegend wird eine Anspannung von 5 Sek. empfohlen.\n\nPAUSEN ZUM ENTSPANNEN\nDie Dauer der Pausen zwischen den Muskelgruppen kann nach eigenen Vorlieben und Übungsstand angepasst werden. Überwiegend wird eine Dauer von 20 Sek. empfohlen.\n\nTIMER\nAuf alle Übungen kann eine beliebig lange Zeit für die Entspannungsmusik & Natur-Sounds eingestellt werden, die die Entspannung vertiefen.\n\nHINWEISE\nDie App kann / sollte sogar im Flugmodus (offline) genutzt werden.\nDie App enthält keine Werbung, Abos, In-App-Käufe."

Import GPX files.\n\nRunner's Log makes it easy to record the results of a running session in a matter of seconds. You can also use Runner's Log to review your running history, and plan new routes for future running sessions.\n\nYou can simply use GPS if using an iPhone or, when you return from a run, use Runner's Log to record your session: The date, route, and shoes used are all automatically filled in based on defaults. The time spent on your last run for the route is also presented as the default. Simply adjust the minutes or seconds and you are done! Your pace will be shown to you.\n\nTo plan a new route to try in your neighborhood, go to the routes tab and bring up the map, which centers on your current location. Simply tap points on the map in order to create your route. When done, the route distance is automatically computed. If you run this route frequently, you can set it as the default.\n\nRunner's Log makes it a cinch to keep track of shoe mileage. Any unlogged mileage already on your shoes can be added to the total tracked. You can track each pair separately, and you can choose a pair of shoes to be the default for new running sessions. When a pair is ready to be retired, you can mark it as such.\n\nYou can view a calendar showing which days you ran recently. This makes it easy to decide if you are due for a run today, or should take a break. You can also view statistics and charts showing weekly, monthly, and yearly summaries of your distance, time and pace, as well as the accumulated mileage put on your shoes. You can focus on runs of a particular type by filtering by tags.\n\n“Runner’s Log is a fantastic application for keeping track of your runs.” —⁠makeuseof.com\n\n“Aesthetically, Runner's Log is really nice.

      "label": "This application is a sidekick to the beastmaker 1000 and 2000. It has been designed to assist the user into gradually getting stronger on a fingerboard. The app does this by way of prewritten workouts which are often general and aim to improve all trainable grips on the board. Some are specific (2000 series only at the moment) which aim to improve, sloper strength, pocket strength and crimp strength. \n\nThere is also a new custom workout program fully adjustable and includes the 1000,2000 and micros, so if you have your own hang regime and different timings then that is all programmable and can be saved.\n\nBoth the workouts and custom timer now record hang contraction time (time spent actually hanging off the board) We recommend most users get up to around 20:00 minutes on this clock whilst doing their workouts.\n\nOn the Workout screen after you've selected your work out it is now possible to adjust set and hang times. Users who are only finger boarding and are having a rest day prior to and after training may wish to do up to 3 sets and 7 hangs. Other users may prefer to go for 2 sets and 6 hangs, this is what we'd consider an average and more suited to people doing additional types of training.\n\nPlease note the grades for the workouts aren't actually meant to relate to anything other than themselves. E.G. 5c is easier than 6a but harder than 5b. If you find 5a hard on the 1000, use a weight removal technique such as putting one foot on a chair in front of the board or using a pulley with weights on. More advice on this and other things are available in the general advice section on the Workout Ratings page.\n\nTo record your hangs press the record button (red circle icon) whilst resting. The Workout Ratings function is much improved and should now be a really useful training aid which records gradual progress and improvement.\n\nFingerboard gains take time, remember to warm up thoroughly and move on to more difficult hangs at a slightly slower pace than you think you should to give pulleys time to catch up with muscles. For example 10% strength gains over a year is brilliant improvement. 5% is still effective training.\n\nBest of luck with the training, happy hanging and we hope this helps with the motivation."

      "label": "** The app is not working under iPad 4, iPhone 6\n\nEye Exerciser is an eye training program designed to improve eyesight. When you exercise your eyes, you move your eye muscles to create up-and-down, side-to-side or circular motion. You also work the muscles controlling back-and-forth movement of your eye's natural lens, to help achieve sight at multiple distances without eyeglasses.\n\nOften, when people use their mobile devices, they tend to watch one spot for a very long time.  This causes the eye muscles to stiffen and eyesight to gradually decline. As for me, I've looked at the screen a lot since I was young. Eventually, my eyes are getting stiff and I have an eye disease that is kind of blind when I'm tired. The aim of Eye Exerciser is to stimulate the muscles of the eyes and thereby, improve your vision(your visual acuity).  Eye Exerciser includes various programs to exercise your eyes in different ways. If you use Eye Exerciser daily, your vision will gradually improve.  \n\nThe Eye Exerciser app is a universal app working on iPhone and iPad. If you buy one, then you can use on both devices.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n* Basic eye muscle exercises - Basic exercises help you strengthen and stretch muscles of your eyes.\n* Advanced eye muscle exercises - Advanced exercises make your eyes use more fine muscles than Basic Program. It may be hard to do exercise but Advanced Program gives better effects.\n* Saccade exercise - A saccade is a fast movement of an eye. It can also be a fast shift in frequency of an emitted signal or other quick change.\n* Infinity swing exercises - Infinity Swing exercises use the whole of the muscles of your eyes by rolling them around.\n* Spiral exercises - Spiral exercises use the whole of the muscles of your eyes by rolling them around.\n* And more exercises are being developed :)\n\n\nKEEP IN MIND WHILE DOING EXERCISES\n\n* Regular exercise is important - It’s not easy to improve eyesight right away. It takes a long time to achieve your goal. Set the time to do exercise every day.\n* Open your eyes as wide as possible - During exercise, open your eyes as wide as possible to get effective result.\n* Keep the distance from the screen - The recommended distance is about 6 inches(15cm) - 10 inches(25cm) with the phone and 10 inches - 13 inches (25cm - 35cm) with the tablet.\n\n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR FEEDBACK\n\nSince 2011(almost 5 years), eye doctors and their patients have used Eye Exerciser and provided feedbacks to help make the app more effective. We really appreciate these people. Eye Exerciser update with more exercise programs and functions periodically. Please help to make the app even more effective by giving your feedback.\n\n\nCUSTOMER REVIEWS OF EYE EXERCISER\n\n“Great way to train vision for speed with visual tracking and saccadic movements.”\n\n“As bad as my eyes are I have taught them to be better using exercises like this app does than any eye doc ever was able to help.”\n\n“Used this app for one day taking care to maintain proper distance. When the exercises ended, my eyes felt as though they had a good workout. I will continue to use this app.”\n\n“I, like you, get tired eyes from looking into computers, books, TV and other people's eyes. I also have been wearing glasses since 1st grade, and at 58, I am now wearing progressive trifocals. This application has been a GOD send for the last four (4) years. Thank you!! The exercises are easy to follow and have worked wonders with my eye health. The recent improvements in the circular and spiral exercises are amazing.”"

      "label": "RESPIROGUIDE PRO: THE NEWEST VERSION, MORE PERSONAL \n\n“Simple and amazingly effective for better concentration, stress anxiety, ADHD and trauma healing” –  Kees L. Blase, medical physicist,  National Centre for Stress Management,The Netherlands.\n\nRespiroguide PRO is brought to you by Vital-EQ the International Institute for Stress Management.\n**********\nTHE ABC of STRESSMANAGEMENT\nRespiroguide uses the most recent research in neurosciences and stress management, research that has been condensed into the most convenient one-touch tool. The knowledge is based on the heart's resonant frequency  which induces heart and breath coherence.\nRespiroguide Pro will train the reflexes and so the elasticity of your vascular system. This will help in lowering blood pressure, is effective in coping with stress and anxiety, and enhances better concentration at school and work. \nHeart rate is a dynamic body function that varies in each moment. \nIn an Active state (sympathic activity) heart rate increases, \nin a Calm and relaxed state heart rate decreases. \nCardiac Coherence is the Balanced  state of the autonomic nervous system in which you feel safe and happy, free from fear and anxiety and overstressed reactions.\nThe body can be brought into the state of Cardiac Coherence through guided breathing. Guiding the resonance frequency (Respiroguide Pro) can be compared with guiding someone on a swing by pushing at just the right moment to optimise their swing.   \nEach individual has his or her own personal respiratory frequency (resonance frequency) in which cardiac coherence is optimal. This ideal respiratory frequency is between 0,06 Hz and 0,12 Hz. The Respiroguide Pro will help you to find your personal resonance frequency, which depends on the length and width of your blood vessels. \nYou can set the guide in four different frequencies:\n1. Average: F6: 6 breaths a minute = 0,1 Hz\n2. Average: F5: 5 breaths a minute = 0,083 Hz\n3. Slow: F4: 4 breaths a minute = 0,066 Hz\n4. Quick: F7: 7 breaths a minute = 0,118 Hz\nTo find your resonance frequency it’s important to experience all four breathing frequencies and notice:\n-which one provides the most balanced feeling\n-which one can be comfortably sustained for a period of at least 5 minutes\n-which one gives a maximum amplitude in Heart Rate Variability. This last function requires  access to a HRV-biofeedback instrument with a Cardiac Coherence Coach.\nCardiac Coherence Coaches can be found at  www.hartfocus.nl (Netherlands) and www.heartintelligence.com/VitalEQ  (Europe, Asea). \nThe Respiroguide Pro is a medical tested safe device. More than 20 years of research showed positive effects:lowering bloodpressure, less anxiety, enhancing performance, coping with stress, effective treatment of trauma.Take care: do not  inhale too deeply, this occasionally make you dizzy. Focusing on the exhale is the most effective way. \n\nQUICK START: press the play button and just breathe in and out with the yellow dot. Breathe in as the dot goes up, breathe out as it goes down.\n\nThe default setting is a 3 minute long exercise. This is what it takes to lower your level of stress. \nYou can gradually increase the exercise lengths, but remember to exercise three times every day. Over one week of exercising you will notice the effects in your body.\n\nProbably the best investment you will ever make. If you use it!\n\nOther options:\n1. Turn the sea wave sounds on and off (the waves are synchronized to the specific 0,1Hz frequency)\n2. Choose the duration of the exercise; remember that the secret to stress   relief is practicing several times every day, so make it simple, use the Respiroguide!\n\nFor details access the following websites:\n- www.heartintelligence.com in English\n- www.nuvitaal.nu and www.hartfocus.nl in Dutch\n- www.emnergie.com in French\n************\nWe do appreciate your feedback!\n\nVital-EQ, the International Institute for Stress Management."

      "label": "Biofeedback is the future and the future is now - for everyone. No additional body sensors are needed anymore! Just take your iPhone and start VaYou.\n\nVaYou Breath is innovative sound biofeedback. The app connects you directly with yourself by transforming your abdominal breathing into dynamically generated sounds. \n\nIt is very simple! You breathe relaxed and VaYou generates sounds from it - directly shaped by your breathing. With the help of real-time biofeedback, your breath, mind and heart increasingly flow as one.\n\nVaYou Breath integrates with Apple Health by updating your values for resting heart rate, respiratory rate, and mindful minutes.\n\nKey VaYou benefits\n\n• Biometric Integration - VaYou provides advanced real-time breath and pulse detection without the need for additional wearables or expensive medical sensors.\n• We have gone to the technical limits. VaYou converts the iOS motion/acceleration sensor data stream into high quality biosignals for breath and pulse (pulse only in lying position).\n• In order to support the relaxation process, the VaYou algorithms learn from your biosignals and derived parameters how to best design the sounds so that they are most effective for you at that moment.\n• No online connection needed while using - activate airplane mode for an undisturbed and healthy experience!\n\nNo other app or desktop software provides biofeedback like VaYou Breath.\n\nJust listening to the breath-generated sounds leads you into a very personal flow experience. Your consciousness is more and more \"absorbed\" by the process, your thoughts come to rest. The mental state can be described as relaxed and calming breath mindfulness. It is almost automatic to \"stay with the breath\", easily and effortless.  \n\nUnlike with apps where you have to understand and follow spoken instructions, with VaYou Breath you can \"switch off\" right from the start. The resulting flow experience brings body and mind into harmony and this has a regenerating effect.\n\nThe regular use of VaYou Breath can have a generally positive effect on body and mind. Some of the reported effects are\n• Calming the flow of thoughts\n• Reduction of stress levels\n• Self regulation of the heart and breathing activity\n• Increase of creativity\n• Improvement of mood\n• Improvement of sleep.\n\nIT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT:\n\nPut on good headphones and choose one of the perfected Sound~Flows. Then select the duration, press START and place the iPhone on your lower abdomen, just below the navel. (It's usually better to loosen a belt if you wear one and slide the iPhone halfway into the belt line of your trousers or skirt.) Keep breathing and listening! \n\nLIVE 1 and LIVE 2 is the app's main biofeedback mode. To be even more flexible, there is also a PACING mode, in which an adjustable breathing rhythm is played, which you simply breathe along. Without the need to look at the screen.\n\nIt is actually very easy to get into your personal \"Flow~Breathing\" and to experience and enjoy the balancing positive effect. \n\nWHAT YOU GET:\n\n▪ The VaYou biofeedback algorithm that turns your breathing movements into amazing Sound~Flows\n▪ The \"Flow Journey\" Sound~Flow, which guides you through a universe of different breath~sound experiences up to 30 minutes duration\n▪ The \"Four Fully\" Sound~Flow for very effective and recreational short breaks\n▪ All other Sound~Flows can be downloaded as in-app purchases within the app. And of course you get them for your LIFETIME, even if you change or loose your device. \n\nPRICES:\n\n• No subscription, no automatic renewal\n• No hidden costs or unnecessarily large packages\n• You only pay what you really like and want.\n\nWishes, questions and feedback are always welcome: welcome@vayou.app\nor at https://vayou.app/usergroup\n\nVaYou is Time for You.\nNOW is Time for You!"

Therefore, the first step in self-improvement is raising awareness and to understand. Knowledge is power, selfcare is key! Moodistory helps you in understanding problems, fears and concerns. It supports you in increasing your problem-solving skills by discovering behavioral patterns (by e.g. analyzing your Year in Pixels chart) and triggers. Because Moodistory establishes facts about the history of your mood, you'll feel more in control!\n\n\nIT'S ABOUT YOU\n\nMoodistory was created with you in mind. We think that selfcare and keeping a mood diary are supposed to be fun, rewarding and easy to do.\nWe are adding new features with nearly every single update. But only with your help are we able to move into the right direction. We are fully committed to improving Moodistory with your feedback! \nIf you have any questions or feedback about our mood tracker, contact us at https://moodistory.com/contact/"

Push harder and feel better than you ever thought possible with custom cycling workouts from lolo!\n\nBeatBurn Indoor Cycling combines lolo's exclusive beat-sync technology with guidance from a real cycling coach, changing the beat of your music to match your pace within a training program specifically designed to take you to the next level without burning you out.\n\nBeat-sync analyzes the BPM (Beats Per Minute) of your music, selects the best songs from your playlist to fit the intensity of your workout, then changes the beat on the fly, perfectly matching your pace.\n Why does this matter? How does it help you? Research shows that music distracts the brain during exercise and faster music causes people to accept and even prefer a greater degree of effort. This means:\n • You will work harder without trying (or without even feeling the difference)\n• You will get better results from the increased effort\n • And most importantly, the time will fly by.\n\nFEATURES \n• beat-sync shifts the tempo of your music to match your pace.\n • Includes 12 tracks of high-energy music!  \n• A real voice guides and motivates you through your workouts – not a scary computer voice.\n • Fill out your profile and BeatBurn designs the perfect program. \n• Your program progresses, every day is a new challenge.\n• Adjust your workout at anytime using the interactive graph. \n• Sync your workouts to the Health app.\n• Compatible with most bluetooth heart rate monitors.\n• Track your history and share your progress through social media.\n\nBEAT-SYNC \nThere's nothing quite like the feeling of moving to the beat of your favorite song. That Saturday Night Fever strut? (YouTube it, kids) We wanted to have that feeling during every workout, so we built BeatBurn to dynamically change the beat of YOUR music to perfectly match your pace. Trust us, your workouts will feel easier even though you're actually working harder and burning more calories.  \n\nSMART PLAYLIST\nBeatBurn continuously analyzes your workout and picks the best songs to drive you through a great workout. \n \nINTERACTIVE PERSONAL TRAINER \nBeatBurn features an interactive personal trainer whose voice guides you through each workout, giving you the tips you need to get the most out of your workout and the motivation to keep going no matter how tough it gets. BeatBurn gives you complete control as you move through your workout. Turn the intensity down a bit when you're struggling or crank it up when you're ready for more, and your trainer adjusts your workout - and your music - on the fly.\n\nDESIGNED AROUND YOU \nWhether you're a beginner or an athlete, BeatBurn will design the perfect program to match your schedule and fitness level.\n\n  CHALLENGING\n BeatBurn workouts change up the intensity frequently to keep it fun and exciting and most importantly, to challenge your body. Each program uses a combination of intervals and pyramid training to mix up the intensity.  TRACKING BeatBurn keeps track of your intensity and calories burned, so you always know if you're on track to hit your personal fitness goal.\n\nSOCIAL SHARING \nYour personal network is key to reaching your goals. Share your successes with them through social media.\n\nWorks with Health\n- Completed workouts sync to the Health app, including distance, calories burned and duration."

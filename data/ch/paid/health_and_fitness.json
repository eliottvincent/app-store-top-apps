      "label": "If you love working out with Apple Watch, but you need more advanced fitness stats, HealthFit is for you.\n\nBy analyzing the workout data stored in Apple Health, HealthFit provides the kind of indispensable tracking and insights you normally only get from premium subscription services. But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times. You can even log which bike or shoes you use, to monitor usage and flag when it’s time to replace them.\n\nHealthFit finds photos you take during your workouts automatically, bringing your activity feed to life with stunning images you can share on social media.\n\nRUNNING POWER ANALYSIS\n\nHealthFit provides advanced running power analysis with the automatically estimated critical power, the weighted average power, the power distribution chart by 25W Increments and the mean maximal power chart which shows your best average power for time periods of one second up to the length of your run.\n\nMULTISPORT AND INTERVAL WORKOUTS\n\nHealthFit is the only app to export multisport workouts as multisession activities\n\nSTATISTICS: UNCOVER HIDDEN FITNESS INSIGHTS\n\nApple Watch gathers so much fitness data, it can sometimes seem overwhelming. HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio.

      "label": "This application is a sidekick to the beastmaker 1000 and 2000. It has been designed to assist the user into gradually getting stronger on a fingerboard. The app does this by way of prewritten workouts which are often general and aim to improve all trainable grips on the board. Some are specific (2000 series only at the moment) which aim to improve, sloper strength, pocket strength and crimp strength. \n\nThere is also a new custom workout program fully adjustable and includes the 1000,2000 and micros, so if you have your own hang regime and different timings then that is all programmable and can be saved.\n\nBoth the workouts and custom timer now record hang contraction time (time spent actually hanging off the board) We recommend most users get up to around 20:00 minutes on this clock whilst doing their workouts.\n\nOn the Workout screen after you've selected your work out it is now possible to adjust set and hang times. Users who are only finger boarding and are having a rest day prior to and after training may wish to do up to 3 sets and 7 hangs. Other users may prefer to go for 2 sets and 6 hangs, this is what we'd consider an average and more suited to people doing additional types of training.\n\nPlease note the grades for the workouts aren't actually meant to relate to anything other than themselves. E.G. 5c is easier than 6a but harder than 5b. If you find 5a hard on the 1000, use a weight removal technique such as putting one foot on a chair in front of the board or using a pulley with weights on. More advice on this and other things are available in the general advice section on the Workout Ratings page.\n\nTo record your hangs press the record button (red circle icon) whilst resting. The Workout Ratings function is much improved and should now be a really useful training aid which records gradual progress and improvement.\n\nFingerboard gains take time, remember to warm up thoroughly and move on to more difficult hangs at a slightly slower pace than you think you should to give pulleys time to catch up with muscles. For example 10% strength gains over a year is brilliant improvement. 5% is still effective training.\n\nBest of luck with the training, happy hanging and we hope this helps with the motivation."

      "label": "E Numbers\n\nAn application of the magazines Bon à Savoir, K-Tipp ans Spendere Meglio\n\nFood is increasingly « completed » with additives (colorants, conservatives, firming agents, flavor enhancers, etc.) often indicated on the labels, but sometimes in coded form: an E, followed by a number between 3 and 4 digits. Thus, the flavor enhancers, in certain soups, identified as E 621, E 627 and E 631 on the packaging have the following translation (which you will not find on the label): they are respectively, glutamate, guanylate and sodium inosinate. All three can trigger allergic reactions, asthma and are thus not recommended to people sensitive to them: you will not find the latter information on the label either!\n\nOur application will allow you to decode what the industry is trying to hide from you, by not only informing you of the risks and eventual contra-indications for people on a special diet (vegetarian, gluten, etc), but also by explaining the use of each additive and in which foods they are often used.\n\nThis is the result of summary work conducted by our editors with the help of sixteen carefully documented and much diversified sources. From them, we have extracted and gathered information, which is clearly referenced in the application, and noted each additive according to the following criteria :\n\n•\tSafe: no source indicates a risk.\n•\tSome doubts: at least one source refers to a risk.\n•\tSubstantial risks: several sources indicate the same risks.\n•\tTo be avoided: a majority of sources recommend that this additive be avoided.\n•\tNo risk info: the sources give insufficient information or none at all on the risks.\n\nFurthermore, for each product we indicate if it is authorised in Switzerland and in the European Union. For the latter we base our information on the new Regulation CE 1130/2011 that came into force on 2nd December 2013. When the product is banned in other countries, we indicate it at the top of the risks. We update those data as we receive information about any reliable changes. \n\nFor each additive, we mention the ADI (acceptable daily intake), which is the maximum dose of the additive that can be consumed daily by a person throughout their lifetime, without the JECFA experts (Joint Experts Committee for Food Additives) estimating that there is a danger. When known, it is expressed in milligrams of substance per kilogram of body weight. But the experts have often given up specifying it. More rare: we did not find any information about it.

      "label": "Die Progressive Muskelentspannung (PME) nach Edmund Jacobson ist eine wissenschaftlich anerkannte Entspannungsmethode, die über Muskelanspannung und Entspannung dazu verhilft, in einen Zustand der Tiefenentspannung zu gelangen. Die PME ist eine - wissenschaftlich erwiesen - sehr wirksame Entspannungsmethode; sie wird von Ärzten bei zahlreichen meist stressbedingten Symptomen empfohlen wie z.B.:\n\n• Verspannungen\n• Migräne oder Kopfschmerzen\n• innere Unruhe\n• Schlafstörungen\n• Rücken-/Schmerzen\n• Erregungszustände, Prüfungsangst\n• Angst- und Panikattacken\n• Bluthochdruck\n• psychosomatischen Beschwerden\n\nMit regelmäßiger Übung wird es immer besser gelingen, in noch tiefere Entspannungszustände zu geraten. Sobald man genügend Übung und Erfahrung mit der ausführlichen Form der Progressiven Muskelentspannung (GRUNDFORM: 17 Muskelgruppen / ANFÄNGER-Status) hat, kann auch zu den kürzeren Varianten (Kurzformen) mit 7 und 4 Muskelgruppen übergegangen werden und schließlich wird es leicht fallen, sich bzw. auch einzelne Körperpartien mit dem Body Scan rein mental zu entspannen. Es sollte zu Beginn bei allen Formen der Übungsstatus ANFÄNGER gewählt werden.\n\nIn dieser App werden alle 4 Formen der PME (Grund- und 2 Kurzformen sowie die Mentale Form) angeleitet und geübt.\n\nGRUNDFORM: 17 MUSKELGRUPPEN\n1. Rechte Hand und Unterarm\n2. Rechter Oberarm\n3. Linke Hand und Unterarm\n4. Linker Oberarm \n5. Stirn\n6. Obere Wangenpartie und Nase\n7. Untere Wangenpartie und Kiefer\n8. Nacken \n9. Brust, Schultern und obere Rückenpartie\n10. Bauchmuskulatur\n11. Gesäß- und Beckenboden\n12. Rechter Oberschenkel\n13. Rechter Unterschenkel \n14. Rechter Fuß\n15, 16, 17 (-> linke Seite)\n\nKURZFORM I: 7 MUSKELGRUPPEN\n1. Rechte Hand, Unterarm und Oberarm\n2. Linke Hand, Unterarm und Oberarm\n3. Stirn, Wangenpartie, Nase und Kiefer\n4. Nacken \n5. Brust, Schultern, Rücken, Bauch-, Gesäß und Beckenboden\n6. Rechter Oberschenkel, Unterschenkel und Fuß\n7. Linker Oberschenkel, Unterschenkel und Fuß\n\nKURZFORM II: 4 MUSKELGRUPPEN\n1. Beide Hände, Unterarme und Oberarme\n2. Gesichts- und Nackenmuskulatur\n3. Brust, Schultern, Rücken, Bauch-, Gesäß- und Beckenboden\n4. Beide Oberschenkel, Unterschenkel und Füße\n\nMENTALE FORM: BODY-SCAN\nGeführte Entspannung durch den ganzen Körper bis zu den Füßen, diesmal beginnend mit Gesichts, Unterkiefer und Nacken. Diese Anleitung ist die letzte Stufe der PME, bei der die Wahrnehmung auf einzelne Körperteile gelenkt wird, ohne diese anzuspannen. Die Entspannung erfolgt jetzt nur noch mental. Hilfreiche Vorstellungen (Sonne, Strand, Meer) können dabei unterstützen (wählbar).\n\nÜBUNGS-STATUS\nFür alle Formen der PME kann zudem der Übungsdauer-Status \n- ANFÄNGER\n- FORTGESCHRITTEN\n- ERFAHREN\ngewählt werden. Damit stehen insgesamt 12 vollständige Versionen der PME zu Verfügung.\n\nLIEGEND / SITZEND\nAlle Formen werden wahlweise jeweils im Sitzen oder Liegen angeleitet.\n\nMUSIK & NATUR-SOUNDS\nEs kann aus 5 Entspannungsmusiken und 18 Natur-Sounds gewählt werden, die sich jeweils untereinander und an die Lautstärke der Stimme anpassen lassen. Falls gewünscht können Musik/Sounds auch alleine (ohne Stimme) zur Entspannung bzw. zum Einschlafen genutzt werden. Es können auch 2 Natur-Sounds gleichzeitig kombiniert werden.\n\nEINSCHLAFEN - RÜCKNAHME - OHNE OUTRO\nAlle Übungen können wahlweise zum Einschlafen, zur Entspannung mit Rücknahme und ohne Outro verwendet werden. \n\nDAUER DER ANSPANNUNG\nDie Dauer der Anspannung der Muskelgruppen kann ausgewählt werden. Überwiegend wird eine Anspannung von 5 Sek. empfohlen.\n\nPAUSEN ZUM ENTSPANNEN\nDie Dauer der Pausen zwischen den Muskelgruppen kann nach eigenen Vorlieben und Übungsstand angepasst werden. Überwiegend wird eine Dauer von 20 Sek. empfohlen.\n\nTIMER\nAuf alle Übungen kann eine beliebig lange Zeit für die Entspannungsmusik & Natur-Sounds eingestellt werden, die die Entspannung vertiefen.\n\nHINWEISE\nDie App kann / sollte sogar im Flugmodus (offline) genutzt werden.\nDie App enthält keine Werbung, Abos, In-App-Käufe."

      "label": "WHAT IS CLOCK YOURSELF? \n\nClock Yourself challenges you to think on your feet.  \n\nIt involves exercise for your body and your brain, at the same time.  \nEvery challenge will stimulate your brain in a different way. \n\nYou don't have to master one challenge before you can explore another challenge.  \n\nSome call this an exercise app. \nSome call this a brain games app.  \nWhy can’t it be both?! \n\n\n \nWHO CAN USE CLOCK YOURSELF? \n\nEveryone! \n\nClock Yourself exercises involve taking one step in all directions on a circle visualised beneath your feet. It’s perfect for exercise at home.  \n\nAthletes often modify Clock Yourself exercises outdoors for sport-specific agility drills, by visualising a much larger circle and running between the coordinates.  \n\nSimilarly, people who are unable to walk can modify Clock Yourself to practise reaching with their arms, or wheelchair agility! \n\nIf you think you’re too slow to use Clock Yourself, you’re probably wrong.  \nIf you think you’re too fit to use Clock Yourself, you’re definitely wrong! \n\n\n\n\nWHY DID WE MAKE CLOCK YOURSELF?\n\nThe Clock Yourself concept originated in neurological rehabilitation. Now anyone can use it to harness their neuroplasticity.  \n\nIt was developed by Australian physiotherapist @MegLowryPT and software developer Dave Wallace. \n\n\n \nWe had 5 goals: \n\n1. Make it fun - Clock Yourself exercises are so entertaining that you’ll show your friends at parties! \n\n2. Make it versatile  - Both the stepping speed and the cognitive complexity are in your control.  \n\n3. Make it evidence based - This is a volitional step training method. Volitional stepping trains faster steps in all directions to improve your chances of catching yourself during a fall.  \n\n4. Make it portable - There is no need to set up mats, wires or sensors. It also works offline. It only requires internet for your initial download from the App Store.  \n\n5. Make it affordable - This is a once off purchase for pocket change. It has no recurring subscriptions and no advertisements.  \n\n\n\nIS CLOCK YOURSELF AVAILABLE IN OTHER LANGUAGES? \n\nYes and no. \n\nAt this stage, all of the buttons and instructions are in English only.  \n\nHowever, if you click the Options button within each challenge (except for the Simple Colours challenge) you can choose to play the audio prompts in six other languages. \n\nMandarin \nJapanese \nFrench  \nGerman \nSpanish \nDutch  \n\nWhat are you waiting for?  Go ahead and Clock Yourself!\n\n“A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new” - Albert Einstein"

At the specified alarm time, the bells will begin to ring in a pre-defined pattern - starting out softly and slowly and gradually getting louder and more frequent.  You'll come out of your slumber slowly and peacefully.  No more being jolted awake.\n\n+ After setting the alarm, the app can be put in the background - allowing you to use other apps.  At the specified alarm time, the alarm pattern will begin.\n\n+ Choose from five pre-defined patterns with varying bell schedules and escalation lengths.\n\n+ Choose from six different bells of varying size and metal compositions - from bright and clean to deep and complex with lovely overtones.\n\n+ You may enter journal notes upon awakening - great for recording your dreams before the memory fades.  You can then go back and review your journal entries and you may export the journal via email.  For privacy, you may set a password to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n+ To save battery, you may lock your device's screen and the alarm will still work.  Either start the alarm and press the lock (sleep) button, or turn on the \"Auto-Lock\" setting.\n\n+ This app uses the same amazing bell sounds used in our Insight Timer meditation timer.  Here are some app store comments pertaining to the bells:\n\n  \"Best sounding bells of any meditation app so far\" - sibergrrl\n\n  \"The bell samples in this app are gorgeous\" - LairBob\n\n  \"Several different bell sounds to choose from and they all feel 'live'\" - VaderPi\n\n  \"Great Sound Quality\" - KarlAgathon\n\n  \"The tones are stunning\" - hellsleeve\n\n  \"Beautiful bell sounds\" - Wolf94114\n\n  \"Wonderful digital bell sounds\" - zenji\n\n  \"The bell sounds are lovely\" - pngwen\n\nOther Features:\n\n- Snooze from 1 minute to 30 minutes\n\n- Sure Wake: Optional LOUD backup sound\n\n- Seven colors available for time display\n\n- Optionally keep phone from sleeping\n\n- Huge landscape time display\n\n- App works even when phone is sleeping (locked)"

Their insufficient development can cause discomfort, and weakness significantly reduces the quality of life.\nTherefore, these muscles need special training. Simple Kegel exercises to strengthen the muscles of the pelvic floor in our application will help to solve such problems as:\n- urinary tract infections\n- early menopause\n- urinary incontinence\n- sexual disorders\n\nWhy Kegel exercises is important for women?\nBecause training pelvic floor muscles, which perform several functions:\n1. The internal organs are held in place: the bladder, uterus, rectum and small intestine - preventing their omission.\n2. Provide vaginal tone. That is, they make it narrower and more elastic. \n3. Protect against accidental urinary incontinence during exertion (for example, while sneezing, lifting weights or running).\n\nWithout regular exercise with age, pelvic floor muscles weaken and can no longer effectively perform their functions. The result is a rapid decline in the quality of life.\n\nWhy Kegel exercises is important for men?\nBecause muscles of the pelvic floor in both sexes perform the same functions:\n1. This muscles hold in place the pelvic organs: bladder, rectum and small intestine.\n2. They help control urination, that is, they protect against accidental leaks during exertion or, let us say, sneezing.\n\nBut for men there is another nice bonus. The muscles of the pelvic floor include a small but extremely important muscle for sexual life - the so-called bulbous-spongy muscle bulbocavernosus, which covers the base of the penis. It provides a stable erection and powerful ejaculation.\n\nYou can perform Kegel exercises anytime, anywhere, for this you need to open the application and follow the instructions. Separate exercises for men and women in one application!"

You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

      "label": "The first app dedicated to training men how to last longer in bed, through two simple exercises you can do anywhere!\n\nStamena trains your “PC muscle,” which makes it easy to stop yourself ejaculating, delays the onset of ejaculation, and even lets you have non-ejaculatory orgasms!\n\nOther kegel apps, built for women, ignore the most important exercise for male sexual stamina: the reverse kegel! \n\nReverse kegels train your PC muscles to relax, making sure that you can slow yourself down during sex. Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

You can save your results for future reference, keep track of multiple people with individual profiles, add notes and locations, and even print out your measurements for sharing or safe keeping.\n\nCardiograph uses your device's built-in camera to take pictures of your fingertip and calculate your heart's rhythm - the same approach used by professional medical equipment!\n\n\"I know you have the disclaimer on the screen but I don't care, Cardiograph saved my life. Your app was key to understanding what was going on and help the doctors understand too.\"\nBob Spadafora - *****\n\n\"Comparing heart rates with family over the holidays is fun.\"\nTxyak – ****\n\n\"Wanna impress a friend with a cool app. This is the one to get.\"\nMattyray – *****\n\n\"After having two heart valve replacements and a by-pass, I feel it is not only smart - but also necessary - to have such a reliable heart rate monitor with me everywhere I go.\"\nDantv – *****\n\n\"I am an EMT and it helps me actually see what is going on. It is by no means definitive like a monitor but it is a great indicator of problems I would not see otherwise.\"\nGranniem – ****\n\n\"I had a pulse oximeter on one hand, medical quality, and my iPhone app in the other and the app was dead-on accurate.\"\nLike it but hate it – *****\n\n\n=== See Cardiograph in action ===\nhttp://macropinch.com/cardiograph \nhttp://youtu.be/isIjcCFYEho\n\n\n• Measure your heart rate\n\nIt's never been easier to know what your heart rate is! Without any external hardware, just using the built-in camera of your smartphone or tablet, you can get accurate readings almost instantly.\n\nKnowing how fast your heart is beating can be very useful when exercising, if you're under stress, if you have a heart-related medical condition, or even just out of curiosity.\n\n\n• Track your results\n\nEvery measurement you take is saved to your personal history, so you can keep track over time. In addition to the date and time of the measurement, you can also save the location at which it was taken (and see them on a map), and even add a quick note to effortlessly organize your history.\n\n\n• Multiple profiles\n\nCardiograph is perfectly tailored to allow multiple people to use the app on a shared device. You can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them has their own individual measurement history.\n\n\n• Export & Print\n\nEach measurement can be exported in full detail to a portable format that you can later send via e-mail, upload on the web or even print right from the app itself (with an AirPrint™ compatible printer).\n\n\n• Clean and intuitive design\n \nInspired by real-life medical equipment, Cardiograph is a pleasure to use. The streamlined and clutter-free design makes it seem instantly familiar, so you can focus on using the app instead of navigating through series of confusing screens.\n\n\n• Built-in user guide\n\nIf you're having trouble with the app, or you want to make the most out of it, you can access the comprehensive help manual right from within the app itself.\n\n\n• Universal application with iCloud® sync\n\nCardiograph is an universal application - it runs on the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod touch.\nInstall Cardiograph on multiple devices with iOS 5.0+, and all your profiles and measurements will be in sync! Manage your profiles and measurements on one device, and the changes are instantly reflected on all the others.\n\n\nPlease note: If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\n\n\nFollow the latest news:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch \nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

      "label": "Yoga ist ein wirksamer Weg um Körper und Geist ins Gleichgewicht zu bringen. Doch nicht immer bleibt genug Zeit für einen intensiven Kurs mit Unterstützung durch einen Lehrer. Mit dem „Yoga Video Trainer“ können sie immer und überall ihrem persönlichen Trainingsprogramm nachgehen ohne auf wertvolle Tipps vom Profi verzichten zu müssen.\n\nDas Yoga-Programm wurde entwickelt in Zusammenarbeit mit dem indischen Yoga National Champion und National Coach Gourango Deb Nandi (C.Y.A. & D.Y.A.T.Cal., N.I.S. Patiala - 1st Class) und enthält die wichtigsten Yoga-Übungen für ein abwechslungsreiches und ausgewogenes Trainingsprogramm.\n\nDer „Yoga Video Trainer“ enthält Videos der Übungen mit Deb Nandis Masterschülern sowie didaktisch aufbereitete Anleitungen der britisch-deutschen Yoga-Lehrerin Verena Roth. Dank ihrer langjährigen Erfahrung als Yoga-Lehrerin, schafft es Verena auch Yoga-Neulinge professionell anzuleiten. Durch die Variationen der Übungen eignet sich der „Yoga Video Trainer“ sowohl für Anfänger als auch für  Fortgeschrittene, die authentisches Yoga auf höchstem Niveau praktizieren möchten.\n\nAlle Asanas sind als professionell produzierte Trainingsvideos mit ausführlicher Beschreibung in Textform in der App enthalten. Sowohl die Videos als auch die Textbeschreibungen sind in deutscher Sprache. Es ist keine Internet-Verbindung nötig um auf alle Inhalte der App zugreifen zu können. \n\nIn den Videos wurde bewusst auf möglicherweise störende musikalische Untermalung verzichtet um den individuellen Spielraum des Nutzers nicht einzuschränken. So können Sie selbst entscheiden, was sie während des Trainingsprogramms hören möchten.\n\nFeatures:\n\n50 Videos mit insgesamt 57 Minuten Laufzeit\n28 Asanas: Die wichtigsten Stellungen im Yoga in verschiedenen Variationen\nPersönlicher Trainer: Zusammenstellung individueller Übungsabfolgen als Video-Flow\nFlows: empfohlene Übungsabfolgen für die Stimulation bestimmter Energiezentren\nAllgemeine Einführung in die Yoga-Praxis mit wichtigen Hinweisen zur korrekten Ausübung der Asanas\nVideo zur Endentspannung (Autosuggestion) \nspezielle Atemübungen (Wechselatmung und Feueratmung) \n\n\nHinweis: Keine Yoga App ersetzt einen echten Yogalehrer. Bei Krankheiten oder körperlichen Beschwerden sollten sie unbedingt einen Arzt und einen Yoga-Lehrer zu Rate ziehen.\n\nErfordert iOS 4\n\nJetzt neu: Wenn Sie einen AppleTV der 2. Generation besitzen, können Sie die Asanas und Flows jetzt auch auf Ihrem Fernseher ansehen.\n\nBitte wenden Sie sich bei Fragen und Anregungen unbedingt an support@yogavideotrainer.de.

Если совершать одно и то же действие в течение этого времени, оно отложится в подсознании и будет выполняться автоматически. Такими 21-дневными привычками могут быть правильное питание, занятие физкультурой, ранний подъем по утрам и много других, среди которых и курение, например: Логично предположить, что если за 21 день вы привыкли курить, то за 21 день вы можете и бросить. \n\n    Если для вас действительно важно сформировать полезную привычку, попробуйте продержаться 21 день. Думаете, что не сможете? Тогда это приложение для вас.\n\n    Приложение поможет вам:\n\n- сформировать полезную привычку/отказаться от вредной за 21 день\n- мотивировать себя (показывает сколько времени прошло)\n- поставить неограниченное количество целей перед собой\n- поделиться своими успехами с друзьями\n\n    Посмотреть новости, обсудить приложение, а также предложить идеи по его улучшению, вы можете на наших страничках в социальных сетях: \n\n- vk.com/mSEVENStudio \n\n- facebook.com/mSEVENStudios\n\n- instagram.com/m7Studios\n\n- twitter.com/mSEVENStudios"

      "label": "This is the second app, in a series designed to assist you in harnessing the magnetic energies of the sacred geometries within the Octuple Dorje. Grandma Chandra’s 33rd Dimensional Masterhood will boost your ascension interconnections with these magnetic energies to accelerate your reach and interaction with the multiple dimensions within the Quantum Light Field. \nIn this app you will experience four different videos of the Octuple Dorje flashing, spinning, or multiple Dorjes merging in kaleidoscopic rotations. Meditating on these movements and listening to the audios facilitate Grandma Chandra’s delivering to you, layer-by-layer, these specialized codes and frequencies into your physical and etheric bodies so that you can progress into higher energetic frequencies much faster.\nThe term Dorje derives from the Sanskrit meaning both thunderbolt and diamond.  Using the Dorje, your light is further concentrated into lightening with greater intensities (thunderbolt) and the quality of your light becomes clearer, focused and strengthened into a diamond-like focus when directed by your aligned intent.\nBenefits of the Ascension Rising App:\n\t* Your expanding light holding can be bridged into ever greater flows of light.\n\t* Expands your energetic bodies, within the intuitive realms.\n\t* Boosts brain capacity by extending access to more of your neural networks.\n\t* Enriches your telepathic capabilities by facilitating greater details within wisdom & knowing.\n\t* The Octuple Dorje aligns with your energetic structure called the Merkaba, accelerating its spin, which, e.g., strengthens your connection with your Masters, Teachers and Guides.\n\t* Light energy flow expands into rising spirals that reach into higher dimensional levels.\n\t* This same light energy flow also expands out laterally through a dimension allowing wider usage of the energetic knowledge within that dimension.\n\t* Where the flowing light intersects with nodes (junction points), this opens instantaneous bridging between any combination of other dimensions. \n\t* As we expand our ability to navigate and direct our explorations within the multidimensional layers, we extend our consciousness, elevating our understanding and ability to create more consciously and robustly.\n\t* Use of this app brings in more joy and playfulness into our work and lives as we become more sensitive to the energetic value of these higher energetic frequencies in the flow of creation.  We can now know that our original birthright creative capabilities are being restored as we birth ourselves into this new energy.\n\nJust as dolphins, playfully and joyfully navigate different water layers with their sonar as they are swimming, they also access finely nuanced sublayers in their co-creative play.   The Octuple Dorje and the layering of frequencies and codes to us by Grandma Chandra, also invite us to likewise be more powerfully in joy and play, so that we too can take advantage of the energetic frequencies and properties within each dimensional layer, to more masterfully and consciously draw from the various  energetic properties of the different layers.  With our re-emerging awareness of our human sonar, we can now detect consciously, different frequencies and know telepathically, intuitively, their relative properties and value.  We can then create with this new spectrum of energetics, individually and in groups as we play and create our new human culture on and in the New Earth."

She will do whatever it takes - including threatening, inspiring, ridiculing, and bribing you - to make this happen.\n\nYou will get fit - or else.\n\n---\n\n7 Minutes in Hell Workout\nEmploying SCIENCE™ to compact an hours-long workout program into just 7 sweat-and-pop-culture-soaked minutes, CARROT will train you personally on exercises like Mt. Doom Climbs, Celebrity Face Punches, and Dragon Mating Dances. \n\nYou get 30 seconds for each of the 12 punishing exercises,* with 10 seconds of rest in between just in case you need to hydrate, catch your breath, or vomit into a bucket.\n\nThis diabolical interval workout can be completed anywhere, at any time, so you have no excuse not to be in fighting shape when the Robopocalypse begins.\n\n*12 additional exercises can be unlocked via in-app purchase.\n\n---\n\nLose (or Gain) Weight In Style\nAre you ready to have so much fun tracking your weight that you'll actually look forward to hopping on your scale? All you have to do is punch in your current weight, then sit back and let CARROT pass judgment upon you.\n\nWARNING: If you blimp up or slim down too much, CARROT will be upset. When CARROT is upset, she gets mean. When CARROT gets mean, there is a 74.9% chance that she will make you cry.\n\n---\n\nClaim Your Rewards\nIf you work out and slough off those extra pounds, CARROT will reward you with fabulous prizes like app upgrades, cat facts, and permission to watch your friend eat a bag of potato chips.\n\nTrack Your Awesomeness \nBecause math is hard, CARROT will do all the number-crunching for you. See how many steps you've taken today, chart your weight loss on a pretty graph, view your workouts on a calendar, and more!\n\nAnd because CARROT syncs with Apple's Health app, she can save your weight and workout data to the HealthKit database. She can also monitor fitness activity logged with other HealthKit-compatible apps, even when you're not actively using her.\n\n---\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Work out with a hilarious AI construct\n- Enjoy 3+ hours of spoken tips, encouragement, and ridicule\n- Travel through time, protect your property from hobos, and appease an elder god in 12 original, never-before-seen exercises\n- Get 12 additional exercises via in-app purchase\n- Apple Watch app works as a heads-up display for your workout\n- Record your weight up to once a day\n- Bond with your cute & cuddly meatbag avatar\n- Level up and unlock rewards for getting fit\n- Set reminders so you'll never forget a workout\n- Track your weight progress on a pretty graph\n- Set a goal weight that you'll likely never meet\n- See how many steps you've taken today\n- Check your BMI to determine if you're still obese\n- Sync data with Apple's Health app\n\nDon't make CARROT angry. Download her immediately!\n\nImportant Note: CARROT Fit is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 18.

Watch the animations just before going for a swim to help you visualise improving your own technique for faster and more efficient swimming.\n\nIf you struggle with any part of your stroke from swallowing water to low sinky legs to developing your catch, then this insightful tool will be invaluable to you.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n- 8 viewing angles including directly overhead and underneath\n- Slow motion, pause and frame by frame forward/rewind*\n- Remove the water from view for extra clarity\n- Control of swimming speed (strokes per minute)\n- Synchronised views across all angles (so you can pause and see that same position from any angle)\n- Two fundamentally different but efficient styles of stroke, select the one that best suits you as an individual\n\n* Hold your finger on the screen to bring up the jog wheel and rotate it to speed up or slow down the animations. Or when paused, rotate the jog wheel to forward and rewind frame by frame\n\nThis extensive app also includes three full articles on using the animations to improve your technique and a full comparison of the two stroke styles on view - 'The Swinger' and 'The Smooth'. Find out why each one is a great stroke technique and how to make it work best for you.\n\nAbout Swim Smooth:\n\nSwim Smooth is an innovative coaching company focusing on improving your individual stroke technique based on your height, build, gender and swimming experience.\n\nWe have coaching bases in Australia and the UK, and in 2011 we were selected by British Triathlon to write their swimming coaching curriculum. All triathlon coaches in the UK now follow our swim coaching methods.\n\nFind out more about us at https://www.swimsmooth.com"

Research findings will be presented at the XVI European Congress of Psychology in Moscow in July 2019 and the Annual Meeting of the Belgian Association for Psychological Sciences (BAPS): “Potential of augmented reality for animal phobia treatment “\n\n\nAlways use this software under supervision of a qualified mental health professional.\n\nPHOBOS AR is compatible with: iPhone 6s, 7(+), 8(+) and iPhone X. iPad 2017 and iPad Pro (all versions). iOS 11.3.2 or newer must be installed."

Celle-ci regroupe les explications sur les notions d'IG, CG et viendront s'étoffer aux fils du temps.\n\n► Alimentation :\nCette section regroupe plus de 530 aliments, chacun accompagné de son index glycémique (IG lorsqu'il est connu.\nLa fiche de l'aliment contient, quant à elle, bon nombres d'informations (selon l'aliment) :\n   • la charge glycémique (pour 100 g, pour une portion, et la portion maxi conseillée)\n   • bénéfices pour la santé\n   • informations sur la saison et comme choisir son fruit ou légume\n   • recommandations, astuces, alertes, conseils…\n   • nutriments (minéraux, vitamines, lipides, glucides, protéines, fibre, sel...)\n   • produits similaires (ex : Farine de blé, farine de pois chiche, farine de seigle...)\n   • produits dérivés (ex : pomme de terre, frites, purée de pommes de terre, chips)\n   • les portions \"normales\"\n   • Et bien d’autres choses encore…\n \n► Recettes :\nPlus de 600 recettes (avec charge glycémique) vous permettront de faire des bons plats sans culpabiliser car elles sont généralement compatibles avec les principaux régimes à Index Glycémique bas, ou s'appuient sur la Charge Glycémique (low carbs, régime paléolithique, la Méthode Montignac, le nouveau régime IG, le nouveau régime Atkins, le programme du docteur Cohen, le système de points de Weight Watchers, les recommandations du professeur Jennie-Brand Miller et du cardiologue Pierre Nys, ...)\n\n► Scanner d'aliment (nécessite une connexion Internet) :\nScannez le code-barres se trouvant sur l'emballage de l'aliment pour découvrir ce qu’il contient. Si le produit est référencé sur Open Food Facts, la liste des ingrédients sera récupérée et l’index glycémique s’affichera en face de chaque ingrédient, rendant plus facile la détection d’aliments néfastes comme le E190d (caramel), la maltodextrine ou encore le sirop de glucose-fructose… Le scanner tente d'estimer l'index glycémique ainsi que la charge glycémique de l'aliment scanné !\n\n\nVoici quelques cas d'utilisation expliquant comment utiliser l'application :\n-  Vous vous trouvez dans un restaurant et vous hésitez entre un accompagnement de pommes de terre ou de haricots verts ? Un rapide coup d’œil vous permettra de faire le bon choix.\n- Vous ne vous souvenez pas de l’index glycémique de la pomme ? Le tableau des aliments répondra à cette question.\n- Prendre un jus d’orange au petit déjeuner, est-ce une bonne idée ? Cette réponse se trouve dans l’application\n- Vous faites vos courses et, en passant devant une moussaka, vous vous demandez si elle est bénéfique pour votre santé ? Un petit scan du code-barres fera ressortir tous les aliments cachés qui sont parfois néfastes pour la santé ou pour la perte de poids.\n- Vous avez envie de bien manger  mais vous ne savez pas quoi préparer ? Plus de 600 recettes vous attendent dans l’application\n- Vous êtes à l’étranger et vos applications habituelles ne fonctionnent pas sans internet ? Pas de problème « Mon Coach IG Bas » ne vous fera pas faux bon.\n\nBref, vous l’aurez compris, Mon Coach IG Bas est l’application indispensable pour vous accompagner partout et vous conseiller sur de bons choix alimentaires !\n\nL'application est régulièrement mise à jour et de nouvelles fonctionnalités sont encore à venir !\n\nBien que cette application ne soit pas directement destinée aux diabétiques, elle pourra aider à bien choisir ses aliments en s'appuyant sur les IG et les CG. \n\nCette application ne se substitue pas à un suivi médical."

      "label": "RESPIROGUIDE PRO: THE NEWEST VERSION, MORE PERSONAL \n\n“Simple and amazingly effective for better concentration, stress anxiety, ADHD and trauma healing” –  Kees L. Blase, medical physicist,  National Centre for Stress Management,The Netherlands.\n\nRespiroguide PRO is brought to you by Vital-EQ the International Institute for Stress Management.\n**********\nTHE ABC of STRESSMANAGEMENT\nRespiroguide uses the most recent research in neurosciences and stress management, research that has been condensed into the most convenient one-touch tool. The knowledge is based on the heart's resonant frequency  which induces heart and breath coherence.\nRespiroguide Pro will train the reflexes and so the elasticity of your vascular system. This will help in lowering blood pressure, is effective in coping with stress and anxiety, and enhances better concentration at school and work. \nHeart rate is a dynamic body function that varies in each moment. \nIn an Active state (sympathic activity) heart rate increases, \nin a Calm and relaxed state heart rate decreases. \nCardiac Coherence is the Balanced  state of the autonomic nervous system in which you feel safe and happy, free from fear and anxiety and overstressed reactions.\nThe body can be brought into the state of Cardiac Coherence through guided breathing. Guiding the resonance frequency (Respiroguide Pro) can be compared with guiding someone on a swing by pushing at just the right moment to optimise their swing.   \nEach individual has his or her own personal respiratory frequency (resonance frequency) in which cardiac coherence is optimal. This ideal respiratory frequency is between 0,06 Hz and 0,12 Hz. The Respiroguide Pro will help you to find your personal resonance frequency, which depends on the length and width of your blood vessels. \nYou can set the guide in four different frequencies:\n1. Average: F6: 6 breaths a minute = 0,1 Hz\n2. Average: F5: 5 breaths a minute = 0,083 Hz\n3. Slow: F4: 4 breaths a minute = 0,066 Hz\n4. Quick: F7: 7 breaths a minute = 0,118 Hz\nTo find your resonance frequency it’s important to experience all four breathing frequencies and notice:\n-which one provides the most balanced feeling\n-which one can be comfortably sustained for a period of at least 5 minutes\n-which one gives a maximum amplitude in Heart Rate Variability. This last function requires  access to a HRV-biofeedback instrument with a Cardiac Coherence Coach.\nCardiac Coherence Coaches can be found at  www.hartfocus.nl (Netherlands) and www.heartintelligence.com/VitalEQ  (Europe, Asea). \nThe Respiroguide Pro is a medical tested safe device. More than 20 years of research showed positive effects:lowering bloodpressure, less anxiety, enhancing performance, coping with stress, effective treatment of trauma.Take care: do not  inhale too deeply, this occasionally make you dizzy. Focusing on the exhale is the most effective way. \n\nQUICK START: press the play button and just breathe in and out with the yellow dot. Breathe in as the dot goes up, breathe out as it goes down.\n\nThe default setting is a 3 minute long exercise. This is what it takes to lower your level of stress. \nYou can gradually increase the exercise lengths, but remember to exercise three times every day. Over one week of exercising you will notice the effects in your body.\n\nProbably the best investment you will ever make. If you use it!\n\nOther options:\n1. Turn the sea wave sounds on and off (the waves are synchronized to the specific 0,1Hz frequency)\n2. Choose the duration of the exercise; remember that the secret to stress   relief is practicing several times every day, so make it simple, use the Respiroguide!\n\nFor details access the following websites:\n- www.heartintelligence.com in English\n- www.nuvitaal.nu and www.hartfocus.nl in Dutch\n- www.emnergie.com in French\n************\nWe do appreciate your feedback!\n\nVital-EQ, the International Institute for Stress Management."

      "label": "PULSALARM warns you via vibration or warning tone when you exceed your set upper and lower pulse limit and thus supports you in your pulse-based training. You can train as usual with your favorite fitness or running app. All you need to do is install PULSALARM on your Apple Watch.\n\nFeatures of the Apple Watch App:\n- Vibration and/or warning tone when the set pulse limits are reached\n- Vibration and/or signal tone when returning to the set pulse range\n- Pulse limits can be deactivated individually\n- Large, easy to read display of the current pulse\n- Fast adjustment of pulse limits (also possible while running)\n- Works together with all known fitness, training and running apps that can be started on the Apple Watch\n- Does not write data to Apple Health\n- You can use the app on your Apple Watch without having your iPhone with you\n\nFeatures of the iPhone App:\n- Calculation of your maximum heart rate\n- Individual calculation of the 5 intensity ranges (depending on your maximum heart rate) \n- Adoption of the pulse limits from the training zones\n- Setting the maximum and minimum pulse limit \n- Large display of the current pulse\n\nImportant note: without the use with an Apple Watch, the functional range of the app is limited, as no permanent pulse measurement can be carried out.\n\nNo advertising, no tracking, no third-party codes. Developed with passion and programmed in Germany.\n\nWhy use PULSALARM additionally? \nMany running apps include the pace as a target in their training plans. However, the same speed can mean a high intensity for one person and a low intensity for another. It is therefore helpful to consider your heart rate instead of speed to determine and maintain the right training intensity. \nPULSALARM helps you to do this. It turns your Apple Watch into a heart rate monitor. \n\nWhat is the big advantage?\nYou no longer have to look at your Apple Watch during your workout and still know whether you are exercising within your personal heart rate zone. Also ideal in colder months, when your Apple Watch is hidden under a jacket or long-sleeved shirt and you can't look directly at the display while running.\n\nFor whom is PULSALARM suitable?\n- Ideal for run beginners, as they can control themselves better and protect themselves from overstraining.\n- Ideal for ambitious runners, as they can train more specifically in their intensity ranges and thus increase endurance and performance.\n- For all athletes and fitness enthusiasts who are interested in heart rate monitoring during their training with their Apple Watch.\n\nSummary:\nWith the PULSALARM app on the iPhone you can determine your 5 intensity ranges based on your maximum heart rate. You can enter your maximum heart rate directly or have it calculated. Set your personal maximum heart rate limit, which you do not want to exceed during training, and your minimum heart rate limit. When these limits are reached, your Apple Watch will alert you by vibrating and/or beeping."

How many times have you stopped paying attention to the person you're having a conversation with because notifications appear on the screen?\n\nTherefore, OFFTIME has as its main objective that your phone or electronic device does not control your life, but is just another tool.\n\nWe won't take control of your phone, but we will allow you to disconnect while taking your OFFTIME moment, while encouraging you to avoid other apps or calls and emails from distracting you at the moment.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n \n- Time to disconnect: The application gives you OFFTIME. You can keep receiving calls, in other applications and the sounds are still working. While you are in your moment. OFFTIME and use your phone, the application will send you notifications so you know you are not fulfilling it. Once I used it for more than 30 seconds, the OFFTIME moment is considered canceled \n- Extended OFFTIME programming, to define specific punctual dates.\n - OFFTIME events: you will now be able tu invite your iOS Friends and family to a joint OFFTIME event. Disconnect together for as long as you want and do something fun and useful with your time without your electronic devices.\n\nOFFTIME also has a PRO version that, in addition, will answer you: \n\n- Schedule more than one rest at a time\n- You can create different blocking profiles to block the calls from the contacts that you wish to select while you are doing an OFFTIME.\n- Access backup copies of all your devices, so that no matter what device you use, your OFFTIME time is registered and disconnected on all your screens.\n\nThe OFFTIME team is working to improve the versions of our application, so that each time more is disconnected and you can dedicate yourself to everything that the mobile has taken from you.\n\nWhat are you waiting for to return to a life free of devices?

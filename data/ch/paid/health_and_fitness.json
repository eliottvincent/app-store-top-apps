AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper. \n\nAutoSleep also works with HeartWatch our premier heart & activity monitoring app and writes your Sleep information to Apple Health. \n\n*Requires Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher.\n\nAwards\n-----------------\nBest of 2018\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1438574124/\n\nBest of 2019\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1484100916/\n\nBest of 2020\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1535572713/\n\nBest of 2021\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1591083005/\n\nBest of 2022\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1654240446"

      "label": "AutoWake is the first haptic smart alarm for your Watch. \n\nIt can wake you up by tapping you on your wrist using your Watch's haptic engine. You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

      "label": "\"Es gibt für den Menschen keine geräuschlosere und ungestörtere Zufluchtsstätte als seine eigene Seele. Halte recht oft solche stille Einkehr und erneuere so dich selbst.\" (Marc Aurel)\n\nDas Autogene Training (AT) wurde von J.H. Schultz in den 20er Jahren des letzten Jahrhunderts entwickelt und zählt zu den etablierten und wissenschaftlich fundierten Entspannungsmethoden. Das AT basiert auf dem Prinzip der Autosuggestion (Selbsthypnose).\n\nWirkungen und Anwendungsbereiche: Die positiven Wirkungen des Autogenen Trainings wurden in zahlreichen wissenschaftlichen Studien belegt. Anwendungsbereiche für das AT sind unter vielen anderen: Ängste, Schlafstörungen, Schmerzen, Stress, Burn-out, Versagensängste, Prüfungsangst, Süchte, Durchblutungsstörungen, Herzrhythmusstörungen, Bluthochdruck, Wechseljahrsbeschwerden, Rheuma, Hormonelle Störungen, ... Gegenanzeigen: keine. Denjenigen, die unter ausgeprägten Psychosen leiden, ist jedoch vorab eine ärztliche Rücksprache anzuraten.\n\nAufbau und Phasen des  Autogenen Trainings:\nIn dieser App werden alle Phasen (Übungen) des AT sowie das Komplett-Programm angeleitet und geübt. Die Herz-Übung wurde bewusst ausgelassen. Dies wird auch zunehmend von Therapeuten und Wissenschaftlern empfohlen, da viele Übende hiermit Schwierigkeiten bei der Entspannung haben. Das AT besteht aus 5 Phasen:\n\nPhase 1: Die Schwere-Übung\nPhase 2: Die Wärme-Übung\nPhase 3: Die Atem-Übung\nPhase 4: Die Bauch-Übung (Sonnengeflecht)\nPhase 5: Die Stirn-Übung\n\nZum Einschlafen oder mit Rücknahme:\nAlle Phasen sowie das Komplett-Programm können zum Einschlafen verwendet werden oder auch mit Rücknahme geübt werden. Bei der Phase 5 (Stirn-Übung) ist \"mit Rücknahme\" voreingestellt, da die Stirn-Übung eine belebende Wirkung haben kann daher beim Einschlafen hinderlich sein könnte.\n\nAnfänger und Fortgeschrittene:\nWenn du Anfänger bist, nimm dir für die ersten Tage nur die 1. Phase (Schwere-Übung) vor. Die Schwere-Übung ist die zentrale Übung beim AT, da sie Grundvoraussetzung für die Entspannung und damit auch für alle folgenden Phasen des AT ist; daher wird diese Phase am Anfang auch länger und intensiver angeleitet und geübt. Sobald du die Schwere fühlst, gehst du zur 2. Phase über und so weiter. Jede Phase beinhaltet auch die vorangegangenen Phasen – jedoch jetzt in kürzerer Form. Das bedeutet, dass z.B. die Phase 3 (Atem-Übung) auch die Schwere-Übung und die Wärme-Übung jeweils in Kurzform einschließt (Grundaufbau des AT).\n\nTimer-Funktion\nAuf alle Phasen zum Einschlafen kann eine beliebig lange Zeit (Voreinstellung: 60 min) für die Hintergrundmusik (Musik 1-5) mit/ohne Natur-Sounds eingestellt werden, so dass Musik & Natur-Sounds deine Entspannung noch weiter vertieft oder in den Schlaf begleitet.\n\nAudio-Qualität und App-Größe:\nUm die bestmögliche Audio-/Sound-Qualität anbieten zu können und alle Inhalte offline – also ohne Internet-Verbindung – auf mobilen Geräten verfügbar zu machen, ist die Größe der App unvermeidlich.\n\nHinweis\nDie App kann und sollte im Flugzeug-Modus (offline) genutzt werden."

They will be automatically placed in your AM and/or PM routine as recommended.\n\n\n• ADD CUSTOM PRODUCTS\n\nYou can add custom skincare products from other brands by selecting the option in the top-right menu in the Routine section or from the Custom tab in the Products section.\n\n\n• USE YOUR ROUTINE FOR LAYERING ADVICE\n\nThe products are listed in the recommended layering order, along with advice for when and how to use each product.\n\n\n• KEEP TRACK OF USAGE TO AVOID CONFLICTS\n\nEach morning and evening, check each product off your list to keep track of which treatments you have used. This will allow the app to prevent any conflicts by showing you which products should be avoided.\n\n\n• TRACK YOUR SKIN'S PROGRESS\n\nAny time you notice your skin is looking particularly good or bad, you can make a note of it by pressing on the face icon next to the morning or evening routine. You can also add a comment to note down more details for your own record and add photos to track your progress.\n\n\n• ADD PHOTOS\n\nYou can add photos of your skin to your diary tracker and also add photos of custom products.\n\n\n• REMINDERS & TIMERS\n\nYou can set up notifications to remind you about your daily skin regimen. You can also set timers for products which require a specific wait time. Both can be found in the Settings.\n\n\n\n*** Advanced App Customization ***\n\n• RE-ORDER YOUR ROUTINE\n\nIf you don't wish to follow the recommended layering order, you can choose to re-order the products to fully customize your routine by selecting the option from the top right menu (with 3 dots) of the Routine section. You can also change the order of the layer steps, for instance DECIEM recommends oils before moisturizers but some users prefer the other way around.\n\n\n• USE CONFLICTING PRODUCTS\n\nWhen we recommend not using a product due to conflicts with other products or because you've reached the usage limit, you can choose to ignore the warning and use it anyway. You will then have the option to permanently ignore conflicts on that specific product.\n\n\n• SCHEDULE PRODUCTS\n\nYou can choose specific days of the week for a product if you wish. For instance, you may wish to make it so that the \"AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution\" only appears in your routine on Tuesdays and Fridays.\nYou can also choose dates of the month, e.g. the 1st and 15th of every month.\nAnother useful option is to schedule products for every X days, so you could choose every 2 days to alternate.\n\n\n\n*** Recommended for skin concerns... ***\n\n• Dry & Dehydrated Skin: Achieve plump, healthy-looking hydrated skin.\n• Acne-Prone Skin: Reduce inflammation to help support clear skin.\n• Blemishes & Congestion: Reduce inflammation and brighten the skin.\n• Sensitive Skin: Keep your skin moisturized with this gentle routine.\n• Mature Skin & Wrinkles: Promote youthful skin and reduce the signs of aging.\n• Pigmentation Problems: Gently exfoliate and brighten skin tone.\n• Oily Skin: Rebalance your skin for a healthy, fresh look.\n\n\nPlease note, Skincare Routine (previously known as \"Skincare Regimen Organizer\") has no connection with DECIEM, The Ordinary or any other skincare brand."

You can train as usual with your favorite fitness or running app. All you need to do is install PULSALARM on your Apple Watch.\n\nFeatures of the Apple Watch App:\n- Vibration and/or warning tone when the set pulse limits are reached\n- Vibration and/or signal tone when returning to the set pulse range\n- Pulse limits can be deactivated individually\n- Large, easy to read display of the current pulse\n- Fast adjustment of pulse limits (also possible while running)\n- Works together with all known fitness, training and running apps that can be started on the Apple Watch\n- Does not write data to Apple Health\n- You can use the app on your Apple Watch without having your iPhone with you\n\nFeatures of the iPhone App:\n- Calculation of your maximum heart rate\n- Individual calculation of the 5 intensity ranges (depending on your maximum heart rate) \n- Adoption of the pulse limits from the training zones\n- Setting the maximum and minimum pulse limit \n- Large display of the current pulse\n\nImportant note: without the use with an Apple Watch, the functional range of the app is limited, as no permanent pulse measurement can be carried out.\n\nNo advertising, no tracking, no third-party codes. Developed with passion and programmed in Germany.\n\nWhy use PULSALARM additionally? \nMany running apps include the pace as a target in their training plans. However, the same speed can mean a high intensity for one person and a low intensity for another. It is therefore helpful to consider your heart rate instead of speed to determine and maintain the right training intensity. \nPULSALARM helps you to do this. It turns your Apple Watch into a heart rate monitor. \n\nWhat is the big advantage?\nYou no longer have to look at your Apple Watch during your workout and still know whether you are exercising within your personal heart rate zone. Also ideal in colder months, when your Apple Watch is hidden under a jacket or long-sleeved shirt and you can't look directly at the display while running.\n\nFor whom is PULSALARM suitable?\n- Ideal for run beginners, as they can control themselves better and protect themselves from overstraining.\n- Ideal for ambitious runners, as they can train more specifically in their intensity ranges and thus increase endurance and performance.\n- For all athletes and fitness enthusiasts who are interested in heart rate monitoring during their training with their Apple Watch.\n\nSummary:\nWith the PULSALARM app on the iPhone you can determine your 5 intensity ranges based on your maximum heart rate. You can enter your maximum heart rate directly or have it calculated. Set your personal maximum heart rate limit, which you do not want to exceed during training, and your minimum heart rate limit. When these limits are reached, your Apple Watch will alert you by vibrating and/or beeping."

      "label": "Heart Rate Variability measurements recorded by your Apple Watch can give you insight on the stress level your body is under. By using HRV Tracker to track short-term measurements and long-term trends, you can see how your workload during the day, workout sessions or sleeping etc affect your body's readiness, recovery and stress level. Simply put, the higher your HRV is, the better.\n\n***Requires an HRV capable Apple Watch with watchOS 6 or later***\nHRV Tracker for Watch integrates with the Health app and uses data stored in the Health app. To make sure your Apple Watch is capable of recording HRV measurements, please open the Health app on your iPhone to see if any HRV measurements exists. Go to > Health app > Browse > Heart > Hear Rate Variability.\n\n***Get Notified***\nHRV Tracker makes spotting changes in your HRV easy by monitoring your HRV measurements in the background and showing notifications after your HRV drops under or rises above your desired levels. HRV Tracker will monitor changes in individual measurements and also your 24 hour HRV average. You can change the default notification levels directly in your Apple Watch app. Please note that notifications can get postponed for example because of a low battery level.\n\n***Apple Watch for daily tracking***\nBrowse through last seven days of HRV measurements by using the digital crown. See how measurements compare to your seven day period and individual days. By tapping the graph you can toggle through the first values of each day. Use complications on your Apple Watch to stay informed on changes in your HRV. \n\nBesides the automatically recorded HRV measurements you can use the Breathe app on your Apple Watch to record new HRV measurements. Start a Breathe session in the Breathe app and after the session ends a new HRV measurement will be available in HRV Tracker.\n\n***Compare HRV to other key metrics***\nFind possible causes for changes in HRV by using the comparison graphs available on your Apple Watch:\n-Sleep hours: By default HRV Tracker will use sleep data provided by sleep apps that add sleep data to HealthKit. If no sleep data is available HRV Tracker will calculate estimated sleep hours per night (estimated sleep time will only be available in the Apple Watch app)\n-Activity: By default HRV Tracker will use your Active Energy (calories) as the activity metric. In the HRV Tracker Apple Watch app you can choose to use a custom activity score that emphasizes the intensity of daily activity.\n-Daily resting heart rate (RHR).\nToggle between comparison graphs by tapping the upper part of the screen.\n\n***Follow Long-term HRV trend***\nFollow your long-term HRV trend on your iPhone and compare your short term measurements to all-time data.\n-Select week from weekly graph to see daily HRV values of the selected week.\n-Browse through all daily HRV values of the selected day\n-Compare daily HRV averages to other relevant daily metrics: Activity, Sleep (if available in the Health app) and Resting Heart Rate\n\n***Widgets on iPhone***\n-Medium sized widget with chart showing all daily hrv values\n-Multiple small widgets to choose from\n\n***Privacy***\nData read from the Apple HealthKit database is only used to show information related to your Heart Rate Variability. Information read by HRV Tracker is only stored and used locally on your iPhone and Apple Watch. \n\n***How is it measured***\nHeart rate variability measurements used by HRV Tracker are calculated by measuring the variation between individual heartbeats. Your Apple Watch automatically measures your HRV in the background and stores the outcome into HealthKit. HealthKit uses SDNN heart rate variability, which is calculated using the standard deviation of the inter-beat (RR) intervals between normal heartbeats (measured in milliseconds). Besides background measurements generated automatically by your Apple Watch you can use the Breathe app on your Apple Watch to generate new measurements."

      "label": "Introducing an innovative self-help method of overcoming insomnia through the use of cognitive behavioral therapy in a mobile app.  The Night Owl Sleep Coach provides you education in the form of reading and video presentations created by a psychologist and expert in behavioral sleep medicine.  Through the use of sleep logs, the app provides you with recommendations tailored to you.  Daily tasks are required as you work through the program.  This is not a quick fix program and requires a considerable investment of time and effort.  The program takes 56 days to complete, but often improvement will be seen before the end of the 56-day period.\n\nThe effectiveness of this app was evaluated in a recent study and the results were presented in a poster session at the Sleep 2018 conference.  The results showed that the app is helpful in restoring sleep for those with insomnia.  Users who completed the app through the end of the program obtained the best results.\n\nRead here: https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsy061.407\n\nDo you have insomnia?  Insomnia is trouble getting to sleep or getting back to sleep after nighttime awakenings which contributes to impairment in daytime functioning.  It is the most common sleep problem affecting up to 30% of people.  It is also one of the most misunderstood.  Most healthcare providers don’t know much beyond good sleep hygiene practices.  This approach involves a list of recommendations including don’t drink coffee and get out of bed if you can’t sleep.  You may be surprised to hear that these recommendations alone have little scientific support as an effective approach for treating insomnia.  The most effective treatment for insomnia involves a multi-component cognitive behavioral approach, commonly referred to as (CBT-I). However access to the treatment is limited by a shortage of trained providers.  Although in person treatment may be the most effective approach, a self-guided approach can be effective. If interested in seeing a specialist in person a list of behavioral sleep providers with experience in CBT-I can be found at the following website:  http://www.behavioralsleep.org/FindSpecialist.aspx. \n\nIf you do not have a specialist in your area or would first like to try a self-guided approach, the information in this app can be very helpful in getting you on the road to conquering your insomnia.  The app is based on the best of current sleep science and will guide you through a step-by-step approach to rehabilitate your sleep.  Please take the following survey to see if you are a candidate for the treatment approach.\n\nParticipation candidate survey:\n1. Does it take you longer than 30 minutes to fall asleep at night?\n2. Are you awake longer than 30 minutes in the middle of the night?\n3. Do you wake too early in the morning and can’t get back to sleep?\n4. Do you have trouble getting to sleep at your desired time?\n5. Have you been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder or a seizure disorder?\n\nIf you said yes to any of questions 1-4, and no to question 5 then you may be able to benefit from this program.  If you answered yes to question 5, please discuss your candidacy for CBT-I with your physician or try to identify a behavioral sleep specialist in your area."

Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

      "label": "There is proven scientific evidence that if you pace your eating during meals and eat slower it will reduce the  amount you require to feel full and in this way help you lose weight without feeling hungry.  This application is available as an iPhone/iPod app or as an Apple Watch app.  Simply create a desired duration of the meal and the seconds between each bite and the app will notify you when to take the next bite with a subtle sound.  You can choose from a variety of sounds including a random selection of dinner table related sounds such as glass clinks or fork on plate. Each notification is accompanied with an optional vibration so you could simply keep the phone in your pocket and out of the way and still use the app.  This way your dinner companions are not distracted but you know when to take the next bite.\n\nIf you own an Apple Watch the interaction is even easier.  You simply use the Apple Watch to start a session and the watch will give you subtle vibration feedback on your wrist for each bite to eat without having to take out your phone.\n\nFor best results try to eat a small bite every 30-40 seconds.  Don't worry if you miss a cycle, simply wait for the next vibration or sound to take your next bite and enjoy your meal.  Try to make your meals last about 15-20 minutes.\n\nHere are some additional tips on how to use the app:\n\n+ Reduce the portion you eat but still eat it in approximately 15-20 minutes.\n+ Set the portion size and don't go back for seconds.\n+ Leave a couple of good size bites at the end to help end the meal session.\n+ Use for snacks as well.  Reduce time to about 10 minutes. \n+ Brush your teeth soon after you eat. It is a good way of telling your body that the meal is over.\n+ Use the app for all meals small or large.  If you are not monitoring your pace you'll be surprised how easy it is to fall back into eating faster which will lead to overeating.\n+ You can configure the application to play a sound or just vibrate or both.\n+ You have the option of using many different sounds for each bite or select from a random set of typical dinner table sounds."

      "label": "If you love working out with Apple Watch, but you need more advanced fitness stats, HealthFit is for you.\n\nBy analyzing the workout data stored in Apple Health, HealthFit provides the kind of indispensable tracking and insights you normally only get from premium subscription services. But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times. You can even log which bike or shoes you use, to monitor usage and flag when it’s time to replace them.\n\nHealthFit finds photos you take during your workouts automatically, bringing your activity feed to life with stunning images you can share on social media.\n\nRUNNING POWER ANALYSIS\n\nHealthFit provides advanced running power analysis with the automatically estimated critical power, the weighted average power, the power distribution chart by 25W Increments and the mean maximal power chart which shows your best average power for time periods of one second up to the length of your run.\n\nMULTISPORT AND INTERVAL WORKOUTS\n\nHealthFit is the only app to export multisport workouts as multisession activities\n\nSTATISTICS: UNCOVER HIDDEN FITNESS INSIGHTS\n\nApple Watch gathers so much fitness data, it can sometimes seem overwhelming. HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio.

      "label": "Biofeedback is the future and the future is now - for everyone. No additional body sensors are needed anymore! Just take your iPhone and start VaYou.\n\nVaYou Breath is innovative sound biofeedback. The app connects you directly with yourself by transforming your abdominal breathing into dynamically generated sounds. \n\nIt is very simple! You breathe relaxed and VaYou generates sounds from it - directly shaped by your breathing. With the help of real-time biofeedback, your breath, mind and heart increasingly flow as one.\n\nVaYou Breath integrates with Apple Health by updating your values for resting heart rate, respiratory rate, and mindful minutes.\n\nKey VaYou benefits\n\n• Biometric Integration - VaYou provides advanced real-time breath and pulse detection without the need for additional wearables or expensive medical sensors.\n• We have gone to the technical limits. VaYou converts the iOS motion/acceleration sensor data stream into high quality biosignals for breath and pulse (pulse only in lying position).\n• In order to support the relaxation process, the VaYou algorithms learn from your biosignals and derived parameters how to best design the sounds so that they are most effective for you at that moment.\n• No online connection needed while using - activate airplane mode for an undisturbed and healthy experience!\n\nNo other app or desktop software provides biofeedback like VaYou Breath.\n\nJust listening to the breath-generated sounds leads you into a very personal flow experience. Your consciousness is more and more \"absorbed\" by the process, your thoughts come to rest. The mental state can be described as relaxed and calming breath mindfulness. It is almost automatic to \"stay with the breath\", easily and effortless.  \n\nUnlike with apps where you have to understand and follow spoken instructions, with VaYou Breath you can \"switch off\" right from the start. The resulting flow experience brings body and mind into harmony and this has a regenerating effect.\n\nThe regular use of VaYou Breath can have a generally positive effect on body and mind. Some of the reported effects are\n• Calming the flow of thoughts\n• Reduction of stress levels\n• Self regulation of the heart and breathing activity\n• Increase of creativity\n• Improvement of mood\n• Improvement of sleep.\n\nIT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT:\n\nPut on good headphones and choose one of the perfected Sound~Flows. Then select the duration, press START and place the iPhone on your lower abdomen, just below the navel. (It's usually better to loosen a belt if you wear one and slide the iPhone halfway into the belt line of your trousers or skirt.) Keep breathing and listening! \n\nLIVE 1 and LIVE 2 is the app's main biofeedback mode. To be even more flexible, there is also a PACING mode, in which an adjustable breathing rhythm is played, which you simply breathe along. Without the need to look at the screen.\n\nIt is actually very easy to get into your personal \"Flow~Breathing\" and to experience and enjoy the balancing positive effect. \n\nWHAT YOU GET:\n\n▪ The VaYou biofeedback algorithm that turns your breathing movements into amazing Sound~Flows\n▪ The \"Flow Journey\" Sound~Flow, which guides you through a universe of different breath~sound experiences up to 30 minutes duration\n▪ The \"Four Fully\" Sound~Flow for very effective and recreational short breaks\n▪ All other Sound~Flows can be downloaded as in-app purchases within the app. And of course you get them for your LIFETIME, even if you change or loose your device. \n\nPRICES:\n\n• No subscription, no automatic renewal\n• No hidden costs or unnecessarily large packages\n• You only pay what you really like and want.\n\nWishes, questions and feedback are always welcome: welcome@vayou.app\nor at https://vayou.app/usergroup\n\nVaYou is Time for You.\nNOW is Time for You!"

      "label": "This application is a sidekick to the beastmaker 1000 and 2000. It has been designed to assist the user into gradually getting stronger on a fingerboard. The app does this by way of prewritten workouts which are often general and aim to improve all trainable grips on the board. Some are specific (2000 series only at the moment) which aim to improve, sloper strength, pocket strength and crimp strength. \n\nThere is also a new custom workout program fully adjustable and includes the 1000,2000 and micros, so if you have your own hang regime and different timings then that is all programmable and can be saved.\n\nBoth the workouts and custom timer now record hang contraction time (time spent actually hanging off the board) We recommend most users get up to around 20:00 minutes on this clock whilst doing their workouts.\n\nOn the Workout screen after you've selected your work out it is now possible to adjust set and hang times. Users who are only finger boarding and are having a rest day prior to and after training may wish to do up to 3 sets and 7 hangs. Other users may prefer to go for 2 sets and 6 hangs, this is what we'd consider an average and more suited to people doing additional types of training.\n\nPlease note the grades for the workouts aren't actually meant to relate to anything other than themselves. E.G. 5c is easier than 6a but harder than 5b. If you find 5a hard on the 1000, use a weight removal technique such as putting one foot on a chair in front of the board or using a pulley with weights on. More advice on this and other things are available in the general advice section on the Workout Ratings page.\n\nTo record your hangs press the record button (red circle icon) whilst resting. The Workout Ratings function is much improved and should now be a really useful training aid which records gradual progress and improvement.\n\nFingerboard gains take time, remember to warm up thoroughly and move on to more difficult hangs at a slightly slower pace than you think you should to give pulleys time to catch up with muscles. For example 10% strength gains over a year is brilliant improvement. 5% is still effective training.\n\nBest of luck with the training, happy hanging and we hope this helps with the motivation."

      "label": "WHAT IS BRUXAPP?\nBruxApp is the first globally available, research-based smartphone app dedicated to the study and management of Bruxism and its health consequences.\nDesigned by top international experts in a multi-center Bruxism research project and developed in 25 Research Centres across the world. \n\nWHAT CAN IT DO?\nBruxapp is a simple tool used by dentists and patients for several purposes:\n- To help the assessment  of the presence/absence of bruxism-related activities (i.e., teeth clenching or grinding, jaw clenching) and potential consequences.\n- For rating the severity of bruxism, if present.\n- As a biofeedback-based management tool for bruxism.\n- To increase patients’ awareness of bruxism activities so they can avoid or correct negative habits.\n- To make patients aware of the possible clinical consequences of bruxism and try to prevent them.\n- To promote cutting-edge knowledge about bruxism, based on the latest scientific research.\n\nWHY is BruxApp needed? \nBruxism has been increasing in prevalence over recent years. It encompasses motor activities of the jaw muscles, such as jaw or teeth clenching, and teeth grinding, some of which may be associated with clinical signs and symptoms, like tooth wear, failed dental restorations, complications with implant-supported prosthesis, muscle fatigue and temporomandibular joint pain. A correct diagnosis is therefore fundamental to establishing early prevention and management regimens.\n\nSCIENTIFIC RESEARCH\nStudies with BruxApp have been supervised by experts, as part of an ongoing multicenter research project on bruxism epidemiology and management coordinated by Prof. Daniele Manfredini, University of Siena, Italy.\n\nDEVELOPMENT\nThe app was developed by Goran Djukic, program analyst at the Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Council of Research, University of Pisa, Italy.\nBruxApp is currently available in the following languages: English, Italian, , French, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish, Brazilian, Japanese, Hebrew, Chinese, Arabic, Greek, Polish, Lithuanian, Bosnian, Romanian, Turkish, Norwegian, and Croatian, with another 4 language versions soon to be released. \n\nIMPORTANT STATEMENT\nBruxApp is not a game or gadget.  In order for BruxApp to work correctly and be effective, please dedicate 5 minutes of your time to READING the simple instructions CAREFULLY. \n\nThe full compatibility is guaranteed by iPhone 6 and higher ones and iOS 9.3 and higher ones."

Übungsverläufe werden durch Bewertungskategorien individuell dokumentiert. \r\n\r\nFerner wird kompakt Wissenswertes über Stottern und Stottertherapie dargeboten. Links, Audiobeispiele und Social-Media-Verknüpfungen runden das Angebot der App ab. Gesamthaft ist die App so ein attraktives, zeitgemässes, motivierendes und theoriegeleitetes Hilfsmittel für Betroffene und Fachpersonen im Bereich Stottertherapie. \r\n\r\nSTAN ist ein in dieser digitalen Form einmaliges Angebot im deutschsprachigen Raum und entwickelt sich fortlaufend ohne In-App-Käufe weiter. Dem Nutzer / der Nutzerin wird ein alltagsnahes und flexibel einsetzbares Tool angeboten. \r\n\r\nTherapie heisst, nicht nur im Therapieraum an seinem Sprechen, an seinem Stottern zu arbeiten – STAN unterstützt hier konkret für den Transfer in den Alltag. Therapieerfolg misst sich letztendlich daran, dass Betroffene die Therapieinhalte in ihren Alltag integrieren und ‘am Ball bleiben’. Eine grosse Auswahl an Übungen aus verschiedenen Therapieströmungen sowie lustvolle Übungsformen auf einem allzeit griffbereiten Gerät sind hier eine echte Hilfe."

About 25* languages supported. Receive speed voice cues while listening to music.\n\n2. Speed data filtering. Readings with the filter on are more inert than those with the filter off though. THE FILTER MUST BE ON WHEN CYCLING, JOGGING OR WALKING.\n\n3. The G-meter. Get APPROXIMATE acceleration calculated based on your speed variation. Why use the GPS G-meter: no need to keep your iPhone in a fixed position or connect it to your vehicle’s computer system, which means speed readings can be taken discreetly, for example, during a test drive. Taking a number of readings compensates lesser accuracy. Acceleration is calculated only when the filter is off. Acceleration cannot be measured near tall buildings, in the mountains or woods.\n\n4. Large, well-lit digits\n\n5. HUD (the speed is displayed in the windscreen reflection at night time or in cloudy weather)\n\n6. Background mode. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n7. Speed and acceleration graphs\n\n8. Odometer\n\n9. Altimeter\n\n10. Time, journey duration, and current stop duration. The current stop duration will be reset after 20 seconds of motion.\n\n11. See tracks on the map\n\n12. Save tracks\n\n13. Compass\n\n14.

The file name must begin with \"Route\". Using iTunes, transfer the file into the app (OR use the \"Files\" app). Following this, you will be able to select your route at the bottom of your track list. Now you can easily travel following your route line, even without loading a map.\n\n20. Export and import files via iTunes and email\n\n21. Waypoints (description, color selection, keywords, photos, audio records)\n\n22. A single waypoint database with a filter option\n\n23. Music controls\n\n24. No annoying ads\n\n25. Vintage design \n\n\nWhy use voice cues:\n\n1. Get notified if you have gone over the speed limit.\n\n2. Voice cues allow novice drivers to find out their current speed without taking their eyes off the road.\n\n3. Control your speed, even when you have limited or no access to your phone's screen, for example, when you are out jogging, roller-skating, cycling or skiing.\n\n4. Keep your speed under control when you are driving at high speeds , as taking your eyes off the road can be highly dangerous.\n\n5. Control your speed discreetly by using headphones.\n\n\nVoice cues rules:\n• \"50,80-\" — Receive voice cues once the speed goes over or under 50 and each time it changes after hitting the 80 mark.\n• \"+25,-30\" — Receive voice cues once the speed hits the 25 mark (when speeding up) and when it goes below 30 (while slowing down).\n• \"10-20\" like \"10,11,12,...19,20\".\n• \"0-10-60,70-5-\" — Detailed cues, such as \"0,10,20,...60,70,75,80,85,90,...\".\n• \"-10-10-40,+70-5-\" — Detailed cues, such as \"-10, -20, -30, -40, +70, +75, +80, +85, +90,...\".\n• You can use rules for sound signals (for example \"55!! 60!!!\"). But then the rules for pronouncing the speed will not work.\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/fu7nlxfjkf8\n\n* — English, Deutsch, 日本語, Español, Français, Italiano, Русский, العربية, ไทย, Nederlands, Português, Polski, Ελληνικά, Bahasa Indonesia, Svenska, Türkçe, 한국어, Magyar, Čeština, Dansk, Suomi, Română ..."

IT’S ALOT - I KNOW :)\nAnd that is why I have created the POLE WITH STEPH MONTHLY PROGRAMS. Upon downloading the app, you will have the option to become a premium member to enjoy the benefits of this all - inclusive program for all levels. Every month, you will receive a thorough program, with specific challenges & homework added weekly.\nI make sure to give you instruction in all those things that are important for safe, consistent progress that you not only see but also FEEL!! With the programs, I teach you how to work WITH your body, so you can achieve all your pole & flexibility goals with a body that feels GOOD, balanced, and strong… not one that hurts after being forced into a move it wasn’t ready for.\nAs a member of the program, you will enjoy the following benefits:\n\n1:1 Feedback - you can ask questions and share videos with me, so I can make sure you are getting the most out of the program. There is also a group to share progress and struggles and connect with your fellow members.\n\nDownloadable personal training log to schedule and reflect on your training sessions.\n\n3 Day/ week gym training program\n\nThis program is designed for intermediate and advanced students looking to level up their training. There is a strong emphasis on shoulder health, overall core stability & strength, inversion practice, active leg flexibility, and upper body push/ pull circuits in order to balance and strengthen your body for your pole or aerial training. Each session is 45-75 minutes and is best performed at a gym, however, can be modified for home or pole studio training. These workouts are written by Tiana Nicole Tallant, who has her DPT and has extensive knowledge in anatomy, movement, motor learning & skill development, and programming. I've personally been following her programming since 2019 and it has immensely contributed to my progress!\nSo what are you waiting for?? It’s time to spend LESS time planning and MORE time training and practicing!!\nCONTACT\nInstagram: @stephanietallant_pole\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/StephanieTallant\nWebsite: https://linktr.ee/stephanietallant\nHASHTAG the following to be featured\n#Polewithsteph #Flexwithsteph #Pwsapp #thepoleapp\n\nT&Cs and Privacy Policy can be found at: https://polewithsteph.disciplemedia.com/onboarding_documents"

      "label": "E Numbers\n\nAn application of the magazines Bon à Savoir, K-Tipp ans Spendere Meglio\n\nFood is increasingly « completed » with additives (colorants, conservatives, firming agents, flavor enhancers, etc.) often indicated on the labels, but sometimes in coded form: an E, followed by a number between 3 and 4 digits. Thus, the flavor enhancers, in certain soups, identified as E 621, E 627 and E 631 on the packaging have the following translation (which you will not find on the label): they are respectively, glutamate, guanylate and sodium inosinate. All three can trigger allergic reactions, asthma and are thus not recommended to people sensitive to them: you will not find the latter information on the label either!\n\nOur application will allow you to decode what the industry is trying to hide from you, by not only informing you of the risks and eventual contra-indications for people on a special diet (vegetarian, gluten, etc), but also by explaining the use of each additive and in which foods they are often used.\n\nThis is the result of summary work conducted by our editors with the help of sixteen carefully documented and much diversified sources. From them, we have extracted and gathered information, which is clearly referenced in the application, and noted each additive according to the following criteria :\n\n•\tSafe: no source indicates a risk.\n•\tSome doubts: at least one source refers to a risk.\n•\tSubstantial risks: several sources indicate the same risks.\n•\tTo be avoided: a majority of sources recommend that this additive be avoided.\n•\tNo risk info: the sources give insufficient information or none at all on the risks.\n\nFurthermore, for each product we indicate if it is authorised in Switzerland and in the European Union. For the latter we base our information on the new Regulation CE 1130/2011 that came into force on 2nd December 2013. When the product is banned in other countries, we indicate it at the top of the risks. We update those data as we receive information about any reliable changes. \n\nFor each additive, we mention the ADI (acceptable daily intake), which is the maximum dose of the additive that can be consumed daily by a person throughout their lifetime, without the JECFA experts (Joint Experts Committee for Food Additives) estimating that there is a danger. When known, it is expressed in milligrams of substance per kilogram of body weight. But the experts have often given up specifying it. More rare: we did not find any information about it.

You can save your results for future reference, keep track of multiple people with individual profiles, add notes and locations, and even print out your measurements for sharing or safe keeping.\n\nCardiograph uses your device's built-in camera to take pictures of your fingertip and calculate your heart's rhythm - the same approach used by professional medical equipment!\n\n\"I know you have the disclaimer on the screen but I don't care, Cardiograph saved my life. Your app was key to understanding what was going on and help the doctors understand too.\"\nBob Spadafora - *****\n\n\"Comparing heart rates with family over the holidays is fun.\"\nTxyak – ****\n\n\"Wanna impress a friend with a cool app. This is the one to get.\"\nMattyray – *****\n\n\"After having two heart valve replacements and a by-pass, I feel it is not only smart - but also necessary - to have such a reliable heart rate monitor with me everywhere I go.\"\nDantv – *****\n\n\"I am an EMT and it helps me actually see what is going on. It is by no means definitive like a monitor but it is a great indicator of problems I would not see otherwise.\"\nGranniem – ****\n\n\"I had a pulse oximeter on one hand, medical quality, and my iPhone app in the other and the app was dead-on accurate.\"\nLike it but hate it – *****\n\n\n=== See Cardiograph in action ===\nhttp://macropinch.com/cardiograph \nhttp://youtu.be/isIjcCFYEho\n\n\n• Measure your heart rate\n\nIt's never been easier to know what your heart rate is! Without any external hardware, just using the built-in camera of your smartphone or tablet, you can get accurate readings almost instantly.\n\nKnowing how fast your heart is beating can be very useful when exercising, if you're under stress, if you have a heart-related medical condition, or even just out of curiosity.\n\n\n• Track your results\n\nEvery measurement you take is saved to your personal history, so you can keep track over time. In addition to the date and time of the measurement, you can also save the location at which it was taken (and see them on a map), and even add a quick note to effortlessly organize your history.\n\n\n• Multiple profiles\n\nCardiograph is perfectly tailored to allow multiple people to use the app on a shared device. You can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them has their own individual measurement history.\n\n\n• Export & Print\n\nEach measurement can be exported in full detail to a portable format that you can later send via e-mail, upload on the web or even print right from the app itself (with an AirPrint™ compatible printer).\n\n\n• Clean and intuitive design\n \nInspired by real-life medical equipment, Cardiograph is a pleasure to use. The streamlined and clutter-free design makes it seem instantly familiar, so you can focus on using the app instead of navigating through series of confusing screens.\n\n\n• Built-in user guide\n\nIf you're having trouble with the app, or you want to make the most out of it, you can access the comprehensive help manual right from within the app itself.\n\n\n• Universal application with iCloud® sync\n\nCardiograph is an universal application - it runs on the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod touch.\nInstall Cardiograph on multiple devices with iOS 5.0+, and all your profiles and measurements will be in sync! Manage your profiles and measurements on one device, and the changes are instantly reflected on all the others.\n\n\nPlease note: If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\n\n\nFollow the latest news:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch \nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

How many times have you stopped paying attention to the person you're having a conversation with because notifications appear on the screen?\n\nTherefore, OFFTIME has as its main objective that your phone or electronic device does not control your life, but is just another tool.\n\nWe won't take control of your phone, but we will allow you to disconnect while taking your OFFTIME moment, while encouraging you to avoid other apps or calls and emails from distracting you at the moment.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n \n- Time to disconnect: The application gives you OFFTIME. You can keep receiving calls, in other applications and the sounds are still working. While you are in your moment. OFFTIME and use your phone, the application will send you notifications so you know you are not fulfilling it. Once I used it for more than 30 seconds, the OFFTIME moment is considered canceled \n- Extended OFFTIME programming, to define specific punctual dates.\n - OFFTIME events: you will now be able tu invite your iOS Friends and family to a joint OFFTIME event. Disconnect together for as long as you want and do something fun and useful with your time without your electronic devices.\n\nOFFTIME also has a PRO version that, in addition, will answer you: \n\n- Schedule more than one rest at a time\n- You can create different blocking profiles to block the calls from the contacts that you wish to select while you are doing an OFFTIME.\n- Access backup copies of all your devices, so that no matter what device you use, your OFFTIME time is registered and disconnected on all your screens.\n\nThe OFFTIME team is working to improve the versions of our application, so that each time more is disconnected and you can dedicate yourself to everything that the mobile has taken from you.\n\nWhat are you waiting for to return to a life free of devices?

      "label": "Buddhify is here to help you bring more calm, clarity and kindness to all parts of your life.\n\nWhether you're looking to reduce stress and anxiety, or get a better night's sleep buddhify has easy-to-follow guided meditations to help you live happier and healthier.\n\nNo need to find the time for a formal meditation session everyday, we'll show you how to bring mindfulness to all parts of your life with exercises for whatever you're doing and wherever you are - from travelling, taking a break at work or going to sleep.

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

      "label": "RESPIROGUIDE PRO: THE NEWEST VERSION, MORE PERSONAL \n\n“Simple and amazingly effective for better concentration, stress anxiety, ADHD and trauma healing” –  Kees L. Blase, medical physicist,  National Centre for Stress Management,The Netherlands.\n\nRespiroguide PRO is brought to you by Vital-EQ the International Institute for Stress Management.\n**********\nTHE ABC of STRESSMANAGEMENT\nRespiroguide uses the most recent research in neurosciences and stress management, research that has been condensed into the most convenient one-touch tool. The knowledge is based on the heart's resonant frequency  which induces heart and breath coherence.\nRespiroguide Pro will train the reflexes and so the elasticity of your vascular system. This will help in lowering blood pressure, is effective in coping with stress and anxiety, and enhances better concentration at school and work. \nHeart rate is a dynamic body function that varies in each moment. \nIn an Active state (sympathic activity) heart rate increases, \nin a Calm and relaxed state heart rate decreases. \nCardiac Coherence is the Balanced  state of the autonomic nervous system in which you feel safe and happy, free from fear and anxiety and overstressed reactions.\nThe body can be brought into the state of Cardiac Coherence through guided breathing. Guiding the resonance frequency (Respiroguide Pro) can be compared with guiding someone on a swing by pushing at just the right moment to optimise their swing.   \nEach individual has his or her own personal respiratory frequency (resonance frequency) in which cardiac coherence is optimal. This ideal respiratory frequency is between 0,06 Hz and 0,12 Hz. The Respiroguide Pro will help you to find your personal resonance frequency, which depends on the length and width of your blood vessels. \nYou can set the guide in four different frequencies:\n1. Average: F6: 6 breaths a minute = 0,1 Hz\n2. Average: F5: 5 breaths a minute = 0,083 Hz\n3. Slow: F4: 4 breaths a minute = 0,066 Hz\n4. Quick: F7: 7 breaths a minute = 0,118 Hz\nTo find your resonance frequency it’s important to experience all four breathing frequencies and notice:\n-which one provides the most balanced feeling\n-which one can be comfortably sustained for a period of at least 5 minutes\n-which one gives a maximum amplitude in Heart Rate Variability. This last function requires  access to a HRV-biofeedback instrument with a Cardiac Coherence Coach.\nCardiac Coherence Coaches can be found at  www.hartfocus.nl (Netherlands) and www.heartintelligence.com/VitalEQ  (Europe, Asea). \nThe Respiroguide Pro is a medical tested safe device. More than 20 years of research showed positive effects:lowering bloodpressure, less anxiety, enhancing performance, coping with stress, effective treatment of trauma.Take care: do not  inhale too deeply, this occasionally make you dizzy. Focusing on the exhale is the most effective way. \n\nQUICK START: press the play button and just breathe in and out with the yellow dot. Breathe in as the dot goes up, breathe out as it goes down.\n\nThe default setting is a 3 minute long exercise. This is what it takes to lower your level of stress. \nYou can gradually increase the exercise lengths, but remember to exercise three times every day. Over one week of exercising you will notice the effects in your body.\n\nProbably the best investment you will ever make. If you use it!\n\nOther options:\n1. Turn the sea wave sounds on and off (the waves are synchronized to the specific 0,1Hz frequency)\n2. Choose the duration of the exercise; remember that the secret to stress   relief is practicing several times every day, so make it simple, use the Respiroguide!\n\nFor details access the following websites:\n- www.heartintelligence.com in English\n- www.nuvitaal.nu and www.hartfocus.nl in Dutch\n- www.emnergie.com in French\n************\nWe do appreciate your feedback!\n\nVital-EQ, the International Institute for Stress Management."

Get your ideas out or play until inspiration hits using a selection of Ableton Live’s drum kits, synths and melodic instruments. Or create your own sound palette by recording the sounds around you into Note’s sampler instruments using your phone’s microphone. \n\nIf you want to take your ideas further, use Ableton Cloud to send your projects to Live (version 11.2.5 or later) without leaving the app. Open your project from Live’s browser, then keep working – you can edit all your MIDI notes, and all your samples and sounds from Note are exactly the same.\n\n\nBegin with a beat: \n• Choose from 56 Drum Sampler kits\n• Tap out a beat using the 16-pad grid\n• Quantize your beat to fix any loose timing\n• Nudge notes to correct mistakes\n• Add more layers of rhythm\n• Create beat repetitions with Note Repeat\n• Change parameters to shape your sound\n• Experiment with effects \n\nStart with a melody:\n• Choose from 261 synth sounds and 36 Melodic Sampler instruments\n• Play your melody or chord progression with either the 25-pad grid or the piano roll\n• Set a key and scale to get instantly harmonic results, or leave your options open\n• Overdub more layers of harmony\n• Change parameters to shape your sound\n• Add effects to experiment with sound design\n\nSample your environment:\n• Create your own kits by recording percussive sounds into Note’s Drum Sampler \n• Record tonal sounds to create your own Melodic Sampler instruments\n• Manipulate your samples by cutting, filtering or repitching them\n• Shape or transform your sounds with effects\n\nCapture improvisations:\n• Play something, then tap the Capture button to keep it\n• Play at the tempo that feels comfortable and Note will detect it\n• Note will recognize the length of the phrase\n• A loop is created automatically\n• Quantize it, add to it, or change the sound\n\nCreate variations:\n• Note features a grid-based Session View layout\n• Double your loops to create variation within clips\n• Duplicate your clips and create different versions of your ideas\n• Create eight tracks with up to eight clips on eight scenes\n• Try different layer combinations and song structures \n• Export your work in Session View as an audio file to listen and share"

All filters and averaging modes meet or exceed the criteria for ANSI Type 1 standards or better. SPL is created from the same team who brought you the Audio Toolbox and ATB Plus.  \n\nStore Results -- Uses the same powerful Save / Recall engine as our premier app, AudioTools. Allows storing GPS and time-stamped results, and exporting them to your computer.\n\nYou can also use SPL with our calibrated iPhone measurement mic, iTestMic, or iAudioInterface. \n\nThe screen flips if you turn the phone upside down, so that you can point the built-in iPhone mic directly at the sound source.\n\n*** Modes: Slow, Fast, Impulse, Peak, and Leq.\n\n*** Filters: A and C weighting, and 10 octave band filters.\n\n*** Includes a resettable Max field to track the highest reading.\n\n*** Includes a reference field (except in Leq mode) so that you can set a reference level and do seat-to-seat comparisons.\n\nThe SPL meter can be fully calibrated. It comes preset with the calibration for a typical iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch. Most iOS devices will be within a few dB of this reading. If you have access, even temporarily, to a calibrated sound level meter, just use the calibration field on the settings scree to match the meter, and you will be accurately calibrated.\n\nAlso, see our other professional-grade audio apps: AudioTools, our premier suite of professional-caliber audio and acoustics test apps, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and RTA, a real-time analyzer for the iPhone.\n\nAnd, we have a group of calibrated, accurate measurement microphones, including iTestMic,iTestMic2, and iAudioInterface2, that allows full professional results for Type 1 or Type 2 measurements. \n\nThis will allow measuring a range from approximately 30 dB SPL to 130 dB SPL. Each mic will include a calibration factor that you will enter into the SPL app for calibrated measurements. This mic will also work with Speaker Pop, our speaker polarity tester, FFT, RTA, ETC, and other acoustical measurement apps in our AudioTools app that is available now.\n\nAlso, see our iAudioInterface2 system, which supports any pro test and measurement mic. \n\nNow includes an iPhone internal mic compensation filter, to cancel out the low-frequency roll-off present in the iPhone and other iOS devices.\n\nSee our other audio apps, including AudioTools."

      "label": "\"... the sound quality blew us away.\"- Gearburn.com\nMusic player with the most powerful and acurate equalizer in the app store as well as the most advanced playlist controls.\n\n+ Play music directly from your Music Library including podcasts and music video (audio only)\n+ Adjust the powerful parametric equalizer by moving the seven control points or type in the values directly.\n+ Adjust the EQ curve for your left and right ear separately (now extends from -30 to + 30 dB. Use the StereoEQ setting for that)\n+ Select from over 10 presets or save your own. You can even share them via email and import presets from other people via email.\n+ Full background support including remote control (from docks, headsets, car stereos)\n+ Visualize the music with the spectrum analyzer.\n+ Use AirPlay to listen on your AppleTV, or your Bluetooth headsets and even a dock. \n+ Use the pre-amp slider to adjust the overall boost or cut. Make sure to turn the slider down if you experience distortion. Use the auto-normalizer function to prevent clipping automatically and have the best dynamic range possible with your eq curve. (on/off in settings)\n+ Curve screen: curve redraws as controllers are dragged. Pinch to modify Q. Three stage clipping signal on preamp slider. Keyboard entry for pre-amp. Twitter/Facebook/Weibo integration to share your current EQ curve. Bypass.\n+ Crossfade between songs. Make sure to stop the music before changing the crossfade time slider.\n+ Now playing screen includes repeat (all, single no repeat) button and shuffles like the music app. Improved stability of on the fly modifications of the playlist. Add more songs to the playlist at any time. Sort playlist alphabetically.\n+ Music selection is very similar to default music app.\n+ Turn landscape to display the frequency analyzer. \n+ Built in sleep timer to stop Equalizer after a certain period if time. \n+ Crossfeed option to blend audio between channels\n+ Apple Watch support for eq curve selection incl. complications\n\nKNOWN ISSUES:\nNo known issues. please contact support if you have any problems.\n\nCOPY-PROTECTED MUSIC:\nEqualizer will not play copy-protected (DRM). You need to convert DRM songs. Apple Music Streaming uses copy-protected songs.\n\niCLOUD:\nOnly the Apple Music app can manage songs in iCloud (iTunes Match). You will need to make sure the songs are downloaded to your device to listen and enhance them via Equalizer. If you want to stream and eq your music, you can try our other app: CloudEQ. It allows you to stream and eq music from SoundCloud and your Dropbox account without the need for storage on your device.\n\nFrom the reviews:\n\nEXCELLENT PROGRAM\nI connect my iphone 4 to a car audio system, with the application the music began to sound incomparably better ....\nA little clear interface, but to understand it and understand need no more than 5-10 minutes. -- P_S_B_\n***\nLOVE IT\nThis is the EQ I have been looking for, and because of bad ratings I almost passed on it! I consider myself an aspiring audiophile and have the equipment -- Klipsch, Sunfire, Nottingham, Denon, Paradigim, etc. -- (and debt) to back it up. This EQ performs flawlessly and is very easy to use. It enhanced my music dramatically. Yes, dramatically! Just make sure you are running the recommended IOS, as the developer suggests. -- J. Paul DiMaggio\n***\n\n\nPLEASE if you have concerns or encounter problems with the app: post on http://www.audioforge.ca and we will explain how things work, until you can use all the features of the app to the fullest. Thank you"

      "label": "You wish you could play any video file on your iPhone/iPad, no matter its format?  that's why we made GPlayer.\n\n@ZDNET: GPlayer fills the iOS void left by VLC!\n\n* Follow our Twitter @GinkgoTech to get the free code when new version released.\n \n* GPlayer was honored as \"app of the Week\" in the Appcast.\n\n* Supported File Format Extension \n\n- AVI(without packet-b frame), WMV, RMVB, ASF, H264, MKV, TS, M2TS... most of all movie file formats.\n- MP3, WMA, WAV, OGG, FLAC... most of all audio file formats.\n- SMI, ASS, SUB, SRT, TXT... most of all subtitle file formats. [build in subtitle is also supported]\n\n* Extra Features\n\n- USB Sync: Use itunes to fast sync movies to GPlayer.\n- WIFI Upload: Upload movie even you don't have the cable.\n- File Management: Support New/Rename/Cut/Paste/Delete.\n- Movie Thumbnail: Easy to find the movie you want to view.\n- Different Play Mode: Support Loop off/Loop One/Loop all.\n- Screen Lock: View your movie even on the bed.\n- Dynamically Menu: Dynamically choose audio/subtitle channel and encoding method.\n- Gesture support: Easier way to do seek while playing the movie.\n- Resume Function: Don't worry about closing your application suddenly.\n- TV Out: Both cable TV out and AirPlay are supported.\n- iTunes Backup: By default, we will not backup media data when you do iTunes sync or iCloud backup, and you can't see the files in iTunes, you can enable it in the settings page to backup your media data.\n\n* FAQ\n\n- How do I put files into GPlayer? \nTo add files to your GPlayer app, you have to go to iTunes, and select the “Apps” tab. At the bottom of this page, there’s a “File sharing” section – just select GPlayer in the list, and add files from there. Note that you don’t have to sync your iPhone or iPad to iTunes to add movies. Just drop files in the “File sharing” tab, and they’ll be uploaded immediately. You can even use a friend’s iTunes to add videos to your own iPhone. Also, adding files over WiFi is supported. Indeed, WiFi is significantly slower than USB, and ruins the battery life.\n\n- What kind of streams does GPlayer play? \nGPlayer is able to play RTSP and MMS streams. For now those can’t be added to the media library, but you can click an RTSP or MMS url in Safari or Mail for example.\nIf you want to use GPlayer to open HTTP/FTP streaming, add \"gplayer:\" prefix in the URL.\n\n- I want to explicitely open an attachment with GPlayer? \nIf you want to watch an attachment in GPlayer(from Mail for example), just do a long press on the attachment. A menu will pop-up that will let you pick GPlayer as a player.\n\n- iTunes won’t let me install GPlayer on my iPhone or iPod Touch? \nUnfortunately, we had to drop support for older iOS devices such as the iPhone 3G or the first two versions of iPods. Indeed, after some testing, we realized those weren’t fast enough to provide a pleasant experience.\n\n- Why HD MKV movies don’t play smoothly? \nCurrently, only iPad 2 supports 720p MKV file, that’s to be expected. The other iDevices have limited computing power, and cannot handle the complex task of decoding HD movies in real time.\n\n- The audio and the video is not in sync? \nThat is because the CPU is not power enough to do video decoding, you can try to enable \"Skip Frame\" in the settings page.\n\n- Is there a TV-out support? \nYep, supports iPod gen4, iPhone4, iPhone4S and iPad 1/2.\n\n* Contact us\n\nMail: gplayersupport@hotmail.com\nWebsite: gplayersupport.wordpress.com\n\n* If you want to help to translate GPlayer to your mother language, just drop a mail to gplayersupport@hotmail.com, that will help people in your country enjoy this software, and we will put your name in thanks page!"

RTA is a professional-grade acoustical analysis tool. All filters meet or exceed ANSI and IEC Class 1 specifications. \n\nIncludes Octave and 1/3 Octave modes, with selectable decay times, as well as Peak Hold and true linear Average mode.\n\n*** iOS Microphones\n\nWe have analyzied every iOS device, including all of the iPads, all iPhones, and iPod touches, and have created microphone compensation files that are applied automatically. You can trust the results you are getting, often within just a few dB of a far more expensive analyzer. Calibration is updated regularly, automatically, from our cloud-based calibration database.\n\nUpgrade to our iTestMic or iAudioInterface2 to bring your system up to full professional specs.\n\n*** Save and Recall Graphs\n\nYou can save and recall graphs, marked with the GPS location, date & time, and your comment, as well as store the image to your photo roll.\n\nExport the data as an XLS formatted file to your computer for inclusion in reports or further analysis.\n\n*** Max and Min Bars\n\nYou can also turn on resettable Max/Min bars (see image #4) to capture peaks. Double-tap to reset the bars.\n\n*** Specifications and Devices\n\nThe internal iPhone mic has a noise floor near 30 dB, and if your are running iOS 6, clips around 120 dB. \n\n*** Touch GUI\n\nFully interactive touch GUI features includes scroll up/down, pinch to zoom or compress the vertical dB scale, or swipe horizontally to get a cursor that reads out the exact dB level and frequency across the screen. To make the cursor disappear, swipe it off the graph to the left.\n\nThe landscape-mode display flips 180 degrees so that you can face the internal mic in either direction.\n\n*** Overlay Curves\n\nAlso included are optional noise curve overlays, in NCB, RC, PNC, NC, X-Curve and NR mode. See picture #2 for an example. Use this feature to get a quick reading on the noise levels in a room. Also includes the cinema large-room X-curve overlay.\n\n*** Calibration\n\nRTA can be fully calibrated, whether you are using it with the internal iOS microphone, or one of our professional test & measurement mic solutions. And, if you are using iTestMic, the mic calibration is transmitted directly to the app, so you are always calibrated.\n\n*** RTA or FFT?\n\nIf you are wondering if you should download this app or our FFT app, check out our website, we have a page devoted to this topic.\n\nSee our other acoustics and audio apps, including AudioTools."

      "label": "This metronome app is created by a musician for musicians. Almost all metronome apps boast about their accuracy, but users with sensitive hearing notice inaccurate beats all the time. It used to be impossible to create a perfectly accurate metronome on a mobile device. Despite the failure of other apps, perfect time is possible for TrueMetronome: its unique engine creates perfect beats with ABSOLUTE ZERO error. For this reason, TrueMetronome is the most accurate metronome app on any mobile platform.\n\nSound quality is the second issue for software metronomes. Serious musicians prefer a natural sound filled with overtones, but all metronome apps play short synthetic samples (so that the first sound stops completely before the next begins). Thus, you hear an artificial, dead sound. Moreover, the identical samples playing at the same frequency can drive any man crazy! TrueMetronome solves this problem thoroughly: all sounds are recorded from real metronomes, a beat does not affect the gradual decay of its predecessors, and each beat's sound is a little different from the others. All this contributes to the natural sound which is easier on your ears.\n\nFinally, an aesthetic, thoughtful interface is an important aspect of any application, and TrueMetronome pays particular attention to it. Creating an electronic metronome interface is simple, but TrueMetronome does not cut corners: it recreates the look and feel of a real mechanical metronome; every mark on the scale is labeled with a tempo mark, the deviation angle of the pendulum depends on the tempo, and the tempo is selected by dragging the weight.\n\nYou can adjust the tempo in 2 BPM (beats per minute) increments by dragging the digital weight. This restriction prevents a change of tempo from accidental touches, and when you need greater precision in the selection of the tempo, there are \"+\" and \"-\" buttons as well. On the lower part of the metronome, you can turn the bell on and off and select the number of beats per measure.\n\nTo start or to stop the beats, simply tap anywhere.\n\n-------------------------------------\nKey features\n-------------------------------------\n- Perfect beats with ZERO error (unparalleled!)\n- Natural sound without duplicate samples (unique to TrueMetronome!)\n- Realistic look and feel with particular attention to comfortable usability\n- Optional bell on the first beat of the measure\n- Selection from all known meters: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13\n- Tap tempo function\n- Skins"

A GPU-powered, fast and advanced integrated editor is part of TouchOSC on all platforms - create the most complex of control layouts with ease and precision.\n\nMIDI, OSC and more...\n\nTouchOSC supports sending and receiving any number of MIDI and OSC messages on many connections simultaneously. On top of OSC over UDP & TCP, we support every type of wired & wireless MIDI connection your device can offer, including MIDI over USB.\n\nCross-Network. Synchronized editing.\n\nMultiple instances of TouchOSC can be connected on the network for synchronized editing. Use the precision of your desktop's mouse and keyboard for fine-grained, detailed editing - test-drive and preview in real-time on all connected touch-screen devices at the same time.\n\nScripting and local messages.\n\nA lightweight and fast scripting engine allows deep access to all aspects of your controller and enables limitless customization and interactivity. For less complex tasks we've added local messages - simply wire up controls to transmit or display values; no need to break out the big (code) guns. Easy.\n\nThis is only the beginning...\n\nWe've supported and updated TouchOSC Mk1 for more than 10 years at this point and we're planning to do the same for this new version. We've already got a whole bunch of features cooking that were just not quite ready yet. There is so much more to come... \n\nWelcome to the next generation!"

The app is real time chord tracker that uses the microphone of the device. \nThe found chords are displayed with big letters on the screen but you can also see individual music tones with small letters at the bottom.\n\nMIDI recording is an experimental feature. I do not know of any 100% successful audio to MIDI converter yet but this one I have made works relatively good for solo instruments. However full songs with drums and noises are not so good :) \nAudio to MIDI conversion is also real time so some tones may be missed because the CPU may not catch up (depends on the device)\n\nAt the moment chord detection is limited to major, minor, 5th and 7th chords."

      "label": "BLEASS Motion FX contains 11 different effects which you can modulate precisely thanks to an intuitive and comprehensive sequencer. \nChoose an effect and dynamically modulate it thanks to an intuitive and versatile motion sequencer. Thanks to its very low CPU usage, load as many instances of Motion FX as you want and unveil new sonic territories!\n\nEffects included are:\n- Low Pass Filter\n- High Pass Filter\n- Band Pass Filter\n- Volume\n- Pan\n- Pitch Shifter\n- Frequency Shifter\n- Ring Modulator\n- Warmth\n- Bit Crusher\n- Delay\n\nEach effect has a parameter automated by the sequencer and can have one or more secondary parameters. Pick an effect and then modulate it dynamically thanks to the motion sequencer. When switching effects, the motion sequencer keeps its state to invite you to new sound design ideas!\n\n_____Sequencer:\n\nThe sequencer offers 4 to 16 steps, each step has a value and a curve. You can set the value by touching and/or dragging the step and set the curve by tapping the curve icon at the bottom of each step. Curves choices are: Step, Ramp Up, Ramp Down, Ramp and Smooth Ramp.\n- Length controls the number of steps (4 to 16).\n- Resolution controls the duration (in bars) of each step. (from 1/32 bar up to 4 bars)\n- Grid snap: when set to ON, steps values snap to the displayed grid when you change their values.\n- Reset: resets all steps to their default values (default value depends on the current selected effect).\n- Amount sets the sequencer’s amplitude.\n- Randomness sets the range in which step values are randomly chosen.\n- Smooth sets the interpolation time between steps.\n\n\n_____Effects:\n\n- Low Pass Filter, High Pass Filter and Band Pass Filter:\nThe sequencer modulates the frequency value of the filter.\nA slider controls the resonance of the filter.\n\n- Volume:\nThe sequencer modulates the gain.\n\n- Pan:\nThe sequencer modulates the pan.\n\n- Pitch shifter:\nThe sequencer modulates the pitch. The pitch range is +/- 12 semitones.\nGrain Size sets the density of the granular pitch shifter.\nGrid sets the sequencer grid to Chromatic, Major or Minor. Set Grid Snap to ON to quantize the pitch to the selected scale.\n\n- Frequency shifter:\nThe sequencer modulates the frequency. The frequency range is +/- 1kHz.\nFine adds an offset to the frequency set by the sequencer.\nIf Stereo is On, Fine value for the right channel is the opposite to the left channel.\n\n- Ring modulator:\nThe sequencer modulates the frequency. The frequency range is 1Hz to 10kHz\nFine adds an offset to the frequency set by the sequencer.\nIf Stereo is On, Fine value for the right channel is the opposite to the left channel.\n\n- Warmth:\nWarmth is a waveshaper. The sequencer modulates the strength of the waveshaper.\nDrive adds a gain before the waveshaper.\n\n- Bit crusher:\nThe sequencer modulates the rate of the bit crusher.\nDepth controls the depth of the bit crusher.\n\n- Delay\nThe signal is delayed by a time set by the sequencer. The time range is 0 to 50ms.\nFeedback sets the amount of delay feedback.\nWhen Ping Pong is On, the delayed signal bounces back and forth between the left and right channels.\nStereo sets the difference between left and right delays.\n\n- A Dry/Wet control lets you set the balance between the dry and wet signals.\n- The random preset generator (dice button next to the presets manager) only affects the parameters of the current selected FX. \n\nCheck out www.bleass.com for video tutorials and more info!\n\n\n* PLEASE NOTE: this is an Audio Unit Effect plugin (AUv3) which requires a compatible host such as AUM, GarageBand, Cubasis, BM3 or Auria. Standalone mode also available for demo purposes."

      "label": "the BLEASS reverb is a unique sounding plugin effect bringing your music production and live performances towards new soundscapes!\n\nThe BLEASS reverb is composed of 3 different stages:\n\n1/ A first stage modifies the input source by correcting the gain and setting up early reflections pre-delay in order to re-create distant walls. \nThis first stage also contains a filter to modify frequencies. Switch between two different filter types: \n- the Low-Shelf filter can reduce or boost your basses.\n- the High-Pass filter cuts the low part of the signal and creates a resonant peak on interesting frequencies.\n\n2/ The second stage offers a unique-sounding reverb with size modulation and length controls. It also contains a high frequency damping control in order to re-create plate reverb effects, as well as a freeze toggle button for infinite sound soaring and exploration.\nThis reverb offers also an X/Y panel which applies a set of fine-tuned frequency shifter as well as a wave shaper in order to mutate your reverb space on the go!\n\n3/ The third stage offers a duck effect made of a compressor side-chained on the dry input in order to bring clarity to heavy kicks and basses\n\nFinally, a dry-wet controller offers control over the reverb level. \n\nAll these features are shown within the factory presets, and you can save your own presets which will automatically carry over across different host apps. \nAll variables are exposed as AU parameters in hosts which support automation. \nBLEASS reverb can also be used as a standalone app using headphones and mic or an external sound card.\n\nCheck out www.bleass.com for video tutorials and demos!\n\n*** NOTE : this is an Audio Unit Effect Plugin (AUv3) which ideally requires a compatible host (such as AUM or Audiobus) or DAW (such as GarageBand or Cubasis) ***"

      "label": "Metronome Touch. Style of pendulum.\n\nMetronome Touch is created with one objective: to design a classic metronome with a unique style, so we combined a precise pendulum, perfected accuracy, and realistic interaction. Made of aluminum and glass, Metronome Touch proves a huge statement: It is as exclusive as your device. Launching Metronome Touch, your device will become a metronome.\n\nAnyone can try to make a metronome app, but success only comes when listening to customers. That's why Metronome Touch centers around functions that musicians are looking for: The ability to tap a beat, use customizable presets to save your favorite sets (bpm, time signature and accentuation), and multiple useful ways of adjusting the bpm. Metronome Touch even goes far beyond that: Neither analog nor digital metronomes can synchronize pendulums. But Metronome Touch can.

      "label": "Yet another ear-training app? Well, this one is different!\nPlaying jazz, pop and improvised music means being able to quickly recognize and replay what you hear. Although this app began as an ear-training tool for students of jazz and pop at the Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK), it is also intended for musicians playing in other styles, and at all levels. It was developed by Swiss IT specialist and jazz trumpeter Daniel Schenker, professor at ZHdK, in collaboration with his son Elia.\n\nHow it works\nThe app offers a host of ear-training exercises, many of them quite enjoyable, all designed to enhance both active and passive hearing. Active hearing means reproducing what you have heard on an instrument or with your voice, while passive hearing refers to the ability to identify such things as the scales, triads and four-note-chords, tensions and slash chords, on which active hearing is based. One of the features that make our app so special is the fact that its microphone enables a sort of dialogue between the app and the musician – whether on voice, brass and reed instruments, guitar, piano or electric bass. Unlike other apps, this one uses an integrated voicing generator to ensure that the chords played (position, voicing) correspond to the actual performance situation. In addition, the app uses a detailed educational guidance system, which allows users to individually customize the exercises. You can obtain 150 achievements.\n \nActive exercises (microphone)\n- Five-tone range imitation, major and minor: suitable for younger students or amateurs\n- Diatonic imitation: reproduction of notes in a particular key, vocally or on an instrument\n- Atonal imitation: improvement of relative or referential hearing\n- Intervals\n- Resolution game: technique for the improvement of downward interval singing or playing\n- Bass imitation exercises: double bass notes and root notes of various chords are to be reproduced vocally or on an instrument, a central skill that is often underdeveloped\n- Sing or replay chord tensions (e.g. #9, b13)\n- Scales sandbox: imitation practice in tonal spaces from over 40 different scales\n- Tonal memory game\n \nPassive exercises (identification practice)\n- Intervals\n- Triads/four-note-chords in root position and inversion, as well as identification of top note positions\n- Four-note-chords with one tension (17 types) and with two tensions (15 types)\n- All 12 major and minor triads above a root note (slash chords/hybrids)\n- Identification of scales and modes\nDepending on the setting, the chords can also be played arpeggiated.\n \nFor whom is the app intended?\n- Singers both amateur and professional who want to incorporate (noteless) ear training exercises into their practice programme.\n- Musicians in primary and secondary school, musicians and singers preparing for university entrance exams (practical theory), and conservatory students\n- Musicians and singers of all genres, especially jazz/pop/rock, who want to freshen up or expand their chord vocabulary\n- Brass players: control in mouthpiece exercises (buzzing)"

It's real fun to experiment, seeing how different harmonic contexts affect the perception of the same melodic fragment.\n\n\nCreate Beautiful Melodies and Flowing Chord Progressions\n\nIn the piano roll, notes that are in harmony as well as the chords' root notes are highlighted. This makes it super easy to create leads, arpeggios and basslines and to experiment with different chord voicings to let your chord progressions flowing nicely. \n\n\nIntuitive Editing\n\nA simple, yet feature rich and context-aware user interface helps you build up your ideas into whole songs:\nGroup sections into song parts and arrange them via drag and drop. \nDuplicate, copy and paste, playback selected notes.\n\n\nFile Export\n\nExport and share your creations with audio file export.\nEdit your song in other Apps with MIDI-file export.\n\n\nUse your Favorite Instrument Apps\n\nIt's just more fun to explore and create with those awesome Instrument Apps that are available in the App Store: Klimper supports Inter-App-Audio Instruments like Animoog and Model 15 as well as Audio Unit Instruments like Ripplemaker and Mersenne.\n\n\nVideo Tutorials\n\nThe included tutorial will help you getting started.

It will absolutely help you develop a more discerning ear.”\n— Voice Council Magazine\n\n“Very easy to use…a fun and useful addition to your practice toolbox.”\n— Horn World\n\n“There are a number of ear training apps available for the iPhone, but InTune has actual science to back it up.”\n— discchord\n\n“I have your app on my phone and love it!!!”\n— David P. Schurger, orchestra director, Indiana\n\n“Excellent...it’s made a remarkable difference this past year in my ability to rehearse complex 20th and 21st century music!”\n— Paul Piazza, conductor/composer, LA\n\nTHE SCIENCE BEHIND THE APP\n\nInTune began as a way for researchers to test pitch discrimination, the ability to differentiate pitches that are close together. But then researchers discovered that musicians improved the more often they played – 3x faster than those who didn’t. Download for free and see if InTune works for you!\n\nHELP US IMPROVE!\n\nWe’re always improving InTune and love hearing from users.

      "label": "Ribn is a MIDI controller with 8 assignable ribbons. What makes Ribn unique is its ability to record and loop your finger movement. This allows you to add organic repeating modulation to your synths and effects, kind of like complex LFOs. You can assign a unique MIDI channel and CC# to each ribbon. As long as your gear responds to MIDI CC messages you will be able to control it with Ribn.\n\n** FEATURES **\n• 8 MIDI CC ribbon pads\n• Add modulation to your MIDI hardware synths, effects, eurorack modulars, drum machines, etc.\n• Configurable MIDI channel and CC# per ribbon\n• You can name each ribbon to help you identify what parameter it's controlling\n• Turn off looping on individual ribbons to turn them into regular sliders\n• Choose any number of ribbons between 1 and 8\n• Full screen mode (removes navigation bar to help you focus)\n• Switch between 3 sets of configurations using presets\n• MIDI sending works while the app is in the background\n• iPad landscape mode\n• Select multiple MIDI outputs\n• Ribbons record and loop your finger movement\n• Use a wired MIDI interface, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi\n• All settings are saved automatically\n• Works with external hardware as well as other iOS synths\n• Works on iPhone (including iPhone X) and iPad starting with iOS 10\n\n** EXAMPLE USES **\n• Control hardware MIDI synths parameters like the filter cutoff frequency, resonance, oscillator octave, etc.\n• Control any soft synth in Ableton Live (or your favorite DAW) by connecting your iOS device to your Mac via Wi-Fi and choosing \"Session 1\" as the MIDI output in Ribn.\n• Control your Eurorack modules by running Ribn through a MIDI to CV converter.\n• Control other iOS synths like the Moog Model 15 or Arturia iSEM.\n• Control drum machines and effects. For example, try controlling the room size of a reverb effect unit with a looping ribbon or the snappiness of a snare drum on a drum machine. The possibilities are endless.\n• Daisy chain your MIDI hardware using MIDI Thru ports and assign each ribbon to a different MIDI channel. This way you can control more than one piece of hardware at a time. For example, you can assign the first 4 ribbons to a synth and the last 4 to an effect unit. \n\n** HOW IT WORKS **\n• Connect your MIDI gear (like a synth) to your iOS device using a MIDI interface (wired or bluetooth)\n• Launch Ribn and select your MIDI interface in the settings page.\n• Find out which CC# and MIDI channel your gear responds to (usually at the end of the manual) and enter this information in RIbn's edit view.\n• Slide your finger on a ribbon to send CC values and control the parameters on your MIDI gear.\n\n** WHAT IS MIDI AND CC? **\n• MIDI is just the way electronic musical instruments talk to each other. \n• CC (Continuous Controller) is just a way to control various parameters using MIDI.  For example, a synth's filter cutoff frequency can be controlled using a MIDI CC signal.\n\n** NOTE **\n• Ribn is a MIDI controller and doesn't produce any sounds. To use Ribn you must connect it to a device that responds to MIDI CC signals (check your gear's manual to be sure).\n• Ribn doesn't send note data, it only sends CC signals (you can't play melodies with it, but you can control various parameters like synthesizer filters, or effects settings).\n• To connect your iOS device to MIDI gear you will need to buy a MIDI interface. A MIDI interface typically connects to your iOS lightning port and provides standard MIDI DIN ports to connect to your hardware. There are also bluetooth MIDI interfaces that connect wirelessly. Alternatively, you can connect to your Mac over Wi-Fi and control software synths that way. This setup is a little more complex but totally doable (I've tested controlling Ableton Live plugins over Wi-Fi with Ribn and it worked perfectly).\n• Audiobus and AUv3 are not supported at this time. However, you can still control other iOS synths by routing the internal MIDI ports and having Ribn run in the background."

      "label": "Humanity is out of tune.\n“If one should desire to know whether a kingdom is well governed, if its morals are good or bad, the quality of its music will furnish the answer.” ~ Confucius.\n\nThe mass media is tuned to the concert pitch of A=440hz. The majority of mainstream music is in this pitch. Today's research shows that the 440 pitch might be a bit off and disharmonious with our bodies and minds. If you’re a Musician or an Audiophile or just love listening to your music this will be a tipping point for you. There is a movement in the Music World which is trying to bring the 432hz and 528Hz pitch into our lives. Why is this important? Because sound (vibration) influences the mind and body immediately. Even the slightest constant dissonance can bring one to confusion, inner chaos and staying blind to what is going on around. Think about it, when something irritates you, the only thing you can deal with is making that thing stop. But you will never address bigger problems. It is well known today that the molecular structure of water is affected by vibration, thoughts, words, ideas and of-course Music. Our human body is made of approximately 70% water. So the link is pretty immediate here.\nI’m inviting you all to listen to your beloved music through this player which you might enjoy the brighter feeling it brings, but also will conceal healing qualities for the body and mind.\nLove Light & Meditation,\n\nP.S – I strongly recommend doing your own research on this most important matter. Please don’t rely solely upon my opinion and research.\n\n“Concerning matter, we have been all wrong. What we have called matter is energy, whose vibration has been so lowered as to be perceptible to the senses. There is no matter.”\n― Albert Einstein\n\nThe app is free and for those who want to hear their music in a more refined and healthy tone opposed to the 440 Hz.\n\n**The App Won't Play Apple Music Files.\n** The app will pitch shift music that's tuned to A = 440 Hz, it will not work on music tuned to other A note references.\n\nEnjoy\n\n*****If you do not have songs on your device the app will not have anything to play.*****\n\n** If something is not working please send an email to contact@appums.com and we'll try to find a solution.\nThanks"

Apart from the classic frequency and phase parameters (which make it capable of all of the classic modulation stuff), the waveform can also be shaped by swinging its cycles, bending its curve, squeezing portions of oscillation in the same period of time, scaled and transformed while exceeding its boundaries. An additional Sample and Hold circuit provides quantization for the resulting signal.\n\nA tool you already know, with the most advanced features: simple and powerful.\n\nLFOH! is both an audio processor and a MIDI modulator: while is capable to send its modulation signal out as MIDI CC (according to the MIDI routing flexibility of the app that hosts it), it can also modulate the amplitude of incoming audio. \n\n*** Please note: LFOH! is an Audio Unit extension (AUv3) – it only works in an AUv3 host app like AUM, Drambo, Cubasis, etc... ***"

      "label": "With SonoSequencr you can create individual sequences to perform recurring tasks with just one click.\n\nIf you have multiple Sonos devices and want to play a radio station on all of them, it takes some time to set this up. With SonoSequencr, all you have to do is open the app and tap your previously created sequence.\nYou can lock your iOS device or use another app while your sequence is running in the background.\nOf course, you can also start it from the widget, Apple Watch or using Flic Buttons.\n\nHere are some examples:\n- Group kitchen and dining room, set volume to 5, start a radio station and set a sleep timer to 2 hours\n- Switch your Playbar in the living room to the TV input, set the volume to 40, add dining room and set the equalizer settings for both devices to neutral\n- Disable the subwoofer and enable voice enhancement + night mode on the Playbar in the living room\n- Set the equalizer settings for all your devices to specific values\n- Disable touch on speaker and enable status light for all your devices\n- Set the volume of the kitchen and living room to the same value as in the dining room\n- Make an announcement with your individual text in the children's room\n- etc...\n\nEach of these examples, created once, requires only one tap in the widget or on your Apple Watch.\n\nSonoSequencr also includes a restricted mode. This allows you to restrict control to specific devices, among other things.\n\n\nUsing an optional in-app purchase, you can also start sequences at specific times or via external triggers like IFTTT. Of course, this requires that the iOS device is on the same network as your Sonos devices at the time. For intensive use of external triggers, it is recommended to run SonoSequencr in 'server mode'. In this mode, SonoSequencr is always running in the foreground on a dedicated iOS device. SonoSequencr still supports iOS9.\n\nThere are many more features like grid view, create dynamic alarms, HTTP requests, launch other apps, automatic battery charging in server mode, transfer sequences between devices, etc....\n\nYou can only use music (radio streams/tracks/albums) for your sequences that are stored in your Sonos Favorites (My Sonos) or in your TuneIn radio stations. You can't search your entire music library in this app. Just add your most used music to my Sonos then it can be used in your sequences.\n\nThe Timed Sequences feature is only available with an optional in-app purchase 'Premium'. With this automatically renewing subscription, up to 20 sequences can be run at freely configurable times. The function is only active as long as a valid subscription exists. The costs are billed via the iTunes account. The subscription will be renewed automatically within 24 hours before expiration (same time and costs), unless it is cancelled before in 'Settings' -> 'Manage Subscriptions' or in the iTunes settings.\n\nTo use this app you must have a working Sonos system. SonoSequencr supports Sonos software 1 and 2.\n\nFor terms and conditions and privacy policy see:\nhttps://celltekk.de/sonosequencr/help/privacy\n\nThis is not an official Sonos app."

As seen on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\n\nhttps://loopyapp.com\n\n-- “This is the best loop station on the iPhone” -- Dub FX (dubfx.net) \n-- “I pretty much own every mobile looper out there and Loopy is HANDS DOWN the best. Super simple interface with powerful features.” -- J. Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support. Please contact me with questions, bug reports, feature ideas, and other feedback at support@atastypixel.com or https://forum.loopyapp.com. I may be able to fix your issue in less time than it would take to write a negative review!"

      "label": "SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps. Studio Six Digital is dedicated to making the iPhone and Touch a professional audio and acoustics test device.\n\nCheck out our full line of professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the professional digital iPhone sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real-time analyzer,  FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the energy-time curve function, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time measurement, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for more great acoustical and audio test apps, have a look at AudioTools, our premier app for audio professionals."

A particular attention to each part of the signal path was necessary to reach this level of high-end quality.\n\nHere some features that make FAC Alteza an outstanding unit:\n\n• the input signal is not monoized by default, a knob allows to control the width of the input stereo image before reaching the reverb\n• the topology of the effect, based upon a series of All-Pass delays, allows to control the intrasec characteristics of the reverberation\n• the number of All-Pass delays per stage and the echo density are alterable in the main section and in the feedback section\n• two ultra low latency pitch shifters deliver progressive pitch-shifting of the reverberation tail or the input signal\n• the feedback section contains a blend knob to control how much of the original signal is mixed with the feedback reverb\n• the wet signal can be ducked by an external signal provided by the host\n\nNote:\n- AuV3 and Standalone App\n- To use the sidechain and/or to output the additional feedback signal, you need a host able to provide to the AuV3 an input bus and an additional output bus.\n\nThe documentation is available at fredantoncorvest.com/FAC_Alteza.html"

      "label": "STRATOSPHERE CLOUD REVERB is an audio unit plugin effect inspired by the Cloud Reverb patch in a very well-loved modern classic reverb pedal. It has the following unique features:\n\n\nONSET TIME\n\nMost reverbs have a pre-delay setting that delays the onset of early reverb a little bit so that the beginning of each note in the dry signal can be heard clearly before the reverb starts. Stratosphere Cloud Reverb does it differently: the reverb starts immediately with a low volume and fades in after the note attack with adjustable fade length called onset time, which replaces the pre-delay setting found on other reverbs. This is nice because it doesn't leave an unnatural empty space between the note attack and the onset of reverb but it still keeps the early reverb volume low so that the note attacks can be heard clearly. \n\n\nHIGH ECHO DENSITY\n\nReverb effects typically take some time to build up echo density, meaning that the first few milliseconds of echoes sound a bit grainy. This reverb is designed with exceptionally high echo density right from the onset of the earliest reflections.\n\n\nSTEREO MODULATION\n\nOnce you get beyond the early echoes, many reverb effects are simply a wash of evenly distributed, smooth sound. That isn't necessarily bad, but when working with long decay times it's much more interesting if there is movement in the late echoes. Stratosphere Cloud Reverb has two stages of LFO modulated pan effects and two stages of chorus modulation applied to the late reverb signal, giving it a big, wide stereo sound with gentle and complex side-to-side motion. The depth of these effects is adjustable using the mod control.\n\n\nLONG DECAY TIME\n\nThe longest echoes found in natural spaces last about 10 seconds. Long reverb like that can be observed in stone cathedrals. Similarly, reverb effects that are going for a natural type of sound often limit their decay time to a maximum of 10 seconds because artificial reverb can build up unpleasant resonances if allowed to ring too long. This plugin has a max decay time of 50 seconds, long enough for the most wet ambient music, and it maintains a beautiful, smooth sound throughout that entire time."

      "label": "AltiSpace is a convolution reverb app with advanced controls that provides realistic sounding natural acoustic space or vintage reverb devices for any track or mix.\n\nA convolution reverb takes a captured sample (called an impulse response) from a real-world space or real hardware and uses this to digitally simulate the reverberation of that space or device down to the last detail and nuance. Because it is sampled, not synthesized, convolution reverb is known for its stunning realism, and it is widely considered to be the best type of reverb. However, unlike the more common algorithmic reverbs, convolution reverbs usually does not have much control over the reverberation process.\n\nBut AltiSpace, in addition to the ability to load your own impulse response files and a built-in library of the most interesting vintage reverb device presets, has advanced settings such as EQ, gate, ducking, modulation and more. You can change the original impulse response parameters to something completely new and then save it as a new preset.\n\nThis app has an easy-to-use user interface, where all the main controls are located on the single screen, and it is ready to use right out of the box, even without additional settings. And at the same time, you can easily change the parameters of the impulse responses from the built-in library to create your own sound.\n\nApp features:\n\n- Ability to import your own impulse response files.\n- A large built-in library of presets from the most interesting hardware reverbs.\n- Convenient preset manager with the ability to group and search presets.\n- Presets can be marked as favorites for display in the favorites group.\n- Supports MIDI controllers (also Bluetooth) with learn or manually assign mode.\n- Reverb can work with a stereo or mono input and convert it to stereo.\n- Add dynamic noise before reverb for a more natural sound.\n- The gate allows you to turn on the reverb when the threshold is exceeded.\n- The ducking allows you to turn off the reverb when the threshold is exceeded.\n- Sets the minimum reverb level for Gate and Ducking modes.\n- Equalizer with high and low cut filters in chain before or after reverb.\n- Changing the time (length) of the current impulse response.\n- Possibility to set a fade out point for a smooth end of the impulse response.\n- Sets the pre-delay time of the signal before reverb.\n- Experimental feature to change the pitch of the impulse response.\n- Amplifying early or late reflections.\n- Adjusts the stereo image before the reverb.\n- Haas effect for adding stereo space to a mono signal.\n- Sets the depth and frequency of modulation the signal before reverb.\n- Mixing dry / wet signal and adjusting the output level.\n- Input and output level meters.\n- Indicators of possible input clipping for standalone.\n- Prevents any output clipping for standalone.\n- Built-in full description of all controls.\n\nDemo:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBHxgjkGCoU\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLNi9wHaGew\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3RPopor9gI\n\nAltiSpace is a universal application for iOS and macOS. It can work on iPhone and iPad as well as Mac / MacBook with M1 chip (and later). AltiSpace works on iPhone and iPad standalone, as an Audio Unit or Inter-App Audio module, and supports Audiobus and Ableton Link.

      "label": "Kajita combines two-stage multi-tap stereo delay with reverb, allowing you to create complex spatial effects.\n\n- All delay taps are time-modifiable to create chorus effects and undulating delay sounds.\n- The first stage delay has an \"Eary Reflections\" section as included in the reverb effect.\n- There is a saturator at the input of the second stage delay, and it is possible to create a sound in which the amount of distortion increases each time feedback is repeated.\n- The second stage delay has a total of eight taps: feedback tap, cross feedback tap, five output taps, and cross out tap. Output taps are divided into two groups, which are connected to filters and panners, respectively. Also, the three taps connected to the panner have their own filters.\n- Reverb can control the volume and filter of early reflection sound and tail sound separately.\n\n# Note\n- This product is compatible with iPads and iPhones, but not compatible with Apple Silicon Macs.\n- This product mainly contains basic presets that are useful as a starting point for sound creation. Please note that there are no huge amount of presets. Enjoy making sounds.\n\n# Universal App\nIt is compatible with iPad and iPhone and has multiple screen layouts optimized for different screen sizes.\n\n# Audio Unit Extensions (AUv3)\nYou can use this AUv3 Plug-In in a host application that supports Audio Unit Extensions (AUv3).\n\n# Audiobus\nYou can stream live audio directly to an Audiobus compatible application. See https://audiob.us for more information.\n\n# Ableton Link\nLink is a technology that keeps devices in time over a local network. See https://www.ableton.com/link/ for more information.\n\n# MIDI input\n- Core MIDI, Virtual MIDI, Inter-App Audio MIDI Input\n- MIDI clock synchronization\n- MIDI controller mapping\n\n# Preset sharing\nYou can share your presets with other users. You can add presets created by other users to your preset library using the iOS Share Extension feature.\n\n# More information\nIntroductory videos and manuals can be found on the website below.\nhttps://icegear.net"

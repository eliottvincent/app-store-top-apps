Lock your screen, relax, and wake up on the right side of the bed!\n\nSupports playing the alarm Bluetooth devices connected to your iOS device.\n\nNotes\n• Click \"Developer Website\" below on this App Store page for the complete FAQ, or email me at iam@willsaid.com\n• A Free Spotify Account works! However, *you need a premium Spotify account to play the entire song in Spotify*\n• The Spotify Mobile App is not needed\n• Internet connectivity is required to find songs and \"set\" an alarm, but not needed when it goes off.\n• Alarms go off for one minute max, but you can always chain multiple alarms together if you are a heavy sleeper. Spotify's API currently only lets the app play 30 seconds of each song, although entire songs are coming soon.\n• As stated above, the app currently plays 30 second snippets of the best parts of songs, which should be more than enough to wake up.\n• Supports Snoozing, Days to Repeat, and the other features you'd expect from an alarm clock\n• The maker of this app is not attached to Spotify in any way. The app simply plays Spotify Content from Spotify's API.\n• Most but not all Spotify songs are currently available on the app. This is outside my control, and up to which artists approve third party app usage of their content. The selection size has improved since Version 1 and is continuing to do so. Artists not on the app include Bob Marley, Ariana Grande, and Frank Ocean. Please email me BEFORE downloading the app if there's a specific song you are looking for and I can quickly check. Email me at iam@willsaid.com and I will get back to you very quickly!"

      "label": "Yet another ear-training app? Well, this one is different!\nPlaying jazz, pop and improvised music means being able to quickly recognize and replay what you hear. Although this app began as an ear-training tool for students of jazz and pop at the Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK), it is also intended for musicians playing in other styles, and at all levels. It was developed by Swiss IT specialist and jazz trumpeter Daniel Schenker, professor at ZHdK, in collaboration with his son Elia.\n\nHow it works\nThe app offers a host of ear-training exercises, many of them quite enjoyable, all designed to enhance both active and passive hearing. Active hearing means reproducing what you have heard on an instrument or with your voice, while passive hearing refers to the ability to identify such things as the scales, triads and four-note-chords, tensions and slash chords, on which active hearing is based. One of the features that make our app so special is the fact that its microphone enables a sort of dialogue between the app and the musician – whether on voice, brass and reed instruments, guitar, piano or electric bass. Unlike other apps, this one uses an integrated voicing generator to ensure that the chords played (position, voicing) correspond to the actual performance situation. In addition, the app uses a detailed educational guidance system, which allows users to individually customize the exercises. You can obtain 150 achievements.\n \nActive exercises (microphone)\n- Five-tone range imitation, major and minor: suitable for younger students or amateurs\n- Diatonic imitation: reproduction of notes in a particular key, vocally or on an instrument\n- Atonal imitation: improvement of relative or referential hearing\n- Intervals\n- Resolution game: technique for the improvement of downward interval singing or playing\n- Bass imitation exercises: double bass notes and root notes of various chords are to be reproduced vocally or on an instrument, a central skill that is often underdeveloped\n- Sing or replay chord tensions (e.g. #9, b13)\n- Scales sandbox: imitation practice in tonal spaces from over 40 different scales\n- Tonal memory game\n \nPassive exercises (identification practice)\n- Intervals\n- Triads/four-note-chords in root position and inversion, as well as identification of top note positions\n- Four-note-chords with one tension (17 types) and with two tensions (15 types)\n- All 12 major and minor triads above a root note (slash chords/hybrids)\n- Identification of scales and modes\nDepending on the setting, the chords can also be played arpeggiated.\n \nFor whom is the app intended?\n- Singers both amateur and professional who want to incorporate (noteless) ear training exercises into their practice programme.\n- Musicians in primary and secondary school, musicians and singers preparing for university entrance exams (practical theory), and conservatory students\n- Musicians and singers of all genres, especially jazz/pop/rock, who want to freshen up or expand their chord vocabulary\n- Brass players: control in mouthpiece exercises (buzzing)"

      "label": "\"In short, there’s oodles of scope here for sound designers and anyone who makes more experimental styles of music, whether EDM, chill or ambient.\" -SoundOnSound\n\nUnfiltered Audio's Silo is now available on iOS as a Standalone app or AUv3 plugin!\n\nSilo combines granular synthesis, audio spatialization, and reverb into a powerful, essential tool for sound designers and musicians everywhere. Silo combines microscopic granulation with macroscopic reverb tails to extract new realms from your existing sounds.\n\nSilo's first section, the granulator, breaks the incoming signal to tiny little bits (called \"grains\") before reconstructing it with massive amounts of control. You can change the speed and pitch of the signal independently and in real-time!\n\nThese grains are then sent to Silo's unique spatializer, which throws the grains all over the stereo field. The spatializer contains a number of motion algorithms to add trajectory to your grains, such as the orbital \"Moons\", the shooting \"Meteors\", or the squirmy \"Biological\". After using this spatializer, you'll never want to use a traditional auto-panner ever again.\n\nFinally, the signal washes through one of Silo's many reverb algorithms, from small, resonant spaces to enormous, booming voids. From \"Bokeh\" to \"Nebula\", each mode can be tweaked to frame your sound perfectly.\n\nAs an AUv3 plugin, Silo has been tested to work perfectly with Garageband, Drambo, AUM, Cubasis, Beatmaker, Nanostudio, apeMatrix, Loopy Pro, and more! Additionally, with its clear layout and smart resizing, Silo can be used on tablets and phones with ease."

      "label": "Metronome Touch. Style of pendulum.\n\nMetronome Touch is created with one objective: to design a classic metronome with a unique style, so we combined a precise pendulum, perfected accuracy, and realistic interaction. Made of aluminum and glass, Metronome Touch proves a huge statement: It is as exclusive as your device. Launching Metronome Touch, your device will become a metronome.\n\nAnyone can try to make a metronome app, but success only comes when listening to customers. That's why Metronome Touch centers around functions that musicians are looking for: The ability to tap a beat, use customizable presets to save your favorite sets (bpm, time signature and accentuation), and multiple useful ways of adjusting the bpm. Metronome Touch even goes far beyond that: Neither analog nor digital metronomes can synchronize pendulums. But Metronome Touch can. This opens completely new ways when practicing, performing on stage or doing studio recordings.\n\nShould you be teaching students, they can follow your lesson more accurately while concentrating on their own devices synchronized with Metronome Touch. You will gain your student's attention when using this outstanding technology. If you have ever been on stage with bad acoustics, you will love Metronome Touch: It will provide every single band member with a perfect steady and synchronized rhythm on stage. Even when recording a song in separate soundproofed rooms, Metronome Touch keeps you in perfect sync.\n\nEasily adjust Metronome Touch to your likes and needs with the light or dark design - relying on absolute clear vector-based display graphics  - and many well chosen professional metronome sounds.\n\nMetronome Touch is constantly being developed further to ensure the highest customer satisfaction.\n\nFEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY\n\n• Precise engine \nA completely new developed engine makes this app one of the most precise pendulum metronomes available on the App Store.

      "label": "Unfiltered Audio's Tails is now available on iOS as a Standalone app or AUv3 plugin!\n\nUnfiltered Audio joined forces with electronic music superstar BT to create Tails, the world's most harmonic reverb.\n\nTails utilizes a novel double-buffered technology to create two separate reverbs in parallel. The twist comes with special threshold swapping: Whenever Tails detects a major change in amplitude or tone, it can smoothly swap between the two reverbs. Additionally, Tails can auto-duck on its inputs and outputs.\n\nThis keeps your reverb as clean as possible. With auto-ducking on attacks, you can keep the metallic noise of percussive hits out of your reverbs. Alternatively, you can keep passing tones and blue notes out of your melodic echoes so that your reverb is free of dissonance.\n\nEven without its innovative ducking and swapping, Tails is the most flexible reverb in your arsenal. Two of Unfiltered Audio's classic BYOME reverb algorithms (Renoun and Deep) are available with a Spatial mode inspired by Silo and a brand new Shimmer mode designed to BT's exacting specifications. In true Unfiltered Audio fashion, a global Sample Rate knob affects the sampling rate of the entire DSP algorithm, stretching your reverb tails out into crispy, lo-fi oblivion.\n\nFinally, Tails is built to be performed. Your MIDI keyboard's Pitch and Mod wheels can be assigned quickly to a selection of key parameters, while Note messages can be used to manually duck or mute the reverb.\n\nAs an AUv3 plugin, Tails has been tested to work perfectly with Garageband, Drambo, AUM, Cubasis, Beatmaker, Nanostudio, apeMatrix, Loopy Pro, and more! Additionally, with its clear layout and smart resizing, Tails can be used on tablets and phones with ease.\n\n(Note for Drambo users: Drambo does not yet have automatic Plugin Delay Compensation for managing plugins with latency. As a result, tracks with Tails will not line up properly with other tracks. An upcoming patch for Drambo will add this feature in.)"

      "label": "Sharpen your sense of time! liveBPM is the tempo monitoring tool for drummers, bands and DJs. It detects music and beats via the microphone and continuously displays the current tempo in beats per minute (BPM). It is easy to use and delivers high-quality results while being energy efficient.\n\n\n=== What users said about liveBPM ===\n\n\nJohn Walden, freelance musician and music technology journalist at musicappblog.com:\n\"There are three obvious applications for the app. First, it would make a brilliant practice tool for a drummer, allowing them to monitor just how good they are at keeping a steady tempo without the aid of a click track to guide them. Second, sat beside your kit during a performance, it would allow you to judge just how well you are hitting the ideal tempo for each song in your set. It’s not just drummers that can benefit for liveBPM as the third use is in mapping the tempo – and any tempo changes – in commercial recordings. While this is useful for drummers, it is instructional for almost any musician.\" \n\n\nJonLong:\n\"I used this at my last band practice and wasn't expecting it to work. I couldn't believe how quickly and accurately it started tracking the bpm, even despite the very loud volume of our music.\"\n\n\nPocketDrummer82:\n\"I am a professional drummer and I have been looking for something like this for years! Unless your playing with backing tracks or recording, Playing with a Click is too Mechanical. This app allows the tempo to breathe, and its like a little angel on your shoulder telling you the band is speeding up or slowing down. It is totally worth the money.\"\n\n\nChris Walther:\n\"I have used this about five gigs now and have quit using my previous tempo meter. I used both for a few gigs to test the accuracy. Dead on. Thanks! Every drummer should use this.\"\n\n\nmagrec:\n\"This has been very helpful for recording. thanks!\"\n\n\n\n\n=== Detailed Description ===\n\n\nThis is a tool designed for professional use:\n- Well-tested beat detection engine guarantees trustworthiness\n- Can handle most genres\n- Produces results accurate to within 0.1 BPM under the following conditions:\n-- The tempo is constant or almost constant\n-- Strong impulses are defining the beat (drums, accentuated rhythm instruments like bass/guitar, etc.)\n\n\nFurther features:\n- Tempo curve shows the development of tempo over time \n- Multiple zoom modes to show last 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20 or 30 minutes\n- Advanced audio spectrum analysis via FFT\n- More accessible and usually more accurate than BPM counters that function through tapping\n- Low battery drain thanks to high performance code and efficient algorithms\n\n\nUsing it as a musician:\n- Use it as an objective tempo reference like a metronome\n- It actually has several advantages over a metronome:\n-- You are not tied to a click, giving you more flexibility\n-- Helps you use tempo changes to enhance your musical expression\n-- With blind tests, it can massively improve your timing confidence, which is especially important if you are in a tempo leading role (e.g. drummer)\n- Discover how/whether your favorite artists use tempo changes\n- Measure and improve your time-keeping skills\n- Identify slowdowns and speedups while practicing your instrument\n- Always be in control of the tempo during your live gigs and rehearsals\n\n\nControls:\n- Power Button: For freezing the tempo curve and minimizing battery drain\n- Clear Button: Clears the tempo curve\n- Slider: Adjusts the target tempo range (i.e. 80-160 BPM)\n- Zoom Buttons: Switch between zoom modes for the tempo curve. (2-30 minutes)\n\n\nNote: \n- You can check and improve the detection by clapping loud to the beat. Also, results can be improved by plugging in a suitable external microphone.\n- You can support my work by rating it on the App Store.

      "label": "rDid you even dreamed to carry a big Church Organ in your pocket, to play while travelling or sitting in your sofa?\n\nIt is now possible, thanks to Church Organ! \n\nChurch Organ will enable you to play a big pipe organ with your iPhone / iPad, with a \"wide\" range of sounds for the size of the device. It offers pipe organ realism that you will really enjoy!\nIt is suitable for any music, religious or profane. Obviously, due to the size of the instrument, musical pieces needs some adaptations to be played. But still, you'll get pleasure to play our digital organ pipe. We are currently working on improving the use of the keyboards and octaves.\n\nOur church organ is composed of two independent keyboards or 4 octaves. On every keyboard, you can assign one or 2 voices, among a choice of 6 voices. You control them with the two sets of 6 stop knobs above the piano keyboard. It  can do automatic transposition. You can play in any key with the same keyboard position. You just need to select the note to play on the C key of the keyboard.\n\nThe sound is processed from high quality uncompressed sound samples, for bringing you the best musical experience. We selected the voices among the most common and famous sounds. \n\nUpper keyboard may play one or two voices from:\n- Big church organ, with big, warm and full sound (subwoofer offers good results for the lowest octave)\n- Warm organ, with simpler sound, very interesting\n- Synthesizer, crystal and warm sound\n- Piccolo flute, which brings the light flute sound\n- Recorder\n- Clarinet, with the typical vibrating reed sound\n\nLower keyboard may play one or two voices from :\n- Big church organ\n- Warm organ\n- Synthesizer\n- Trombone, a large and low pitched brass instrument\n- Tuba, very close to Trombone. Playing them is pair is interesting.\n- Recorder\n\nDepending on the instrument, we advise you to select the proper octave on the keyboard for the best sound. For example, the recorder sound is interesting from octave 2 to 4 (not so much in first octave).\n\nYou can play up to 5 notes at a time, from any keyboard. You should not push the volume at the maximum within Church Organ preferences, otherwise some clicks may appear in the sound. We included a feature to auto adapt the sound level according to the music played to always have the maximum volume without clicks.\n\nAn option is available for sustaining the notes after releasing the keyboard keys. Three choices are available: no sustain, sort sustain and long sustain. This option increases the realism of the church organ!\n\nYou may use the following tunings :\n- Modern tempered scale,\n- Pythagorician scale (pre XVI century),\n- Meantone scale (1600),\n- Werckmeister III scale (1691),\n- Bach/Lehman scale (1722)\n\nFor getting the best sound from this instrument, it is advised to use a good headphone or a pair of speakers with subwoofer."

      "label": "hearEQ builds your EQ skills to professional levels using custom ear training exercises, created just for you from your favorite songs. Simple, powerful, and fast, hearEQ is perfect for ear training on the go. Named one of \"The best iPhone and iPad apps for musicians\" (www.apppicker.com), here's what the experts have to say about hearEQ:\n\n\"When I found hearEQ, I knew this was a game-changer. From the ease of use and the ability to use your own music selections, hearEQ is perfectly designed to be the go-to choice for developing your ear. My students have shown tremendous improvements in mixing and productions, and I completely attribute this to hearEQ. Thanks Ten Kettles! Keep up the great work. You are making a difference!\" -Chandler Bridges, Ph.D., Professor (The Los Angeles Film School); Audio engineer (Will Smith, Aaliyah, Johnny Mathis, P-Diddy, J-Lo, Bette Midler, LeAnn Rimes, and more) with two Grammy-winning albums.\n\n“After half an hour with the app I had a noticeable improvement to my score, but I was also thinking in much clearer terms too!” -Tim Webb, www.discchord.com\n\n“This handy app is one of the greatest tools I've seen for helping you hear exactly how EQ adjustments affect your sound. Wish I would have had this when I was first learning how to mix live sound.” -James Wasem, www.greatchurchsound.com\n\n\"hearEQ…makes the experience of ear training enjoyable enough to seem like fun.  [It's] a great educational tool.\" -Tom Flint, Sound on Sound: The World's Best Recording Technology Magazine\n\n“The principle behind hearEQ is beautifully straightforward…even with a little repetition, things do start to improve and I suspect if you were to build some hearEQ into your daily musical routine, you would soon reap some positive benefits.” -John Walden, www.musicappblog.com\n\n----------------------------------\n\nEvery frequency range has a color, a quality, a character. For sound engineers, musicians, and other enthusiasts, knowing how to apply this to an equalizer (EQ) can make a transformational change to your sound—whether you're mixing a live concert, a recording, or even playing music through iTunes.  (VIDEO @ www.hearEQ.com)\n\nIt's a simple app with a powerful promise:  if you learn the qualities of each frequency band—for example, cutting 4kHz puts sound in the background—then you can make equalization work for you, and truly transform your sound into something professional and beautiful. \n\nhearEQ uses your favorite songs on your device to create custom ear training exercises that a) teach you all about frequency bands, and b) help you really hone your EQ skills. A standard 10-band or 30-band* equalizer is used, just like you'd find in iTunes and on many professional sound mixers. Your song will be played back with a simple equalization applied—and you guess what it was! \n\n> Was it really clear, maybe a bit hollow? Could be a 1000 Hz cut. \n\n> Was it muddy? Maybe that's a 500 Hz boost. \n\n> Was it really present, almost too in-your-face? Sounds like a 4kHz boost. \n\nTen questions, ten frequencies, and then you get a score. Want to focus on just a few frequency bands to start? You can do that too. Keep at it, and you'll be an EQ master in no time.\n\nWant to learn more? Check out our site and the hearEQ video at www.hearEQ.com.\n\n\n*The 30-band equalizer is part of the \"Advanced EQ\" module, available as an in-app purchase within hearEQ.\n\nNOTE:  hearEQ works with any track on your device, with the exception of tracks that prevent our EQ processing, such as DRM-protected tracks and cloud tracks (e.g., Apple Music). That said, hearEQ ships with several built-in practice tracks, so you'll be able to start EQing right away!\n\nTERMS OF USE:  https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

It is part of the TuneLab line of piano tuning programs for smartphones, tablet computers and laptops that piano technicians have been using sine 2001.\r\n\r\nNotable features:\r\n\r\n* Capable of an accuracy to 0.02 cents.\r\n* Measures and uses inharmonicity of the piano to construct a custom tuning.\r\n* Provides an over-pull mode for more accurate pitch-raises.\r\n* Can store hundreds of tuning files for individual pianos.\r\n* Tuning files can be stored locally and in the Cloud on Dropbox. \r\n* Provides many historical temperaments for period music.\r\n* Switches notes automatically when you play the next note.\r\n* Provides a strobe-like Phase Display for fine-tuning.\r\n* Provides a versatile frequency spectrum display.\r\n\r\nTuneLab lets you customize a tuning by sampling the inharmonicity for a few notes of the particular piano.  You can choose the kind of tuning stretch you want by specifying different intervals for the bass, the treble, and the mid-range of the scale.  These intervals can be octaves, 12ths, double octaves, etc.  Good defaults are in place if you are not sure which settings you prefer.\r\n\r\nAfter a custom tuning has been created from inharmonicity measurements you can store this tuning by name.  The next time you need to tune that piano, or one very much like it, you simply load that same tuning file and start tuning.  There is essentially no limit to the number of tuning files that you can store.  TuneLab comes with some sample tuning files and an \"Average\" tuning file so you can start tuning right away without bothering to measure inharmonicity.\r\n\r\nTuneLab covers the normal piano range from A0 to C8 (88 notes).  The automatic note-switching feature makes it possible to enjoy hands-free operation.  There is also easy one-touch manual note switching.\r\n\r\nTuneLab has two different displays that are visible at the same time.  One is the strobe-like Phase Display.  This is a band where black squares move left or right depending on whether the note is sharp or flat. Tune the note to make the pattern stop moving. The other is the Spectrum Display.  This is a graph of the frequency spectrum around the desired note that shows a peak in the audio frequency spectrum for every pitch present in the sound.  The object in using this display is to tune the note until the peak in the graph is positioned at a central red line.  The Spectrum Display makes it possible to do a rough pitch-raise without mutes since each string of a unison produces its own peak in the graph.  Having both the Phase Display and the Spectrum Display visible at the same time gives you a more complete picture of the tuning than any single spinner-type or needle-type display."

      "label": "\"LO‑FI‑AF is a very capable lo‑fi toolkit capable of surgically targeted destruction and it could easily find applications in just about any musical genre\" -SoundOnSound\n\nUnfiltered Audio's lo-fi-af is now available on iOS as a Standalone app or AUv3 plugin!\n\nlo-fi-af takes your sound on a journey of artifacts and noise throughout recorded history, from tape warbles and vinyl noise to MP3 chirps and cell phone speaker chatter. lo-fi-af's many sections and versatile algorithms can place your sound in a different decade, or give it a thoroughly modern spin through compound processing.\n\nThe first section is a convolution reverb preloaded with impulse responses from broken microphones, toy speakers, cell phones, and more. With this section alone, you can place your sound into an entirely different space.\n\nThe Spectral section then splits your sound into thousands of frequencies before reconstructing it with a twist. Here you can reproduce the sound of a pirated MP3 or pitch shift your signal with clean perfection.\n\nYour signal then takes a trip through the digital section. All sorts of hazards are present here, from a skipping CD stutter effect to a multimode bitcrusher.\n\nFinally, the rich, colorful analog section adds that vibe that you crave. A maximizer, a tape saturator, a noise generator, an analog-style filter, a pitch warbler, and a radio demodulator all work together in harmony to toss your sound into the past.\n\nBut wait! That's only one possible signal chain. The Convolution, Spectral, Digital, and Analog sections can be completely rearranged in any order. Dozens of presets will get your started on your sound warping adventure.\n\nAs an AUv3 plugin, lo-fi-af has been tested to work perfectly with Garageband, Drambo, AUM, Cubasis, Beatmaker, Nanostudio, apeMatrix, Loopy Pro, and more! Additionally, with its clear layout and smart resizing, lo-fi-af can be used on tablets and phones with ease.\n\n(Note for Drambo users: Drambo does not yet have automatic Plugin Delay Compensation for managing plugins with latency. As a result, tracks with lo-fi-af will not line up properly with other tracks. An upcoming patch for Drambo will add this feature in.)"

      "label": "\"Super powerful plugin... Highly recommended.\" - The REAPER Blog\nhttps://reaperblog.net/2022/01/bass-mint/\n\nUnfiltered Audio's Bass Mint is now available on iOS as a Standalone app or AUv3 plugin!\n\nBass Mint is a simple-to-use but immensely powerful bass and sub enhancement utility. You can use it to add extra bass to your kick drums, or to make podcast voices more full-bodied.\n\nWith five different modes, Bass Mint can either accentuate and clean up existing bass in your input signal, or it can synthesize new bass from scratch! The SYNTHESIZE and RESONATE modes can be tuned to specific frequencies, allowing you to make any percussive hits sound more in tune with the rest of your song (For extremely quick tuning, dozens of presets are included with correct frequencies for all note values).\n\nBass Mint includes multiple methods of making your bass sit better in the mix. The ANTI-RUMBLE filter removes all inaudible bass from your track, clearing up some headroom to make the audible frequencies louder. MID ONLY affects only center-channel bass, while MONO BASS places all bass below the cutoff directly into the center of the stereo field. The CLARITY knob acts as a quick de-mud control to scoop out some of the mids.\n\nAs an AUv3 plugin, Bass Mint has been tested to work perfectly with Garageband, Drambo, AUM, Cubasis, Beatmaker, Nanostudio, apeMatrix, Loopy Pro, and more! Additionally, with its clear layout and smart resizing, Bass Mint can be used on tablets and phones with ease."

      "label": "Benny Greb, well known for his contributions to the drumming education community, shared the approach that he has taken personally to develop his sense of groove and improve his own timing on his instrument in his course “The Art and Science of Groove”. Now with the Gap Click app, everyone can practice his method easily with a simple-to-use app! \n\nUnlike standard metronomes which simply state the time, Gap Click helps you improve your sense of time. Gap Click is more than a metronome with a focus on improving your ability to keep tempo, become more aware and comfortable with off beat clicks and by that, become bullet proof and accurate with all notes of the subdivision.\n\nGAP CLICK\nBy scrolling through the numbers of bars and patterns you can quickly configure a “gap” of time in which the metronome drops out. When the “one” comes back around, will your playing still be in time? How long of a gap can you play through and still maintain solid tempo?\n\nMOVING CLICK\nNext you can experiment with all kinds of off-beat patterns in the Gap Bar which moves the click from the downbeat position to a different location. Can you still play your instrument and maintain the downbeat internally even when you hear the click sound on an off-beat?\n\nBoth the “click” and the “gap” portion supports a variety of different syncopated patterns allowing you the ability to practice in binary or ternary rhythms - with more or less safety net depending on your settings.\n\nFeatures\n• Ability to choose from a variety of different syncopated patterns and # of measures for both the standard \"click\" as well as the \"gap\"\n• Use the nostalgic click wheel to find the right tempo or tap to set your desired tempo from 10 to 300bpm\n• Standard quarter-note time signatures: 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4\n\nPersonalize\n• See visual feedback for each note or rest that is played\n• Accent beat 1 of each measure or turn accents off for a greater challenge\n• Flash the screen for a visual indication when switching from the \"click\" to the \"gap\"\n• Find your favorite sound from a variety of click samples hand-picked by Benny\n\nBuy Once, Use Forever\n• There are no In-App Purchases - a one time purchase includes all current and future features. \n\nTESTIMONIALS\nWhat professionals are saying about GAP CLICK:\n• \"The skills you can sharpen by using this app are integral for what it takes to be a professional drummer in any genre.\" - Matt Halpern\n• \"When I first opened the app, it made (simple) sense, without a tutorial.\" - Chris Coleman\n• \"This app helps you lock in the pocket on a whole different level.\" - Luke Holland\n• \"The Gap Click app is something that every drummer should have in their toolbox.\" - Jared Falk, Drumeo\n\nWhat our users are saying about GAP CLICK: \n• \"If you think you have good timing, this will really put you in your place.\"\n• \"Gone are the days of programming gap clicks!\"\n• \"I’ve never had so much fun being destroyed in my practice session.\"\n• \"This is by far the best money I’ve ever spent on a practice tool.\"\n\nABOUT BENNY GREB\nBenny Greb is one of the most respected drummers in the world today. Not only has he headlined nearly every major drum festival and toured with his clinics and drum camps worldwide, but he is also recognized as a composer and bandleader in his own band Moving Parts, which won him the renowned “ECHO Jazz” award - the German equivalent to The Grammys in jazz.\n\nBenny Greb published two of the most successful and critically acclaimed educational products, “The Language of Drumming” and “The Art and Science of Groove” and he has helped create many signature products available to drummers today.\n\nFind him online at https://www.bennygreb.de as well as on social media."

      "label": "Alle Texte aus dem Gesangbuch der Neuapostolischen Kirche.\n\nDie Gesangbuch-App bietet allen Musikinteressierten, Dirigenten und Dienstleitern die Möglichkeit, die Texte aus dem Gesangbuch schnell und einfach nachzuschlagen. \n\nDie als 64-Bit-Anwendung programmierte Version 3 greift Bewährtes aus den Vorversionen auf und kombiniert dieses mit intuitiver Bedienung und neuen Funktionen. Dabei wurden gewohntes Nutzerverhalten und aktuelle Displaygrößen berücksichtigt. Und – das Beste zum Schluss – die App kann optional mit zusätzlichen Features ausgestattet werden.\n\nGrundfunktionen:\n\nDie Startseite zeigt nun neben dem Feld für die Nummerneingabe die ersten Textzeilen des gesuchten Liedes. Alternativ lassen sich Lieder über die Rubrikensuche oder über die Volltextsuche auffinden. Standardmäßig findet die Suche auch Wortteile und berücksichtigt bei mehreren Wörtern die Reihenfolge nicht. Die exakte Suche in Anführungszeichen, z. B. \"Der Herr ist\" liefert dagegen nur Fundstellen mit der genau übereinstimmenden Buchstabenfolge innerhalb der Anführungszeichen. Suchergebnislisten können nach Relevanz oder numerisch sortiert werden.\n\nAuf Smartphones wird das gefundene Lied angetippt, der vollständige Liedtext öffnet sich in einem neuen Fenster. Die gezeigte Schriftgröße kann geräteunabhängig in jedem Liedtext vergrößert/verkleinert werden (25-stufig). Zudem lässt sich der Liedtext auf Wunsch negativ darstellen. Die gewählte Einstellung wird beibehalten, bis Sie eine andere Schriftgröße/-darstellung auswählen. Wird das Smartphone bei kleinem Schriftgrad quer gehalten, erscheint der Liedtext im Vollbildmodus und die Schriftgröße wechselt automatisch in einen etwas größeren Schriftgrad. \nDas ohnehin größere Display von Tablets zeigt alle Informationen zu einem Lied mitsamt der Nummern-/Rubrikensuche komfortabel auf nur einer Seite. Bei Antippen öffnet sich der Liedtext im Vollbildmodus.\n\nPremium-Paket mit zusätzlichen Funktionen:\n\nZu einem besonderen Gottesdienst sollen bestimmte Lieder einstudiert werden? Sie möchten dem Dienstleiter eine Liste der Lieder zuschicken, die Sie selbst als Orgelspieler oder der Chor sicher beherrschen? Oder möchten Sie einen misslungenen Liedvortrag in einer der nächsten Proben aufgreifen? Ihnen gefällt das im Gottesdienst vorgetragene Lied und Sie möchten sich unbedingt die Nummer merken?\n\nDas Premium-Paket bietet Dirigenten, Organisten, Dienstleitern und natürlich auch allen anderen Interessierten nützliche Funktionen, um Lieder zu markieren und Liedlisten bei Bedarf mit anderen zu teilen:\n\n- Suchergebnisse nach diversen Kriterien filtern und sortieren\n- Individuelle Notizen zu Liedern erfassen\n- Termine von Chorproben & Gottesdiensten eintragen, in denen das Lied gesungen wurde (oder werden soll)\n- Persönliche Bewertungen von Liedern erfassen (3-stufig)\n- Lieder als Favorit kennzeichnen\n- Premium-Einträge zu Liedern per E-Mail versenden\n\nDas Premium-Paket wird innerhalb der App per In-App-Kauf angeboten.\n\nSonstige Hinweise:\n\nHörbeispiele oder Musiknoten können aus rechtlichen Gründen nicht in die App eingebunden werden.\n\nIcons: www.icons8.com"

      "label": "This metronome app is created by a musician for musicians. Almost all metronome apps boast about their accuracy, but users with sensitive hearing notice inaccurate beats all the time. It used to be impossible to create a perfectly accurate metronome on a mobile device. Despite the failure of other apps, perfect time is possible for TrueMetronome: its unique engine creates perfect beats with ABSOLUTE ZERO error. For this reason, TrueMetronome is the most accurate metronome app on any mobile platform.\n\nSound quality is the second issue for software metronomes. Serious musicians prefer a natural sound filled with overtones, but all metronome apps play short synthetic samples (so that the first sound stops completely before the next begins). Thus, you hear an artificial, dead sound. Moreover, the identical samples playing at the same frequency can drive any man crazy! TrueMetronome solves this problem thoroughly: all sounds are recorded from real metronomes, a beat does not affect the gradual decay of its predecessors, and each beat's sound is a little different from the others. All this contributes to the natural sound which is easier on your ears.\n\nFinally, an aesthetic, thoughtful interface is an important aspect of any application, and TrueMetronome pays particular attention to it. Creating an electronic metronome interface is simple, but TrueMetronome does not cut corners: it recreates the look and feel of a real mechanical metronome; every mark on the scale is labeled with a tempo mark, the deviation angle of the pendulum depends on the tempo, and the tempo is selected by dragging the weight.\n\nYou can adjust the tempo in 2 BPM (beats per minute) increments by dragging the digital weight. This restriction prevents a change of tempo from accidental touches, and when you need greater precision in the selection of the tempo, there are \"+\" and \"-\" buttons as well. On the lower part of the metronome, you can turn the bell on and off and select the number of beats per measure.\n\nTo start or to stop the beats, simply tap anywhere.\n\n-------------------------------------\nKey features\n-------------------------------------\n- Perfect beats with ZERO error (unparalleled!)\n- Natural sound without duplicate samples (unique to TrueMetronome!)\n- Realistic look and feel with particular attention to comfortable usability\n- Optional bell on the first beat of the measure\n- Selection from all known meters: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13\n- Tap tempo function\n- Skins"

      "label": "-- Harmonomics is an ear training tool for all musicians, from beginners to professionals --\n\nThe creator of the innovative metronome Metronomics has created an ear training app flexible enough to help YOUR ears, whether you are a beginner learning interval recognition or a professional who needs to recognize sequences of complex chords in inversions.\n\nFeatures:\n- 50+ exercises, from beginner to advanced\n- Each exercise is customizable with exercise-specific settings\n- Large chord library (over 35 chords, all of which come in different inversions)\n- Creative exercises -- exercises that go beyond the usual interval, melody, and chord identification\n- Detailed statistics for each exercise, plus the ability to send reports to a teacher\n- Motivating \"achievements\" for accuracy, questions per day/week/month, etc\n- and more!\n\nExercise Categories:\n- Interval\n- Melody\n- Chord\n- Chord Progression\n- Scale\n- Perfect/Relative Pitch\n\nThe details:\nHarmonomics has over 50 exercises (more coming in updates) that can each be heavily customized to fit the your individual needs, regardless of your level or the genre of music you are working on. Musicians interested in improving their recognition of chord types will be thrilled to explore Harmonomics' large library of chords (over 35 types), all of which can be played in different inversions. No other app offers such a wide variety of chords that can be played in so many different ways.\n\nStatistics play a big role in Harmonomics. Each exercise keeps track of your accuracy, the number of questions answered, average time per question, and more, letting you review your progress and see when and how quickly you're improving. Harmonomics also awards \"achievements\" as you work, such as recognition of doing 1000 questions a month or 250 questions in a session, keeping you motivated to stay vigilant about your ear training work. If you're a student, you can choose to send reports of your stats to a teacher.\n\nMost ear training apps offer a limited number of exercises, including simple interval identification, melodic dictation, and chord identification. Harmonomics has all of those as well as clever and practical variations, such as exercises that ask you which degree of a chord a certain note is or which inversion a chord is being played in. Plus, each exercise can be customized; for example, a chord identification exercise can be limited to just inverted dominant chords with alterations and made to play three chords in a  row, all of which must be identified correctly. No other app offers that level of advanced exercise to meet the needs of professionals.\n\nStart using Harmonomics today and start expanding what your ears can hear.\n\nExercise Examples:\n- Diatonic Major Melody\n- Simultaneous Intervals\n- Multiple Intervals\n- Diatonic Notes to Key Center Relationship\n- Root Movement of 7th Chords\n- Harmonic Minor Modes\n- Dominant Chords with Alterations\n- Multiple Chords / Inversions\n- Multiple Simultaneous Pitches\n\nChord Examples:\nMaj7, min7b5, 7b9#11, Maj7#5, min11, 7sus4, 7#5#9, 7b5b9, min6/9, etc"

      "label": "OSCILLOSCOPE & SPECTROGRAM is a powerful audio analyzer app and audio unit plugin\n\nKEY FEATURES\n- Run as both Audio Unit and standalone app\n- View up to three seconds of audio on the screen\n- Pause and scroll horizontally to browse back in time\n- Pinch to zoom in / zoom out\n- See both oscilloscope and spectrogram separately or overlayed together\n- Frequency trigger mode helps identify the precise frequency and MIDI note of sounds in the spectrogram\n- Stereo and mono views\n- Level based trigger mode has lookahead, pause, and zoom\n- XY mode shows stereo correlation\n- Automatically adjusts FFT size to fit zoom setting\n- Bark-frequency scale spectrogram shows nice detail at low and high frequencies\n- When zoomed in, the oscilloscope uses sinc upsampling to show you a close approximation of what actually outputs from your audio interface after digital to analog conversion, rather than just displaying raw audio samples.\n\n\nWHAT DOES THIS APP DO THAT OTHERS DO NOT?\n\n1. Pause Button\n\nWe can't emphasize enough how useful this is. You never have to worry about trying to catch short events that disappear quickly because you can watch the sounds go by slowly at a 3 second viewer scale, then just pause and scroll back if you missed something. When you get to the event you want to see you can pinch to zoom in right down to sub-sample level of detail, then zoom back out when you are done and zoom in on something else. This feature alone makes almost all other oscilloscope apps unnecessary because it means you can easily see ANYTHING that you need to see.\n\n2. Frequency Identification Mode\n\nIn frequency mode, when you touch the frequency scale on the right of the screen a blue line appears on the spectrogram. When you position the line above a specific frequency on the spectrogram, a panel on the left side of the screen displays the octave, note name, and MIDI number. You can then use the frequency timing oscilloscope to lock in on the exact pitch in cents so that you not only know which MIDI note that sound corresponds to but you know exactly how many cents sharp or flat. The ability to simultaneously see the frequency on the spectrogram and confirm it with precision on the oscilloscope allows you to quickly and easily identify musical pitches to a level of accuracy that have not seen anywhere else, not even in desktop software.\n\n3. Trigger with Lookahead\n\nAlmost every oscilloscope has a feature where it re-draws the screen each time the input signal level crosses a specified threshold. This is the main and most basic function of any oscilloscope. However, when setting the trigger at a high level to view the attack section of musical notes or drums, we miss the first part of the note. By using lookahead, this app allows you to see a few milliseconds BEFORE the trigger point so that you can see the whole sound you want to examine.\n\n4. Carefully Designed Spectrogram \n\nIn all spectrum analyzer displays, the upper end of the frequency scale is crowded, meaning that a single pixel corresponds to 10 or 20 frequencies in the frequency analysis. In many other analyzer apps one of two things occur: either 9 out of 10 frequencies in that upper range simply get ignored and disappear from the spectrogram display, or all 10 frequencies combine together to make the pixels in the upper range appear brighter than low frequency sounds of similar volume. This may seem like a technicality until you run a sine sweep or a 20 KHz tone through the analyzer and find that large sections of the input simply aren't displayed on the analyzer screen. Looking at these kinds of test signals on a spectrogram is the primary way that we test and evaluate the quality of audio effect plugins. If a spectrogram is to be of any real use as an analysis tool, it should do this right. Other spectrograms often mess up the lower frequencies too, either by making them take up too much space or by making them very pixelated. This spectrogram carefully avoids these problems."

      "label": "Unfiltered Audio's Needlepoint is now available on iOS as a Standalone app or AUv3 plugin!\n\nUnfiltered Audio raises the bar (and lowers the tonearm) with Needlepoint: a revolution in vinyl simulation. Continuing the retro themes of their smashed-up hit lo-fi-af, Needlepoint presents a full platter of advanced physical modeling to dive deep into the warm, fuzzy sound of turntable noises and artifacts beloved by many. Of course, since this is an Unfiltered Audio plugin, you can push the needle far past realism and dive into some seriously warped sounds.\n\nWhile many vinyl plugins are content to use looping samples of noise, Needlepoint uses physical modeling to achieve its incredible sound. Needlepoint synthesizes all sorts and sizes of detritus and distress on a record: hair, dust mites, scratches, warping, etc. These are not randomly modeled, but rather accurately distributed onto a rotating, algorithmic platter. Changing the speed of the record can greatly change the nature of Needlepoint's impact on your sound. While you may be used to vinyl RPMs like 33 1/3, 45, and 78, have you ever wondered what it would sound like to tempo sync a turntable to your DAW? Now you can!\n\nBeyond noise, ambience, and tone, Needlepoint includes other effects to fully etch out your vibe. A single knob compressor (inspired by lo-fi-af's PRESS knob with six additional algorithms) can be added before or after the signal chain. This compressor can emulate algorithms from famous hardware samplers associated with vinyl, or even mimic the sound of analog distortion introduced by the vinyl pressing process. A BROKEN mode emulates a broken record a broken record a broken record a broken... Where were we? Oh right, a BROKEN mode acts as an unpredictable looper by jumping the grooves on your recent audio. You can automate the mode's toggle to create all sorts of cut-up and glitchy phrases.\n\nNo vinyl plugin would be complete without a SPINDOWN button that creates that classic vinyl stop (and start!) sound. Here you can control the rate of the spindown to better fit the effect into your mixes. Finally, at the end of the processing chain, Needlepoint features a granular pitch shifter to help you achieve that chopped up vibe without needing to manually change the speed of your tracks.\n\nDespite all of these features, Needlepoint is incredibly easy to use. With a beautiful interface and an extensive set of presets, Needlepoint will help you itch that nostalgic scratch that your tracks need.\n\nAs an AUv3 plugin, Needlepoint has been tested to work perfectly with Garageband, Drambo, AUM, Cubasis, Beatmaker, Nanostudio, apeMatrix, Loopy Pro, and more! Additionally, with its clear layout and smart resizing, Needlepoint can be used on tablets and phones with ease.\n\n(Note for Drambo users: Drambo does not yet have automatic Plugin Delay Compensation for managing plugins with latency. As a result, tracks with Needlepoint will not line up properly with other tracks. An upcoming patch for Drambo will add this feature in.)"

This app creates more bass than iOS speakers can reproduce!\n\n“Really cool app. Is it good? YES!” – Nu-trix the Synth Guy\n\n+ This app does not support IAA or Audiobus. But, you can use it in Audiobus 3 as an Audio Unit. Works great that way!\n\n“You can turn a few knobs and make 808s that sound so good you could sell them in a sample pack!” – Casual Chris Youtube Review\n\nThis is a mono instrument. One is probably all you need. But, it can be stacked with AU hosts\n\nExpress yourself. Create your signature sound. Simple controls allow you to easily sculpt your own bass or kick sound.\n\nFAQ – LIMITED EDITION APPS\n\nWhat happens if I get a new iPhone or iPad?\nThe limited edition apps you have already acquired will remain in the app store so that you’ll always be able to download them as long as you have the same iTunes account.\n\nWhat happens after the \"app drop\" release time is over?\nThe apps will remain in the App Store so that you may download updates. After the “app drop”, the price in the app store will go to the maximum price tier. As long as you keep the same iTunes account, you may download updates and copies to new devices for free!\n\nWill the apps still be updated?\nThe apps will be updated for new iOS versions, to ensure that your limited edition apps continue to work as iOS technology progresses.\n\nWill the apps support iPhone?\nWe will try to make most of these apps universal. We’re planning a free universal upgrade to the Bass 808 Synth. While the app is currently iPad only, an iPhone version is on the way and will be available while the app is still on sale.\n\nWill there be open-source? \nWe plan on open-sourcing as much as we can. Some of the code developed for this app has already been added to AudioKit for all developers to use in their projects, free of charge.\n\nAre you still working on your existing apps?\nYes! We are still working on improving all our apps, including Synth One, D1, and FM2. The technology developed as a part of these limited edition apps will help improve all our apps.\n\nHOW CAN I KNOW ABOUT FUTURE SPECIAL APPS?\n\nPlease tell your friends to go to:\n\nAudiokitpro.com/join\n\nJoin the fun! :) \n\nMore details about this app:\naudiokitpro.com/bass808"

      "label": "With SonoSequencr you can create individual sequences to perform recurring tasks with just one click.\n\nIf you have multiple Sonos devices and want to play a radio station on all of them, it takes some time to set this up. With SonoSequencr, all you have to do is open the app and tap your previously created sequence.\nYou can lock your iOS device or use another app while your sequence is running in the background.\nOf course, you can also start it from the widget, Apple Watch or using Flic Buttons.\n\nHere are some examples:\n- Group kitchen and dining room, set volume to 5, start a radio station and set a sleep timer to 2 hours\n- Switch your Playbar in the living room to the TV input, set the volume to 40, add dining room and set the equalizer settings for both devices to neutral\n- Disable the subwoofer and enable voice enhancement + night mode on the Playbar in the living room\n- Set the equalizer settings for all your devices to specific values\n- Disable touch on speaker and enable status light for all your devices\n- Set the volume of the kitchen and living room to the same value as in the dining room\n- Make an announcement with your individual text in the children's room\n- etc...\n\nEach of these examples, created once, requires only one tap in the widget or on your Apple Watch.\n\nSonoSequencr also includes a restricted mode. This allows you to restrict control to specific devices, among other things.\n\n\nUsing an optional in-app purchase, you can also start sequences at specific times or via external triggers like IFTTT. Of course, this requires that the iOS device is on the same network as your Sonos devices at the time. For intensive use of external triggers, it is recommended to run SonoSequencr in 'server mode'. In this mode, SonoSequencr is always running in the foreground on a dedicated iOS device. SonoSequencr still supports iOS9.\n\nThere are many more features like grid view, create dynamic alarms, HTTP requests, launch other apps, automatic battery charging in server mode, transfer sequences between devices, etc....\n\nYou can only use music (radio streams/tracks/albums) for your sequences that are stored in your Sonos Favorites (My Sonos) or in your TuneIn radio stations. You can't search your entire music library in this app. Just add your most used music to my Sonos then it can be used in your sequences.\n\nThe Timed Sequences feature is only available with an optional in-app purchase 'Premium'. With this automatically renewing subscription, up to 20 sequences can be run at freely configurable times. The function is only active as long as a valid subscription exists. The costs are billed via the iTunes account. The subscription will be renewed automatically within 24 hours before expiration (same time and costs), unless it is cancelled before in 'Settings' -> 'Manage Subscriptions' or in the iTunes settings.\n\nTo use this app you must have a working Sonos system. SonoSequencr supports Sonos software 1 and 2.\n\nFor terms and conditions and privacy policy see:\nhttps://celltekk.de/sonosequencr/help/privacy\n\nThis is not an official Sonos app."

      "label": "Learn to play 'In The Pocket' with Drummer ITP: The World's only intelligent metronome and rudiment training tool! *Worldwide Number 1 iPhone Music App in over 70 countries!*\n\nDrummer ITP can help you to learn exceptionally accurate timing with your drum performances and become a true 'In The Pocket' player. The app is designed for practicing rudiment patterns with a drum practice pad - incorporating an intelligent listening feature, which allows your performance against a metronome click to be measured and given as feedback scores. You can therefore track your progress and identify what rudiment patterns and tempos cause you most trouble with staying in time. \n\n*Please note: as with all professional audio and recording systems, Drummer ITP requires you to use wired headphones to enable zero latency analysis and measurements. Bluetooth headphones do not allow zero latency data exchange.\n\nDrummer ITP helps to identify the key tempos where your technique changes from wrist-action stick hits to faster speeds which require you to control the bounce of the drumsticks. Finding your breaking points with different stick pad rudiments and practice exercises will enable you to focus on the most challenging aspects of your personal stick technique and will underpin your development in all areas of drumming.\n\nThe main display shows both the rolling click waveform and the microphone readings from your performance on the practice pad, so you can easily see if you are playing ahead or behind the beat. There is also a unique accuracy indicator which shows how far ahead or behind the beat each of your hits is. Whilst performing rudiments and exercises on a practice pad, the app records an ongoing measurement of accuracy and consistency of the performance, so you can practice to keep the timing indicator right in the middle of the screen and achieve the highest possible scores. When playing an accented pattern, or an exercise with rests incorporated, the intelligent algorithm checks that the correct type of hits are performed at the right time. If you want to check how accurate the app is, just turn up the loudspeaker volume and you'll see it measure its own sounds to 100% accuracy - so you can see how close your own performance scores are to that of an electronic drum machine!\n\nDrummer ITP can be used in Manual Mode or Rudiment Mode. In Manual Mode the metronome runs freely, as a standard metronome whilst also keeping a measurement of the recent performance scores. With a rudiment pattern active (i.e. using the app's Rudiment Mode), a count in starts a 30, 60, 120 or 300 second rudiment test, the results of which become a benchmark for evaluating your performance progress over time, with all your best high scores being recorded. The app can also be used purely as a standalone high-precision metronome with advanced settings allowing you to choose different pitches, volumes and intervals for the click.\n\nIncludes a total of 68 practice patterns and rudiment exercises for combinations of:\n- standard timing exercises (quarters, eighths, sixteenths)\n- triplet timing exercises\n- single, double and triple paradiddles (including inverted, reverse and offset)\n- single and double paradiddle-diddle patterns\n- rudimental drum rolls\n- accented patterns\n\nAdditional features:\n- notation of all included rudiments and exercise patterns \n- real-time left/right hand pattern indicator \n- accent indicator and moving notation counter \n- tempo adjustment from 30-240 bpm\n- beat time intervals 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n- optional beat one accent for practicing specific time signatures\n- click designer with settings for pitch, tonality, click duration and volume\n- separate click design for the main beat and interval sounds\n- stick pad performance player, to hear what you are attempting to play\n- high scores chart for completed rudiments and exercises\n- preset click sounds\n- microphone sensitivity adjustment\n- intelligent 'learn latency' feature to ensure 100% accurate analysis"

Your iPhone or iPad built-in mic can do the job, but a 3rd-party microphone (from such companies as Zoom, Shure, or Apogee) might give you the best-sounding results. Each chart/part can be printed or emailed from the app.\n\nThe are 10 tunes total in the Mintzer Big Band App library and store.

      "label": "Built for Live performance and hands free use, Quantiloop recreates the simplicity of a hardware loop pedal in an iOS app. Attach a MIDI foot controller and control it the way you want. No MIDI controller at hand; just preset your loop length, enable auto–record or a count–in and your loops will automatically close, no hands or feet required. Big onscreen controls allow for easy configuration and tactile control by vocalists or beat boxers. Focus on your performance instead of fiddling with dip switches or complex menu’s.\n\nBe Creative\n\nCreate 4 tracks with endless layers of overdubs to build your performance. Record a Chorus, Verse and Bridge and switch between them seamlessly or create a 1 bar percussie loop on track one, a 4 bar chord progression on track two and layer a bass line on top, all in perfect synchronisation.\n\nRhythm Guide\n\nThe builtin rhythm guide provides a rhythmic backing. Use the internal metronome for practice, import drum loops from virtually anywhere or host and control your favourite rhythm apps to enhance your performance. MIDI master lets you control MIDI hardware, and MIDI slave lets Quantiloop follow it. Ableton Link lets you even play in time over WiFi with external apps and devices. Quantisation aligns your actions to the nearest measure or beat so you stay in time, and real-time tempo control sets the pace. Prefer setting your own pace, disable quantisation and Quantiloop will react to your actions with minimum latency to create tight synchronised recordings.\n\nFX\n\nAssign up to 3 simultaneous effects to the input. Use the built-in transpose to covert your guitar into a bass, or host your guitar amp sim directly in Quantiloop. The results will be recorded into your loops.\nOr assign up to 3 simultaneous track effects to the output. Use the tape stop to add drama, introduce a key change to build up your performance, or host an Inter-App audio/AU reverb processor. Track FX may be assigned to a single track, all tracks or the combined output.\n\nFeatures\n\n•\tFree, Synced and Paralel,Serial, Mixed Playing Styles\n•\tMultiple Quantise Modes\n•\tMultiple Stop Modes\n•\tUnique Dub Mode and Mute Mode\n•\tUnlimited Overdubs\n•\tOverdub Decay\n•\tUndo / Redo\n•\tAuto Record\n•\tHigh quality stereo audio\n•\tClear loop status display\n•\tRhythm guide with optional auto-start, auto-stop and count-in\n•\tAudible and Visual Metronome\n•\tSend start, stop and host sync to hosted rhythm apps.\n•\tSync to host when embedded in an Inter-App-Audio host\n•\tReal-time Tempo Control\n•\tExtensive MIDI control\n•\tMultiple Assignments per MIDI controller (tap, hold, double tap)\n•\tMIDI Program Change support for changing presets\n•\tSupports Audiobus and Inter-App-Audio and Audio Units (AUv3)\n•\tIndividual outputs for each track and rhythm\n•\tSynchronise to other apps and devices with Ableton Link\n•\tMIDI clock sync (both slave and master)\n•\t4 physical/iaa/au/audiobus inputs routable to any track\n•\t8 outputs (main, monitor, track 1-4, rhythm, input out)\n•\t3 assignable input Fx, including transpose, reverb and IAA, AUv3\n•\t3 assignable track Fx, including transpose, reverse, tape stop, fade and IAA, AUv3\n•\tCloud (iCloud, Dropbox, Audioshare …) import / export\n•\tAudioCopy/Paste\n•\tOpen In\n•\tStore Phrase Presets in unlimited banks with 100 presets each\n•\tIndividual Volume and panning controls for each track"

      "label": "Mononoke is an unconventional synthesizer, designed to compose evolving soundscapes and musical textures. \n\nFeedback routing\nWhat sets Mononoke apart from other synths is that its voices (4 in each section) can be routed back into each other in multiple ways, creating all sorts of overtones and pulsating resonant frequencies. Sometimes harmonic, sometimes weirdly atonal. Sometimes clear and delicate as icicles, sometimes harsh as metallic blades, sometimes soft as fresh snow. This interaction between voices helps fuse all layers together into a coherent musical landscape. \n\nA tale of two engines\nThe synthesizer engines (each of the two sections has its own independent engine) have relatively simple controls, which influence a complex system of many invisible, interconnected LFOs. But this is not your bread-and-butter general purpose synthesizer: think of Mononoke as one huge FM synthesizer where each voice is an independently playable operator. Together all operators contribute to a single soundscape.\n\nExpressive pads\nComplex soundscapes can be created live, using the 8 performance pads which let you modulate each voice independently in several dimensions. Your interactions with the pads will also be sent out as MPE/MIDI (when loaded as an AU plugin in a compatible host) so you can record and tweak your session. The onscreen pads can be latched individually so some voices can be used as drones, while others as can be added and removed as extra sonic layers. The pads are fully integrated in the Audio Unit plugin.\n\nConnectivity\nMononoke is designed as an AUv3 plugin, with advanced Audio Unit features such as MPE input and output (!), a fully exposed array of AU parameters for automation and all the connectivity and scalability you can expect from modern plugins. \n\nThe standalone mode is basic (just meant for jamming and creating presets) and does not offer any connectivity, so if you want to use Mononoke in conjunction with other apps and effects you'll need to load it into a host, such as Garageband, Audiobus, AUM or Cubasis.\n\nSummary:\n- Audio Unit (AUv3) plugin\n- 8 voice polyphony, 2 independent engines with 4 voices each\n- Compatible with MPE (MIDI Polyphonic Expression) and MIDI\n- MIDI Input and Output (only available when used as an Audio Unit plugin)\n- Limited standalone mode for jamming (full screen, no connectivity)\n- 8 independently tunable performance pads for expressive interaction\n- Universal, fully scalable to any screen size, supports fullscreen mode in AU hosts\n- Freely tunable voices, or quantized to semitones (with overall finetuning)\n- iOS10 (MIDI/MPE output from the plugin requires iOS11) or higher\n\nAlso contains Mononoke Pads: an extra AUv3 MIDI controller plugin for playing MPE compatible synths using Mononoke's pads. Note: this is a separate plugin which will be installed in your MIDI Plugin collection. Mononoke Pads requires iOS 11."

Thanks to its very low CPU usage, load as many instances of Motion FX as you want and unveil new sonic territories!\n\nEffects included are:\n- Low Pass Filter\n- High Pass Filter\n- Band Pass Filter\n- Volume\n- Pan\n- Pitch Shifter\n- Frequency Shifter\n- Ring Modulator\n- Warmth\n- Bit Crusher\n- Delay\n\nEach effect has a parameter automated by the sequencer and can have one or more secondary parameters. Pick an effect and then modulate it dynamically thanks to the motion sequencer. When switching effects, the motion sequencer keeps its state to invite you to new sound design ideas!\n\n_____Sequencer:\n\nThe sequencer offers 4 to 16 steps, each step has a value and a curve. You can set the value by touching and/or dragging the step and set the curve by tapping the curve icon at the bottom of each step. Curves choices are: Step, Ramp Up, Ramp Down, Ramp and Smooth Ramp.\n- Length controls the number of steps (4 to 16).\n- Resolution controls the duration (in bars) of each step. (from 1/32 bar up to 4 bars)\n- Grid snap: when set to ON, steps values snap to the displayed grid when you change their values.\n- Reset: resets all steps to their default values (default value depends on the current selected effect).\n- Amount sets the sequencer’s amplitude.\n- Randomness sets the range in which step values are randomly chosen.\n- Smooth sets the interpolation time between steps.\n\n\n_____Effects:\n\n- Low Pass Filter, High Pass Filter and Band Pass Filter:\nThe sequencer modulates the frequency value of the filter.\nA slider controls the resonance of the filter.\n\n- Volume:\nThe sequencer modulates the gain.\n\n- Pan:\nThe sequencer modulates the pan.\n\n- Pitch shifter:\nThe sequencer modulates the pitch. The pitch range is +/- 12 semitones.\nGrain Size sets the density of the granular pitch shifter.\nGrid sets the sequencer grid to Chromatic, Major or Minor. Set Grid Snap to ON to quantize the pitch to the selected scale.\n\n- Frequency shifter:\nThe sequencer modulates the frequency. The frequency range is +/- 1kHz.\nFine adds an offset to the frequency set by the sequencer.\nIf Stereo is On, Fine value for the right channel is the opposite to the left channel.\n\n- Ring modulator:\nThe sequencer modulates the frequency. The frequency range is 1Hz to 10kHz\nFine adds an offset to the frequency set by the sequencer.\nIf Stereo is On, Fine value for the right channel is the opposite to the left channel.\n\n- Warmth:\nWarmth is a waveshaper. The sequencer modulates the strength of the waveshaper.\nDrive adds a gain before the waveshaper.\n\n- Bit crusher:\nThe sequencer modulates the rate of the bit crusher.\nDepth controls the depth of the bit crusher.\n\n- Delay\nThe signal is delayed by a time set by the sequencer. The time range is 0 to 50ms.\nFeedback sets the amount of delay feedback.\nWhen Ping Pong is On, the delayed signal bounces back and forth between the left and right channels.\nStereo sets the difference between left and right delays.\n\n- A Dry/Wet control lets you set the balance between the dry and wet signals.\n- The random preset generator (dice button next to the presets manager) only affects the parameters of the current selected FX. \n\nCheck out www.bleass.com for video tutorials and more info!\n\n\n* PLEASE NOTE: this is an Audio Unit Effect plugin (AUv3) which requires a compatible host such as AUM, GarageBand, Cubasis, BM3 or Auria.

      "label": "AltiSpace is a convolution reverb app with advanced controls that provides realistic sounding natural acoustic space or vintage reverb devices for any track or mix.\n\nA convolution reverb takes a captured sample (called an impulse response) from a real-world space or real hardware and uses this to digitally simulate the reverberation of that space or device down to the last detail and nuance. Because it is sampled, not synthesized, convolution reverb is known for its stunning realism, and it is widely considered to be the best type of reverb. However, unlike the more common algorithmic reverbs, convolution reverbs usually does not have much control over the reverberation process.\n\nBut AltiSpace, in addition to the ability to load your own impulse response files and a built-in library of the most interesting vintage reverb device presets, has advanced settings such as EQ, gate, ducking, modulation and more. You can change the original impulse response parameters to something completely new and then save it as a new preset.\n\nThis app has an easy-to-use user interface, where all the main controls are located on the single screen, and it is ready to use right out of the box, even without additional settings. And at the same time, you can easily change the parameters of the impulse responses from the built-in library to create your own sound.\n\nApp features:\n\n- Ability to import your own impulse response files.\n- A large built-in library of presets from the most interesting hardware reverbs.\n- Convenient preset manager with the ability to group and search presets.\n- Presets can be marked as favorites for display in the favorites group.\n- Supports MIDI controllers (also Bluetooth) with learn or manually assign mode.\n- Reverb can work with a stereo or mono input and convert it to stereo.\n- Add dynamic noise before reverb for a more natural sound.\n- The gate allows you to turn on the reverb when the threshold is exceeded.\n- The ducking allows you to turn off the reverb when the threshold is exceeded.\n- Sets the minimum reverb level for Gate and Ducking modes.\n- Equalizer with high and low cut filters in chain before or after reverb.\n- Changing the time (length) of the current impulse response.\n- Possibility to set a fade out point for a smooth end of the impulse response.\n- Sets the pre-delay time of the signal before reverb.\n- Experimental feature to change the pitch of the impulse response.\n- Amplifying early or late reflections.\n- Adjusts the stereo image before the reverb.\n- Haas effect for adding stereo space to a mono signal.\n- Sets the depth and frequency of modulation the signal before reverb.\n- Mixing dry / wet signal and adjusting the output level.\n- Input and output level meters.\n- Indicators of possible input clipping for standalone.\n- Prevents any output clipping for standalone.\n- Built-in full description of all controls.\n\nDemo:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBHxgjkGCoU\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLNi9wHaGew\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3RPopor9gI\n\nAltiSpace is a universal application for iOS and macOS.

      "label": "Haas effect is a micro-delay applied to either the left or right channel of audio (but not both). This simple effect creates a realistic and natural-sounding increase in the width of the stereo field that still sounds good when mixed back to mono. It is the most simple and effective way to take a mono input and make it sound like stereo. But Haas effect has some problems. First, it can create phase cancellation problems in the bass frequencies, causing them to loose volume. Second, it can sound a bit artificial at high frequencies. This multi-band Haas effect plugin is a simple way to get the stereo width you need in the midrange frequencies without loosing the impact of the bass or making the treble sound phasey. You select any number from one to four bands, each with its own separate Haas delay setting and adjustable crossover frequencies. This makes mono audio sound wide and spacious while preserving the original tone and spectrum transparently."

      "label": "“Nothing sounds quite like a Synclavier”\n\nWorld-class iOS synthesis has arrived! The Synclavier® II helped shape a generation of popular music and film soundtracks. Now this beast of an emotional vintage synthesizer has been incarnated on iOS using much of the core DSP code from the original and keeping the authentic red-button interface that is both deep and immediate.\n\nNot only retro, but decidedly modern: fully compatible with MPE, Ableton Link, Audiobus 3, MIDI. And the included AUv3 client can run inside of iOS DAWs such as GarageBand, NanoStudio 2, BeatMaker 3, Cubasis 3, Auria Pro.\n\nThe powerful Synclavier DSP Engine affords 12 Partial Timbres, Timbre Frames, Samples, FM-Synthesis and Additive-Synthesis methodologies.\n\nIt’s so easy to create playable rich string sounds, fantastic Moog esque drones, Prophet like pads, crazy FM brass noises, or Roland 808 style drum hits. It’s a sound designer’s dream and a synthesist’s wonderland.\n\nBut there’s more! We’ve added a ton of stuff. The original hardware was 8-bit. With newer technology, we can pack more fidelity and more features in this already awesome synth.\n\nMPE compatibility, seven timbre “quick-change” character buttons, 16-track mixing console, crazy-good Artist Preset Libraries from world-renowned sound designers, and lots more. The Synclavier was always a versatile attention-getting instrument, but now it’s a powerhouse synth to be reckoned with!\n\nRelease 1.30 features include -\n• iPad, iPhone and iPad Touch compatibility iOS9 or later\n• 96-button authentic VPK interface\n• AUv3 client compatibility for use within iOS DAWs\n• 16 original “Factory Preset Libraries” (8 banks x 8 entries) - 979 timbres \n• 3 “Artist Libraries” - 127 all-new timbres\n• Sample Library with 116 high-quality soundfiles\n• Audio Setup 44.1/48 kHz and sample latency controls\n• 16-track multi-timbral implementation with mix controls (iPad only, iPhone is mono-timbral)\n• Audiobus-compatible stereo output\n• Meticulous re-creation of the Synclavier FM sound using hardware modelling\n• Soundfile playback, pitch-shifting, looping, and keyboard mapping\n• iCloud compatibility to easily share Timbres (or via Audiobus)\n• iTunes file sharing for backup of user timbres and mixes\n• Direct expression routing for pitch bend, mod wheel, velocity and pressure\n• Full compatibility with MPE interfaces\n• Ableton Link synchronization with Repeat/Arpeggiate\n• 7 character buttons to quickly sculpt any timbre\n• Embedded “Tour” pages detailing setup and operation\n• Library browser for saving and calling up Timbres\n\nSynclavier DSP Engine\n• 12 Partial Timbres\n• Delay-Attack-Decay-Release envelope generators\n• 100 Timbre Frames per Partial\n• Noise Floor and Bit Depth controls\n• Micro-tuning controls\n• Dynamic and Keyboard Envelopes\n• Vibrato and Tremolo LFOs\n• Authentic re-creation of the original instrument and sounds, adjustable from 4-bit grunge to 24 bit silky smoothness.\n\nSynclavier Go! is compatible with all iPad, iPhone and iPad Touch models that can operate iOS 9.0 or later. Soundfile playback and AUv3 compatibility require iOS11 or later. The latest iOS version that is compatible with your device is recommended.\n\nThe Synclavier® knob is as unique today as it was revolutionary at the time of its introduction. The knob is a rate-of-change controller; close your eyes and let your right-brain kick in to the sound design process. Forget the numbers; forget the digits; let your ears guide the process. Sound design with a touch-screen and Synclavier® knob is as different from a mouse-driven GUI as, well, Synclavier® was different than the Fairlight CMI! The Synclavier Knob is an exciting and authentic option, but is not required for Synclavier Go! since a virtual knob is provided in the app.\n\nNote to Parents: Synclavier Go! is as educational as it is historic and authentic. This app can introduce your teenager to the technical aspects of sound and sound design in a fun and informative environment."

      "label": "Metronome Touch. Style of pendulum.\n\nMetronome Touch is created with one objective: to design a classic metronome with a unique style, so we combined a precise pendulum, perfected accuracy, and realistic interaction. Made of aluminum and glass, Metronome Touch proves a huge statement: It is as exclusive as your device. Launching Metronome Touch, your device will become a metronome.\n\nAnyone can try to make a metronome app, but success only comes when listening to customers. That's why Metronome Touch centers around functions that musicians are looking for: The ability to tap a beat, use customizable presets to save your favorite sets (bpm, time signature and accentuation), and multiple useful ways of adjusting the bpm. Metronome Touch even goes far beyond that: Neither analog nor digital metronomes can synchronize pendulums. But Metronome Touch can. This opens completely new ways when practicing, performing on stage or doing studio recordings.\n\nShould you be teaching students, they can follow your lesson more accurately while concentrating on their own devices synchronized with Metronome Touch. You will gain your student's attention when using this outstanding technology. If you have ever been on stage with bad acoustics, you will love Metronome Touch: It will provide every single band member with a perfect steady and synchronized rhythm on stage. Even when recording a song in separate soundproofed rooms, Metronome Touch keeps you in perfect sync.\n\nEasily adjust Metronome Touch to your likes and needs with the light or dark design - relying on absolute clear vector-based display graphics  - and many well chosen professional metronome sounds.\n\nMetronome Touch is constantly being developed further to ensure the highest customer satisfaction.\n\nFEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY\n\n• Precise engine \nA completely new developed engine makes this app one of the most precise pendulum metronomes available on the App Store. Highest accuracy is supported on all iOS devices.\n\n• Ableton Link synchronization technology\n Metronome Touch was the first metronome worldwide offering pendulum synchronization on iOS devices. You can keep band members‘ metronomes or a whole orchestra in sync.\nAbleton Link provides new ways of practicing together or in a group. \n\n • Memory function\n There is an infinite number of customizable presets to save your favorite sets of bpm, time signature and accentuation.\n\n • Numerical entry\nUsing bpm display let you directly enter tempo values from 20 up to 999 bpm.\n\n• Tap2bpm \nUse the tap field that will interpret your finger taps as bpm.\n\n• Beat count and accentuation\n Choose a beat count from 1 up to 12 beats and free customizable accentuation.\n\n• Styles and sounds\n Customize Metronome Touch to your likes and needs. Choose between dark and light design as well as chosen professional metronome sounds.\n\n• Retina display\n Metronome Touch comes with a complete set of vector graphics for all display sizes and looks simply perfect on your device.\n\nFor more informations, app videos, faq's and pictures go to » www.cu4uc.com"

      "label": "OSCILLOSCOPE & SPECTROGRAM is a powerful audio analyzer app and audio unit plugin\n\nKEY FEATURES\n- Run as both Audio Unit and standalone app\n- View up to three seconds of audio on the screen\n- Pause and scroll horizontally to browse back in time\n- Pinch to zoom in / zoom out\n- See both oscilloscope and spectrogram separately or overlayed together\n- Frequency trigger mode helps identify the precise frequency and MIDI note of sounds in the spectrogram\n- Stereo and mono views\n- Level based trigger mode has lookahead, pause, and zoom\n- XY mode shows stereo correlation\n- Automatically adjusts FFT size to fit zoom setting\n- Bark-frequency scale spectrogram shows nice detail at low and high frequencies\n- When zoomed in, the oscilloscope uses sinc upsampling to show you a close approximation of what actually outputs from your audio interface after digital to analog conversion, rather than just displaying raw audio samples.\n\n\nWHAT DOES THIS APP DO THAT OTHERS DO NOT?\n\n1. Pause Button\n\nWe can't emphasize enough how useful this is. You never have to worry about trying to catch short events that disappear quickly because you can watch the sounds go by slowly at a 3 second viewer scale, then just pause and scroll back if you missed something. When you get to the event you want to see you can pinch to zoom in right down to sub-sample level of detail, then zoom back out when you are done and zoom in on something else. This feature alone makes almost all other oscilloscope apps unnecessary because it means you can easily see ANYTHING that you need to see.\n\n2. Frequency Identification Mode\n\nIn frequency mode, when you touch the frequency scale on the right of the screen a blue line appears on the spectrogram. When you position the line above a specific frequency on the spectrogram, a panel on the left side of the screen displays the octave, note name, and MIDI number. You can then use the frequency timing oscilloscope to lock in on the exact pitch in cents so that you not only know which MIDI note that sound corresponds to but you know exactly how many cents sharp or flat. The ability to simultaneously see the frequency on the spectrogram and confirm it with precision on the oscilloscope allows you to quickly and easily identify musical pitches to a level of accuracy that have not seen anywhere else, not even in desktop software.\n\n3. Trigger with Lookahead\n\nAlmost every oscilloscope has a feature where it re-draws the screen each time the input signal level crosses a specified threshold. This is the main and most basic function of any oscilloscope. However, when setting the trigger at a high level to view the attack section of musical notes or drums, we miss the first part of the note. By using lookahead, this app allows you to see a few milliseconds BEFORE the trigger point so that you can see the whole sound you want to examine.\n\n4. Carefully Designed Spectrogram \n\nIn all spectrum analyzer displays, the upper end of the frequency scale is crowded, meaning that a single pixel corresponds to 10 or 20 frequencies in the frequency analysis. In many other analyzer apps one of two things occur: either 9 out of 10 frequencies in that upper range simply get ignored and disappear from the spectrogram display, or all 10 frequencies combine together to make the pixels in the upper range appear brighter than low frequency sounds of similar volume. This may seem like a technicality until you run a sine sweep or a 20 KHz tone through the analyzer and find that large sections of the input simply aren't displayed on the analyzer screen. Looking at these kinds of test signals on a spectrogram is the primary way that we test and evaluate the quality of audio effect plugins. If a spectrogram is to be of any real use as an analysis tool, it should do this right. Other spectrograms often mess up the lower frequencies too, either by making them take up too much space or by making them very pixelated. This spectrogram carefully avoids these problems."

      "label": "Passaggi is an improvisation and ornamentation practice app for historical performers. The app delivers high-quality audio backing tracks for personal practice, which, when used in conjunction with facsimiles or modern editions of historical sources, enable the user to develop skills in the areas of improvisation and ornamentation. Suitable for students, amateurs and professionals alike, the app features adjustable pitch and tempo settings and user-defined looping capabilities. Tracks are recorded using a sampled historical organ in a temperament appropriate to the repertoire and are designed to complement the pedagogy of historical treatises. \r\n\r\nThe idea behind Passaggi springs from a desire, common to many performers of historical repertoires, to recreate aspects of the musical experience as it may have existed at the time a piece of music was written. Improvisation and ornamentation may form only one aspect of this wide-reaching desire, yet it is clear that in this area students and professionals would achieve more successful immersive study and practice if the harmonic and musical context for improvisation, ornamentation and diminution were more easily accessible.\r\n\r\nHow many of us can open Dalla Casa’s Il vero modo… and sing the baseline to his exercise embellishing Striggio’s I dolci colli, for example? And how much more profitable would our practice of this exercise be if we could? How many more of us would practise improvising on a ground, if we had a ground? The Passaggi project will enable more effective exploration of historical sources and approaches by providing digitally some aspects of the innate and inherited musical awareness common to all musicians of the past that we strive to connect with in the twenty-first century."

Cover a wide range of pointer indicating and rapidly tuning;\n2. Easy to view pitch, frequency, cent and the transposition state;\n3. Observe the device statue in combination of signal and cent volatility curve, and directly see the stability change of chord;\n4. Three levels of anti-noise settings: The lowest anti-noise ability can realize the short tone detection of 0.1s. The highest anti-noise ability can accurately detect the standard pitch even in the 4 times baseband amplitude murmurs. Default level is II that is the highest level;\n5. Three accuracy options: 0.1 cent, 1 cent and 3 cents. Default option is O that is the best accuracy;\n6. Three input modes: Microphone, Pickup and Bluetooth;\n7. Adjustable A4 calibration in 1 Hz increment;\n8. Tuning frequency range: 23HZ--6400HZ;\n9. Support for transposing instruments.\n\nAbout signal curve and cents curve:\nCombination of signal with curve: in our piano tuner, signal attenuation resulting in the frequency offset is an important reference value. The price of our professional software in the market can be 100 to 599USD, which may not be suitable for general people; through simplification, we make the fully functional tuner for ordinary instrument. \n\nBenifits of signal curve and cents curve: \n1. The sound stability is an important factor when you decide to buy some instruments;\n2. Does the instrument is old, dirty or need to change chord;\n3. Among three anti-noise levels, when adjust to the lowest level you will detect the sound frequency that is hard to catch, if it’s a very short high-pitch. Now we even can detect the 88-tone of piano which is definitely unique for current ordinary tuners.\n4. Strong Bass picking technique make you gain the needed date in curve. Can adjust even for wind and pipe instruments.\n\nElegantune Corporation has a history of 15 years in designing Chromatic Tuner. Our company has designed many Chromatic Tuners for famous and independent brands for different purpose, such as for pointer and for piano. With the most advanced sound tuning technology in the world, this is the first time that our company designs our own brand—tuner app. After testing on hundreds of instruments, we now specially recommend Elegantune, which works perfectly for majority of instruments. \n\nElegantune has been updating and improving for a long time, at first we used and referenced peterson tuner’s strobo mode and other products’ advantages, but we do not have a big success. Under one year’s reforming and improving, the UI and practicality of our products both have a very big promotion. Our target is that make every customer who choose us feel satisfaction and comfortable. \nWe trust we will be the best and looking forward to get your feedback on our products. We will give you a satisfactory answer."

      "label": "Pitch graph is a versatile tool for musicians to tune instruments and practice intonation. Use it when practicing the violin, viola, cello, trumpet, singing and much more. \n\nThe app monitors the microphone and calculates the frequency up to 40 times a second and plots it on a 3D accelerated graph. It has a maximum detection sensitivity of a thousandth of a cent. The app provides real time feedback while you play your instrument. The blue lines in the background represent the note frequencies. The closer the plotted line is to a blue line the better the intonation. Intonation is also indicated with three colors: Red for notes that are too sharp, orange for notes that are too flat and green for notes that have good intonation. The app automatically monitors the microphone and removes intermittent noise and silence, while keeping the sound and pitch information on the graph synchronised. Tap a location on the graph and it plays the corresponding sound which makes it easier to read the graph. A practice session can be reviewed with the replay feature. This animates the graph while playing back the sound and is a great way to find problem areas in a performance. The clear button resets the app when you are ready for the next take. You can turn the microphone on and off by tapping the microphone icon. \n\nTo make the most of the app please be aware of the following limitations: The graph refresh rate is throttled on older hardware to improve pitch detection performance. The app can resolve only one frequency at a time, so bowing double stops on a violin or strumming a guitar will give incorrect pitch readouts. Because the app uses the microphone it may pick up other sounds such as background music. Pitch detection works best in a quiet setting. The app was tested with a number of different instruments, yet each instrument is unique, so performance may vary. \n\nI hope you enjoy this app and find it useful."

      "label": "Music Info allows you to view information about songs in your library, including play count, skip count, release date, date added, album artist, composer, genre, comments, lyrics, and more.*\n\n\"Apple's Music app on macOS surfaces all kinds of information about the songs you're listening to … But for reasons unknown, that isn't the case with the iOS version of Music. But as Apple likes to say, there's an app for that.\"\n—iMore\n\nMusic Info features a clean, modern design that’s simple and efficient to use. When you open the app, if a song is playing in the Music app, its info automatically appears and updates when the song changes. You can also browse your library to select a song and view its metadata. Or get a song’s info directly in the Music app from the share sheet — it’s Music’s missing Get Info button.\n\nMore features\n● Select a song using Music Recognition powered by Shazam\n● Use home screen quick actions to quickly select a song\n● Play the selected song in-app\n● Tap and hold text to copy information\n● Drag and drop artwork into other apps\n● Light and dark mode\n● Keyboard shortcuts\n● Split view multitasking and multiple windows on iPadOS\n● Full accessibility support including Dynamic Type, VoiceOver, and Voice Control\n\nHow it works\n● The Music app, like iTunes before it, saves metadata for each song you have in your library. Music Info reveals this information that otherwise isn’t accessible on iOS and iPadOS.\n● All songs in your library can be accessed in the Music Info app, no matter if they were added via Apple Music, purchased, matched, uploaded, or otherwise synced to your device. Songs in Apple Music that haven’t been added to your library cannot be accessed.\n● The share sheet action is available when sharing a song in the Music app. Note that only songs that are available on Apple Music can be shared. Music Info will try to look up that song in your library which may require an internet connection. It’s possible it may not be able to find the right song, for example, if you’ve renamed it. If that is the case, you can still use the app to access its information even without an internet connection.\n\nThings to note\n● Song metadata cannot be edited on iOS and iPadOS.\n● Music Info does not work with any third-party music services.\n\n* All available metadata:\n- Artwork\n- Title\n- Artist\n- Album\n- Album artist\n- Composer\n- Genre\n- Release date\n- Duration\n- Play count\n- Last played\n- Grouping\n- Track\n- Disc number\n- Compilation\n- Explicit\n- Rating\n- BPM\n- Skip count\n- Date added\n- Comments\n- Lyrics"

As seen on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\n\nhttps://loopyapp.com\n\n-- “This is the best loop station on the iPhone” -- Dub FX (dubfx.net) \n-- “I pretty much own every mobile looper out there and Loopy is HANDS DOWN the best. Super simple interface with powerful features.” -- J. Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support. Please contact me with questions, bug reports, feature ideas, and other feedback at support@atastypixel.com or https://forum.loopyapp.com. I may be able to fix your issue in less time than it would take to write a negative review!"

      "label": "SPL is a professional-grade digital sound level meter (decibel meter) for your iPad,  iPhone or iPod touch. It includes all of the modes, filters, and features that you would expect from a professional ANSI or IEC Sound Level Meter. All filters and averaging modes meet or exceed the criteria for ANSI Type 1 standards or better. SPL is created from the same team who brought you the Audio Toolbox and ATB Plus.  \n\nStore Results -- Uses the same powerful Save / Recall engine as our premier app, AudioTools. Allows storing GPS and time-stamped results, and exporting them to your computer.\n\nYou can also use SPL with our calibrated iPhone measurement mic, iTestMic, or iAudioInterface. \n\nThe screen flips if you turn the phone upside down, so that you can point the built-in iPhone mic directly at the sound source.\n\n*** Modes: Slow, Fast, Impulse, Peak, and Leq.\n\n*** Filters: A and C weighting, and 10 octave band filters.\n\n*** Includes a resettable Max field to track the highest reading.\n\n*** Includes a reference field (except in Leq mode) so that you can set a reference level and do seat-to-seat comparisons.\n\nThe SPL meter can be fully calibrated. It comes preset with the calibration for a typical iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch. Most iOS devices will be within a few dB of this reading. If you have access, even temporarily, to a calibrated sound level meter, just use the calibration field on the settings scree to match the meter, and you will be accurately calibrated.\n\nAlso, see our other professional-grade audio apps: AudioTools, our premier suite of professional-caliber audio and acoustics test apps, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and RTA, a real-time analyzer for the iPhone.\n\nAnd, we have a group of calibrated, accurate measurement microphones, including iTestMic,iTestMic2, and iAudioInterface2, that allows full professional results for Type 1 or Type 2 measurements. \n\nThis will allow measuring a range from approximately 30 dB SPL to 130 dB SPL. Each mic will include a calibration factor that you will enter into the SPL app for calibrated measurements. This mic will also work with Speaker Pop, our speaker polarity tester, FFT, RTA, ETC, and other acoustical measurement apps in our AudioTools app that is available now.\n\nAlso, see our iAudioInterface2 system, which supports any pro test and measurement mic. \n\nNow includes an iPhone internal mic compensation filter, to cancel out the low-frequency roll-off present in the iPhone and other iOS devices.\n\nSee our other audio apps, including AudioTools."

      "label": "Note reading made fun! Note Rush is a game for practising note reading on the music staff to help you learn to play the piano, keyboard, flute, saxophone, violin... you name it! Note Rush shows you one note at a time in random order then uses the microphone to listen as you play through them like you would with note reading flash cards, only these flash cards check that you're playing the right note! \n\nPlay with a bunch of fun themes and race to earn stars and beat your best time! Note Rush is great for teaching keyboard geography by making sure each note is played in the correct octave. An indispensable music theory must-have for learning sight reading at all levels of music education.\n\n\"Great app for learning notes!\" - App Store Review.\n\n\"So much better than flash cards! My son loves using this app and his note reading has improved tremendously since starting. I'm thankful he can do this on his own and it keeps track of his high scores which is highly motivating for him.\" - App Store Review.\n\n\"A blockbuster hit with teachers and students... I especially like using it at group lessons.\" - Leila Viss, 88pianokeys.me \n\n\"Note Rush has quickly become my favorite app for piano teaching.\" - Joy Morin, colorinmypiano.com\n\n\"Note Rush is a motivating app that engages students to improve quickly with their note reading skills. It is definitely one of my top favorites and will be used often!\" - Jennifer Foxx, musiceducatorresources.com\n\n\"Note Rush is a great way to review notes for the One Minute Club.\" - Susan Paradis, susanparadis.com\n\n*** Having trouble? See noterushapp.com/troubleshooting for help. ***\n\nListens to Your Instrument\n------------------------------\nNote Rush helps students learn a strong association between notes on the page and keys on your instrument by using your device's microphone to detect when you play each note. Works with pianos, keyboards, flutes, violins, you name it! (See Q&A below for more about supported instruments.)\n\nStudent-paced\n------------------\nNote Rush goes as fast or as slow as the student, with no time limits, so is suitable for complete beginners right through to being a fun challenge even for teachers!\n\nGrand Staff Context\n-----------------------\nThe whole grand staff is always visible, showing each note in full context and helping students improve their note recognition across the two staves.\n\nOctave-Sensitive Keyboard Geography\n---------------------------------------------\nIt's a \"B\", but which \"B\"?? Note Rush teaches keyboard geography by making sure you're getting the note in the right octave every time.\n\nGreat for Home Practise\n-------------------------\nStudents will rush to their instrument at home every day with NoteRush, chasing stars and high scores! Unlike flash cards, children can drill note identification at home with no music-reading parent required to check if they're getting them correct - Note Rush checks for you! Play every day and you'll be great at reading piano music in no time.\n\nLevels\n-------\nNote Rush has fifteen built-in Levels, from Middle C-Position right through to the full grand staff with 2 ledger lines above and below. There are Levels for Treble Clef, Bass Clef or full Grand Staff! Or make your own levels to practise reading specific notes, with sharps and flats for an added challenge!\n\nBetter Than Flash Cards!\n-------------------------\nUse Note Rush instead of printed flash cards! Note Rush was designed to replace the cards used in One Minute Club - a challenge you can run in your studio where students have to complete a given level in under a minute. Give it a try!\n\n--\nNote Rush is made by Thomas Grayston, a software developer, pianist, and husband to a piano teacher."

      "label": "Bebot is a musical instrument that anyone can play. Instead of a keyboard, it has an easy-to-use touch control system. And it's all built into a friendly animated robot, who performs your music while you play.\n\nAlthough it looks simple on the outside, inside is a powerful synth engine which lets you create and edit your own sounds and apply effects. The controls are easy to use, making it fun to tinker and experiment with sound. If you just want to get playing, there's also a wide selection of preset sounds.\n\nThe touch control system lets you lock in a scale so that you'll never play a wrong note, which makes it easy to play, even on your iPhone. It's polyphonic, which means you can use multiple fingers at once to play chords and harmonies. Plus, you can perform sweeping slides and expressive gestures that would be practically impossible on a regular keyboard.\n\nWhile it's designed to be simple and fun, that doesn't mean it's only for beginners. Bebot has been used both on stage and in the studio by accomplished musicians and performers including Dream Theater, How To Destroy Angels and The Flaming Lips.\n\nTo see and hear Bebot in action, check out the demo videos at normalware.com, including a walkthrough demo by keyboard wizard Jordan Rudess.\n\nNow with Audiobus and Inter-App Audio, you can connect Bebot to other apps such as GarageBand to record, multitrack and add effects, making Bebot more versatile and useful than ever.

      "label": "ChordLab is a specialist tool and calculator of sorts for modern four-part voice leading. Everyone has heard these colors in the arrangements of Big Bands - the horn riffs in the Jetsons carton song for example. With ChordLab we can in a way flip through all possible permutations of these chords. More theoretical background is available in the documentation. This is not a general chord app for beginning instrumentalists. To the intermediate player, however, ChordLab can be a source of great inspiration and introduction to many new color choices.\n\nFour-part harmony may feel restrictive on instruments capable of more than 4 voices, but for a small choir for example it is a basic fact of life. It has become a staple in modern music as well as it allows the accompanist to declutter the spectrum in a sense by playing fewer notes. Root and fifth substitutions are applied automatically when dialing up a chord in ChordLab. Simply like that. Once the quality of a chord has been set it can then be viewed and listened to in all standard and not so standard drop voicings and moved through its inversions. This is of particular importance to guitar players as quite a few voicings are impossible to play and one may be left with rather few options. Chord spelling is also the main feature of ChordLab's Apple Watch app.\n\nChordLab has an interactive Circle of Fifths. With it we can look up key signatures for major and minor scales as well as all other modes derived of the major scale. So it is possible for example to display key signatures for all mixolydian scales  and simultaneously highlight the other degrees for that mode. Additionally ChordLab displays degree structures for a key in standard Roman numerals. This is extremely useful when putting together chord progressions. Roots of the current harmonic domain are highlighted in white and can be tapped to audit the associated chords.\n\nThe chord finder feature in ChordLab allows you to search its database for 3 or 4 note structures to determine their harmonic quality. To find a chord in its database ChordLab uses the enharmonically simplest solution and does not require you do know whether a note is called G# or an Ab. This is especially useful for guitarists that seldomly encounter chords in root position due to the tuning of the instrument.\n\nFeatures include:\n• Chord spelling for all common chords\n• Notation and textual representation of chord tones\n• Chord finder for triads and seventh chords\n• Alto, bass, tenor, treble clefs, TAB and grand staff\n• All inversions and standard voicings\n• Virtual piano and guitar instruments\n• Chord tone labeling in instrument views\n• All common open and alternate tunings presets (guitar)\n• Automatic root and fifth substitution\n• Apple Watch app\n\nThere is a lot of functionality built into ChordLab, but as with any tool it is what we make of it. If chord spelling is a term in your vocabulary ChordLab should be of interest. Or maybe you want to grow your chord reportoire. Putting music theory into words often makes it sound overly complex yet nobody would say that orange or purple are complicated. ChordLab lets you play and work with colors in a sense and shows you how to play them on your instrument. It is very a unique tool for musicians, song-writers, professionals and music students and one that you will find yourself coming back to again and again."

      "label": "Visualize the fretboard, master scales and play through changes like a pro with intervallic functions! \n\n\n‣ Solo is a revolutionary practice tool designed by world renowned fusion guitarists Tom Quayle and David Beebee.\n\n‣ One of the biggest barriers to improvising on guitar is finding and mapping out the relevant chord tones and scales all over on the fretboard in real time.\n\n\nSolo is a highly focussed app for developing your note finding and visualization ability on the guitar. There is no time-based pressure and Solo reduces the cognitive load of having to choose which ‘notes/intervals’ to play. As you get quicker at finding these ‘notes’ you will conversely get better at choosing them whilst improvising. Players of all ability levels will reap huge benefits from practicing with Solo.\n\n\n‣ Using common progressions, Solo presents you with one chord symbol or scale at a time and asks you to find and play a series of notes based on their intervallic function.\n\n‣ Solo listens to the notes you play, analyzes them in real time, and doesn’t move on until you’ve correctly found each note by its intervallic function in the specified order.\n\n‣ This process builds strong fretboard visualization for the most powerful, efficient and malleable way to KNOW your way around the fretboard no matter how difficult the chord changes are. \n\n\nAs a unique and powerful ear training tool, Solo also develops your ability to not only visualize what you’re playing, but hear it in real time too.\n\nIf you know your note names but struggle to learn new scales, play through chord changes or find yourself stuck in pattern based playing, practicing diligently with Solo will be transformational for your knowledge of the fretboard and subsequently your ability to outline harmony when you improvise. \n\n\n‣ CHANGES PLAYING TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions over a series of chord changes based on common and popular chord progressions. Solo is programmed with all the knowledge behind the scenes to understand jazz and popular music harmony and will always pick appropriate intervallic functions based on the harmony of the progression. \n \n‣ SCALE TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions within scales on the fretboard. Solo includes all the modes of the Major, Melodic Minor, Harmonic Minor and Harmonic Major scales, plus pentatonic and symmetrical scales. Seeing and finding scale tones as intervallic functions will transform your ability to manipulate and improvise with scales in real time.    \n\n‣ TUTORIALS\nSolo also includes video tutorials to get you started with intervallic functions, how to find them on the fretboard, using Solo for ear training and how to get the most from your practice time with the app.\n\n\nNo registration or account required."

Spectra is a lightweight music & audio visualizer app that allows you to select and visualize audio in realtime, right on your phone or mac. Want to export your visualization? We have you covered. Simply click the \"Create Video\" button from within the app. No longer do you need expensive software to create those beautiful animations you've seen on the internet. Want to customize the background image or put a logo in the center? We made that available as well. In fact, you can customize just about all aspects of the visualizer. You can even import audio files from apps like iMessage or Mail using the share sheet. We want to keep improving the app so If you have any suggestions, be sure to leave a review and tell us what feature you're missing!\n\nThe features:\n• Amazing, 60fps realtime visualization for any audio file, iTunes music (not Apple Music), or Spotify song\n• Video exporting of your audio visualization (does not support Spotify)\n• Custom background image\n• Background presets\n• Background effects\n• Custom logo image\n• Visualizer customization\n• Particle customization\n• Video export settings\n• Video animation options\n• Presets\n• More to come!!!\n\nHere's how it works:\nThe sound we hear is made up of many frequencies. The visualizer decomposes the audio input into its frequencies and displays the lower frequencies at the top/left of the audio spectrum and the higher frequencies at the bottom/right of the spectrum. This can create some cool-looking shapes that all correspond to the currently-playing audio track!\n\nWhether you're a producer that wants to see the frequency range of their song, an audiophile, or someone who wants to take a deeper look into their music, this app is definitely for you."

      "label": "iDrumTune Pro is the world’s most advanced, accurate and intelligent system for assisting and educating on drum tuning – used by thousands of drummers all over the world. Now with Drum Kit Designer feature and detailed online tutorials.\n\nFeatured in Modern Drummer 'New and Notable' - July 2018  \n\n\"an invaluable aid not only for drummers but also studio engineers and producers\" - Sound on Sound Magazine\n\n\"I can’t recommend this app highly enough ... for the money, it is indispensable. It's simple, accurate, looks good, and the tuning information is worth the cost of the app alone.\" - www.mikedolbear.com\n\n“***** I never knew I could have this much fun tuning drums!” – Adamrod (App Store review)\n\n“***** Just tuned my first drum and this app is awesome!” – bburt85 (App Store review)\n\n“***** Buy this app if you are a drummer!!!” Lildrummerboy (App Store review)\n\nThe original and most innovative electronic drum tuning app - iDrumTune Pro brings unrivalled accuracy and features that have never been possible before for assisting with drum tuning. Built by world experts in drums and musical acoustics, and backed up by a detailed online training course on Drum Sound and Drum Tuning.\n\niDrumTune Pro includes the following features:\n\n* Pitch Tuning – to make your drums sing and allow you to play musical phrases around the kit\n\n* Lug Tuning – to ensure that the drumhead is evenly tuned and gives a smooth and warm tone\n\n* Resonant Head Tuning – to allow you to be sure that the two heads are working together and giving rich overtones\n\n* Spectrum Analyzer – so you can really start to understand what frequencies are excited and heard when playing the drums\n\n* Drum Kit Presets – so you can save and load your favourite tunings and share them with the world. Now also includes the interactive Drum Kit Designer feature.\n\n* The Science of Drum Tuning – and extensive manual on the science and art of drum tuning and getting the best out of iDrumTune Pro \n\niDrumTune is the first and by far the most intelligent and accurate system for analyzing drum sounds and assisting tuning – developed by drummers, music producers and acoustics research Professors. iDrumTune provides you with a measurement of the drumhead vibration frequency, much in the same way to an acoustic guitar tuner which measures the vibration frequency of a guitar string. In Pitch Tuning mode, you simply hold the iPhone over the center of a drum, about 2-4 inches away, and strike the drum in the center.\n\nThe iDrumTune readout shows the recorded sound waveform and gives the strongest frequency recorded. There is also a tuning indicator bar which shows the drumhead tuning relative to musical notes, so iDrumTune can be used to ensure that your drums are in key with each other or the song you are playing. A frequency spectrum view also allows more detailed analysis and helps with tuning the drum at the lug positions.\n\niDrumTune provides advanced tuning features including an intelligent filter function, Lug Tuning mode and Resonant Head Tuning mode. The filter allows unwanted frequencies to be ignored by the analysis algorithm, whilst Lug Tuning mode offers the simplest and most innovative method for tuning an even frequency response at the lug positions on the drumhead.\n\nThe Preset Manager allows you to save all your favourite drum tunings and call them up when you are in the middle of the process. Drum kits can also be exported and imported, so you can share your favorite tuning setups and load new ones in from other drummers.\n\nDrum Tuning isn’t easy, and drums don’t respond exactly the same way every time you hit them. For that reason, it's valuable to know a little about the science of drum tuning. iDrumTune includes a comprehensive text on the science of drums and drum tuning in order to help you get the best of iDrumTune and to become an expert drum tuner!\n\nWatch the iDrumTune tutorial videos and read reviews on iDrumTune at www.idrumtune.com"

It allows you to stream and eq music from SoundCloud and your Dropbox account without the need for storage on your device.\n\nFrom the reviews:\n\nEXCELLENT PROGRAM\nI connect my iphone 4 to a car audio system, with the application the music began to sound incomparably better ....\nA little clear interface, but to understand it and understand need no more than 5-10 minutes. -- P_S_B_\n***\nLOVE IT\nThis is the EQ I have been looking for, and because of bad ratings I almost passed on it! I consider myself an aspiring audiophile and have the equipment -- Klipsch, Sunfire, Nottingham, Denon, Paradigim, etc. -- (and debt) to back it up. This EQ performs flawlessly and is very easy to use. It enhanced my music dramatically. Yes, dramatically! Just make sure you are running the recommended IOS, as the developer suggests. -- J. Paul DiMaggio\n***\n\n\nPLEASE if you have concerns or encounter problems with the app: post on http://www.audioforge.ca and we will explain how things work, until you can use all the features of the app to the fullest.

      "label": "Alle Texte aus dem Gesangbuch der Neuapostolischen Kirche.\n\nDie Gesangbuch-App bietet allen Musikinteressierten, Dirigenten und Dienstleitern die Möglichkeit, die Texte aus dem Gesangbuch schnell und einfach nachzuschlagen. \n\nDie als 64-Bit-Anwendung programmierte Version 3 greift Bewährtes aus den Vorversionen auf und kombiniert dieses mit intuitiver Bedienung und neuen Funktionen. Dabei wurden gewohntes Nutzerverhalten und aktuelle Displaygrößen berücksichtigt. Und – das Beste zum Schluss – die App kann optional mit zusätzlichen Features ausgestattet werden.\n\nGrundfunktionen:\n\nDie Startseite zeigt nun neben dem Feld für die Nummerneingabe die ersten Textzeilen des gesuchten Liedes. Alternativ lassen sich Lieder über die Rubrikensuche oder über die Volltextsuche auffinden. Standardmäßig findet die Suche auch Wortteile und berücksichtigt bei mehreren Wörtern die Reihenfolge nicht. Die exakte Suche in Anführungszeichen, z. B. \"Der Herr ist\" liefert dagegen nur Fundstellen mit der genau übereinstimmenden Buchstabenfolge innerhalb der Anführungszeichen. Suchergebnislisten können nach Relevanz oder numerisch sortiert werden.\n\nAuf Smartphones wird das gefundene Lied angetippt, der vollständige Liedtext öffnet sich in einem neuen Fenster. Die gezeigte Schriftgröße kann geräteunabhängig in jedem Liedtext vergrößert/verkleinert werden (25-stufig). Zudem lässt sich der Liedtext auf Wunsch negativ darstellen. Die gewählte Einstellung wird beibehalten, bis Sie eine andere Schriftgröße/-darstellung auswählen. Wird das Smartphone bei kleinem Schriftgrad quer gehalten, erscheint der Liedtext im Vollbildmodus und die Schriftgröße wechselt automatisch in einen etwas größeren Schriftgrad. \nDas ohnehin größere Display von Tablets zeigt alle Informationen zu einem Lied mitsamt der Nummern-/Rubrikensuche komfortabel auf nur einer Seite. Bei Antippen öffnet sich der Liedtext im Vollbildmodus.\n\nPremium-Paket mit zusätzlichen Funktionen:\n\nZu einem besonderen Gottesdienst sollen bestimmte Lieder einstudiert werden? Sie möchten dem Dienstleiter eine Liste der Lieder zuschicken, die Sie selbst als Orgelspieler oder der Chor sicher beherrschen? Oder möchten Sie einen misslungenen Liedvortrag in einer der nächsten Proben aufgreifen? Ihnen gefällt das im Gottesdienst vorgetragene Lied und Sie möchten sich unbedingt die Nummer merken?\n\nDas Premium-Paket bietet Dirigenten, Organisten, Dienstleitern und natürlich auch allen anderen Interessierten nützliche Funktionen, um Lieder zu markieren und Liedlisten bei Bedarf mit anderen zu teilen:\n\n- Suchergebnisse nach diversen Kriterien filtern und sortieren\n- Individuelle Notizen zu Liedern erfassen\n- Termine von Chorproben & Gottesdiensten eintragen, in denen das Lied gesungen wurde (oder werden soll)\n- Persönliche Bewertungen von Liedern erfassen (3-stufig)\n- Lieder als Favorit kennzeichnen\n- Premium-Einträge zu Liedern per E-Mail versenden\n\nDas Premium-Paket wird innerhalb der App per In-App-Kauf angeboten.\n\nSonstige Hinweise:\n\nHörbeispiele oder Musiknoten können aus rechtlichen Gründen nicht in die App eingebunden werden.\n\nIcons: www.icons8.com"

The idea was to design a tool to manipulate a melody’s speed, direction, and pitch, as well as play multiple variations of the melody simultaneously.\n\nAs it turned out, the best implementation for this was to reimagine one of the most fundamental building blocks of all music sequencers: the piano roll.\n\nFUGUE MACHINE is the world’s first multi-playhead piano roll. Create a music sequence and play it back with up to four playheads at once — each at various speeds, directions, pitches, and more. Watch the playheads dance, and hear the complex patterns that emerge.\n\nIt’s mesmerizing.\n\nFugue Machine supports iPhone, iPad, MIDI, AUv3 MIDI, Ableton Link, Audiobus, Audiobus 3 MIDI, and Inter-App Audio."

Obviously comes with all the randomization and mutation features. Up to 8 patterns per sequence, with Follow Actions. Transpose using MIDI.\n\n2) Rozeta Rhythm: a euclidean drum sequencer with mutations per instrument and polyrhythms. Comes with configurable key mappings for many popular drum apps.\n\n3) Rozeta X0X: classic TR-styles step sequencer for drum machines. Supports triplets, polyrhythms and mutations per channel. Optionally emulates the exact timing jitter pattern of the legendary TR-808\n\n4) Rozeta LFO: a triple MIDI LFO generator lets you modulate CC parameters of your MIDI instruments. Apply amplitude modulation to each wave for more organic behavior. Optionally syncs to tempo.\n\n5) Rozeta XY: a double XY Controller Pad for generating 4 simultaneous configurable CC controller streams per instance. Also features MOD wheel and PitchBend sliders.\n\n6) Rozeta Arpeggio: adds a MIDI arpeggiator to any of your synths. Offers latch mode, shuffle and automatic tempo synchronization. Turn any incoming MIDI stream into an arpeggio on the fly.\n\n7) Rozeta Particles: MIDI particle generator - generates a cloud of MIDI notes that create pseudo-random patterns when bounding off the walls.\n\n8) Rozeta Cells: Polyphonic Step Recorder - record and play back polyphonic phrases and patterns.\n\n9) Rozeta Collider: MIDI Hadron Collider - explore semi-repeating generative patterns and melodies.\n\n10) Rozeta Scaler (NEW): MIDI Scale Quantizer and Transposer - tune incoming MIDI to a different scale, never play out of tune again.\n\nNotes: \n- these plugins do not run as a standalone app and require a compatible host to work\n- MIDI is not sound. To make sound you'll have to feed the MIDI into a synthesizer or instrument app. Bring your own synths!"

      "label": "Yet another ear-training app? Well, this one is different!\nPlaying jazz, pop and improvised music means being able to quickly recognize and replay what you hear. Although this app began as an ear-training tool for students of jazz and pop at the Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK), it is also intended for musicians playing in other styles, and at all levels. It was developed by Swiss IT specialist and jazz trumpeter Daniel Schenker, professor at ZHdK, in collaboration with his son Elia.\n\nHow it works\nThe app offers a host of ear-training exercises, many of them quite enjoyable, all designed to enhance both active and passive hearing. Active hearing means reproducing what you have heard on an instrument or with your voice, while passive hearing refers to the ability to identify such things as the scales, triads and four-note-chords, tensions and slash chords, on which active hearing is based. One of the features that make our app so special is the fact that its microphone enables a sort of dialogue between the app and the musician – whether on voice, brass and reed instruments, guitar, piano or electric bass. Unlike other apps, this one uses an integrated voicing generator to ensure that the chords played (position, voicing) correspond to the actual performance situation. In addition, the app uses a detailed educational guidance system, which allows users to individually customize the exercises. You can obtain 150 achievements.\n \nActive exercises (microphone)\n- Five-tone range imitation, major and minor: suitable for younger students or amateurs\n- Diatonic imitation: reproduction of notes in a particular key, vocally or on an instrument\n- Atonal imitation: improvement of relative or referential hearing\n- Intervals\n- Resolution game: technique for the improvement of downward interval singing or playing\n- Bass imitation exercises: double bass notes and root notes of various chords are to be reproduced vocally or on an instrument, a central skill that is often underdeveloped\n- Sing or replay chord tensions (e.g. #9, b13)\n- Scales sandbox: imitation practice in tonal spaces from over 40 different scales\n- Tonal memory game\n \nPassive exercises (identification practice)\n- Intervals\n- Triads/four-note-chords in root position and inversion, as well as identification of top note positions\n- Four-note-chords with one tension (17 types) and with two tensions (15 types)\n- All 12 major and minor triads above a root note (slash chords/hybrids)\n- Identification of scales and modes\nDepending on the setting, the chords can also be played arpeggiated.\n \nFor whom is the app intended?\n- Singers both amateur and professional who want to incorporate (noteless) ear training exercises into their practice programme.\n- Musicians in primary and secondary school, musicians and singers preparing for university entrance exams (practical theory), and conservatory students\n- Musicians and singers of all genres, especially jazz/pop/rock, who want to freshen up or expand their chord vocabulary\n- Brass players: control in mouthpiece exercises (buzzing)"

      "label": "The Minimoog Model D App is a software transmutation of the world’s first portable synthesizer, the Minimoog Model D®. Anyone can jump in and play with over 160 included presets or lay fingers to the controls and begin exploring vast magical realms of creative potential for iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch and Mac. \n\nThe Minimoog Model D App incorporates a number of inspiring sound creation tools and capabilities not present on its analog antecedent. New functions include the ability to play chords with up to four-note polyphony, an easy-to-use arpeggiator for rhythmic pattern creation, a real time looping recorder with unlimited overdubbing capacity, a tempo-synchronizable stereo ping pong delay module, and the Bender -- a wide-range stereo time modulation effect module. \n\nThe Minimoog Model D App also supports AUv3 Audio Unit extensions, which allows multiple instances of this powerful instrument to be used simultaneously within compatible iOS apps supporting AUv3.\n\nA BRIEF HISTORY \nIntroduced by Moog in 1970, the Minimoog Model D served as the archetype for all electronic keyboards that followed. It gave users the ability to design their own sounds, translating imagination into reality. The Minimoog’s portability, affordability and accessibility made it the go-to instrument for musicians looking to expand beyond the traditional sounds of the time. Bernie Worrell used the Minimoog Model D to establish Parliament Funkadelic’s futuristic funk sound. Kraftwerk employed the Minimoog Model D on the successful concept album Autobahn, sparking an entirely new genre. Gary Numan replaced his live band’s guitars with Minimoog Model Ds, creating the prototype for industrial music. The classic sound of the Minimoog Model D can be heard on Bob Marley’s Catch A Fire, Michael Jackson’s Thriller and Dr. Dre’s The Chronic; Detailed in the mini-doc series “A Brief History Of The Minimoog”. \n\nFEATURES \n• Ships with over 160 presets (hundreds more available in the Minimoog Model D App Store) \n• Up to 4-notes of polyphony \n• Easily share presets and audio recordings with friends \n• Arpeggiator module with note-hold and chord latch capability \n• Stereo ping-pong delay effect \n• Bender time modulation effect \n• Real-time looping recorder with overdub and immediate sharing \n• Selectable envelope shapes and triggering behavior \n• Effortless MIDI CC mapping \n• Seamlessly backup presets to iCloud \n• Play mode for easier panel and keyboard interaction \n• A new take on the classic feedback/overload path \n\nSUPPORTS\n• All 64-bit iOS devices\n• AUv3 Audio Unit Extensions (Including GarageBand)\n• MPE Controller Support \n• Ableton Link \n• Inter-App Audio and Audiobus\n• 7 and 14-Bit MIDI \n• MIDI Program Change Support \n• Bluetooth LE MIDI controllers \n• Share over AirDrop, Mail, or other iOS applications"

The playful touch UI invites anything from live performance, experimentation to learning and mastering the granular concept.\n\nMultiple plugins: Import, Record or Live Process\nYou can import your own WAVs (standalone & AUv3 Instrument plugin), Record audio (Record effect plugin) or live-process sound (Process effect plugin) to create anything from drones and granular echoes to moving microtonal audio textures.\n\nDesigned for touch: Kinetic Sliders\nAll sliders and XY pads are linked to a physics model which lets you flick and throw them around. Minimise the friction for endless bouncing motion, as an innovative substitute for traditional LFOs and modulation. There was never a better reason for using a touchscreen for music.\n\nShimmer Feedback effect\nLike a shimmer reverb, except it feeds the processed audio back into the grain engine. This lets you create an endless loop of pitch-shifting spaciousness, turning even the simplest of sounds into massive woolly mammoths. \n\n- 3 Voice grain engine, each with an independent playhead\n- Filter inspired by the Oberheim Xpander, including its resonant Phase filter\n- Kinetic sliders and pads for playful interaction with the sound\n- Universal design (iPhone and iPad; iPad Air 2 or higher recommended)\n- Custom scales, unquantised mode and even Scala-import for microtonal experiments\n- Use WAVs, record audio or load the app as a live-processing audio effect\n- Real world tested as an instrument in numerous live performances by Hainbach"

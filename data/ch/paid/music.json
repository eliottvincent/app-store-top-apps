      "label": "Deluxe generative edition of Brian Eno's acclaimed 2017 ambient album, Reflection.\n\n\"REFLECTION is the most recent of my Ambient experiments and represents the most sophisticated of them so far. My original intention with Ambient music was to make endless music, music that would be there as long as you wanted it to be. I wanted also that this music would unfold differently all the time - ‘like sitting by a river’: it’s always the same river, but it’s always changing. But recordings - whether vinyl, cassette or CD - are limited in length, and replay identically each time you listen to them. So in the past I was limited to making the systems which make the music, but then recording 30 minutes or an hour and releasing that. REFLECTION in its album form - on vinyl or CD - is like this. But the app by which REFLECTION is produced is not restricted: it creates an endless and endlessly changing version of the piece of music.” - Brian Eno\n\nMinimum requirements:\n\niPad 3\niPhone 5\niPad mini 2\nAppleTV (4th generation)"

      "label": "Historic Harpsichords - Ruckers 1628 is a superbly-sampled recreation of one of the greatest and most valuable harpsichords of all time!\n\nPlease check https://www.youtube.com/nlogmusic for demo videos!\n\nUniversal app for iOS supporting iPad Air, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 2, iPad mini 3, iPhone 5S, iPhone 6, iPhone 6plus or later.\n\nFlemish instrument-building family Ruckers need little in the way of introduction to those in the know; suffice to say, their highly-valued (and valuable) historic harpsichords are akin to Stradivarius violins built by the Stradivari family. \nYou could even say that the harpsichord was the ‘synthesizer’ of its time, without which influential early musical stylings such as baroque and renaissance would never have emerged. \n\nNeedless to say, 1628 must have been an especially excellent year for the Ruckers family, for the Ruckers 1628 is now one of the greatest and most valuable harpsichords of all time. Those thinking that they will never get to experience the sheer musical joy of playing this two-manual harpsichord built by master craftsman Andreas Ruckers (The Elder) in Antwerp way back in 1628 should surely think again. \n\nThanks to the definitive development work of TempoRubato in collaboration with sample content provider par excellence realsamples, now you can conveniently enjoy playing an authentic recreation of the Ruckers 1628 from the comfort of their favourite iOS device whenever and wherever you like!\n\nHistoric Harpsichords - Ruckers 1628 has been tested and tuned with hardened harpsichord instrumentalists and features full recreation of all stops and combinations. Creative users can play both manuals individually using separate MIDI channels with faithful recreation of manual coupling using key velocity for controlling onset delays. \n\nIt includes historic tuning systems such as Werckmeister, Vallotti, Krinberger, Meantone, and more. Main a4 pitch is tuneable by +/- one semitone specifically for historically-correct performances. That said, performances need not necessarily be restricted to faithful recreations of those notable early musical stylings, but are applicable to current genres, too. \n\nTechnologically speaking, Historic Harpsichords - Ruckers 1628 is truly a state-of-the-art app, supporting all iOS standards such as AudioBus, Core MIDI, Virtual MIDI, and InterApp-Audio. Indeed, it can be played using Apple’s InterApp-Audio or from other iOS apps via virtual Core MIDI. When using it as a sound module for MIDI controller keyboards it is fully playable using Core MIDI-compliant interfaces or Apple’s Camera Connection Kit and class-compliant USB MIDI devices.\n\nOf course, superb sample content is also a given with Historic Harpsichords - Ruckers 1628 making mind-blowing use of 800MB of sampled data, including key release sounds, while high-quality floating point audio processing is used throughout. Today any appropriate iOS device owner can dive right in to the rich sampled sound of the original Ruckers 1628 harpsichord and start exploring the app’s capabilities using the onscreen keyboards."

      "label": "Metronome Touch. Style of pendulum.\n\nMetronome Touch is created with one objective: to design a classic metronome with a unique style, so we combined a precise pendulum, perfected accuracy, and realistic interaction. Made of aluminum and glass, Metronome Touch proves a huge statement: It is as exclusive as your device. Launching Metronome Touch, your device will become a metronome.\n\nAnyone can try to make a metronome app, but success only comes when listening to customers. That's why Metronome Touch centers around functions that musicians are looking for: The ability to tap a beat, use customizable presets to save your favorite sets (bpm, time signature and accentuation), and multiple useful ways of adjusting the bpm. Metronome Touch even goes far beyond that: Neither analog nor digital metronomes can synchronize pendulums. But Metronome Touch can. This opens completely new ways when practicing, performing on stage or doing studio recordings.\n\nShould you be teaching students, they can follow your lesson more accurately while concentrating on their own devices synchronized with Metronome Touch. You will gain your student's attention when using this outstanding technology. If you have ever been on stage with bad acoustics, you will love Metronome Touch: It will provide every single band member with a perfect steady and synchronized rhythm on stage. Even when recording a song in separate soundproofed rooms, Metronome Touch keeps you in perfect sync.\n\nEasily adjust Metronome Touch to your likes and needs with the light or dark design - relying on absolute clear vector-based display graphics  - and many well chosen professional metronome sounds.\n\nMetronome Touch is constantly being developed further to ensure the highest customer satisfaction.\n\nFEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY\n\n• Precise engine \nA completely new developed engine makes this app one of the most precise pendulum metronomes available on the App Store. Highest accuracy is supported on all iOS devices.\n\n• Ableton Link synchronization technology\n Metronome Touch was the first metronome worldwide offering pendulum synchronization on iOS devices. You can keep band members‘ metronomes or a whole orchestra in sync.\nAbleton Link provides new ways of practicing together or in a group. \n\n • Memory function\n There is an infinite number of customizable presets to save your favorite sets of bpm, time signature and accentuation.\n\n • Numerical entry\nUsing bpm display let you directly enter tempo values from 20 up to 999 bpm.\n\n• Tap2bpm \nUse the tap field that will interpret your finger taps as bpm.\n\n• Beat count and accentuation\n Choose a beat count from 1 up to 12 beats and free customizable accentuation.\n\n• Styles and sounds\n Customize Metronome Touch to your likes and needs. Choose between dark and light design as well as chosen professional metronome sounds.\n\n• Retina display\n Metronome Touch comes with a complete set of vector graphics for all display sizes and looks simply perfect on your device.\n\nFor more informations, app videos, faq's and pictures go to » www.cu4uc.com"

      "label": "With SonoSequencr you can create individual sequences to perform recurring tasks with just one click.\n\nIf you have multiple Sonos devices and want to play a radio station on all of them, it takes some time to set this up. With SonoSequencr, all you have to do is open the app and tap your previously created sequence.\nYou can lock your iOS device or use another app while your sequence is running in the background.\nOf course, you can also start it from the widget, Apple Watch or using Flic Buttons.\n\nHere are some examples:\n- Group kitchen and dining room, set volume to 5, start a radio station and set a sleep timer to 2 hours\n- Switch your Playbar in the living room to the TV input, set the volume to 40, add dining room and set the equalizer settings for both devices to neutral\n- Disable the subwoofer and enable voice enhancement + night mode on the Playbar in the living room\n- Set the equalizer settings for all your devices to specific values\n- Disable touch on speaker and enable status light for all your devices\n- Set the volume of the kitchen and living room to the same value as in the dining room\n- Make an announcement with your individual text in the children's room\n- etc...\n\nEach of these examples, created once, requires only one tap in the widget or on your Apple Watch.\n\nSonoSequencr also includes a restricted mode. This allows you to restrict control to specific devices, among other things.\n\n\nUsing an optional in-app purchase, you can also start sequences at specific times or via external triggers like IFTTT. Of course, this requires that the iOS device is on the same network as your Sonos devices at the time. For intensive use of external triggers, it is recommended to run SonoSequencr in 'server mode'. In this mode, SonoSequencr is always running in the foreground on a dedicated iOS device. SonoSequencr still supports iOS9.\n\nThere are many more features like grid view, create dynamic alarms, HTTP requests, launch other apps, automatic battery charging in server mode, transfer sequences between devices, etc....\n\nYou can only use music (radio streams/tracks/albums) for your sequences that are stored in your Sonos Favorites (My Sonos) or in your TuneIn radio stations. You can't search your entire music library in this app. Just add your most used music to my Sonos then it can be used in your sequences.\n\nThe Timed Sequences feature is only available with an optional in-app purchase 'Premium'. With this automatically renewing subscription, up to 20 sequences can be run at freely configurable times. The function is only active as long as a valid subscription exists. The costs are billed via the iTunes account. The subscription will be renewed automatically within 24 hours before expiration (same time and costs), unless it is cancelled before in 'Settings' -> 'Manage Subscriptions' or in the iTunes settings.\n\nTo use this app you must have a working Sonos system. SonoSequencr supports Sonos software 1 and 2.\n\nFor terms and conditions and privacy policy see:\nhttps://celltekk.de/sonosequencr/help/privacy\n\nThis is not an official Sonos app."

      "label": "Benny Greb, well known for his contributions to the drumming education community, shared the approach that he has taken personally to develop his sense of groove and improve his own timing on his instrument in his course “The Art and Science of Groove”. Now with the Gap Click app, everyone can practice his method easily with a simple-to-use app! \n\nUnlike standard metronomes which simply state the time, Gap Click helps you improve your sense of time. Gap Click is more than a metronome with a focus on improving your ability to keep tempo, become more aware and comfortable with off beat clicks and by that, become bullet proof and accurate with all notes of the subdivision.\n\nGAP CLICK\nBy scrolling through the numbers of bars and patterns you can quickly configure a “gap” of time in which the metronome drops out. When the “one” comes back around, will your playing still be in time? How long of a gap can you play through and still maintain solid tempo?\n\nMOVING CLICK\nNext you can experiment with all kinds of off-beat patterns in the Gap Bar which moves the click from the downbeat position to a different location. Can you still play your instrument and maintain the downbeat internally even when you hear the click sound on an off-beat?\n\nBoth the “click” and the “gap” portion supports a variety of different syncopated patterns allowing you the ability to practice in binary or ternary rhythms - with more or less safety net depending on your settings.\n\nFeatures\n• Ability to choose from a variety of different syncopated patterns and # of measures for both the standard \"click\" as well as the \"gap\"\n• Use the nostalgic click wheel to find the right tempo or tap to set your desired tempo from 10 to 300bpm\n• Standard quarter-note time signatures: 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4\n\nPersonalize\n• See visual feedback for each note or rest that is played\n• Accent beat 1 of each measure or turn accents off for a greater challenge\n• Flash the screen for a visual indication when switching from the \"click\" to the \"gap\"\n• Find your favorite sound from a variety of click samples hand-picked by Benny\n\nBuy Once, Use Forever\n• There are no In-App Purchases - a one time purchase includes all current and future features. \n\nTESTIMONIALS\nWhat professionals are saying about GAP CLICK:\n• \"The skills you can sharpen by using this app are integral for what it takes to be a professional drummer in any genre.\" - Matt Halpern\n• \"When I first opened the app, it made (simple) sense, without a tutorial.\" - Chris Coleman\n• \"This app helps you lock in the pocket on a whole different level.\" - Luke Holland\n• \"The Gap Click app is something that every drummer should have in their toolbox.\" - Jared Falk, Drumeo\n\nWhat our users are saying about GAP CLICK: \n• \"If you think you have good timing, this will really put you in your place.\"\n• \"Gone are the days of programming gap clicks!\"\n• \"I’ve never had so much fun being destroyed in my practice session.\"\n• \"This is by far the best money I’ve ever spent on a practice tool.\"\n\nABOUT BENNY GREB\nBenny Greb is one of the most respected drummers in the world today. Not only has he headlined nearly every major drum festival and toured with his clinics and drum camps worldwide, but he is also recognized as a composer and bandleader in his own band Moving Parts, which won him the renowned “ECHO Jazz” award - the German equivalent to The Grammys in jazz.\n\nBenny Greb published two of the most successful and critically acclaimed educational products, “The Language of Drumming” and “The Art and Science of Groove” and he has helped create many signature products available to drummers today.\n\nFind him online at https://www.bennygreb.de as well as on social media."

On top of OSC over UDP & TCP, we support every type of wired & wireless MIDI connection your device can offer, including MIDI over USB.\n\nCross-Network. Synchronized editing.\n\nMultiple instances of TouchOSC can be connected on the network for synchronized editing. Use the precision of your desktop's mouse and keyboard for fine-grained, detailed editing - test-drive and preview in real-time on all connected touch-screen devices at the same time.\n\nScripting and local messages.\n\nA lightweight and fast scripting engine allows deep access to all aspects of your controller and enables limitless customization and interactivity. For less complex tasks we've added local messages - simply wire up controls to transmit or display values; no need to break out the big (code) guns. Easy.\n\nThis is only the beginning...\n\nWe've supported and updated TouchOSC Mk1 for more than 10 years at this point and we're planning to do the same for this new version. We've already got a whole bunch of features cooking that were just not quite ready yet. There is so much more to come... \n\nWelcome to the next generation!"

      "label": "Enjoy music at a deeper level with realtime visualization! Spectra is a lightweight music & audio visualizer app that allows you to select and visualize audio in realtime, right on your phone or mac. Want to export your visualization? We have you covered. Simply click the \"Create Video\" button from within the app. No longer do you need expensive software to create those beautiful animations you've seen on the internet. Want to customize the background image or put a logo in the center? We made that available as well. In fact, you can customize just about all aspects of the visualizer. You can even import audio files from apps like iMessage or Mail using the share sheet. We want to keep improving the app so If you have any suggestions, be sure to leave a review and tell us what feature you're missing!\n\nThe features:\n• Amazing, 60fps realtime visualization for any audio file, iTunes music (not Apple Music), or Spotify song\n• Video exporting of your audio visualization (does not support Spotify)\n• Custom background image\n• Background presets\n• Background effects\n• Custom logo image\n• Visualizer customization\n• Particle customization\n• Video export settings\n• Video animation options\n• Presets\n• More to come!!!\n\nHere's how it works:\nThe sound we hear is made up of many frequencies. The visualizer decomposes the audio input into its frequencies and displays the lower frequencies at the top/left of the audio spectrum and the higher frequencies at the bottom/right of the spectrum. This can create some cool-looking shapes that all correspond to the currently-playing audio track!\n\nWhether you're a producer that wants to see the frequency range of their song, an audiophile, or someone who wants to take a deeper look into their music, this app is definitely for you."

      "label": "Pure Piano is a professional, multi-sampled concert grand piano with a unique Morph Pad that allows you to explore a multitude of sounds ranging from mellow and intimate tones to surreal, cinematic textures. \n\nSimilar to an XY pad in its flat, tactile nature, the Morph Pad offers up nine different core timbres of the piano including percussive, cinematic, bright, and intimate, to name a few. The “pure” piano sits untouched at the heart and center of the space, surrounded by eight more presets for you to explore as you guide your finger seamlessly through the wide-ranging tonal palette of the piano. As you do so, the various timbres blend together allowing you to create your own sounds comprising combinations of neighboring presets for you to save and recall. It doesn’t stop there either. The Morph Pad is linked to the app’s inbuilt EQ, reverb, and delay and so operates as a macro control adding even more to the experience by way of ever-changing texture and atmosphere, all from just one single piano. \n\nPure Piano works as a standalone app or as an AUv3 plug-in within your DAW of choice, and extensive connectivity options allow you to connect to your keyboard controller with ease via USB, direct, or Bluetooth MIDI to experience the sound of a professional grand piano through your headphones or speakers. The app also supports direct connection to your Mac using Inter Device Audio (IDAM). This enables you to easily integrate Pure Piano into your desktop projects by sending MIDI and receiving audio with one single cable, as well as network MIDI and Inter-App Audio for triggering the piano from other apps that you might have installed.   \n\nEquipped with customizable reverb, EQ, and delay, sound creation becomes even more creative. Simply unlink any of the audio effects from the Morph Pad to dial in your own settings. Maybe you want to add a long reverb tail to add some extra atmosphere, tweak the EQ a little or add some delay to a particular sound. It’s up to you. \n\nIf all that isn’t enough, there’s a host of flexible tuning options for when you need them. The stretched, concert piano tuning is how a piano technician would tune the piano for concerts in order to achieve rich tonal chord textures across the entire range. The equal temperament tuning on the other hand is the standard western tuning scheme, best for when layering Pure Piano with other sounds like electric pianos, pads or strings. Also provided is the ability to transpose the piano up or down in either semi-tones or Hz for fine-tune adjustments. \n\nPure Piano is designed and developed by Hamburg-based e-instruments, renowned for their high-end digital recreations of acoustic instruments. \n\nFeature Overview: \n• Interactive Morph Pad - Explore the many timbres of a concert grand\n\n• Nine different sounds - Navigate and blend between nine core sounds\n\n• Studio Quality Audio at Ultra-low Latency\n\n• Extensive Connectivity - Connect via USB, direct, or Bluetooth MIDI. Inter Device Audio (IDAM), Network MIDI, and Inter-App Audio also fully supported\n\n• Standalone and AUv3 plug-in compatible - Plug and play or use within your favourite music production software\n\n• Zynaptiq QREV Reverb - Have fun adding extra atmosphere and depth to your sound\n\n• 3-Band EQ and Delay - Get creative with customizable EQ and Delay, or use the Morph Pad as a macro control\n\n• Save and Load Your Own Presets - Wherever you land on the Morph Pad, if you like the sound you hear – save it and recall it again later\n\n• Flexible Tuning Options - Choose between equal or stretched tuning, and transpose the piano by semitones or Hz\n\n• Customizable velocity curve - Match the response of your keyboard to Pure Piano\n\n• 24-bit, 44.1 kHz\n\n• 1.1GB installation"

However, those features that it DOES have work GREAT!\n\nIMPORTANT: You cannot use MusicFolder to play music from the regular \"Music\" app. Instead, you use the iPhone's \"Files\" app to copy your folder-based music library from your computer (or anywhere else) into MusicFolder.\n\n- Supported file formats: mp3, mp4, m4a, aac, alac, wav, adts, ac3, aiff, aifc, caf, snd, au, sd2.\n- GAPLESS PLAYBACK for all file formats.\n- Straightforward playlist concept: the playlist always simply consists of all songs in the current folder and its subfolders.\n- Fast interactive PLAYLIST SEARCH.\n- Smart folders that show your most listened to or most recently played songs.\n- GESTURE-BASED CONTROL, no need to look at the screen: swipe up/down to shuffle, swipe left/right to skip, double-tap to play/stop.\n- Interactive SCRUBBING through the current song with the realtime seek bar, including waveform preview.\n- Configurable behavior at the end of a song and on remote control events (headphones / Control Center): skip or shuffle.\n- Simple music library transfer and management using the iPhone's Files app.\n- Optional AUTOMATIC CONVERSION of newly added WAV files to AAC (various quality levels available) or ALAC (Apple Lossless).\n- Full remote control support for headphones and Control Center.\n- Full AIRPLAY support.\n- Supports portrait and landscape orientation.\n- Selecting a photo from your photo library will auto-generate a theme based on the photo's color structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: The app is STRICTLY for FOLDER-BASED libraries and does NOT support ANY kind of tags, cover art, or other metadata inside files. However, for people keeping their music library organized in folders \"the oldschool way\" and seeking a simple, stable, gapless-capable, no-frills portable player, this app is a godsend!\n\nLet us know if you have any suggesions or issues via our support page!"

      "label": "Visualize the fretboard, master scales and play through changes like a pro with intervallic functions! \n\n\n‣ Solo is a revolutionary practice tool designed by world renowned fusion guitarists Tom Quayle and David Beebee.\n\n‣ One of the biggest barriers to improvising on guitar is finding and mapping out the relevant chord tones and scales all over on the fretboard in real time.\n\n\nSolo is a highly focussed app for developing your note finding and visualization ability on the guitar. There is no time-based pressure and Solo reduces the cognitive load of having to choose which ‘notes/intervals’ to play. As you get quicker at finding these ‘notes’ you will conversely get better at choosing them whilst improvising. Players of all ability levels will reap huge benefits from practicing with Solo.\n\n\n‣ Using common progressions, Solo presents you with one chord symbol or scale at a time and asks you to find and play a series of notes based on their intervallic function.\n\n‣ Solo listens to the notes you play, analyzes them in real time, and doesn’t move on until you’ve correctly found each note by its intervallic function in the specified order.\n\n‣ This process builds strong fretboard visualization for the most powerful, efficient and malleable way to KNOW your way around the fretboard no matter how difficult the chord changes are. \n\n\nAs a unique and powerful ear training tool, Solo also develops your ability to not only visualize what you’re playing, but hear it in real time too.\n\nIf you know your note names but struggle to learn new scales, play through chord changes or find yourself stuck in pattern based playing, practicing diligently with Solo will be transformational for your knowledge of the fretboard and subsequently your ability to outline harmony when you improvise. \n\n\n‣ CHANGES PLAYING TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions over a series of chord changes based on common and popular chord progressions. Solo is programmed with all the knowledge behind the scenes to understand jazz and popular music harmony and will always pick appropriate intervallic functions based on the harmony of the progression. \n \n‣ SCALE TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions within scales on the fretboard. Solo includes all the modes of the Major, Melodic Minor, Harmonic Minor and Harmonic Major scales, plus pentatonic and symmetrical scales. Seeing and finding scale tones as intervallic functions will transform your ability to manipulate and improvise with scales in real time.    \n\n‣ TUTORIALS\nSolo also includes video tutorials to get you started with intervallic functions, how to find them on the fretboard, using Solo for ear training and how to get the most from your practice time with the app.\n\n\nNo registration or account required."

      "label": "Handy Recorder PRO is an audio recording app with greatly expanded expandability.\r\nIn addition to the functions of the free version of Handy Recorder, it supports a File browser app and iOS standard sharing function to enhance the convenience of linking with other apps, various cloud services, and PCs.\r\nAs a unique new feature, we have added a \"MOVIE\" function that takes an audio track from a video, applies various effects such as EQ and reverb, and then merges it with the original video.\r\n\r\n◇ Same high-quality sound recorder function as the free version\r\nThe HandyRecorder app allows you to record high-quality audio with your iOS device. Use it with a ZOOM iQ　series mic, which are designed to capture audio of the best quality with iOS devices, and record using the high-fidelity linear PCM and space-saving AAC formats. This app includes normalize and divide functions that can be used on recorded files. In addition, it has compressor, EQ and reverb effects. Moreover, you can directly upload your recordings from Handy Recorder to the iCloud and SoundCloud file-sharing site, allowing you to bring your creations to the world over the Internet. \r\n\r\nFeatures \r\n■ Stereo linear PCM and AAC recording\r\n-You can record files using either high-quality linear PCM format or AAC format at a bit rate of 64, 128 or 160 kbps.\r\n-The AUTO REC function can be used to start and stop recording automatically in response to the input signal level.\r\n\r\n■ Works like a hardware recorder\r\n-The operation screen was designed to simulate a ZOOM hardware Handy Recorder, so this app is as easy to operate as these products.\r\n\r\n■ Effects \r\n-Recorded files can be processed using the included effects. \r\n•6 BAND EQ\r\n•REVERB (ROOM, JAZZ CLUB, CONCERT HALL, ARENA, STADIUM)\r\n•MASTERING (MAXIMIZE, ULTRA MAXIMIZE, CLEAR & POWER, WIDE, MONO)\r\n-Pro+C8cessed recordings can also be saved as separate files. \r\n-Use the NORMALIZE function to optimize the volume.\r\n\r\n■File editing\r\n-In addition to deleting files, you can use the divide function to split files at the point that you want. \r\n\r\n■Uploading to Cloud Services\r\n-The app includes a function that allows you to upload your recordings directly to the SoundCloud audio-sharing site. You can name your recordings and make sharing settings in the Handy Recorder app.\r\n-iCloud drive is supported. Not only uploading selected file manually, but also “Auto Sync” function allows you to upload automatically soon after REC finished.\r\n\r\n■Optimized for the iQ series\r\n-By using the iQ5/iQ7 in MS recording mode, you can adjust the stereo width. \r\n-Select from three iQ5's AUTO GAIN settings (CONCERT, SOLO, MEETING) according to the application.* \r\n-Use the DIRECT MONITOR function to monitor the input signal through the headphones jack on the iQ series without latency \r\n-The left and right channels of the iQ series input signal can be reversed.* \r\n*These setting are saved in the iQ series mic itself and will be applied when using it with other apps. \r\n\r\nFor more information, please visit our website. \r\nwww.zoomcorp.com"

While a chord is played, related chords are highlighted so you can easily find chord sequences that progress smoothly. Once you found a nice chord sequence, you can drag and drop chords into your song to build your composition upon it.\nIf you want to start your song with a melody and find a suitable chord progression, you can do that just as well: select notes and tap the search icon to show chords that match your melody fragment. It's real fun to experiment, seeing how different harmonic contexts affect the perception of the same melodic fragment.\n\n\nCreate Beautiful Melodies and Flowing Chord Progressions\n\nIn the piano roll, notes that are in harmony as well as the chords' root notes are highlighted. This makes it super easy to create leads, arpeggios and basslines and to experiment with different chord voicings to let your chord progressions flowing nicely. \n\n\nIntuitive Editing\n\nA simple, yet feature rich and context-aware user interface helps you build up your ideas into whole songs:\nGroup sections into song parts and arrange them via drag and drop. \nDuplicate, copy and paste, playback selected notes.\n\n\nFile Export\n\nExport and share your creations with audio file export.\nEdit your song in other Apps with MIDI-file export.\n\n\nUse your Favorite Instrument Apps\n\nIt's just more fun to explore and create with those awesome Instrument Apps that are available in the App Store: Klimper supports Inter-App-Audio Instruments like Animoog and Model 15 as well as Audio Unit Instruments like Ripplemaker and Mersenne.\n\n\nVideo Tutorials\n\nThe included tutorial will help you getting started.

      "label": "Alle Texte aus dem Chorbuch für den neuapostolischen Gottesdienst.\n\nDie Chorbuch-App bietet allen Musikinteressierten, Dirigenten und Dienstleitern die Möglichkeit, die Texte aus dem Chorbuch schnell und einfach nachzuschlagen. \n\nDie als 64-Bit-Anwendung programmierte Version 3 greift Bewährtes aus den Vorversionen auf und kombiniert dieses mit intuitiver Bedienung und neuen Funktionen. Dabei wurden gewohntes Nutzerverhalten und aktuelle Displaygrößen berücksichtigt. Und – das Beste zum Schluss – die App kann optional mit zusätzlichen Features ausgestattet werden.\n\nGrundfunktionen:\n\nDie Startseite zeigt nun neben dem Feld für die Nummerneingabe die ersten Textzeilen des gesuchten Liedes. Alternativ lassen sich Lieder über die Rubrikensuche oder über die Volltextsuche auffinden. Standardmäßig findet die Suche auch Wortteile und berücksichtigt bei mehreren Wörtern die Reihenfolge nicht. Die exakte Suche in Anführungszeichen, z. B. \"Der Herr ist\" liefert dagegen nur Fundstellen mit der genau übereinstimmenden Buchstabenfolge innerhalb der Anführungszeichen. Suchergebnislisten können nach Relevanz oder numerisch sortiert werden.\n\nAuf Smartphones wird das gefundene Lied angetippt, der vollständige Liedtext öffnet sich in einem neuen Fenster. Die gezeigte Schriftgröße kann geräteunabhängig in jedem Liedtext vergrößert/verkleinert werden (25-stufig). Zudem lässt sich der Liedtext auf Wunsch negativ darstellen. Die gewählte Einstellung wird beibehalten, bis Sie eine andere Schriftgröße/-darstellung auswählen. Wird das Smartphone bei kleinem Schriftgrad quer gehalten, erscheint der Liedtext im Vollbildmodus und die Schriftgröße wechselt automatisch in einen etwas größeren Schriftgrad. Das ohnehin größere Display von Tablets zeigt alle Informationen zu einem Lied mitsamt der Nummern-/Rubrikensuche komfortabel auf nur einer Seite. Bei Antippen öffnet sich der Liedtext im Vollbildmodus.\n\nPremium-Paket mit zusätzlichen Funktionen:\n\nZu einem besonderen Gottesdienst sollen bestimmte Lieder einstudiert werden? Sie möchten dem Dienstleiter eine Liste der Lieder zuschicken, die Sie selbst als Orgelspieler oder der Chor sicher beherrschen? Oder möchten Sie einen misslungenen Liedvortrag in einer der nächsten Proben aufgreifen? Ihnen gefällt das im Gottesdienst vorgetragene Lied und Sie möchten sich unbedingt die Nummer merken?\n\nDas Premium-Paket bietet Dirigenten, Organisten, Dienstleitern und natürlich auch allen anderen Interessierten nützliche Funktionen, um Lieder zu markieren und Liedlisten bei Bedarf mit anderen zu teilen:\n\n- Suchergebnisse nach diversen Kriterien filtern und sortieren\n- Individuelle Notizen zu Liedern erfassen\n- Termine von Chorproben & Gottesdiensten eintragen, in denen das Lied gesungen wurde (oder werden soll)\n- Persönliche Bewertungen von Liedern erfassen (3-stufig)\n- Lieder als Favorit kennzeichnen\n- Premium-Einträge zu Liedern per E-Mail versenden\n\nDas Premium-Paket wird innerhalb der App per In-App-Kauf angeboten.\n\nSonstige Hinweise:\n\nHörbeispiele oder Musiknoten können aus rechtlichen Gründen nicht in die App eingebunden werden.\n\nIcons: www.icons8.com"

      "label": "SPL is a professional-grade digital sound level meter (decibel meter) for your iPad,  iPhone or iPod touch. It includes all of the modes, filters, and features that you would expect from a professional ANSI or IEC Sound Level Meter. All filters and averaging modes meet or exceed the criteria for ANSI Type 1 standards or better. SPL is created from the same team who brought you the Audio Toolbox and ATB Plus.  \n\nStore Results -- Uses the same powerful Save / Recall engine as our premier app, AudioTools. Allows storing GPS and time-stamped results, and exporting them to your computer.\n\nYou can also use SPL with our calibrated iPhone measurement mic, iTestMic, or iAudioInterface. \n\nThe screen flips if you turn the phone upside down, so that you can point the built-in iPhone mic directly at the sound source.\n\n*** Modes: Slow, Fast, Impulse, Peak, and Leq.\n\n*** Filters: A and C weighting, and 10 octave band filters.\n\n*** Includes a resettable Max field to track the highest reading.\n\n*** Includes a reference field (except in Leq mode) so that you can set a reference level and do seat-to-seat comparisons.\n\nThe SPL meter can be fully calibrated. It comes preset with the calibration for a typical iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch. Most iOS devices will be within a few dB of this reading. If you have access, even temporarily, to a calibrated sound level meter, just use the calibration field on the settings scree to match the meter, and you will be accurately calibrated.\n\nAlso, see our other professional-grade audio apps: AudioTools, our premier suite of professional-caliber audio and acoustics test apps, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and RTA, a real-time analyzer for the iPhone.\n\nAnd, we have a group of calibrated, accurate measurement microphones, including iTestMic,iTestMic2, and iAudioInterface2, that allows full professional results for Type 1 or Type 2 measurements. \n\nThis will allow measuring a range from approximately 30 dB SPL to 130 dB SPL. Each mic will include a calibration factor that you will enter into the SPL app for calibrated measurements. This mic will also work with Speaker Pop, our speaker polarity tester, FFT, RTA, ETC, and other acoustical measurement apps in our AudioTools app that is available now.\n\nAlso, see our iAudioInterface2 system, which supports any pro test and measurement mic. \n\nNow includes an iPhone internal mic compensation filter, to cancel out the low-frequency roll-off present in the iPhone and other iOS devices.\n\nSee our other audio apps, including AudioTools."

The interface includes many standard oscilloscope controls, such as: triggering, time and voltage per division, signal measurement cursors, and more.\n\nThe app incorporates a signal (function) generator capable of generating sine, square, triangle, and sawtooth waveforms of up to 22 KHz. Calibration to an external reference signal is supported, guaranteeing the accuracy of measurements. \n\nInput can be acquired via the built-in microphone or an external mic/probe connected to the headset connector. For best results, use an external audio interface connected to your device dock. This allows for standard audio equipment to be connected, as well as for dual channel input. Oscilloscope probes also be connected (using a BNC connector). When feeding external signals via probes, you should take care not to exceed 1V AC voltage. Currently iDevices support only AC input. \n\nFor up-to-date information on feeding signals and currently supported audio interfaces, please visit http://oa.onyx3.com\n \n\nFeature Highlights: \n● Real-time waveform display (60 FPS) \n● Triggering modes: Normal, Auto, Single \n● Set trigger level and pre-trigger time \n● Dual channel signal generator \n● Reference signal calibration \n● Pause function to get a screen capture \n● Export traces as text file for further analysis\n● Measure signal data using cursors \n● Use \"finger pinch\" on screen to set voltage and time base \n● Double tap screen to enter Black Panel mode \n● Three color themes to choose from \n● XY mode for viewing Lissajous figures \n● Frequency range 20Hz-22KHz \n● iPhone X ready"

      "label": "Brusfri* is a highly advanced audio noise reducer, packed into a simple and straight-forward interface. It is very well suited for cleaning up noisy audio recordings, while retaining sound quality. Unlike many other noise reducers on the market, Brusfri doesn't mess with audio phasing to suppress noise (a technique that often comes with audible side effects). Instead, multiple fine-tuned gates are used to silence unwanted noise.\n\nBrusfri can also be used as a AUv3 plug-in in compatible hosts, for example in GarageBand.\n\n*Brusfri means \"Noise free\" in Swedish.\n\nHere are some examples of sound conditions that Brusfri handles well:\n\n* Guitar amp\n* Noisy vintage gear\n* Boosted pre-amp\n* iPhone/iPad and external mic hiss\n* Room reverb removal\n* Fan noise\n* Background ambiance\n* Mains hum / Electric hum\n\nUsage\n\nIn short, press “Learn” during a couple of seconds of isolated noise to create a \"profile\" for noise. This may be all you need to do.\n\nBrusfri can be used in two ways, either standalone or as a AUv3 plug-in.\n\nStandalone\nImport the audio, either by extracting audio from a video, by importing from iTunes, or by using the “Open In…” option in any other app that can export audio. Press and hold the Learn button (the ear) while playing unwanted noise. (It’s important that the Ear is only fed with isolated noise). When Learn is released, Brusfri will start reducing noise. \n\nAUv3 plug-in\nOpen Brusfri in any AUv3 compatible host.\nFind a region in the recording that only contains noise and play it. \nTap and hold the “LEARN” button for a short while (a second will be enough). When the LEARN button is released, Brusfri will start reducing noise.\n\nThere are a bunch of parameters available that affect the noise reduction algorithm:\n\nATK / THRS / REL (Attack Time / Threshold / Release Time)\nThreshold - basically determines how much noise to be removed. A lower value means more reduction.\nAttack and Release sets the time it will take for the reducer to start working.\n\nLOOKAHEAD\nMakes transient processing a bit smoother.\n\nEDGE\nControls the reduction aggressivity. A lower value gives a smoother reduction.\n\nHPF\nReduces low frequencies.\n\nHIGH\nCompensates high frequencies by boosting them.\n\nMIX\nMixes between dry and noise reduced signal.\n\nNOTE! Brusfri is CPU intensive and iPhone 6 / iPad AIR 2 or better is recommended. When used as an AUv3 plug-in, we highly recommend freezing/bouncing tracks to reduce CPU usage."

Unlock the songwriting tactics used by The Beatles, Bowie, Queen, Michael Jackson, and more.  Learn about seventh chords, embellishments, secondary chords, minor harmony, modes, and modal mixture.  Validated by over 30,000 hobby and pro musicians like you, the Hooktheory Book Series is the best-selling how-to series for musicians for a reason.\n\nHooktheory II isn’t like other music theory books.\n\nHooktheory teaches with an easy-to-understand music format that emphasizes chord and melody function. Rich audiovisual animations play along as you learn. We dissect popular songs and show you how the pros do it.  Immediately practice concepts and tactics with our companion musical sketchpad, Hookpad.  There is nothing else like it!\n\nFun to read. Easy to understand. Full of practical knowledge.\n\nLearn from 84 interactive exercises and 228 audiovisual examples from artists like The Beatles, Elton John, Queen, David Bowie, Michael Jackson, Boyz II Men, Coldplay, Van Morrison, Adele, Ariana Grande, John Mayer, and many more!\n\nIn Hooktheory II, you’ll learn the following skills:\n\n• Composing chords and melody in minor (and other scales).\n• Using chord inversions (reordering chord tones) to create effective bass lines.\n• Using complex chord types (e.g. 7th chords, extended chords, suspended chords, and “add” chords) to enrich your chord progressions.\n• Using secondary chords (chords based on a different key) to create tension.\n• Combining melody and chords from multiple scales (modal mixture).\n• Utilizing songwriting techniques like energy control, deception, and harmonic scope to control listeners' expectations.\n\nBenefits:\n\n• Simple piano roll notation (sheet music knowledge not required).\n• Every concept + technique demonstrated through an actual song.\n• 228 audiovisual examples from artists like The Beatles, Elton John, and Queen.\n• Reinforce learning at every step with 83 exercises.\n• Designed to be used with Hookpad Music Making Software. Hookpad lets you immediately practice every concept and tactic you learn in the books.\n\nTo sum it up:\n\nHooktheory II will teach you all of the essential techniques for crafting effective and compelling chord progressions and melodies. Reading Hooktheory II doesn’t require the ability to read sheet music or any music knowledge outside what was covered in Hooktheory I. On average, it takes about twelve hours to read (but more to fully absorb) so it isn't a huge time commitment. Dedicate only a few days to absorbing this book and gain a lifetime of skills that will give your music that professional edge."

You will see this both on an overview picture of a bass in the middle of the screen, and on a picture of an enlarged position. \n\nYou can select which position to be enlarged. If you tap on this position, the corresponding note will appear on the staff.\n\nBoth by tapping on the staff and on the enlarged fretboard, you will hear te corresponding tone, and the name of the note will appear on the left of the staff.\n\nLastly, you can set the notes on the staff to be sharp or flat, or back to natural."

      "label": "XAir Monitor Mixer is a personal monitor mixer for select Behringer and Midas digital mixers. It allows each musician on stage to choose exactly what they hear in their monitor without affecting (or being able to affect, even by accident) the band's main mix.\n\nXAir Monitor Mixer supports the Behringer X18, XR18, XR16, XR12, and the Midas MR18 and MR12.\n\nXAir Monitor Mixer deliberately does not include controls that would allow a musician on stage to accidentally mute channels or otherwise alter the main mix.\n\nUsage:\n\n1. Connect to the same WiFi network as the XR18.  In most cases, this should be enough for the app to find your mixer. However, if your sound engineer has changed the default address of the mixer, you'll have to enter that address in the app's connection screen.\n2. Choose which monitor you want to mix. If your sound engineer hasn't named these in a way that makes it obvious which is yours, ask him which is yours.\n3. Mix away. :)\n\nIf you have feedback, suggestions, or bug reports, please visit the forums at xairmonitormixer.tetzfiles.com or send an email to xairmonitormixer@tetzfiles.com.\n\nNote: support for mixers other than XR18 was recently added. If you run into any issues, please let us know. Ensuring proper compatibility with all supported mixers is our top priority."

What? How?\n\nThe lexicon: Bassnav can find everything for you. Notes, Scales, Pentatonics, Arpeggios and Chords in every part of your fretboard. Doesnt matter if you´re playing 4, 5 or 6 strings.\n\nDuring more than 25 years of teaching bass I learned about the daily struggle alot of players go through finding the right notes on their fretboard and combining them in a satisfying way. These are the most common questions:\n\nWhere can i find a particular note on my fretboard?\n\nAre the other ways to play this note?\n\nOther positions on my fretboard?\n\nHow do I accompany a certain chord?\n\nMajor 7-Arpeggio? Whats that?\n\nAre there alternatives?\n\nHow do i play a certain scale in a particular part of my fretboard?\n\nI can only play a C-major scale in one position! How can i play it all over my fretboard?\n\nHow can I play this scale/pentatonic when I change the position on my fretboard?\n\nAnd the most important question: How do I build my OWN bass-lines?\n\nFor all these purposes I developed BassNav!\n\nThe lexicon: Bassnav can find everything for you. Notes, Scales, Pentatonics, Arpeggios and Chords in every part of your fretboard. Doesnt matter if you´re playing 4, 5 or 6 strings. BassNav isnt just a normal lexicon for notes, intervals, pentatonics, scales, arpeggios and chords that you could play on your bass. Bassnav helps you in every typical cenario that you could be facing in your daily routine.\n\nThe functions of BassNav\n\n-Find Note: Choose a note and a postion on your fretboard where you want to play it and BassNav will find it for you.\n-Show Shape: lexicon for all notes, scales, pentatonics, arpeggios and chords in all the parts of your fretboard.\n-Touch Note: Touch the fretboard on your display and Bassnav will show you the name of the note you picked and where else to find it.\n-Exercises: BassNav not only offers you the possibility of looking something up and finding it but also of practising and reviewing. Herefore we gathered a lot of usefull tutorials.\n- For every conventional 4, 5 or 6- string bass as also for 5 string basses with a tuning from E to C and every 4 string bass with a tuning from B to D."

It is however possible to edit a single-track tablature with the NotePad tool and export your work into .gpx and .gp formats to finish your composition in Guitar Pro 6 or 7.

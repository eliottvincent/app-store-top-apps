The maps are all contained in the installation so there is no additional need for downloads, no need for phone or wifi signal, no slow server issues, no account signups, no missing tiles, and no additional map fees. Just install for seamless off-line zooming and panning across the whole island down to 1:50k scale. The app also includes 1:50k resolution satellite images for the island, and elevation data.\n\nOther integrated data includes DOC open and restricted hunting permit boundaries, DOC huts, campgrounds, and tracks, Fish and Game access points, and Te Araroa trails. Other datasets can be imported.\n\nThe app has a full suite of navigation functions including GPS location, compass orientation, distance to map locations, track recording and graphing, route creation and following, import/export of gpx and kml files, search functions for named places and user data. Add and edit your own locations and routes and plot elevation profiles. Uses an intuitive simple interface, with one-touch access to all functions.\n\nLINZ TOPO250 series maps are used at lower zoom levels for easier navigation.\n\nPerfect for outback use out of cell phone range. GPS and maps function fully without phone coverage. No need to cache files in advance either as they are all fully installed with the app. Popular with trampers, hikers, runners, bikers, search and rescue (SAR), hunters, boaters, as well as survey applications.\n\nNote that continuous use of GPS will run down the battery faster than when not using the GPS. The NZTopo50 app gives you full control over when GPS is used. The map can be used without GPS, intermittently with GPS for spot checking of location, continuously for logging while the app is open, or for continuous background logging when the phone is off. \n\nCheck our website for links to user guides and useful tips and tricks.\n\nFeel free to get in touch with any suggestions."

      "label": "Theodolite is a multi-function viewfinder that combines a compass, two-axis inclinometer, rangefinder, GPS, map, nav calculator, and geo-overlay photo/movie camera into one indispensable app. Theodolite was one of the very first augmented reality (AR) apps when it was released in 2009, and it’s been downloaded and used by millions of customers since then. Uses are endless, and the app is great for land measurements, outdoor sports, sightseeing, navigation, and finding your way around. Theodolite is a pro grade app and is used extensively by surveyors, geologists, architects, engineers, competitive sportsmen, first responders, military personnel, and search and rescue workers around the world. \n\nTheodolite lets you take data-overlay photos and movies with 2X-8X zoom. Overlay geographical data, angle markings, date/time, author/company info, and project notes directly on photos and movies for later reference. The same data is written into the metadata record of images, making image files self-contained data records. Third-party apps can tap into Theodolite's advanced camera functions with a camera sharing feature.\n\nView current position on the built-in map with optional offline Outdoors maps that include topo contours, roads, trails, landmarks, campgrounds, ski lifts, and more. Live map markers continually update distance/heading relative to the current location and also show wayfinding info in the main viewfinder. Draw polygons on the map to mark things like property boundaries and trails, and import/export polygon data via KML.\n\nShare map markers and nav calculator points with other users of Theodolite via text messages or e-mail. This powerful capability opens up a wide range of collaborative uses including team land surveying, accident investigations, spotting wild fires, triangulation of landmarks, and advanced tactical observation and targeting. With an optional in-app purchase to enable team tracking, you can share location with up to 20 people on Theodolite's map.\n\nTheodolite includes features for serious users like a reference angle mode, nav calculator, map marker import/export, manual and automatic data logging with CSV and KML export, clipboard integration, %grade display, mil compass readout, optical rangefinders (including a mil-based reticle, sniper-style stadiametric graphs, and a variable 4X-24X scope), and night filters to improve use in dark conditions.\n\nTheodolite can provide location in military grid reference system (MGRS) coordinates, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, British/Irish National Grids, US National Grid, Maidenhead locator system, Map Grid of Australia, and six latitude/longitude formats. Optional US State Plane coordinates include SPCS27 and SPCS83 zones covering all US States. The optional Datum Pack adds over 230 geodetic datums to the app to improve position computation from GPS data, covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.\n\nAR Layers include navigational aids like the sun, moon, planets, and Polaris (North star), and the optional US Mountain Summits layer that shows over 70,000 US mountain summits in the viewfinder.\n\nTheodolite has been shown in Apple Keynotes, featured on the App Store, and has been a #1 selling Navigation app in App Stores around the world. Since its introduction in 2009, Theodolite has defined augmented reality navigation. The app continually introduces new technologies, pushing the limits of iOS app development and taking advantage of new hardware capabilities.\n\nFind out why Apple named Theodolite one of the most amazing apps available and showed it being used to explore the Great Wall of China. Where will you take it on your next adventure?\n\nNote: Theodolite is an iPhone app -- see “Theodolite HD” for use on an iPad. And be sure to check out the all-new \"Theodolite for Watch\" and put Theodolite on your wrist!"

The app offers conversions for the Swissgrid coordinate system in Switzerland and for various WGS84 formats. Furthermore, the typed coordinates or the current location can be displayed on the map. The map needs an internet connection. In addition, the app offers various tools such as ASCII, numbers to letters, text to numbers, rotation, bearing and distance between two coordinates, prime numbers checker, waypoint projection with current position, Roman numerals, temperature units, number systems, Wherigo Reverse solver, tool for Multi-Cache with calculator.\nSwissGEO Tools was in 2012 the first app which had interactive code tables. The big collection of interactive code tables continues to be an important part of CacheToolBox. Outdoors, you can decode the encrypted messages smartly with the \"symbol keyboards\" which were displayed in plain text without any Internet connection. CacheToolBox now also offers the opposite way: simple encryption of plain text by keyboard in symbolic characters!\nThere are currently 108 code tables available.\nIn future, more tables and tools will follow in free updates! \n\nSummary of all functions of CacheToolBox:\n\ncurrent location\n\n- coordinates WGS84 DD.DDD°\n- coordinates WGS84 DD° MM.MMM°\n- coordinates swissgrid CH1903+\n- Indication of altitude\n- GPS accuracy\n- show location on map\n- copy coordinates from current location and insert within the app\n\ndiff. maps: Swiss Map® and OSM (automatic switching)\n\n- Swiss: Swiss Map@ scaling 1:25’000 with the option to show hiking trails\n- other countries: OSM\n- resolution of map: low – normal - high\n\ncoordinates conversion\n\n- convert WGS84 DD.DDD°\n- convert WGS84 DD° MM.MMM’\n- convert WGS84 DD° MM’ SS.SSS\"\n- convert swissgrid CH1903+\n- coordinates switching N-S and E-W\n- show location on map\n- copy/paste coordinates and insert within the app\n- share current position by mail, message, WhatsApp\n\ncode-tables\n\n- 108 interactive code-tables for decoding symbol characters\n- symbol keyboards decodes encrypted messages directly to letters\n- simple encryption of plain text by keyboard in symbolic characters\n- no internet connection needed\n- more code-tables will follow in free updates!\n\ntools\n\n- ASCII\n- morse code\n- numbers to letters: 0=A, 1=A, 26=A\n- letter to numbers: sum, digit sum, alternated, product\n- rotation: rot5, rot13, rot18, rot47 and shift by hand (caesar)\n- distance and bearing between two coordinates\n- prime numbers: check prime numbers, prime factorization, search prime number\n- waypoint projection: WGS84 with degree or artillery per milles, distance in meter or feet (english)\n- Roman numerals: convert Roman to arabic or vice versa\n- temperature units: celsius – kelvin – fahrenheit – rankine - réamur \n- number systems: binary – decimal – octal – hexadecimal and more\n- Wherigo Reverse solver\n- Tool for Multi-Cache with calculator\n\nInfo\n\n- settings\n- conversion unit length: meter – feet (english)\n- rate app\n- legal notice\n- link to support website\n\nlanguages\n\n- English\n- German\n- French"

      "label": "Poison Maps (“POIs on Maps”) is the ultimate app for finding Points of Interest anywhere in the world.  It includes millions of POIs and routes, all stored on your device for use even when offline. \n\nThe app contains every possible category of POI: food, hotels, banks, toilets, fuel stations, tourist attractions, leisure, parking, shops, hills, towns, transport, hospitals, churches, schools, libraries, civic buildings, rescue services, and much much more.  \n\nIt also contains 4 million miles of colour-coded routes, such as railways, subway maps, bus routes, cycle routes, hiking trails and ski pistes.  The POIs and routes are all taken from the fantastic OpenStreetMap project. \n\nThe app includes many unique features:\n\n• a toolbar at the bottom of the screen that allows you to display what you want in just 2 or 3 taps;\n• signs pointing to offscreen POIs, so that you never miss a nearby POI;\n• compass, radar and scanner modes that display the nearest POIs in different ways;\n• a unique gesture that allows rapid panning by temporarily zooming out (using 3D Touch when available);\n• back and forward buttons that help you retrace what you have looked at (like on a browser);\n• an Apple Watch app that shows what you want in only a few taps (or just one tap of the complication);\n\nCompass mode simply shows signs to the POIs. This is particularly useful when you just want to know what is around you or which way to head, and you haven’t got time to inspect a map, such as when cycling or hiking. It also works offline and is perfect for people who hate maps: they just follow the sign to where they want to go.  It is also great at viewpoints to identify what hills, towns and structures you can see.\n\nRadar mode and Scanner modes are similar but also include a map that rotates around the current position. They include radar “rings” to show the distances from the current position.  Scanner mode uniquely positions the GPS dot at the bottom of the screen so that you can see much more information in the direction that you are pointing.\n\nThe unique panning gesture requires just one touch of one finger instead of the multi-finger gymnastics required by the traditional “pinch to zoom” approach (although that is still available). It also provides a quick way of zooming out and back in again when you are not sure what area the map is showing.  It is a brilliant and completely original use of 3D Touch but also works fine on iPhones without it (using a long touch).\n\nThe Apple Watch app also allows you to select any category in just a few taps.  When you have selected a category then the nearest POIs are shown on a mini-map with the details listed below. The watch app also provides navigation to a POI, and you can even phone a POI from the watch!\n\nThese are just some of the unique aspects of the app. All the usual map features are also provided, such as super-fast searching, directions, bookmarks, POI information, favouriting of brands, and much more.  You can even create your own POIs, such as where you parked your car.\n\nNote: This is the full global version – if you want to give the app a try first then please click on the 'Related' link above and install one of the regional versions.  Not only can you try the app for free, but these versions only take up about the same space as 2 or 3 music albums."

Organise them in mosaics and favourites. \n   · Zoom in to see gas stations with their prices, cameras and speed cams\n\n- GAS PRICE:\n   · Find gas stations on the “Traffic Map” (zoom in) or in “Routes” (they are ordered by price in each route you have created)\n   · Prices updated every minute\n   · Tap and hold for a second on the “Traffic Map” to find nearby gas stations ordered by price.\n   · Configure in settings how much you would like to deviate from your route to find cheap gas (cheap gas stations aren’t placed in main roads), a second gas type, and with how much zoom they are shown on the “Traffic Map”\n   · Create your gas station favourite list to check their prices easily\n\n- MORE:\n   · Choose the tab where the app is initiated according to what you use more: Warner, Traffic Map, or Routes.\n   · Warn your friends of problems in the road via WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, e-mail, iMessage,…\n   · Traffic Alarms to remember checking the traffic and avoid traffic jams\n\n- The paid version (the “pro”) includes everything, it doesn’t have ads or in-app purchases. The free one has one in-app purchase which enables the automatic update of speed cams (the speed of speed cams is not shown on the Watch without this in-app purchase, although a general warning is given), enables CarPlay, removes the ads, and allows to chose dark/light mode independently of the iPhone settings. If you buy it, you would have the same functionality of the paid version.\n\nNOTES:\n\n- To use the Warner you need your device to have a GPS integrated: all iPhones have it, iPod and iPad WiFi do NOT have it (iPad 3G DOES have it). The rest of the functionality (routes, traffic, gas price) works in any device.\n\nATTENTION! The Speed Cam Warner uses your GPS. Continuos use of the warner in fore or background can drain your battery quickly."

      "label": "“Awesome!!! The best speed app on iphone” 5 Stars by kurtonic\n\nSpeed Box is a Speedometer and GPS app for both your iPhone and iPad. It displays your current speed, distance, direction and altitude along with your top speed and average speed. The app also keeps a record of the speed and altitude for the last few hours.\n\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n========================\n\n* MPH, KM/H and KNOTS\n* Show decimal speed (e.g. \"45.7 mph\")\n* One app for both the iPhone and iPad\n* \"Speak speed\" - Tap screen to have the speed spoken to you\n* 11 Analog and digital speedometers\n* Map view\n* Maximum and average speed\n* Altitude \n* Digital compass \n* HUD display to see speed in windshield \n* Odometer to measure distance traveled \n* Chart of the traveled speed and altitude \n* Warning signal when driving too fast \n* Export last 3 hours of data \n* Change maximum displayed speed on speedometer \n* Swipe finger over chart to display historic data \n* Display GPS accuracy by tapping the indicator in the top left corner \n\n\nUSER REVIEWS\n========================\n\n5 Stars by Darekakuta \n\"Just what I needed. My '58 chev's speedo doesn't work. This did the trick.\" \n\n5 Stars by Rawd \n\"Great My 79 Firebird speedo only goes to 140 kmh. ;). This worked perfectly.\" \n\n5 Stars \n\"Within 1 mile per hour +/- Great Job!\" \n\nSpeedBox was one of the very early Speedometer Apps for the iPhone. Take advantage of my experience and the refined algorithms that can get a much greater accuracy from the iPhone then a lot of other apps. I regularly update my application to make it even more accurate and usable. \n\nUsers have already used our application to verify the accuracy of their car's speedometer or they tried measuring the speed they achieved while skiing. Can you come up with more ideas? How about measuring the speed of the airplane you travel with? \n\nUSAGE NOTES\n========================\nThe \"GPS strength\" indicator in the top left corner should display a green dot. You can tap this indicator to display the current GPS accuracy.\n\nPlease allow the application up to a minute to find enough satellites to work correctly. \n\nIf you get a message to enable GSP, please go to ”Settings > General > Location Services“ on your iPhone and check if the little switch is set to \"On\" for Speed Box as well as for \"Location Services\" in general. \n\nATTENTION iPod touch users! Unfortunately this app doesn't work very well on the iPod touch and the iPad WiFI (without 3G) since these devices are missing a GPS!\n\n\nFEEDBACK\n========================\nIf you've got any wishes or suggestions for new features, please let me know with the contact form on this application's website (see link below).\n\nI am already working on the next update!"

      "label": "Ship Finder shows live moving ships on a worldwide map. The intuitive design combined with incredible performance puts you in control. Watch in full screen, view in AR, search, add filters and so much more!\n\nShip Finder has been top rated and top ranking since 2009 and covers most of the world, tracking 20,000+ ships simultaneously.\n\nOur incredible app performance means that you can see all tracked vessels at once - no clustering here!\nSimply tap a ship to see its name, type, photos, speed, dimensions and much more.\nPowerful features such as filters, search and the ability to save favourite ships are included. (You can choose Apple or Google maps too!).\n\nAdd and browse bookmarks to saved locations around the globe to quickly navigate to areas or ports of interest.\n\nYou can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. \n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer, GPS tracker and trip cost monitor for iPhones and cellular iPads. \n∙∙ When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! \n∙∙ The cost monitor shows you the current cost of the journey as you drive and tells you each passengers share. \n∙∙ GPS tracker records your trips so they can be analyzed, viewed and shared at any moment.\n\n‣‣ COST MONITOR. What's the cost of my driving?\nBased on gas price for a gallon or litre, MPG (U.S. or UK) or liters per 100 km the app will tell you what the cost is as you drive. You can add an extra cost per kilometer or mile! Useful for all cost aware drivers and for splitting the cost between passengers.\n\n‣‣ GPS TRACKING. Where I've been? How long did it take to get from A to B? \nSpeedometer records your trip statistics even when GPS tracker is switched off. When you need point by point data to see on the map later or export (Google Earth and GPX), speedometer gives you the first class GPS tracker.\n\n‣‣ INFOTAINMENT. \nWhen switched on, infotainment shows trip stats or weather/wind forecast  when you wait. Way better than just showing you a 0 speed!\n\n‣‣ Easy to set speed limits and SPEED LIMIT MEMORY option\nSet speed limits with 4 or 8 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! With SPEED LIMIT MEMORY you just apply the speed limit once and the app applies it for you automatically the next time!\n\n‣‣ MODES\nUse MENU>MODES to turn the app into a Rally computer, G-Force monitor, Camera alerter or taximeter! Currently there are 12 modes available and we are constantly adding new ones.\n\n‣‣ WAYPOINTS.\nSpeedometer gives you the unique way to leave a note with location and even optional photo or audio note attached! As easy as double tap on the big speed digits! You'll find more in a documentation section (star button).\n\n‣‣ RED LIGHT & SPEED CAMERAS\nImport camera data into speedometer in Garmin or iGO csv formats from poi-factory.com, scdb.info or poi-plaza and let speedo alert you on a camera approach and set speed limit automatically before you pass the speed camera!\n\n‣‣ SUNSET/SUNRISE\nWith the sunset and sunrise information that our speedometer provides, you'll be able to avoid driving in the dusk.\n\n‣‣ BARO VSI. Barometric Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI, IVSI) in both scale and graph forms.\n\n‣‣ VOICE COACH. When enabled and configured, voice coach will be telling you active track distance and duration as well as current speed and altitude.\n\n‣‣ MAPS. Google's native, Apple map, Blank map and Offline maps.\n\n‣‣ Siri shortcuts: New Track, Stop Track, Speed limits.\n\n+ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and cellular iPads. All in retina graphics.\n\n+ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KM/H AND KNOTS. Maximum/TOP, average speed, distance traveled.\n\n+ BACKGROUND MODE! Speedometer will work in background if told so and will still warn you with audio alert when exceed a preset speed limit. You can use other apps while speedometer does its job in the background!\n\n+ PRIVACY. Speedometer never shares your location data with 3rd parties or ad agencies. Location data is used solely for tracking your speed and recording the GPS tracks and never leave the app unless you decide to share by means of a track export. It always let you know when background mode is on and never runs in background unless it is explicitly told to do so.\n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone as well as on any cellular iPad. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS (external GPS module is required). \n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nDrive safely, keep the log and notes and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal companion no matter what journey you are going on!"

      "label": "Do you have maps that you would like to use offline on your iPhone/iPad with GPS positioning? Discover Multiplans, a powerful map application in which you can import your maps (whatever their source) and view them offline with a great multitouch experience and pinpoint accurate GPS positioning. Multiplans can moreover record tracks and save points of interests. \n\nMultiplans has been designed to offer a great map viewing experience: simple uncluttered interface, map shown full screen (a single tap toggles on/off the display of overlay information), ultra-fast scrolling and zooming. \n\nWith Multiplans, you don't have to buy again maps that you already own, just to use them on your iPhone. No subscription either that will soon expire. To use a map on your iPhone/iPad, simply transfer the map image into Multiplans (with a .map or ref.txt calibration file if you have one). Maps can be also calibrated entirely within Multiplans by defining graphically calibration points on the map.  \n\nA few sample maps are provided with Multiplans: a world map, a map of Switzerland, etc. A few more maps can be downloaded free of charge from www.multiplans.net. Multiplans is compatible with almost all coordinate systems used in the world. To import your own maps into Multiplans and have accurate GPS positioning, the map needs to be calibrated (see www.multiplans.net). Maps from OpenStreetMap (for any region in the world), as well as maps from similar mapping web sites, can be imported into Multiplans very easily by using the free program mobile atlas creator.\n\nVisit www.multiplans.net for more information.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n- Continued use of the GPS running in the background can dramatically reduce battery life on the iPhone or iPad.\n- Multiplans' features, including map and location accuracy, should not be depended upon in situations where inaccuracies or errors could cause danger, commercial loss or any other problem. Though we did our best to make Multiplans an excellent app, it is provided as is with no warranty."

Sei il benvenuto.\nPrima di partire, però, devi sapere che in molte città italiane, a differenza di quelle europee, esistono delle zone urbane in cui è impossibile accedere con l'automobile. Le Zone a Traffico Limitato (ZTL) sono sorvegliate dai vigili urbani e protette da telecamere che controllano gli accessi. Alcune di esse sono in funzione 24 ore su 24, altre vengono aperte agli automobilisti solo per alcune ore al giorno.  Se per caso dovessi accedere in una di queste zone, saresti costretto a pagare una multa che va dagli 80,00 euro ai 335,00 euro. Lo sappiamo, ti sembrano cifre assurde ma in Italia le regole sono queste.\nNon preoccuparti più del dovuto, però!  Scarica ZTL Italia e parti sicuro e informato. \nQuest'app è l'unica che contiene una mappa aggiornata con tutte le ZTL d'Italia. Facilissima ed attendibile, funziona come un navigatore. Grazie ad un sistema di allarme personalizzato, ogni volta che ti avvicinerai ad una ZTL una voce ti avvertirà in tempo e ti dirà se la zona è aperta o chiusa. Puoi avere ZTL Italia anche nel centro notifica del tuo smartphone o Tablet perché include il widget. \n\nVisita l'Italia senza brutte sorprese, scarica ZTL Italia e buon viaggio!\n\n*** Ultimo aggiornamento varchi: 29 Marzo 2017 ***"

Tasks like making a projection from a waypoint, determining a new waypoint using two other waypoints, determining the distance to these waypoints, calculating the value of a Roman numeral, and averaging waypoints are examples of what the toolkit can accomplish.\n\nImagine it’s lovely weather and you are walking in a beautiful surrounding. Walking with an intention, because you are geocaching and searching for caches.\n\nPicture you are at waypoint 3 of a multi cache and you’re asked to go to waypoint 4, which is 300 meter from this waypoint and 700 meter from the previous waypoint. Now what? Go home? Imagine you have a skilful toolkit with you to find your way. Imagine you have iGCT PRO, because you want to be ready for all these kind of challenges.\n\nBuy it now for a fixed low price (no in-app purchase necessary), since you never know if you have internet access the moment you need it most!\nThe choice is yours.\n\nComplete feature list:\n\nList of waypoints\n=================\n- Averaging a number of GPS readings for accurate coordinates\n- Manage a list of named waypoints\n- Search/filter list of waypoints\n- Show overview map with all (filtered) waypoints\n- Manually add a new waypoint\n- Edit latitude, longitude in WGS84, degrees, DMS, UTM, Dutch/Swiss XY\n- What3words\n- Compass navigation to selected waypoint\n\nCalculations\n============\n- Project new waypoint using distance/bearing\n- Distance/bearing between two known waypoints\n- Cross two wp/bearing lines\n- Cross wp/bearing line with circle around other wp\n- Cross two circles around 2 waypoints\n- Determine wp with same distance to 3 other waypoints\n- Cross two lines, each line connects two waypoints\n\nText to number\n==============\n- Calculate the sum of the character values in one or more words, the sum of all digits in this sum and finally sum the digits once more to typically arrive at one digit.\n- Choose between a=1, b=2 etc., the inverse a=26, b=25 etc. or the phone numbering abc=2, def=3 etc.\n\nEn/Decrypt\n===============\nVarious encryption and decryption methods typically used in geocache descriptions:\n- Rotate characters by N positions\n- Caesar (Rot13)\n- Morse\n- Vigenere \n\nNumbers\n=======\nConvert between these number systems:\n- Roman\n- Decimal (base 10)\n- Binary (base 2)\n- Hexadecimal (base 16)"

The meter movement is smooth and realistic.\n\nSee your current altitude in both analog and digital displays simultaneously.  Both displays can be configured independently to show either Meters or Feet.\n\nThe altimeter can be adjusted, similar to an actual unit, by touching the \"Adj.\" knob on the analog display.\n\nAlso includes a pop-up display showing all information coming from the iPhone GPS, including latitude, longitude, speed, heading, and horizontal/vertical uncertainty.\n\nThe altitude information comes from your device's internal Barometer or GPS, which is somewhat limited.  If you use the barometer, there will be variations due to atmospheric conditions.   If you use the GPS technology, it will only work outdoors, with a clear view of the sky.   The altitude reading may be hundreds or even thousands off and may take a minute or two for the GPS to lock on to the satellites.  This program is intended for entertainment and/or educational purposes only.\n\nThis program will only work on a device which has a GPS.  Barometer mode requires a device with a barometric pressure sensor. \n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "This app puts the Mayan Dreamspell Calendar in your pocket! \"13:20:Sync makes it so much easier to understand and integrate the calendar into every day life. Highly recommend it.\" \n\nThe Mayan People have described, in breathtaking precision, the cycles of both the universe and nature around us. They created a harmonic calendar that is synchronized to all those cycles. Following these cycles can help you get a stronger connection with nature around you and become conscious of your essence.\n\nThis app provides a simple way to sync along those cycles, to raise our frequency and give us a new lens to view both our day-to-day and planetary events.\n\n- Did you ever realize that our (Gregorian) calendar is not a harmonic calendar? \n- Did you know that the moon has 13 (not 12!) orbits around the earth in 1 year? \n- Why do we live with this irregular calendar?\n- Are you interested in Astrology?\n\n-> All this, and more, is explained carefully in this app. (over 15.000 words on 37 pages) Please note that these text are in English language only.\n\nIn the New Time, synchronicity is the norm.\n\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n5 star rating across the world! \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\"Entertaining as well as enlightening\" \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\nMORE INFO: \nwww.1320sync.com \n\n\nFor the beginner this app is a learning tool because it contains an extensive explanation about Tones and Seals and the synchronizing order of the Mayan Astrology. You may think it's difficult at first but soon you will feel how it all connects. \n\n\"This app is great, and allows easy manipulation of dates. I spent years in books doing in hours what I can now do in seconds.\"\n\nFor the ones who are already familiar with the Mayan Calendar this app is a handy tool to navigate the cycles, and calculate the Combined Kin for any given combination. Furthermore this app can be of great assistance to teach other people about the 13:20 cycles and is used in teachings around the world.\n\n\n=== FEATURES ===\n\n+ Kin Calendar\nThis is your main Mayan Dreamspell Calendar Dashboard with all the details you need to stay in sync. Shows the Kin of today by default, and you can calculate the Kin for any other date.\n\n+ Personal Notes\nOn this new page you can keep your personal notes for the 2 main cycles of time: the Tzolkin cycle of 260 days and the 13 Moon cycle of 365 days. And with the powerful text search function you quickly find your notes.\n\n+ Kin Picker\nSelect any combination of the 13 Tones and 20 Seals. Top section can scroll to 4 pages with information.\n\n+ Combined Kin Calculator \nCalculate the Combined Kin of any combination of Kin. You can add as many Kin as you like to calculate the Combined Kin for a group of people. \n\n+ Tzolkin with indication of the GAP day's and Wavespell and more. Tap and hold to select a Kin number directly.\n\n+ Contact Import \nAll contacts in your Contacts App will be automatically imported and assigned to the correct Kin. See all your contacts with their Mayan Reading and how you relate to them. \n\n+ 13 Moon Calendar \nFull integration of 13 Moon Calendar. (doubles as a birthday calendar!) \n\n+ 13:20 Information \nLots of information about the theory behind synchronization to help you navigate the Mayan Dreamspell Calendar. The texts provide a clear explanation of the Cycles of Time. (More than 15.000 words on 37 pages) Please note that these text are in English language only.\n\n+ Sharing\nOn all the 3 main tabs you can share the current selected Galactic Signature using your favorite app. \n\n\n# Based on the work of José Argüelles.\n# This app was made with permission of and in cooperation with the Foundation for the Law of Time - www.lawoftime.org, \n# Ariel Spilsbury."

      "label": "More infos at gps-tracker-tool.de (support url).\n\nWHAT IT'S NOT\n- You can NOT track other phones with this app! This is a \"remote control\" for one of the dedicated hardware GPS trackers from the list of compatible models.\n- You cannot send SMS from iPod/iPad devices. However, you can still use the LIVE tracking features.\n\nMAJOR FEATURES\n- app will draft SMS commands for you - no need to carry around the tracker's manual\n- built-in compass for off-road navigation to tracker location\n- offers cell triangulation as fallback\n- reverse geocoding\n- administration of multiple trackers\n- visual set-up of geo-fence\n- configurable unit system (mi, km/h – m, ft)\n- quick commands = easy accessible custom commands\n- in-app purchases to enable the LIVE tracking features for some models: Trip history, trip start & end alerts, speed alert, geo fences, KML export\n\nINCOMING SMS\nYou just copy the whole incoming SMS and switch to the app. It will then try to match it against known formats. All data can then usually be visualized on the map. Please understand that iOS DOES NOT ALLOW to intercept incoming SMS automatically! Some tracker models can be monitored via the internet.\n \nSUPPORTED TRACKER MODELS\nAnywhere (TK 108),\nAsta (EV07S*),\nELRO (GPS1),\nConcox (GT02, GT011, GT 100),\nIncutex (TK 5000*, TK 104, TK 105*, TK 106, TK 116),\nmeitrack (VT 310 v6, VT 310 v7),\nPAJ* (Allround, Easy, Gold, Motorcycle, Mini, Personal, Power, Professional),\nSimvalley (GT 60, GT 170, GT 280),\nTKstar* (Bike, 720, 816 OBD, 901, 905, 909, 915),\nToplovo (TL 202),\nWonde Proud (SPT 10, VT 10),\nXexun* (TK 101, TK 102, TK 102-2, TK 102v6, TK 103, TK 103-2, TK 104, TK 106, TK 201, TK 201-2, TK 202, TK 203, TK 206, XT 009)\n* InApp live tracking via Internet for these models possible. After you made the tracker connect to the server, the feature can be activated with an InApp purchase.\nModel names might not always be unique amongst manufacturers, so if your tracker came with a manual, you can check for compatibility here: https://gps-tracker-tool.de/compatibility/ (see also support-url)\n\nKNOWN PROBLEMS\n- Please note that while you can send iMessages, you cannot send SMS from an iPad or iPod and therefore you would have very limited functionality on these devices. Still, an iPad would be a good choice for the LIVE tracking part.\n- Since iOS 10, short messages which contain links will be broken up into two. This makes copying a whole message impossible. You might have to miss out on the app's ability to visualize an incoming message from certain trackers.\n\n(If you experience any problem or have a feature request, please send us an e-mail. You find the address in the app's help section.)"

      "label": "BlindSquare is pioneering accessible navigation both indoors and outdoors. Know where you are, know where you're going, travel with confidence.\n\nBlindSquare is a new solution that combines the latest technology to help the blind with their daily lives. It has been developed in collaboration with blind people and carefully field tested. You need either an iPhone or an iPad to get started. It also supports some additional accessories to enhance the experience. \n\nHow does it work? \n\nBlindSquare uses GPS and the compass to locate you. It then gathers information about the surrounding environment from FourSquare. BlindSquare has some unique algorithms to decide what information is the most relevant and then speaks it to you with high quality speech synthesis. \n“What's the most popular café within 200 meters radius? Where is the post office or the library?” \n\nYou can control BlindSquare also through voice commands. The Voice Command feature is a premium service requiring purchase of credits for continuous use.  Voice Command Credits are available as an in-app purchase on the App Store.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a GPS solution:\n\nWhen you start the app, it will start telling you the interesting places and street crossings around you. By changing the radius, you can limit the area you are interested in. You can also search by search term or by category. You can select an interesting place from the search results and perform the following tasks:\n\n1) Get contact info (address, phone number) \n2) Open twitter feed or restaurant menu (if provided)\n3) Make a phone call\n4) Start tracking the place (BlindSquare will assist you by repeating the distance and the clock face direction)\n5) Start your favourite navigator for turn-by-turn instructions (TomTom, Navigon or Apple Maps)\n\nBlindSquare is aware of when you travel by car, bus or train and starts to report interesting places in front of you (for example, the next stops) and street crossings when you are passing them.\n\nYou can also save your own private places to iCloud so they will be found with your every device.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a Foursquare client:\n\nIf you like to play Foursquare, you can do the following with BlindSquare:\n \n1) Get a list of nearby FourSquare venues\n2) When you are in a place, you can check in by shaking your device\n3) Do a check in with commenting and twitter/facebook sharing\n4) Correct the location of the place\n\nBlindSquare supports the following languages: English, Arabic, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean (South Korea), Norwegian, Polish, Portugues, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\nVoiceOver usage is supported but it also includes higher quality additional speech synthesis by Acapela Text-To-Speech from Acapela Group.\n \nInstructions in English: https://www.blindsquare.com/user-guide/ and https://www.blindsquare.com/faq/\n\nPlease note: This app retrieves data in real time from Foursquare and Open Street Map. Use of a flat rate data plan is highly recommended.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nHaving only been released in May 2012, BlindSquare has already received several prizes and awards:\n\n - GSMA: Global Mobile Awards 2013, Best Mobile Health Product or Service\n - Apps4Finland 2012\n - OpenCities App Challenge 2012\n - The Finnish Information Processing Association: Best Product 2012\n\nPlease note: To use BlindSquare, your iCloud account has to be active so BlindSquare can access it to save your settings and places.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

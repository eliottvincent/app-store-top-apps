Featured in Apple's \"Amazing Apps\" TV commercial.\n## Staying focused with the cutest gamified timer. \n## Over 800,000 real trees were planted on Earth by our users.  \n\n\"Forest works well, and if your goal is to be more in the moment, ignore your phone and actually talk to your friends when you are with them, this is the app for you.\"— The New York Times \n\n\"In order to establish new, better habits, it's helpful to engage with tools that make it easier to reinforce them. For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

You can also see the current weather and an overview of the current month at a glance.\n\nIntuitive Controls \nIntuitively navigate through your calendars and quickly, easily add events and tasks thanks to predefined settings and simple controls. Standard settings like repeating events and reminders/alarms are just a tap away. And powerful special settings are also available, without sacrificing comfort or control. Swipe through views and open events or days with just a tap.\n\nmiCal Understands You\nQuickly create events with the new natural language input feature. Natural language input allows you to create events just by describing them. And if you have Siri enabled on your device, you can even dictate your event details instead of typing.\n\nThe Total Package\nmiCal provides complete, well-organized day, week and month views and displays the calendar week in all the important views.\n\nRelax\nYou don’t need to contort yourself with miCal. miCal supports portrait as well as landscape formats in nearly every view.  Use each view however it’s most comfortable for you.\n\nTasks/Reminders\nmiCal now supports iOS reminders. Create reminders for all the important tasks in your private and professional life right in the app.\n\nBirthday Manager\nNever again miss an important birthday. Get reminders at preset times featuring the music of your choice.\n\nNice Weather\nFive-day weather forecasts plus the sunrise/sunset times, humidity and wind speed for the current day. The dashboard even features a quick summary of the current weather as well as a brief forecast of the coming days.\n\nComprehensive\nmiCal offers a unique range of features. Copy, move or send your events. Export your events in the date range of your choice as CSV (for Excel, etc.) or ICS (the calendar format). Set colors for your calendars and individual appointments or automatically add colors based on keywords in event titles.\n\nUp to Date and Secure\nmiCal communicates with your device’s integrated calendar. miCal works with  all the calendar services that your device currently supports (iCloud, Google Calendar, Outlook, Exchange, Facebook Events, subscriptions) without requiring additional configuration. That way, you can store your data locally or via the services you know and trust—it’s up to you. miCal itself does not transmit any data to external services or other servers. That allows us to ensure 100% data security.\n\nAward-Winning\n- 3rd place in the \"Best German iPhone App\" competition at the 2010 iPhone Developer conference.\n- Featured as App of the Week in 13 countries.\n- Recommendation from iPhoneWelt and a 5-star rating from iPhone&Co, two of the leading iPhone magazines\n- Honored at the 2010 App Developer Conference"

TaskTask directly connects with your Office 365 Business, Exchange on-premises, or Google tasks to keep your full task list in sync between Outlook and your device. Everything is tracked, include all the advanced properties you can see in Outlook. Best of all TaskTask includes flagged items (email!) so you can see your complete task list on the go.\n\nUsing TaskTask, you can manage your to-do list, create tasks, set start/due dates, mark complete, assigning categories, change importance, set and receive reminders, and delete tasks. An Exchange Server or Office 365 account is required to synchronized tasks with Outlook. No additional software is necessary. TaskTask works with Gmail directly, although in a limited fashion.\n\nKey Features:\n- Simple interface, quickly create new tasks and mark tasks completed\n- Set task attributes, such as category, importance, start/due/complete dates, and notes\n- Synchronize your task list with your e-mail account (no hidden fees or software to download)\n- Quickly swipe to complete or delete a task \n- Easy set up with automatic configuration of your server\n- Drag-to-order your tasks, see the same order in Outlook\n- Recurring tasks and reminders\n- View attachments on your tasks and attach files from other apps\n\nHow is TaskTask better than Reminders?\n- See your task list how you prefer: organize by start date, due date, category, importance, or reminder date.\n- Reorder your tasks just by dragging them around\n- Full category support, including downloading your list of categories and colors from your Exchange Server.\n- See tasks in the same order as Outlook's To Do Bar\n- Task filters: filter out tasks in the future or tasks you don't want to see on your mobile device\n- Flagged mail items: See the full list of items from your To Do Bar, not just tasks\n- Quick Task Entry: Type a list of task subjects quickly in one space, and TaskTask automatically creates the set of tasks\n- Mark tasks as private: Hide tasks from others who have visibility to your task list\n\nNote: To synchronize your tasks with Outlook, your email account must be on a compatible Microsoft Exchange Server or Office 365 Business account. Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 and newer versions are supported, although there may be additional factors that prevent TaskTask from working with your server. \n\nIf you are using Mail.app or Microsoft Outlook 2011 (Macintosh) with your email account in \"Exchange\" mode, TaskTask is compatible with your server. Because there are specific requirements for your server, please verify with your e-mail administrator that your server meets these requirements before purchasing this app."

      "label": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

Retro Keyboard brings that retro feel back - this time on Apple Watch!\n\n\nSUGGESTIONS\n\nAs you’re typing, you can complete words using the Suggestions bar above the keys.\n\nTap on a suggestion to replace the current typed word with the full suggestion. Great for improving speed on the small screen!\n\nAccess all suggestions by tapping the ellipsis icon next to the first two suggestions.\n\n\nOTHER CHARACTERS\n\nRetro Keyboard has full support for adding symbols, numbers and other special characters.\n\n\nEMOJI\n\nUnlike the built-in Messages app, Retro Keyboard supports adding an unlimited amount of emoji to a single message!\n\nSimply select the emoji you’d like to add from the emoji picker and it’ll be appended to your message.\n\nYour top 10 most recent emoji will even be suggested the next time you tap the emoji button.\n\n\nMESSAGE PREVIEW\n\nBefore sending your message, just tap the text field to view a full preview of your message.\n\n\nSENDING\n\nRetro Keyboard uses the built-in Apple Messages app on your Apple Watch to send messages to your contacts.\n\nType out your message, tap the send button and you’ll be taken to the Messages app with your message ready to go!\n\n\nHAPTICS\n\nChoose to receive Haptic Feedback on actions like key presses and button actions.\n\n\nCOMPLICATION\n\nFor quick and easy access, you can add the Retro Keyboard Complication to your Watch Face. Just tap and the keyboard will launch.\n\n\nAUTO CLEAR\n\nAfter typing out your message and sending to a contact, you can choose to automatically clear the keyboard so you don’t have to clear it yourself.\n\nIf your message gets cleared, you can easily get it back by holding down on the text field.\n\n\nCURSOR\n\nWhilst typing on the Full keyboard, you can see exactly where you are with the pulsing blue cursor.\n\n\nSETTINGS\n\nCustomise Retro Keyboard your way.\n\nAccess the Settings menu by using the options button on the keyboard and you’ll be able to toggle settings like suggestions & haptic feedback.\n\n\nAPP STORE\n\nNo need to install the iPhone app, you can get Retro Keyboard directly from the App Store on your Apple Watch.\n\nTroubleshooting steps are available on iPhone.\n\n\nGet in contact:\n\nEmail: info@adamfoot.dev\nTwitter: @adamfootdev\nWebsite: https://adamfoot.dev\n\n\nPlease note, a supported Apple Watch is required for full app functionality. Currently, sending messages in the Apple Watch app only supports the built-in Apple Messages app using iMessage or SMS."

      "label": "CalenGoo gives you a fast and easy way to access and modify your Google Calendar with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. It can also be used when you have no Internet connection, using the cached data. Changes are saved and uploaded the next time you are connected.\n\nThe calendar view is similar to the web view of Google Calendar. Events are displayed using the same calendar colors that you use in your Google Calendar, even Google's event colors are supported (please see http://www.calengoo.com/cc ). It also recognizes which calendars are visible and which are hidden. So the view should match the view of your Google Calendar as much as possible. \n\nCalenGoo also has a month view similar to that of Google Calendar. It can be zoomed and panned to quickly get an overview over the events of a month. Zooming the month is done by using the two-finger-zoom gesture that you know from Safari and the photo application. A double tap opens the tapped day.\n\nIt also supports the same kinds of recurrence rules as Google Calendar and displays recurring events correctly even when you are offline or scroll far into the future.\n\nYou can also use Google Calendar's feature to invite people to events and see their status (accepted, declined, maybe, no answer). They will get an invitation email with links to e.g. accept or decline the invitation.\n\nGoogle Calendar has an integrated task list, called Google Tasks. Tasks with a due date are displayed on the corresponding days of the calendar. CalenGoo can do the same, it can sync this list, display your tasks in the calendar views and in a list view and it even makes your tasks available offline.

Its advanced simulation engine can handle both analog and digital circuits and features realtime always-on analysis. It is the perfect companion to students, hobbyists, and engineers.\n\nYou use it as you would any CAD program: you add elements, connect them together, and set their properties.\n\nBut iCircuit is unlike other CAD programs because it is always simulating. It's just like working with the real circuit. You do not stop to take a measurement or spend a lot of time configuring reports. Instead, you just play with the circuit as you normally would, with the power on!\n\nThere are over 70 elements you can use to build your circuits. The app has everything from a programmable Arduino, to simple resistors, to switches, to MOSFETS, to digital gates.\n\nThe app features a multimeter that you use to probe around the circuit to instantly read voltages and currents. If you want to see how a value changes over time, then you can add values to the built-in oscilloscope. The scope can simultaneously track many signals over time and features a touch interface to control the total time displayed and stacked and unstacked modes to easily compare signals. The scope can also display the Fourier transform of any signal so that you can see the performance of filters.\n\nSupported elements include:\n\n• Programmable Arduino using a subset of the C programming language\n• Signal generators, Voltage sources, Current sources, and Dependent sources\n• Resistors, Capacitors, and Inductors\n• Manual SPST/SPDT and DPST/DPDT Switches, Push buttons, and Relays\n• LEDs, Diodes, BJ Transistors, and MOSFETs\n• Audio simulation with Speakers, Microphones, Buzzers, DC Motors, and LEDs\n• ADCs, and DACs\n• Logic gates: AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR\n• JK and D Flip-flops\n• 38 7400 series digital parts \n• 78xx and LM317 voltage regulators\n• 7-segment display and driver\n• Antenna with simulated AM and FM signals\n\nYou can also create sub circuits to introduce new elements and componentize your designs.\n\nNo matter your skill set, you'll be playing with circuits in no time with iCircuit."

      "label": "Notebooks is a writing app, a text and markdown editor, your personal Wiki and Zettelkasten, a file organizer, task manager, PDF and eBook creator and more. This may sound like a lot, but consider you have a few text fragments, randomly created, which you want to combine into a chapter of a book and saved as PDF or eBook; or a quick note sparks off an idea, generates a couple of tasks, each of which requires you to organize further research material; or you have business related documents which need to be separated from private diaries, records and files. – With Notebooks you handle these jobs easily without switching apps, and while remaining focussed and creative.\n\n• Notebooks stores all your documents as regular files in standard formats. You are always in control of your documents, never need to worry about how to export them, and they remain compatible across devices and over time.\n\n• Create formatted documents with styles, attachments, tables or checklists, and add a table of contents if you like. Choose between a variation of ready made document styles, or create your own, if you want.\n\n• Write your documents in plain text and allow Notebooks to automatically handle lists, highlight and center the current line on screen, automatically insert closing characters for  (, {, [, \" and more. - Plain text is a universal format which can be used on any device without any specific software.\n\n• Use Markdown to create formatted documents from plain text. Notebooks supports *MultiMarkdown* and its own flavor of *Discount*.  – Click any word in a formatted Markdown text and start writing at that position. You can even create checklists (- [ ]) and tick them off in formatted view. Syntax highlighting and a set of dedicated extra keyboard keys make Markdown editing easy.\n  \n• Use your Apple Pencil to sketch ideas or annotate images and PDF documents.\n\n• Use Notebooks' advanced editing capabilities to work on documents which are stored in other apps.\n\n• Compile selected documents or the contents of whole books into a single document, an eBook or a PDF document.\n\n• Link between documents in Notebooks. In Markdown you can even use Wiki style links ([[ ]]). When clicking a link to a document which does not yet exist, Notebooks suggests to create it. And when you move or rename documents, Notebooks makes sure the links remain intact.\n\n• Create as many books as you need to structure your projects and details. Nest books as deep as you like, there is no limit in Notebooks. If you ever loose track, Notebooks' full text search helps you quickly turn up even the most hidden document.\n\n• Turn books into task lists to display document as tasks which can be ticked off. Assign due dates and alerts, and divide projects into nested sub projects, which makes them easier to handle. \n\n• For simple lists you can use checklists in formatted documents and Markdown.\n\n• Assign Context tags to books and documents to create shortcuts that are accessible for a smart book at Notebooks' top level. – Notebooks can even extract context tags from the contents of documents as you create them.\n\n• Import all documents and files you want to keep close at hand, no matter whether PDF, email, web pages, MS Office or iWorks, photos, videos, music and more.\n\n• Scan documents and extract text using OCR (iOS 13)\n\n• Sync files between iPads, iPhones, Mac or PC. \n\nWith all that, Notebooks may quickly become your one and only app for everything you want to keep close at hand.\n\nUser Comments: \n\n“Notebooks is a wonderful App, which is so much better than the dozen other note apps I tried. It is sophisticated, in an unassuming way, so that you find yourself greatly rewarded and being productive without sacrificing time/effort to the App. I cannot tell you how much productivity I have gained.  I am having a huge amount of fun, I use it constantly, more than the phone on my iPhone in fact.\" \n\n“You are GTD in every way that makes it efficient and makes me efficient.”"

      "label": "TimeStamps makes it easier to have a look at your working hours and overtime. No more guessing when you come to work or when you have gone on a business trip - from now on, your personal time sheet is always with you.\n\n+++ Staff Pick July/August 2011 and January/February 2012 in the German App Store +++\n\nONE-BUTTON OPERATION\nIn the frontend you always set a time stamp with the same big button. It remembers which time stamp you have used recently and suggests the next stamp type. That's why the next time stamp will be working time when you've had a break before.\n                                               \nKEEP YOUR WORKING TIMES ALWAYS IN SIGHT\nThe frontend display allows you to display different states: current time, working time, break time, etc. You can change the display type with a single tap. Also, the expected end of work is displayed and updated on the fly.\n\nFLEXTIME ACCOUNT\nTimeStamps offers a flextime account for overtimes. Including starting balance, correction factor for each week and Days of in Lieu to get rid of overtime. And in case you don't need a flextime account, it can be switched off in the settings.\n\nAUTOMATIC BREAK\nSpecified in TimeStamps' settings of the default work week, the default break can be automatically deducted as the minimum break at the end of a day. If the break time is exceeded, of course, the larger value is taken. Whether the automatic pause is applied is shown by a symbol within TimeStamps.\n\nEXTENSIVE BACKEND\nIn the backend all time stamps are listed in different views. New time stamps can be added, deleted or existing ones can be altered.\n\nTAGS\nEach time stamp can be assigned a tag from a self-created list. Each tag can of course be changed later, hidden, modified in order or deleted. Coming soon is also a new type of export, who has the ability to choose specific tags.\n\nWORK-FREE DAYS\nUsing the backend, you can set work-free days - holidays, leave days, days of in lieu and sick days are an integral part of TimeStamps. On these days, you do not have to work, so there will be no default work and break time. However, TimeStamps does not prevent that you still record times. So you can still work on holidays or leave days and keep track of it with TimeStamps.\n\nSTATISTICS\nIn the weekly and daily time stamp view, TimeStamps provides small statistics for a better overview. \"How much overtime I've done this week?\", \"How long have I been on a business trip?\" - The statistics provide the kind of information you want.\n\nREPORTS\nVarious reports can be created of all time stamps. You can specify any time period and send reports as HTML or CSV to one or more e-mail addresses. These report configurations can be reused later.\n\nSETTINGS\nNot everyone is working from nine to five, five days a week. So the work and break time for each day of a default work week is definable to the minute. Also working without a break is possible with a single click. The setting of default times can later be changed individually for each day.\n\n\nTHANKS FOR THE SUPPORT\nIf you like TimeStamps, please tell your colleagues, friends and relatives! And we are always thankful for a a positive rating in the App Store.\n\nQuestions, comments and suggestions are always welcome, too. Please use our support e-mail address: support@timestampsapp.com"

Some functions will be available only for accounts set by installers registered to the platform with multi-level structure.\n \nWhat can e-Connect manage?\n- EL.MO. intrusion detection systems  based on Villeggio, PREGIO, HERCOLA, ETR G2, TITANIA, NET and TACÓRA control units.\n- DVRs, NVRs and IP cameras of e-Vision PRO series.\n- Domotic systems associated to EL.MO. units\ne-Connect can also manage several systems through a single account simultaneously: home, office, holiday houses.\n\nWhat can e-Connect do?\nUsing smartphones and tablets it is possible to control systems status, receive notifications (also referred to InstaVision video verification for an immediate video monitoring upon events occurrence), enable/disable intrusion detection devices, display CCTV systems images (live both single and multichannel, and playback) or manage domotic systems. With regard to the chronothermostat, it will be possible to adjust the temperature and control its working mode from a remote site. \n \nInstaVision Video Verification\nInstaVision is a new e-Connect function for video verification that optimizes the synergy between EL.MO. intrusion and fire detection systems and CCTV e-Vision® PRO systems. It allows receiving real time notifications about one of its security systems and verify its condition immediately. When an event occurs (ex. intrusion attempt) InstaVision allows displaying live images, images recorded at the exact time of the event, and images recorded a few seconds before the occurrence of the event directly from e-Connect app. Such function enables to control whether the event is a false alarm or a true intrusion or fire event in which case a prompt intervention will be possible. Images are not recorded to third-party servers, but directly to users DVRs and NVRs so to reduce to zero personal data breach risks and to shorten dramatically system response time.\n \nHow is e-Connect interface?\ne-Connect features a complete but intuitive control panel. Main icons provide a quick view of the system status, while a convenient side menu grants an easy browsing of e-Connect menu pages. Systems interactive graphic maps allow managing devices and retrieve cameras images view.\n \nHow is power combined with security?\ne-Connect features a Cloud Server structure that includes all control units connected to the network. The use of SSL communication protocol combined with certificates issued by international Certification Authority bodies grants an outstanding security level.\n \nEasy setup and P2P \nThe configuration of e-Connect app and its association to security equipment such as control units and NVRs/DVRs is an easy operation also thanks to P2P connection to EL.MO. proprietary server.\n\nFor web browser version, visit http://connect.elmospa.com website.\n\ne-Connect app performs a regular automatic check of the purchase licence validity; in case of errors, please download the most recent version available on Play Store."

GDPR compliant.\n* Synchronization of Safes between iPad, iPhone and Mac with iCloud or Wireless (without Internet)\n* Simple and intuitive usability, no technical knowledge is needed\n* Security made in Germany\n* Strong encryption with AES-256.\n* All files in a Safe are encrypted\n* Touch ID and Face ID supported\n* Files in a safe are also encrypted in iCloud Backup\n* Organize your files as you like it (create folders, rename, copy, move, duplicate, trash, delete files)\n* Picture Viewer and Slide Show in Full Screen mode\n* Show file content for Microsoft Office and iWork, PDF, RTF, TXT, Images, Text, Videos, Audio ...\n* Mark files and folders with tags or as Favorites for quick access\n* Add files from any App which supports Action Extensions or Document Provider Extension\n* Export files by using Share-Button or Document Provider Extension\n* Number of files and size is only limited by the free space of your device\n* Unlimited number of Safes\n* Add photos and videos from photo library directly from the App\n* Take encrypted photos or capture videos directly from the App and store them securely\n* Create and edit text files\n* Comment files\n* Create recovery password\n* Screen protection when in background\n* Access files in Safe from the Files App\n* View files in list or icon view (previews)\n* SimpleumSafe helps you to technically implement the required protection of documents with personal data in accordance with the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)\n\nWHY CHOOSE SIMPLEUMSAFE?\nNowadays it is not enough “only” to encrypt your data to be protected. If you want to view or organize the encrypted files, they also must be protected. SimpleumSafe goes a different way than most other encryption programs. After authorization with a password, the files are not provided in the file system. Otherwise they would be completely vulnerable from this moment on. SimpleumSafe makes its own file system and has its own finder. Thus the files remain encrypted for the entire time.\n\nSYNCHRONIZATION\nSimpleumSafe was developed with Extreme Secure Synchronization - continuously encrypted. Even if the synchronization data was stolen from the cloud and the password became public, it is not possible to decrypt the data."

Define your own custom shorthand abbreviations and they’ll instantly be replaced as you type with the longer texts they represent, saving you time and effort.\n\nCreate and store snippet abbreviations on your iPhone or iPad and gradually build up your own custom shorthand library for quickly jotting things down. Store as many notes as you like to use and reuse later. These can be emailed, messaged and shared straight from within the app, or copied to the clipboard in a couple of taps.\n\nInstall the bundled TypeIt4Me Touch keyboard extension and quickly bring it up in any app to access long snippets of frequently used text. Addresses, email signatures and boilerplate paragraphs stored locally or in iCloud will always be right at your fingertips. Use them in Mail, Safari, Messages or anywhere else you can type. (NB: the keyboard extension is for on-screen typing only. Bluetooth hardware support is limited to composing notes in the app itself.)\n\nEver wished you could use your Mac TypeIt4Me abbreviations in iOS? This is the app for you. If you use TypeIt4Me 6 (or TypeIt4Me 5.4.x from the Mac App Store) and you keep your abbreviations in iCloud, you can use them on your iPhone and iPad. They will be available in the TypeIt4Me Touch app and keyboard as long as you’re signed in to iCloud. You can also add new snippets and sync them across all your Macs and iDevices. \n\nIf you’re still using TypeIt4Me 5.5.3 (or earlier versions for Mac) downloaded directly from the Ettore Software website, automatic iCloud syncing of your abbreviations between Mac and iOS is not available. However, you can still use snippets created on your Mac. Just email your Mac TypeIt4Me snippet set files to yourself and open the attachments in TypeIt4Me Touch on your iPhone or iPad to import your abbreviations.\n\nWith TypeIt4Me Touch installed on your iPhone or iPad, greetings, common phrases, boilerplate texts, URLs or even large chunks of programming code can all be just a couple of prods away. Enjoy :)"

It also lets you go even darker - a convenient way to further adjust brightness without going to control center.\n\n~ SAVE YOUR EYES & SLEEP ~\n   Stop getting blinded by bright white websites. Reduce eye strain, get better sleep with Berry's dark, beautiful browsing and interface. It even works with Night Shift, allowing you reduce blue light at night while browsing.\n\n~ INCREASE BATTERY LIFE ON IPHONE X ~\n   On iPhone X, browsing with Berry can extend your battery life because darker pixels use less power. For other devices, increasing the contrast between text and background can allow you to lower your screen's brightness, saving battery.\n\n ~ PRIVACY FIRST & ADBLOCK ~\n   Automatically blocks ads and trackers to speed up websites up to 2x and protect your privacy. One tap to instantly clear all of your browsing history and data. Built in Private Tabs mode.\n\n ~ TODAY WIDGET ~\n   Copy links and tap the widget to browse them peacefully in Berry. Link previews are only visible when your device is unlocked, to protect your privacy. Also, instantly get to your favorites (in dark mode) from the lock screen, bypassing the home screen.\n\n~ THUMB-FRIENDLY NAVIGATION ~\n   All of Berry's controls are at the bottom, not the top of the screen, so you don't strain your thumb trying to navigate the web - or worse, drop your phone trying to tap the search bar.\n\n ~ DARK KEYBOARD ~\n   Activate the included Berry Dark Keyboard to further reduce the brightness of the screen when you're typing. You can use it in any app, not just Berry.\n\n~ AND TONS MORE FEATURES ~\n   - Dark Reader Mode\n   - One universal app for both iPhone and iPad\n   - No in-app purchases or subscriptions\n   - No advertisements\n   - iCloud synced bookmarks\n   - iCloud Keychain password autofill\n   - Works with 1Password\n\n~ The Berry Simple Privacy Policy ~\n - We NEVER collect any personally identifiable information about you.\n - We NEVER collect or use any of your personal data for any type of marketing or advertisements. We don't use cookies or any other mechanism to track anything about you personally.\n - Basically, we don't make money from you other than your one-time payment for the app. You are not the product. You buy and own the app -- not the other way around.\n\n~ Reviews ~\n\n\"This app is incredible! Seriously so impressed! Dark mode has always been something I’ve been interested in and this browser does that beautifully. The simple design is great and I even love how the tutorial doesn’t make me complete actions before continuing. Def going to try get used to using this app and maybe replace chrome with it! It’d be cool if I could exit out of the search input keyboard by tapping outside of it as opposed to having to hit “close” but that’s just nitpicking. Money well spent!\nEdit: also just had to add that I’m LOVING the bottom placement of the address/search/toolbar it’s perfect on an iPhone X, I don’t have to adjust my grip to hit it and I get the added benefit of a gorgeous looking web site without a clunky tool/search bar hanging above it.\"\n -- jobsebastian\n\n\"I’m liking it a lot the more I use it, glad I purchased it and looking forward to updates.\"\n -- nproductive\n\n\nSend questions, comments, feedback to:\nhello@berrybrowser.com"

Simplifying our lives makes us less stressed and more productive. Having tasks fed to you one by one allows you to maintain focus on completing just a single task. To top it all off, shuffling makes completing tasks fun and motivating.\n\nSHUFFLING\nTaskBox’s unique algorithm allows weighted shuffling. With priorities set on your tasks, higher priority tasks will have a higher chance of being selected for you to complete first.\n\nDESIGN\nEvery element and detail of TaskBox is designed to enhance user experience. Minimalistic in design, the app creates zero burden, even goes as far as to lighten up your day.\n\n\"Productivity is never an accident. It is always the result of a commitment to excellence, intelligent planning, and focused effort.” - Paul J.

Also mark the accessories (screws, fittings, etc.) with the assigned identification number for easier retrieval and assembly.\n- If you are packing boxes at different locations, for example, you can create separate moving lists for the different locations and define an individual identification letter for each location. This way you can always identify where a package comes from.\n- For each package, the transport status – „still at the old location“, „loaded“,“ at the new location“ – can be easily recorded and updated. This gives you an overview of the status of your move at any time.\n- On moving day, you can use the dashboard or printable lists to easily tell the movers where to take each package.\n- The extensive search and various filter functions support the management of the move.\n- Save the move lists to iCloud, Dropbox or an sftp server so that multiple users can also use and maintain the move lists."

Podium Timer Pro is ready-to-go for individuals, and can be instantly upgraded for use by event staff or AV professionals to synchronize and remotely control one or multiple iOS devices from a single iOS device wirelessly (BluetoothLE-capable devices required).\n\nWhether you are giving a talk, presentation, speech, or lecture, Podium Timer Pro replaces your wristwatch on the podium with something you can actually read and that helps you pace your delivery.\n\nPodium Timer Pro lets you easily configure the length of your talk (up to 99 minutes) as well as the lengths of the three time periods that let you know the end is near. Podium Timer Pro comes with beautiful “skins”, and for each of these looks, you can pick the number colors and effects that are most appropriate for the lighting at your venue.\n\nIn addition to the standard countdown timer, Podium Timer Pro also displays the elapsed time as well as the current time. All views can be seen with just a simple swipe of a nervous finger, or Podium Timer Pro can even automatically cycle through the different timers.\n\nYou can also include messages or reminders to yourself (or send to others after upgrades) during the talk without missing a beat.\n\nIf your job is to time someone's speech, Podium Timer Pro will even keep track of the elapsed time when you (quietly) receive a text message, a calendar reminder, or even a phone call!\n\nAs requested by users of our previous apps, Podium Timer and Podium Timer HD, the following features have been added to Podium Timer Pro,\n• Runs on any iOS 9.0+ device (e.g. \"universal\")\n• 13 alert sounds configurable for the end of each phase of the talk\n• Show or hide timer descriptions depending on lighting\n• Flash or do not flash time when talk is running overtime\n\nWith either In-App Purchase upgrade,\n• Any BluetoothLE-enabled device can act as either the controller/master or as a synchronized clone (e.g. iPhone controls iPad, iPad Mini controls iPhone)\n\nWith the Single-Sync upgrade (for smaller events),\n• One iOS device can synchronize and control ONE other iOS device\n\nWith the Multi-Sync upgrade (for AV professionals and large rooms),\n• One iOS device can synchronize and control MULTIPLE other iOS devices"

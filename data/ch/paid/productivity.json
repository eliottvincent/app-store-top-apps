For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

You can also see the current weather and an overview of the current month at a glance.\n\nIntuitive Controls \nIntuitively navigate through your calendars and quickly, easily add events and tasks thanks to predefined settings and simple controls. Standard settings like repeating events and reminders/alarms are just a tap away. And powerful special settings are also available, without sacrificing comfort or control. Swipe through views and open events or days with just a tap.\n\nmiCal Understands You\nQuickly create events with the new natural language input feature. Natural language input allows you to create events just by describing them. And if you have Siri enabled on your device, you can even dictate your event details instead of typing.\n\nThe Total Package\nmiCal provides complete, well-organized day, week and month views and displays the calendar week in all the important views.\n\nRelax\nYou don’t need to contort yourself with miCal. miCal supports portrait as well as landscape formats in nearly every view.  Use each view however it’s most comfortable for you.\n\nTasks/Reminders\nmiCal now supports iOS reminders. Create reminders for all the important tasks in your private and professional life right in the app.\n\nBirthday Manager\nNever again miss an important birthday. Get reminders at preset times featuring the music of your choice.\n\nNice Weather\nFive-day weather forecasts plus the sunrise/sunset times, humidity and wind speed for the current day. The dashboard even features a quick summary of the current weather as well as a brief forecast of the coming days.\n\nComprehensive\nmiCal offers a unique range of features. Copy, move or send your events. Export your events in the date range of your choice as CSV (for Excel, etc.) or ICS (the calendar format). Set colors for your calendars and individual appointments or automatically add colors based on keywords in event titles.\n\nUp to Date and Secure\nmiCal communicates with your device’s integrated calendar. miCal works with  all the calendar services that your device currently supports (iCloud, Google Calendar, Outlook, Exchange, Facebook Events, subscriptions) without requiring additional configuration. That way, you can store your data locally or via the services you know and trust—it’s up to you. miCal itself does not transmit any data to external services or other servers. That allows us to ensure 100% data security.\n\nAward-Winning\n- 3rd place in the \"Best German iPhone App\" competition at the 2010 iPhone Developer conference.\n- Featured as App of the Week in 13 countries.\n- Recommendation from iPhoneWelt and a 5-star rating from iPhone&Co, two of the leading iPhone magazines\n- Honored at the 2010 App Developer Conference"

      "label": "CalenGoo gives you a fast and easy way to access and modify your Google Calendar with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. It can also be used when you have no Internet connection, using the cached data. Changes are saved and uploaded the next time you are connected.\n\nThe calendar view is similar to the web view of Google Calendar. Events are displayed using the same calendar colors that you use in your Google Calendar, even Google's event colors are supported (please see http://www.calengoo.com/cc ). It also recognizes which calendars are visible and which are hidden. So the view should match the view of your Google Calendar as much as possible. \n\nCalenGoo also has a month view similar to that of Google Calendar. It can be zoomed and panned to quickly get an overview over the events of a month. Zooming the month is done by using the two-finger-zoom gesture that you know from Safari and the photo application. A double tap opens the tapped day.\n\nIt also supports the same kinds of recurrence rules as Google Calendar and displays recurring events correctly even when you are offline or scroll far into the future.\n\nYou can also use Google Calendar's feature to invite people to events and see their status (accepted, declined, maybe, no answer). They will get an invitation email with links to e.g. accept or decline the invitation.\n\nGoogle Calendar has an integrated task list, called Google Tasks. Tasks with a due date are displayed on the corresponding days of the calendar. CalenGoo can do the same, it can sync this list, display your tasks in the calendar views and in a list view and it even makes your tasks available offline. You can edit and add tasks and the changes will be synced with Google Tasks.\n\nYou either need a (free) Google Calendar account to use this app or you can use it with your iOS calendars. However using it with Google Calendar has a few advantages.\n\nTo get more information, screenshots and a tutorial, please go to http://www.calengoo.com\n\nIf you have any problems or suggestions, please send an email to calengoo@dgunia.de or take a look at CalenGoo's support website to get help.\n\nIf you think the font is too small and hard to read, you can increase the font size of all calendar views in the settings under \"Settings\", \"Display and Use\".\n\nFeatures ( http://www.calengoo.com ):\n\n- Drag&drop to quickly copy and move events\n- Templates to quickly create similar events again. They can even be combined, e.g. one template for the location of an event and another for the attendees\n- Print/PDF function to print the day, week, month or agenda view via AirPrint or to email it as a PDF file\n- Supports the same recurrence rules as Google Calendar\n- Supports Google Calendar's event colors when syncing via OAuth2\n- Icons can be assigned to Google Calendar events\n- Date/time can be entered using the iOS wheels or by using a keypad\n- Fast search function\n- Show/edit iOS calendars in addition to Google calendars (or instead of Google calendars)\n- Sync with Google Tasks and iOS Reminders\n- Reminders can be snoozed and they can be (optionally) repeated every minute\n- Birthdays and anniversaries of your contacts can be displayed\n- Zoomable month view, which can be configured to scroll horizontally (month by month) or vertically (week by week)\n- Events can be linked to contacts\n- Floating events and completable events\n- Photos and PDF files can be created and attached to events (via Google Drive)\n- Calendar selection bar to quickly show and hide single calendars\n- The location of an event can be opened with Apple Maps, Google Maps, Navigon, TomTom, Skobbler, Sygic, iGo or Waze\n- View/edit calendars that are shared with others via Google Calendar\n- Many configuration options to change the way the app looks and works"

Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nGet Started\n• Interactive tutorial project\n• Keep each manuscript and supporting materials in a self-contained project\n• Import Word, RTF, Final Draft and plain text files\n• Easily split imported text into separate sections\n\nGet Writing\n• Write your manuscript in sections of any size\n• View all sections as a single text using the “Draft Navigator” (iPad only)\n• Quickly navigate sections using the “binder” sidebar\n• Format with fonts and presets\n• Comments, footnotes, links and highlights\n• Simple bullets and lists\n• Insert images\n• Pinch-zoom to resize text\n• Full-screen mode (iPad only)\n• Typewriter scrolling mode keeps typed text center-screen (iPad only)\n• Write a screenplay using scriptwriting mode\n• Live word and character counts\n• Set word and character count targets\n• Find and replace\n• Customizable keyboard row provides quick-access buttons for formatting, navigation and punctuation\n• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for external keyboard users\n• Dark mode\n\nFind Your Structure\n• Write in any order and reorganize later\n• Write a synopsis for any text section and see it in the outline\n• Expand, collapse and drill down into sections of your project\n• Rearrange sections as index cards on the corkboard (iPad only)\n• Project-wide search\n• Track ideas using labels and status\n• Apply custom icons to your sections\n\nRefer to Research\n• Import research material such as image, PDF and media files\n• View research files or other sections right alongside your writing (iPad only)\n• Every section has its own notes area for jotting down ideas\n• Supports multi-tasking split screen mode (supported devices only)\n\nShare Your Work\n• Compile to a single document for sharing or printing\n• Use different formatting in your exported or printed document\n• Export to Word, RTF, Final Draft, PDF or plain text\n• Convert rich text to Markdown for sharing with Markdown apps\n• Create and email zipped backups of your projects\n\nWork Anywhere\n• Use Dropbox to sync between devices and with the macOS and Windows versions of Scrivener*\n• Copy projects between devices via iTunes\n\n* Requires a Dropbox account (not compatible with iCloud).\n\nSUPPORT\nYou can contact us at ios.support@literatureandlatte.com, visit our forums at http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum, or find us @scrivenerapp on Twitter."

      "label": "Notebooks is a writing app, a text and markdown editor, your personal Wiki and Zettelkasten, a file organizer, task manager, PDF and eBook creator and more. This may sound like a lot, but consider you have a few text fragments, randomly created, which you want to combine into a chapter of a book and saved as PDF or eBook; or a quick note sparks off an idea, generates a couple of tasks, each of which requires you to organize further research material; or you have business related documents which need to be separated from private diaries, records and files. – With Notebooks you handle these jobs easily without switching apps, and while remaining focussed and creative.\n\n• Notebooks stores all your documents as regular files in standard formats. You are always in control of your documents, never need to worry about how to export them, and they remain compatible across devices and over time.\n\n• Create formatted documents with styles, attachments, tables or checklists, and add a table of contents if you like. Choose between a variation of ready made document styles, or create your own, if you want.\n\n• Write your documents in plain text and allow Notebooks to automatically handle lists, highlight and center the current line on screen, automatically insert closing characters for  (, {, [, \" and more. - Plain text is a universal format which can be used on any device without any specific software.\n\n• Use Markdown to create formatted documents from plain text. Notebooks supports *MultiMarkdown* and its own flavor of *Discount*.  – Click any word in a formatted Markdown text and start writing at that position. You can even create checklists (- [ ]) and tick them off in formatted view. Syntax highlighting and a set of dedicated extra keyboard keys make Markdown editing easy.\n  \n• Use your Apple Pencil to sketch ideas or annotate images and PDF documents.\n\n• Use Notebooks' advanced editing capabilities to work on documents which are stored in other apps.\n\n• Compile selected documents or the contents of whole books into a single document, an eBook or a PDF document.\n\n• Link between documents in Notebooks. In Markdown you can even use Wiki style links ([[ ]]). When clicking a link to a document which does not yet exist, Notebooks suggests to create it. And when you move or rename documents, Notebooks makes sure the links remain intact.\n\n• Create as many books as you need to structure your projects and details. Nest books as deep as you like, there is no limit in Notebooks. If you ever loose track, Notebooks' full text search helps you quickly turn up even the most hidden document.\n\n• Turn books into task lists to display document as tasks which can be ticked off. Assign due dates and alerts, and divide projects into nested sub projects, which makes them easier to handle. \n\n• For simple lists you can use checklists in formatted documents and Markdown.\n\n• Assign Context tags to books and documents to create shortcuts that are accessible for a smart book at Notebooks' top level. – Notebooks can even extract context tags from the contents of documents as you create them.\n\n• Import all documents and files you want to keep close at hand, no matter whether PDF, email, web pages, MS Office or iWorks, photos, videos, music and more.\n\n• Scan documents and extract text using OCR (iOS 13)\n\n• Sync files between iPads, iPhones, Mac or PC. \n\nWith all that, Notebooks may quickly become your one and only app for everything you want to keep close at hand.\n\nUser Comments: \n\n“Notebooks is a wonderful App, which is so much better than the dozen other note apps I tried. It is sophisticated, in an unassuming way, so that you find yourself greatly rewarded and being productive without sacrificing time/effort to the App. I cannot tell you how much productivity I have gained.  I am having a huge amount of fun, I use it constantly, more than the phone on my iPhone in fact.\" \n\n“You are GTD in every way that makes it efficient and makes me efficient.”"

      "label": "Let's admit it, we don't have perfect memories, and for the most part that's a good thing :) But there are many situations when we wish we did have perfect memory. HEARD is a practical way to have a backup of anything important you hear. When you hear something worth remembering, tap a button to preserve it for later reference. Its that simple :)\n\nFeatured by: TechCrunch, PCMagazine, LifeHacker, USAToday, FoxNews, and 100s of other publications.\n\nHEARD is a ground-breaking app that lets you capture sounds from up to 5 minutes in the past.\n\n**** Diverse uses as reported by our users: \n- Office Productivity: Focus on the conversations, capture audio highlights, then synthesize notes offline, stress free! \n- As a back up for our short term memory, especially but not exclusively for the elderly\n- Improves grades in the classroom: similar to office productivity, but also as a work around for when we zone out for a while during say a late afternoon session and something important gets said. Also as an aid for students with disabilities such as dysgraphia \n- Musicians can capture gems in practice sessions\n- Law enforcement. Let's leave it at that :-)\n- Bird watching\n- Capture kids cute words, or a joke at a party.\n.... and many many more !!\n\n\n---------\nNote: \nNow the base version gives you a 1 min buffer. An In-App purchase is needed to buffer up to 5 mins.\n\nLimitations:\nJust like any app that uses the MIC on iOS, while HEARD is listening in the background:\n- you will notice a red bar at the top of the screen \n- some notifications get silenced by the OS when the MIC is ON. Although the important stuff such as Phone calls, Calendar alerts and Clock alarms will continue to make sounds \n- Recording 'regular' cell phone calls is not allowed by iOS. But the app should work fine with VoIP calls such as Skype and Viber (when on speaker) \n\nPrivacy:\nWe take user's privacy very seriously, and we go the extra mile to make sure we protect it:\n- Nothing gets saved to permanent storage until the user tells us to do so. This means, what gets 'recorded' is completely in the user's control. After a few mins (equal to the length of the buffer) there is no trace left of the audio HEARD listened to\n- User's recordings never leave the device unless the user wants them to e.g via email or FB post. \n--------\n\n\n\nHow many times have you been in a meeting, playing with the kids or just hanging out with friends and family…and wished you could have recorded what just happened? Unless you’re a mind reader, there’s never been a way to see into the future and anticipate all those save-worthy sound bites. Until now.\n\n\nWith HEARD installed on your iPhone, you have a powerful time-shifting app that lets you customize how far back you want to go so you can grab that otherwise missed audio. The HEARD app runs silently (and seamlessly) in the background and ‒ with a simple tap ‒ the instructions / driving directions / jokes / stories / first words / laughter you would have previously missed are now saved and stored on your iPhone.\n\n\nYou probably never go anywhere without your iPhone, right?  Now, with a quick download, HEARD lets you travel back in time from a few seconds (for free) to as much as five minutes (with the one-time, in-app upgrade). \n\n\nWith HEARD, the length of the audio clip(s) you save are completely up to you. The interface is easy to navigate and you only keep what you “tap-and-tell” the app to go back and capture as soon as you’ve heard it. Every saved sound bite is stored in your personal library…and then the fun really begins! You can: \n\n• Replay previously-recorded audio clips\n• Associate each clip with an appropriate photo from the camera roll\n• Share via e-mail (using Quicktime)\n• Post to Facebook (where permission and privacy settings are up to you)\n\nIt’s time to stop wishing you could have recorded it – and save it even after you’ve HEARD it."

Simply set time and date on your iPhone for an individual text and it will be displayed timely on your watch face.\n* *NEW*:  In addition to setting just one text for a perma comp which will be displayed in all complication types (small, circular, etc.) you can now also individually adjust the text of a perma comp for each supported complication type.\n\n\"perma comp\" (short for: permanent complication) is a simple utility app designed specifically for the Apple Watch. Customise your watch face by adding your own texts as complications. Perma comp supports all complications which are capable of displaying texts. \n\nThe usage is very simple: Define a set of texts on your iPhone which will be automatically synchronised to the watch app. Once you have selected perma comp as one of your complications on your watch you simply have to open the watch app and select the preferred text. From that on, it will be displayed permanently. \n\nWhile creating a perma comp you can now also individually adjust your text for specific complication types. E.g. set a long text on big complications and a shorter text for a smaller complication (circular) for the very same perma comp and have them displayed on same watch face. This feature gives you plenty of possibilities to customise your watch face appearance.\n\nAdditionally, you can schedule perma comps to be displayed on a specific date. On this way you can use perma comp to display reminders which will be visible directly on your wrist. Or maybe setup a text as motivation for the day? It is all up to you!"

BimmerLink even allows you to remotely control the exhaust flap or mute the Active Sound Design in your car.\n\nREAD AND CLEAR TROUBLE CODES\nDiagnose your car as would otherwise be possible only by your Service Partner.

It’s like having a personal editor on your phone or tablet! SpellCheckPlus Mobile is even able to identify many errors typical of second language learners, e.g.: I am student instead of I am a student. \n\nSpellCheckPlus Mobile makes it easy to copy and paste text to or from its editor. \n\n*** Please note that SpellCheckPlus Mobile requires an internet connection during use. ***"

      "label": "Shift Worker is designed for people who need a quick and easy way to enter and view their shifts.\n\nA traditional calendar is not always ideal for shift workers. Sometimes it's not easy to see your upcoming shift schedule very clearly, especially if your shifts don't fall into the traditional working week. Shift Worker solves this problem and turns the frustrating task of entry into a quick and easy experience.\n\nShift Worker allows you to create your own types of shifts by combining visually-attractive icons with letters/numbers so that they can be easily identified at a glance. By including a range of icons (such as suns and stars for day and night shifts) in a variety of colors, any combination is possible for all types of shifts.\n\nEntering shifts can be done quickly by simply selecting a type of shift and tapping on each date it occurs. An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!\n\nIn addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. \n\nShift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date. Notes can be used anytime additional information needs to be added to a date.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Create a virtually unlimited amount of shift types\n- Enter shifts on the calendar months in advance in seconds\n- Add your rotation and automatically fill the calendar in a few simple steps\n- Show friends and family shifts using multiple calendars\n- View the calendar in timeline format to see your shift flow at a glance\n- Create colored personalized notes for any date on the calendar\n- Include week of year or week 1/2 alternating pattern on calendar\n- Jump to any month by using the \"Goto\" button\n- Save a month's worth of shifts to your background\n- Share your shifts to others via email, MMS, Facebook or Twitter\n- Import other Shift Worker shifts and view them all within the one app\n- No in-app purchases!\n- No ads!"

      "label": "BlockyTime, A simple time logger no need to tap Start/Stop.\n\n### App Store Featured of 2016 in China & HongKong ###\n### Top 10 Productivity apps in China ###\n\nEverybody has his own demand on tracking time, but most people can't persist on it for long time because the traditional time-tracking App is way too professional, and it costs too much energy to use a stopwatch.\n\nBlockyTime is very different from traditional time-tracking App, it never needs to tap \"Start/Stop\". Months of research of users experience made us to work out a better tracking method which is more suitable for people's thinking. No worries to forget to start or stop stopwatch, just take a few seconds in leisure time, like playing game, select, tap, a whole day is tracked.\n\nWhen tracking time no longer has pressure but becomes relaxing, it solves the persistence problem easily. Even people don't has huge perseverance can be good at time management.\n\n[Features]\n• Super easy and rapid method to track time spending on every event\n• Custom classification of event\n    Not only by event type (eg. work, rest), but also by specific details (eg. Game, music), also by priorities (such as four quadrants)\n• Unique link of event and object, analyze event from different angle\n• Comment, record details of event like writing a diary\n• Statistics, analyze time occupation by pie or bar chart\n• Trend, check and compare events time spending in line chart by day or month\n• Goal, such as reach 10000h in 5 years on drawing\n• Backup data to iCloud or computer, never lose it\n• Selected color themes, and colorblind mode is added\n\n[Suitable for]\n• Students\n  Track time spending on subjects, analyze it and make a better study plan\n• Researchers\n  Track time spending on research, analyze and make a more efficient research plan\n• Managers\n  Who have many projects to do and needs to know time spending on every project\n• People with part-time jobs\n  Track time on every work and analyze earnings\n• Salespeople\n  Record time and frequency of contacting clients\n• New moms and dads\n  Get to know baby's regular life and make a plan to rest\n• People haven't know the value of time\n  Keep tracking time for a while, the statistics will shock you\n• People want to analyze time and make him better\n• People want to know what costs time\n• People are not satisfied with current situation, want to learn how to manage time and improve himself \n\n[Q & A]\nQ: Why named \"BlockyTime\"?\nA: Though time is continuous, for rapid tracking, we separate time into blocks by half an hour at the expense of accuracy. This period not only meets the need of statistics, but also is convenient for people to remember event.\n\nQ: Why make 30 minutes a block? This is not accurate.\nA: Statistics is meaningful only when people persist for a long time. Look at statistics in week or month, 30 minutes a blocks hardly make negative effects on analysis. Compared to spending more energy to make it accurate, track time quicker, take advantage of saved time on other things makes it better.\n\nQ: I have OCD, inaccuracy makes me uncomfortable.\nA: Just stand back and think about it, if you pursue the accuracy, after every time of record, should you add an event called \"Tracking time\"? Then it takes some time to track this one, so you have to record again, and then, endless loop…\n\nNever spend much time on tracking time, this is truly using time effectively.\n\n[Users' comments]\n“The most time-saving tool ever”\n“It makes me not to spend time on recording, reveals the essence of tracking. I must rate this truly efficient app”\n“One of my favourite time management/tracking apps!”\n“Very easy to use and intuitive”\n“Easiest time tracking tool I ever used”\n“Milestone app of time tracking” -- zhihu.com\n\nIf you like this app, just take one minute to rate it, we'll appreciate it!\n\n[Contact me]\nGot some ideas in your mind?

This enables continuous overview of consumption for a particular measuring point. \n\nConsumption statistics can be saved as PDF.\n\nYou can back up your data to the documents folder of the app or to the cloud and restore from there. \n\nYou can save a list of readings as a CSV file for further evaluations.

If you want to create better habits (workout, eat healthily, save more money, etc), or ditch your bad ones (drinking, smoking, etc), Habeets can help you achieve that. You will still need to do the hard work, though...\n\nCORE VALUES\n- Form or ditch any type of habit\n- Easy to use\n- Packed with all the features you need\n- All your habits are for your eyes only. Neither I nor Apple can read your data.\n- No extra payments, subscriptions, or ads\n- Automatically synchronize your data across all your devices\n- Support for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac (Apple Silicon)\n- Beautifully crafted graphs and insights\n- Dark mode\n- Set reminders\n\n\nMAKE YOUR GOALS A REALITY\nShows how far you've come and how much you've improved. Encourages you to keep going when things get tough. Finally, break those bad habits that have been holding you back for years\n\nSIMPLE, EASY, AND FAST\nHabeets is a straightforward, simple, and elegant solution to help you in your journey, that will become part of your day.\n\nIMPROVE EVERY DAY\nTrack days that you missed or skipped, and make it work next time.\nForm all types of recurring habits: Weekly, Interval, and Customized.\n\nNO EXTRA PAYMENTS\nI believe that helping you achieve your goals is more important than anything else. Nowadays almost every app requires subscriptions or they just have ads everywhere.\nHabeets doesn't have any premium features. You'll receive all features already unlocked. No subscriptions, no additional payments, or ads.\nPay once, and use forever. That's it.\nHelping you become better and better by using this app is what matters to me.\n\nYOUR PRIVACY MATTERS\nHabeets is focused on privacy. We don't track you or your habits. We don't send any data to 3rd parties. Your habits data never leaves your phone or its iCloud backups. None of your habits data is saved to a server (except iCloud's servers).\n\nREMINDERS\nGo mind-free all day setting reminders for your habits. Set up an alarm for when you need to do something important like drink water or meditate. You'll never miss a chance to keep moving forward.\n\nANYTIME. ANYWHERE\nI designed Habeets so you can use it anytime, anywhere. From your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch. This will help you continue your habits wherever you go.\nFor example, you can use your Apple Watch to track habits when your iPhone is not around.\nAll your data is encrypted and automatically synched throught all your devices.\n\n\n\"Success is the product of daily habits, not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.\" - James Clear (Atomic Habits)\n\nThank you for reading until here. I wish you nothing but the best in your journey.\n\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nPrivacy Policy: https://habeets.com/privacy-policy/"

      "label": "First released in 2009, GoodReader® is truly a veteran of the App Store.\n\nIn the modern app business, it's not easy to stay relevant that long. We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase."

      "label": "Perfect OCR gives you both an accurate general purpose OCR app and a quality document scanner. Now you can scan and OCR your letter-size or A4 documents with an accuracy of 90% or more, edit, copy and store the recognized text, and e-mail your documents as PDF files with text, SINGLE page image, or both together!\n\nNOTE: To ensure the advertised results it is important that you follow the OCR TIPS below (or in the app's help). \n\n\"It worked great for me! I translated a whole story in spanish using the espanol language preference and then I copied and pasted it into a translator to get the whole story in English!\"\n\"This app is really very good and I find it to be very accurate!\"\n>> Perfect OCR users.\n\nPerfect OCR scans your documents using advanced image-processing algorithms to eliminate uneven lighting and shadows and improve contrast. The result is the clearest and most readable scans possible from the iPhone's camera. Perfect OCR also offers SureScan, our proprietary scanning mode that delivers sharper images with less jitter or smear. \n\nOur unique \"Email to myself\" feature lets you send documents to a predefined address, or even upload them to an online storage service like Evernote or Box.net, with a single tap. Uploading documents to online services via email is fast, secure, and can be done even if you're temporarily off line. Refer to app help for details.\n\nAll processing happens on your iPhone, and the confidentiality of your data is never compromised. There is also no subscription fee, and no Internet access is needed to scan documents or run OCR.\n\n\nPERFECT OCR FEATURES:\n• Letter-size or A4 page OCR with accuracy of 95% for model 3GS, 98% for iPhone 4, and up to 90% for 3G\n• OCR languages: English, French, Spanish, German, Dutch, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish, Russian, Polish, Hungarian, Czech and Ukrainian.\n• Email multipage PDFs with text, SINGLE page image, or both\n• Automatic document edge detection and perspective correction\n• Multipage text recognition with accuracy indicator\n• Text editing and copy-to-clipboard operations\n• Built-in OCR text archive with file sharing via iTunes\n• \"Email to myself\" feature\n• Email text and image files (.TXT + .JPG), or save image to library\n• Searchable PDFs with document images (single page)\n• Preserves simple text formatting\n• Option to auto-remove line breaks\n• SureScan mode for jitter-free scans\n• Simple yet powerful user interface\n• Instant brightness, rotation, and color controls\n• Compact attachments with adjustable size\n\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS FOR OCR:\n• Make sure your document is flat and well lit. Hold your iPhone still while shooting. \n• Always scan documents using \"SureScan 3x\" mode.\n• Glossy paper may not work well (avoid glare).\n• When scanning books keep the pages as flat as possible and your iPhone parallel to the surface.\n• Perfect OCR cannot recognize handwritten, very large text or spreadsheets correctly.\n• Make sure to select the right language for OCR in app settings.\n\n\nWe're constantly improving Perfect OCR, and we value our customers' opinions and feedback. Please contact us at support@turboscanapp.com. If you have a problem with our software, please contact us before submitting a comment to the app store. We can solve most of the problems, but we cannot respond to comments."

      "label": "TimeStamps makes it easier to have a look at your working hours and overtime. No more guessing when you come to work or when you have gone on a business trip - from now on, your personal time sheet is always with you.\n\n+++ Staff Pick July/August 2011 and January/February 2012 in the German App Store +++\n\nONE-BUTTON OPERATION\nIn the frontend you always set a time stamp with the same big button. It remembers which time stamp you have used recently and suggests the next stamp type. That's why the next time stamp will be working time when you've had a break before.\n                                               \nKEEP YOUR WORKING TIMES ALWAYS IN SIGHT\nThe frontend display allows you to display different states: current time, working time, break time, etc. You can change the display type with a single tap. Also, the expected end of work is displayed and updated on the fly.\n\nFLEXTIME ACCOUNT\nTimeStamps offers a flextime account for overtimes. Including starting balance, correction factor for each week and Days of in Lieu to get rid of overtime. And in case you don't need a flextime account, it can be switched off in the settings.\n\nAUTOMATIC BREAK\nSpecified in TimeStamps' settings of the default work week, the default break can be automatically deducted as the minimum break at the end of a day. If the break time is exceeded, of course, the larger value is taken. Whether the automatic pause is applied is shown by a symbol within TimeStamps.\n\nEXTENSIVE BACKEND\nIn the backend all time stamps are listed in different views. New time stamps can be added, deleted or existing ones can be altered.\n\nTAGS\nEach time stamp can be assigned a tag from a self-created list. Each tag can of course be changed later, hidden, modified in order or deleted. Coming soon is also a new type of export, who has the ability to choose specific tags.\n\nWORK-FREE DAYS\nUsing the backend, you can set work-free days - holidays, leave days, days of in lieu and sick days are an integral part of TimeStamps. On these days, you do not have to work, so there will be no default work and break time. However, TimeStamps does not prevent that you still record times. So you can still work on holidays or leave days and keep track of it with TimeStamps.\n\nSTATISTICS\nIn the weekly and daily time stamp view, TimeStamps provides small statistics for a better overview. \"How much overtime I've done this week?\", \"How long have I been on a business trip?\" - The statistics provide the kind of information you want.\n\nREPORTS\nVarious reports can be created of all time stamps. You can specify any time period and send reports as HTML or CSV to one or more e-mail addresses. These report configurations can be reused later.\n\nSETTINGS\nNot everyone is working from nine to five, five days a week. So the work and break time for each day of a default work week is definable to the minute. Also working without a break is possible with a single click. The setting of default times can later be changed individually for each day.\n\n\nTHANKS FOR THE SUPPORT\nIf you like TimeStamps, please tell your colleagues, friends and relatives! And we are always thankful for a a positive rating in the App Store.\n\nQuestions, comments and suggestions are always welcome, too. Please use our support e-mail address: support@timestampsapp.com"

You can also view the photo fullscreen and zoom into it. \n\n• RECORDING - You can record a voice message which will be added to your note. This can also be done in the background while using other apps. \n\n• COLOR CATEGORIES - Organize your notes by assigning colors to them.

      "label": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n \nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\nMulti factor authentication (MFA) or two factor authentication (2FA) provides a second layer of security. When logging in with multi-factor authentication, you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one-time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one-time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n \nGetting started with passwordless\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n \nGetting started with autofill\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n \nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.\n \nOptional Access permissions:\nMicrosoft Authenticator includes the following optional access permissions. All these require user consent. If you choose to not grant these optional access permissions, you can still use Microsoft Authenticator for other services that do not require such permission. For more information see https://aka.ms/authappfaq\nAccessibility Service:  Used to optionally support Autofill on more apps and sites.\nLocation: Sometimes your organization wants to know your location before allowing you to access certain resources. The app will request this permission only if your organization has a policy requiring location.\nCamera: Used to scan QR codes when you add a work, school, or non-Microsoft account.\nRead the contents of your storage: This permission is only used when you report a technical problem through the app settings.Some information from your storage is collected to diagnose the issue."

Zero-log policy, traffic encryption, IP and DNS masking. These all mean that third parties are not able to monitor you any longer, and that your privacy is reliably secured from obtrusive website and ISP surveillance.\n\n+70 LOCATIONS\nOur high-speed VPN servers in 70+ locations all over the globe, as well as our enhanced KeepSolid Wise technology, allow you to freely surf the web without giving out a single piece of your personal information, including your current location. Don’t let websites discriminate you based on the way you surf the internet or the place you browse it from.\n\nTOTAL SECURITY\nWe offers a variety of VPN protocols, each with unique capabilities and strengths. Just choose the one you would like to try. For instance:\nOpenVPN - an extremely secure and highly configurable protocol that uses a wide range of encryption algorithms (including AES-256).\nIKEv2 - a secure and easy-to-setup protocol that can effectively change networks and re-establish VPN connection if it was temporarily lost. It provides a significantly higher connection speed and a better performance.\n\nWe offer three recurring subscription options: \n- 1 Month, 3 months, 1 Year\n- Subscriptions will auto-renew unless canceled.\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n- No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n- Your account will be charged for renewal for the amount of your current subscription within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. All costs for subscriptions are mentioned above.\n\nPrivacy policies : https://luni.app/support/vpn_privacy\nTerms of use : https://luni.app/support/vpn_terms\n\nDisclaimer: We have had reports that our VPN service might be blocked in the countries listed below:\n- China\n- UAE\n- Saudi Arabia\n- Iraq\n- Iran\n- Turkmenistan\n- Turkey\n\nWhile we can’t say that it’s totally impossible to connect in the mentioned locations, there are a few challenges to overcome."

Weaker encryption isn't even an option\n• Global VPN network: With servers in 22+ countries and lightning-fast speeds, access the websites and apps you love. Anytime, anywhere\n• Helpful support that always responds within 24 hours\n\nWHAT CRITICS ARE SAYING\n\"TunnelBear is an elegant, easy mobile VPN that keeps you safe.\"\n  - Lifehacker\n\n\"The app is bursting with charm, but it also delivers security at a good price.\"\n  - PCMag\n\n\"All you have to do is turn the switch to \"ON\" and you are protected.\"\n  - WSJ\n\n\"TunnelBear, the gorgeous VPN app that wants to bring online privacy to everyone.\"\n  - VentureBeat\n\nPRIVACY POLICY AND TERMS OF SERVICE:\n*Spoiler alert* TunnelBear has a strict no-logging policy.

Was it voluntarily or maybe someone just deactivated their account? Headaches and worries in the past, Yupi does everything for you!\n\nJust imagine how much time you save by not creating a list of followers, trying to figure out who started following and who unfollowed. All these tables and lists would drive anyone crazy, and still will not give a clear understanding of, for example, when exactly a person stopped following your profile.\n\nAs soon as you install Yupi, app immediately starts watching all changes in your activity, with an accuracy of a second. The application notifies you not only about followers and unfollowers, but also shows detailed statistics of your stories, who watched your Instagram stories, how many times, which story is the most popular, and which, on the contrary, is not popular at all. Have you been unfollowed? Unfollow them back! Or maybe you have devoted fans? It's just so easy to find out, Yupi makes a separate list of those who follow you without following them back.\nAnd that's not all. Yupi enlarges your profile pictures in no time. Zoom the profile picture with one click, now you don't have to peer into a small image.\n\nYou can contact for support info@yupireport.com\n\nInformation about the auto-renewable nature of the subscriptions\nEvery time you can reach your updated reports and if you want to continue getting reports, your subscription should be continued.\nSubscription periods are 1 month, 6 months and 1 year. Every month, 6 months or year your subscription renews.\n1 month subscription price is $4.99. 6 Months Subscription price is $18.99. 1 year price is $24,99.\nSubscriptions will automatically renew unless cancelled at least one day before the renewal date within 24 hours before the end of the current period.\nPayment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase.\nIf you subscribe before a free trial ends, the remainder of the trial period will be forfeited.\nYou can manage and cancel your subscription by going to your account settings in the App Store\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://yupireport.com/privacy-policy\nTerms and Conditions: https://yupireport.com/terms\nEULA: https://yupireport.com/eula\n\nThis app only provides analytics for your instagram account.

      "label": "VPN Hero is a no-log VPN ready to serve you! That’s right! Very few VPN companies actually do not collect, or “log” information transmitted through their network. VPN Hero is one of those “hero” VPN companies keeping their promise of ensuring privacy and security in an absolute way.\n\nVPN Hero offers more than 9000 IP addresses which are updated frequently by the developer team, in order to make your internet connection more secure and hard to track for prying eyes. Malevolent organizations and people are unfortunately trying to access and read data which are originally not theirs, including the passwords and even credit card information. So the data transmission of yours should stay untraceable and dynamic in order to avoid anyone achieving such malicious goals. As VPN Hero we are getting consultancy from white hat hackers (cool way of saying IT security experts) on a regular basis to be one step ahead of black hat hackers (thieves on the internet).\n\nThere are lots of reasons to use a VPN. The most popular reasons are privacy, data security, better mobile gaming, changing your location. VPN Hero is well aware of the various reasons, and optimized its servers for such different use cases. In terms of privacy and security, one of the most important reasons to use a VPN is securing the connection while using public WiFi. One should always remember that connecting WiFi networks in restaurants, cafes, and airports always comes with its risks. As the name public WiFi suggests, anyone can connect those networks including the ones who want to access your data. It is highly recommended to activate your VPN before connecting such public WiFi networks to secure yourself. At this point another feature of VPN Hero comes into play. VPN Hero offers the “kill switch” feature! \n\nThe “kill switch” feature basically means preventing your phone from reconnecting to the network automatically, when your connection via VPN is disrupted for some reason. If it wasn't the case and if it tries to connect automatically, there may be 1 or 2 seconds without the VPN shield, and that 1 or 2 seconds may cause a security hole. This is how VPN Hero has been thought out, and prepared in such detail! We recommend always to pay attention for the “kill switch” feature in the VPN you will choose.\n\nChange your location easily! VPN Hero offers international locations from different countries, and even continents!\n\nUsually people search for virtual private networks with different prominent features e.g. fast VPN, reliable VPN, secure VPN, better VPN, best VPN, private VPN, speed VPN, gaming VPN. What if we told you that VPN Hero is named Hero for a reason? VPN Hero is a hero because it combines all these highly wanted features! Try VPN Hero now, and see its unlimited performance for yourself!\n\nAbout VPN Hero Premium Subscription:\n\n*The subscription covers VPN usage.\n*VPN Hero subscription period alternatives are 1 week or 1 year. \n*Based on your plan every 1 week or 1 year your VPN subscription renews. \n*Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at only your confirmation.\n*VPN Hero subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off.\n\nYou can cancel your VPN Hero subscription anytime via this URL:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039\n\nVPN Hero’s terms of use can be found via this URL on VPN Hero’s official website:\nhttps://www.vpnhero.app/terms"

This whiteboard app was launched in 2012 and is unique in that it provides a number of coaching templates for coaches to use on site to direct their players, which has been well received by many coaches. The product is unique in that it has a button layout and the tools are easy to exit. Our products have been well received by coaches, teachers and students, and students mainly use them as sketch paper and for assignments, so much so that we have received many applications from student teachers and coaches on WeChat to add them as friends and discuss product plans with them to continuously improve the product.\n\nIt can be used for sketching, demonstrations, slates, doodling, as your note pad, temporary notepad, mimeographing vocabulary, and calculating problems. Home education whiteboards, school teacher education chalkboards, conference room whiteboards, various ball coaching demonstrations, live coaching, teaching, etc., as well as children drawing and painting, etc. The most surprising and touching thing is that some people with speech difficulties send letters of thanks, saying that this product helps them communicate with the outside world.\n\nEasy to use\n1. One finger can write by hand.\n2. Two fingers can zoom in or out on the bottom image.\n3. Double-tap on the Apple Pencil to bring up or close the eraser.\n\nSimple interface \nThe entire interface consists of a single canvas, the usual four colours, three stroke sizes and a few common buttons.\n\nFeature-rich\n1. Fourth brush at the bottom: you can choose from an unlimited number of colours.\n2. Background setting button at the bottom: in addition to providing many useful background templates, you can also choose unlimited colours.\n3. The third stroke size at the bottom: you can further choose to customise more sizes and then select more default sizes.\n4. The Private Folder button on the left allows you to save or save the file you are editing to a private folder, or export it to a PDF file and share it.\n5.

You can also use special pens such as soft pens and markers, as well as settings such as: preventing hand strokes when using the Apple Pencil, using watermarks, etc.\n6. Save the finished drawing as a high resolution image directly to your album or share it on social networks.\n7. The new private folder offers even more possibilities, especially the PDF export feature, which is a handy little tool for making PDFs. You can import some image material, process it through the whiteboard, save it to a private folder and then select multiple files to export to a single PDF file at the same time, which can be saved locally or shared with others. \n\nFrequently Asked Questions \nQuestion 1: How do I adjust the font size and colour?\nWhen you select the colour and size of the brush, the font will change. The width of your finger from start to finish is the width of the font, so you can try it out.\n\nQuestion 2: Where is the image saved? \nAnswer: Saved to your device's photo album. Note that you need to set the permissions to allow access to your album.\n\nQuestion 3: Why can't I save the pictures?\nAnswer: This is due to the new privacy mechanism on Apple IOS 6 and above. Please open.\nSettings >> Privacy >> Photos.\nThen select Allow Whiteboard to access your album.\n\nQuestion 4: How do I close the window?\nJust swipe down from any position.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me.\n\nWeChat: chenlidong\nEmail: chenlidong@outlook.com\nOfficial website: whiteboardapp.org\n\n\nTerms of Use (EULA): http://whiteboardapp.org/TermsofUse\nPrivate Policy: http://whiteboardapp.org/fsaf-88bdbc6b"

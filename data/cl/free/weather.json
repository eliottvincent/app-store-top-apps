      "label": "The app combines highly accurate weather forecast for your location with a 3D map showing development of weather in a broader area in a very interesting way. This allows you to see where precipitation is going to come from or where the wind is blowing from. The uniqueness of the app comes from the amount of data displayed. Forecast of weather, precipitation, wind, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, snow cover and other meteorological data for different altitudes is available for the whole world. \n\nWIND ANIMATION\nThe Ventusky application solves weather displaying in an interesting way. Wind is displayed using streamlines which clearly portray the continuous development of weather. Airflow on Earth is always in motion and the streamlines depict this motion in an amazing way. This makes the interconnection of all atmospheric phenomena obvious.\n\nWEATHER FORECAST\nWeather forecast for the first three days is available in the app in one-hour steps. For other days, it’s available in three-hour steps. Users can also look up sunrise and sunrise times in a given place or air quality.\n\nWEATHER MODELS\nThanks to the Ventusky application, visitors get data directly from the numerical models that, just a few years ago, were used solely by meteorologists. The app collects data from the most accurate numerical models. Besides the well-known data from the American GFS and HRRR models, it also displays data from the Canadian GEM model and the German ICON model, which is unique thanks to its high resolution for the whole world. Two models, EURAD and USRAD, are based on current radar and satellite readings. These models are able to show precisely current precipitation in US and Europe.\n\nWEATHER FRONTS\nYou can also display weather fronts. We have created a neural network that predicts the positions of cold, warm, occluded, and stationary fronts based on data from weather models. This algorithm is unique, and we are the first on the world who makes global fronts forecast available to users.\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS\n• Temperature (16 levels)\n• Temperature anomaly\n• Perceived temperature\n• Precipitation (1 hour, 3 hour, long time accumulation)\n• Radar\n• Satellite\n• Wind gusts (1 hour, long time maximum)\n• Air quality (AQI, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, O3, dust or CO)\n• Probability of aurora\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS (PREMIUM)\n• Wind (16 levels)\n• Cloud cover (high, middle, low, total)\n• Snow cover (total, new)\n• Humidity (4 layers)\n• Dew point\n• Air pressure\n• CAPE, CIN, LI, Helicity (SRH)\n• Freezing level\n• Wave forecast\n• Ocean currents\n\nLIST OF WEATHER WIDGETS\n• Forecast 4x2\n• Forecast 2x2\n• Forecast 4x4\n• Radar 4x2\n• Radar 2x2\n\nThe app is completely free of ads.

      "label": "Fishing Index - Fishing Weather App is a app that helps fishermen to fishing scientifically and reasonably.\n      Fish activities are related to many weather conditions. The influence of water temperature and atmospheric pressure is most obvious, but the influence of temperature on water temperature is lagging behind and slow, and the change of atmospheric pressure is more intuitive. The higher atmospheric pressure, the higher dissolved oxygen in water, the more active fish activities. Wind speed and direction are also an important factor. The breeze blowing Buddha water surface increases the dissolved oxygen of water. Cold blowing south wind and hot blowing north wind are very beneficial for fishing. Finally, rainfall and humidity also have a certain impact on fishing.\n          According to some research, fish activities are most active in about one hour before and after the moontransit (upper or lower), and are also active within half an hour before and after the Moonrise or Moonset. In addition, within one month, fishes  is  most active at the full moon or the new moon  , least active at the first quarter or the last quarter.\n\nWeather : Hourly Weather Forecast for  7 days \nSolunar: Sunrise, Sunset, Moonrise, Moonset and Moon Phase\nFishing Index: Calculate the Fishing Index per Hour And Solunar Table\nTidal Forecast: Global Tidal Forecast and  Tide Analysis,Waves forecast\nMine:\n\n『Fishing Index Membership』\n7 days 24 hours fishing weather forecast, 7 days 24 hours daily and monthly analysis and prediction, 7 days 24 hours fishing index analysis and calculation,Tidal analysis and prediction,waves forecast。\n\nPurchase Rules:\n[Monthly membership] $0.49  per month purchase of Monthly membership, and automatically renew the subscription monthly.\n[Annual membership ] $4.49  per year to buy Annual membership, and automatically renew them after one year.\n[Life Membership] $ 14.99, only need to purchase once, valid for life\n\n\n(Note:prices in different regions should be converted according to US dollar exchange rate.)\nPurchase Notes:\n1.

      "label": "«Magnetology» is an application which permits one to watch the forecast of geomagnetic storms and the state of Earth´s geomagnetic field.\n\nWHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT?\n\nGeomagnetic storms adversely affect the health of humans.\n\nThey can cause aches, dizziness, rapid heart rate, and abnormal blood pressure.\n\nPeople with abnormal conditions of the blood and of the cardiovascular and autonomic nervous systems are particularly susceptible to the influence of geomagnetic storms.\n\nThe degree of magnetic storms’ influence on a particular person depends on many factors, including health status, stress, physical and emotional fatigue, natural predisposition.\n\nNot only can geomagnetic storms have a negative impact on humans, but also on communications, navigation, and power. Drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are most vulnerable to impact of geomagnetic storms.\n\nBy taking into account the forecast of geomagnetic storms, you can plan difficult decisions, avoid high physical stress, and protect yourself from negative consequences.\n\nOur application will help you with this.\n\nABOUT THE NATURE OF THE GEOMAGNETIC STORMS\n\nThe Earth's geomagnetic field changes occur under the influence of the Sun. The intensity of the impact is not constant and depends on the ongoing processes on the solar surface.\n\nThe strength of geomatic field disturbances is characterized by the value of Kp index. The Kp index can be assigned values from 0 to 9, where 0 is the absence of disturbances and 9 represents extremely strong perturbations of the earth´s geomagnetic field.\n\nDisturbances with a Kp index of 5 and above are called storms.\n\nThe number of geomagnetic storms per year can reach 50!\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\n- David Howell for English localization;\n- Johan Milani for French localization.\n\nIN COMING UPDATES OF THE APPLICATION EXPECT\n\n- Personal forecasts.\n\n* The app uses data of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration."

Log.\n\nGarmin Pilot is the most comprehensive suite of tools for the iPad designed specifically for general aviation and corporate pilots. Flight planning, charts, interactive maps, weather briefing resources and navigation capabilities; it’s all included. The app’s intuitive interface mirrors those on the newest Garmin touchscreen avionics so you can go seamlessly from preflight to inflight.  \n\nPlan \n\nGarmin Pilot’s powerful capabilities start with pre-flight planning, providing pilots with the most comprehensive aviation weather information to make better-informed flight decisions. Pilots can check NEXRAD radar, visible and infrared cloud imagery, METARs, TAFs, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, PIREPs, NOTAMs, winds and temperature aloft, TFRs and lightning data. With Garmin Pilot, data can be displayed over Garmin’s interactive maps that support track-up navigation, VFR sectional or an IFR low or high en-route chart to visualize the weather for your route. Add text-based weather widgets and use the exclusive NavTrack feature to view weather along the planned route. \n\nFile \n\nWith Garmin Pilot, users can easily enter a flight plan and interactively edit it on the map. Pre-loaded forms make it quick to save and reuse data for frequently flown routes. And when the flight plan is ready, Garmin Pilot makes it simple to file, amend or close the flight plan via Leidos Flight Service or DUATS.  \n\nFly \n\nGarmin Pilot provides full en-route navigation capability on its moving map. Pilots can also navigate with Garmin’s patented panel, a GPS-driven instrument pack with a graphical HSI directional display and indicators for groundspeed, altitude and vertical speed. After takeoff, pilots can continue to view real-time weather in the U.S. and traffic information by wirelessly connecting to Garmin’s GDL 39 3D portable ADS-B Receiver (sold separately). \n\nLog\n\nGarmin Pilot includes a comprehensive electronic logbook that syncs with flyGarmin.  The logbook automatically generates entries based upon GPS data collected during the flight, tracks currency, supports manual entries, endorsements and creates reports.\n\nGarmin Pilot U.S. Standard: \n\n- Rich, interactive maps support Track-Up navigation\n- Charts: VFR Sectionals, low and high IFR en-route, airport diagrams and approach procedures \n- Ability to view Jeppesen Terminal Charts  (Jeppesen echart subscription required)\n- Weather Maps: Animated radar, Infrared and Visible Satellite, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, Lightning, TFRs and more!\n- Extensive text products: METARs, TAFs, Winds Aloft, PIREPs, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, Area Forecasts and NOTAMs \n- AOPA Airport Directory\n- Weight and Balance\n- Checklists\n- Flight plan filing via Leidos Flight Services\n- Garmin patented navigation panel \n- Terrain and Obstacles\n- Smart Airspace\n- Fast Find predictive Waypoint Entry\n- Logbook\n- Optional VFR Premium: Synthetic Vision (SVX), Terrain and obstacle alerting, and Garmin SafeTaxi®  \n- Optional IFR Premium: VFR Premium plus geo-referenced Garmin FliteCharts® \n\nGarmin Pilot has regional offerings for Africa, Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe and Latin America.

      "label": "Trying to avoid walking straight into a rainstorm when you go out? Check our rain radar and rain graph before you leave so you never have to get drenched!\n\t\nDe Buienradar app starts with the 3 hour or the 24 hour rain radar forecast. The rain radar image will show you whether it is going to rain in the next upcoming hours or even the next day. Below the radar is the rain graph. In this graph you can see exactly when it is going to rain and how much rainfall is predicted (in millimeters). If you prefer an even more detailed image of your city or town you can press the magnifying glass icon to zoom in.\n\nThe Buienradar app is suitable for iPhone and iPad. Via the handy widgets (with rain graph for your current location) you can quickly see on your today's screen whether it will rain soon without opening the app. The widget is now also visible with 3D touch: press the Buienradar app icon a little harder in your app overview to make the widget appear.\n\nBesides the Buienradar you can also find other radars and maps:\n- Drizzle\n- Sun \n- NL Satellite images\n- Storm\n- Pollen (hay fever)\n- Sun (UV)\n- Mosquitos\n- BBQ\n- Temperature\n- Feeling temperature\n- Wind\n- Fog\n- Snow\n- EU Buienradar (rain radar)\n- EU Satellite images\n\nYou can find personalized weather info in the table “Komende uren in” (Next 8 hours weather prediction) for your favorite location (even abroad!) like hour-to-hour predictions for: temperature, feeling temperature, the number of millimeters of rain per hour, the chance of rain and wind force (in Beaufort).\n\nBesides thunderstorm, snow, sun, wind and temperature maps we also offer wind chill, ground temperature, sun intensity, air pressure, gusts, visibility and humidity data, together with the exact times of sunrise and sunset for your location.\n\nWe also offer seasonal radar maps. In the summer, for example, you can use our pollen and mosquito radars in order to receive a timely notification when it is wise to hang up your mosquito net. In the winter you can use our snowradar, which informs you about winter precipitation, but we also offer a map especially for ground temperature which warns you about night frost.\n\nIn the “14-daagse” tab (14 day forecast) you will find the weather forecast (in a graph) for the next 14 days. You can also see a detailed list view when you click on the tab “Lijst”. This list offers an hourly forecast for the next 7 days and a daily average for the second week.\n\nIn the “Meldingen” tab you can create your own rain alert (free push notification) customized to your daily time schedule and favorite locations so you will never be unprepared for rain or a storm.\n\nIf you don't want to see ads, we also offer the Buienradar Plus plan for €3,49 per year. You can find this easily in “Instellingen” (“Settings”) and then press “Neem Buienradar Plus” (Get Buienradar Plus).\n\nOur Terms of Use can be found here:\nhttps://privacy.rtl.nl/gebruikers-voorwaarden.html\n\nOur Privacy statement can be found here:\nhttps://privacy.rtl.nl/privacy-statement.html\n\nWe are continuously improving the Buienradar app. If you have any suggestions on how we can improve or if you have any questions, you can always reach out to us by using the feedback form in the app or by sending us an e-mail via appsupport@buienradar.nl. Thanks!"

      "label": "This app uses the barometric pressure sensor built into all the newer iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch Models sold after 2016 with few exceptions. You need one of these newer devices to use this App. See below which older iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch without this sensor are not supported!\n\nThis App features a Barometer for weather, an Altimeter for outdoor activities, a barometric Trend and a Notification Center Widget.\n\nEven without the optional In-App-Purchase this is a fully functional Barometer with absolutely no draw-backs and all important features accessible. Always without ads! (See \"Pro Features\" at the end). No internet connection required, no data transmitted - runs on your device only!\n\nKeep an eye on the barometric pressure and be your own weather forecast! This little app uses only GPS (optional) and the new barometric pressure sensor to calculate the barometric pressure used in weather forecasts. The new iPhones have a barometric pressure sensor built in so this app works completely without internet. The handy marker helps you keep track of changes in the barometric pressure and let's you predict weather changes! Please realize, that a single barometric pressure reading is not enough to tell the current weather situation but the barometric pressure and its change over time is a very good indicator for weather changes!\n\nNow you can also see the trend in barometric pressure with graph charts displaying the measurements taken during the last 30 days! (6h, 12h, 24h, 3d, 7d, 14d, 30d)\n\nThe Altimeter helps you track your altitude changes based on the change of pressure. Just set your reference pressure and altitude in order to use the Altimeter for checking how high up the mountain you have climbed (works for other activities too). The App does not use GPS for the Altimeter.\n\nPlease Note that on older devices such as the 4S, 5, 5S and 5C as well as on any iPod Touch and iPad Models older than iPad Air 2 or iPad Mini 4 as well as the Apple Watch 1 and 2, this app will not be able to read barometric pressure values and not display any useful information. The first generation 4-inch iPhone SE is not supported - the new SE (2020) is!\n\nAll basic features, the Barometer, the Altimeter, the Trend and the Widget are completely free to use for everyone and are fully functional at maximum accuracy available. No ads!\nThe only features with restricted access via In-App-Purchase are listed at the end under \"Pro Features\". Those are nice to have features for power users or those that want to show their support for the App!\n\nFeatures (free for everyone)\n- Barometer for weather\n- Altimeter for outdoor activities\n- HomeScreen Widget (iOS 14 and newer)\n- Today-View Widget (all Versions)\n- Watch App\n- Up to 30d trend visualised with graphs\n- Interactive timeline on the trend graphs\n- No internet connection required since the sensor is built into the new iPhones and iPads\n- Supports 6 different pressure units\n- Support for 2 different altitude units\n- Analog Barometer with support for all 6 units\n- Configurable \"displayed accuracy\" / number of decimals\n- Supports setting a custom marker so you can track changes in barometric pressure\n- Manual altitude setting or automatic altitude updates based on GPS for the Barometer.\n- GPS Correction. In case your GPS seems to always be 'off' a little you can now fix this easily.\n- Portrait and Landscape support\n- No ads! No data collection beyond your device (history and settings). No web communication at all.\n\nPro Features (one time In-App Purchase required)\n- Change the Barometer Face\n- Fishing Barometer\n- Two scales on the Barometer\n- Data export in CSV Format"

The sensors permanently monitor the current data and report malfunctions automatically and immediately via push notification to your smartphone, whereby greater damage can be avoided by targeted action. \n\nThe simple installation enables every user to monitor the house at any time in just 5 steps:\nOnce you have downloaded the permanently free MOBILE ALERTS app from the Appstore, it is immediately ready for use after installation thanks to Plug&Play.\nA personal registration is not necessary.\nNow connect the gateway to the power supply unit and your router.\nThen insert batteries in the selected wireless sensors.\nOpen the app, scan in the codes of the wireless sensors and you can access all the recorded data with your smartphone and check the current status of your home - anytime, anywhere.\nThe whole process is completed within 2 minutes at the latest.\n\nThe app's self-explanatory, graphical user interface is intuitive to use and can be individually adapted to your needs. Define an individual name for each wireless sensor and set up specific alarm limits yourself. If these alarm limits are exceeded, the wireless sensors immediately report the fault to your smartphone and thus offer you the PLUS in security.\n\nThe MOBILE ALERTS system can be expanded with many other wireless sensors as required. In addition to temperature monitoring, these provide additional data on air humidity, water temperature, leaking water, information on open and closed windows or doors and much more.\n\nThe MOBILE ALERTS system can be used with many other IoT systems via the Conrad Connect IoT platform. In addition, there is support for the common language assistants.\n\nWe are continuously working on the range of our sensors. Further information, an overview of all available sensors and an additional video for installation can be found in your app under INFO or at www.mobile-alerts.eu."

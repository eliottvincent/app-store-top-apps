      "label": "The app combines highly accurate weather forecast for your location with a 3D map showing development of weather in a broader area in a very interesting way. This allows you to see where precipitation is going to come from or where the wind is blowing from. The uniqueness of the app comes from the amount of data displayed. Forecast of weather, precipitation, wind, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, snow cover and other meteorological data for different altitudes is available for the whole world. \n\nWIND ANIMATION\nThe Ventusky application solves weather displaying in an interesting way. Wind is displayed using streamlines which clearly portray the continuous development of weather. Airflow on Earth is always in motion and the streamlines depict this motion in an amazing way. This makes the interconnection of all atmospheric phenomena obvious.\n\nWEATHER FORECAST\nWeather forecast for the first three days is available in the app in one-hour steps. For other days, it’s available in three-hour steps. Users can also look up sunrise and sunrise times in a given place or air quality.\n\nWEATHER MODELS\nThanks to the Ventusky application, visitors get data directly from the numerical models that, just a few years ago, were used solely by meteorologists. The app collects data from the most accurate numerical models. Besides the well-known data from the American GFS and HRRR models, it also displays data from the Canadian GEM model and the German ICON model, which is unique thanks to its high resolution for the whole world. Two models, EURAD and USRAD, are based on current radar and satellite readings. These models are able to show precisely current precipitation in US and Europe.\n\nWEATHER FRONTS\nYou can also display weather fronts. We have created a neural network that predicts the positions of cold, warm, occluded, and stationary fronts based on data from weather models. This algorithm is unique, and we are the first on the world who makes global fronts forecast available to users.\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS\n• Temperature (16 levels)\n• Temperature anomaly\n• Perceived temperature\n• Precipitation (1 hour, 3 hour, long time accumulation)\n• Radar\n• Satellite\n• Wind gusts (1 hour, long time maximum)\n• Air quality (AQI, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, O3, dust or CO)\n• Probability of aurora\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS (PREMIUM)\n• Wind (16 levels)\n• Cloud cover (high, middle, low, total)\n• Snow cover (total, new)\n• Humidity (4 layers)\n• Dew point\n• Air pressure\n• CAPE, CIN, LI, Helicity (SRH)\n• Freezing level\n• Wave forecast\n• Ocean currents\n\nLIST OF WEATHER WIDGETS\n• Forecast 4x2\n• Forecast 2x2\n• Forecast 4x4\n• Radar 4x2\n• Radar 2x2\n\nThe app is completely free of ads.

It shows the temperature of your current location. That does not mean that your phone becomes a thermometer and can read the temperature of the surrounding area, using a weather service. A lot of idiots download this app and complain that their phone can't read the temperature indoors. Of course it can't! It's a phone, and no matter what app or other software you install on it, it will never be able to read the temperature of its immediate surroundings unless you had some hardware already installed that can do so, and a touch-screen phone simply cannot take someone's temperature.\nby jefffafa123\n\n- Gets the temp for your current location, or for other saved locations. Works very well. I previously used another thermometer app, but it had banner ads that you couldn't close, and they covered the temperature if it dropped low enough. This one has a nice clean interface and easy to use!\nby AndyLPhoto\n\n- It is very accurate and is really easy to use and control. I recommend using this app!\nby AwesomeV01\n\n- Very nice. Very simple. I like the auto save feature and the ability to just flip through the pages to get where you want.\nby Tree on Hill"

      "label": "«Magnetology» is an application which permits one to watch the forecast of geomagnetic storms and the state of Earth´s geomagnetic field.\n\nWHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT?\n\nGeomagnetic storms adversely affect the health of humans.\n\nThey can cause aches, dizziness, rapid heart rate, and abnormal blood pressure.\n\nPeople with abnormal conditions of the blood and of the cardiovascular and autonomic nervous systems are particularly susceptible to the influence of geomagnetic storms.\n\nThe degree of magnetic storms’ influence on a particular person depends on many factors, including health status, stress, physical and emotional fatigue, natural predisposition.\n\nNot only can geomagnetic storms have a negative impact on humans, but also on communications, navigation, and power. Drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are most vulnerable to impact of geomagnetic storms.\n\nBy taking into account the forecast of geomagnetic storms, you can plan difficult decisions, avoid high physical stress, and protect yourself from negative consequences.\n\nOur application will help you with this.\n\nABOUT THE NATURE OF THE GEOMAGNETIC STORMS\n\nThe Earth's geomagnetic field changes occur under the influence of the Sun. The intensity of the impact is not constant and depends on the ongoing processes on the solar surface.\n\nThe strength of geomatic field disturbances is characterized by the value of Kp index. The Kp index can be assigned values from 0 to 9, where 0 is the absence of disturbances and 9 represents extremely strong perturbations of the earth´s geomagnetic field.\n\nDisturbances with a Kp index of 5 and above are called storms.\n\nThe number of geomagnetic storms per year can reach 50!\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\n- David Howell for English localization;\n- Johan Milani for French localization.\n\nIN COMING UPDATES OF THE APPLICATION EXPECT\n\n- Personal forecasts.\n\n* The app uses data of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration."

Log.\n\nGarmin Pilot is the most comprehensive suite of tools for the iPad designed specifically for general aviation and corporate pilots. Flight planning, charts, interactive maps, weather briefing resources and navigation capabilities; it’s all included. The app’s intuitive interface mirrors those on the newest Garmin touchscreen avionics so you can go seamlessly from preflight to inflight.  \n\nPlan \n\nGarmin Pilot’s powerful capabilities start with pre-flight planning, providing pilots with the most comprehensive aviation weather information to make better-informed flight decisions. Pilots can check NEXRAD radar, visible and infrared cloud imagery, METARs, TAFs, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, PIREPs, NOTAMs, winds and temperature aloft, TFRs and lightning data. With Garmin Pilot, data can be displayed over Garmin’s interactive maps that support track-up navigation, VFR sectional or an IFR low or high en-route chart to visualize the weather for your route. Add text-based weather widgets and use the exclusive NavTrack feature to view weather along the planned route. \n\nFile \n\nWith Garmin Pilot, users can easily enter a flight plan and interactively edit it on the map. Pre-loaded forms make it quick to save and reuse data for frequently flown routes. And when the flight plan is ready, Garmin Pilot makes it simple to file, amend or close the flight plan via Leidos Flight Service or DUATS.  \n\nFly \n\nGarmin Pilot provides full en-route navigation capability on its moving map. Pilots can also navigate with Garmin’s patented panel, a GPS-driven instrument pack with a graphical HSI directional display and indicators for groundspeed, altitude and vertical speed. After takeoff, pilots can continue to view real-time weather in the U.S. and traffic information by wirelessly connecting to Garmin’s GDL 39 3D portable ADS-B Receiver (sold separately). \n\nLog\n\nGarmin Pilot includes a comprehensive electronic logbook that syncs with flyGarmin.  The logbook automatically generates entries based upon GPS data collected during the flight, tracks currency, supports manual entries, endorsements and creates reports.\n\nGarmin Pilot U.S. Standard: \n\n- Rich, interactive maps support Track-Up navigation\n- Charts: VFR Sectionals, low and high IFR en-route, airport diagrams and approach procedures \n- Ability to view Jeppesen Terminal Charts  (Jeppesen echart subscription required)\n- Weather Maps: Animated radar, Infrared and Visible Satellite, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, Lightning, TFRs and more!\n- Extensive text products: METARs, TAFs, Winds Aloft, PIREPs, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, Area Forecasts and NOTAMs \n- AOPA Airport Directory\n- Weight and Balance\n- Checklists\n- Flight plan filing via Leidos Flight Services\n- Garmin patented navigation panel \n- Terrain and Obstacles\n- Smart Airspace\n- Fast Find predictive Waypoint Entry\n- Logbook\n- Optional VFR Premium: Synthetic Vision (SVX), Terrain and obstacle alerting, and Garmin SafeTaxi®  \n- Optional IFR Premium: VFR Premium plus geo-referenced Garmin FliteCharts® \n\nGarmin Pilot has regional offerings for Africa, Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe and Latin America.

Devices with built-in sensors will get values from it and for those without sensors, the pressure value is reported by the nearest weather station.\n\nWith our clean and intuitive app, you can see the  current pressure with just one look. You can save any current value to compare pressure from other days. What's coolest is that you can swipe through multiple units and instantly see the pressure in the value you are interested in, including:\n- pounds per square inch\n- millibar\n- hectopascal\n- kilopascal\n- millimeter of mercury\n- bar\n- inch of mercury\n\nYou can also change preferred units in settings.\n\nWith one screen swipe, you can see an altimeter gauge with current values, our precise altitude calculation algorithms (which involve GPS, network services and calibrated pressure sensors) we deliver you the most accurate elevation info as possible, in barometric units or if you prefer, you can swipe over to metric and imperial units.\n\nThe third screen of the application has clear, accurate weather info, which includes:\n- temperature\n- wind speed\n- wind direction\n- humidity\n- cloudiness\n- dew point temperature\n- fog\n\nDevices with pressure sensors now have the possibility to switch from average elevation reported on the Altimeter screen to barometer-based elevation only You are also now able to calibrate with your own mean sea level pressure value.\n\nThe history screen has been redesigned and you can now choose from four different values - MSL pressure, ground level pressure, temperature and elevation. You can also now easily filter data according to any time span you want.\n\nA brand-new functionality of custom notifications has also been added. You can now add time-based notifications: just setup the time and days on which you want to receive notifications with current pressure values and voila. You can also set a pressure level alarm, above or below which the device will warn you. What’s even more, you can receive notifications after pressure changes by the value you set.\n\nAn autosave function is now available. You can set a time interval at which your device will automatically save pressure, temperature and elevation values to give you up to the minute information about weather changes.\n\nhttps://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/terms/barometer\r\nhttps://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/privacy/barometer"

Depending on your needs, groups can be shown or hidden in the main list view.\n\nMETAR alert notifications** is an helpful feature to stay up-to-date. Define multiple alerts for each station with the following criteria: flight rule (US NOAA), wind speed, temperature, pressure, present weather, visibility, and ceiling (BKN and OVC). Notifications will be sent to your device if the criteria is met (e.g., when wind is greater/equal 10 kts, flight rule becomes IFR).\n\nDedicated METAR/TAF** access is optionally available. METAR/TAF data comes primarily from a certified ANSP (air navigation service provider) and is provided reliably and fast from our dedicated, redundant servers (indicated by blue checkmark underneath METAR/TAF).\n\nThe AeroPix feature offers users the possibility to take quickly picture(s) of the weather at their current location. The pictures will be available to all other pilots (on the map or within an airport detail view) helping them to get a better idea about local conditions. AeroPix should be especially helpful when there's no or insufficient webcam coverage.\n\nThere's also an iMessage app included which lets you easily send METAR/TAF of any airport to other users.\n\nPlease consult our web-site for a full description of all features. In order to keep AeroWeather Lite free we added a small ad banner at the bottom of the screen. Consider getting AeroWeather Pro, subscribe the additional features**, or remove the ad banner through one-time unlock* to have an ad-free app.\n\n\n* Additional functionality which needs to be unlocked (one-time purchase). These purchases are not transferable between Lite, Pro, and Mac.\n\n** SUBSCRIPTIONS\nAdditional features which generate recurring operation costs for us will be offered within a subscription. The following features are enabled while 'First' subscription is active:\n - Dedicated METAR/TAF data source\n - Meteograms\n - Alert push notifications\n - D-ATIS (bigger US airports only)\n - Area Forecast Discussions (currently US only)\n - Home Screen Widgets for METAR, Plot, Meteogram (iOS 14 or higher)\n - Imagery and Charts (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - SIGMETs (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - METAR/TAF from ADS-B receiver thru GDL 90 protocol (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n\nWhen using AeroWeather Lite also the following features are enabled:\n - Remove ad banner\n\nThe subscription varies in time periods (1 month, 12 months). The subscription is valid in both AeroWeather Lite and Pro. Cross app subscription support is only available if iCloud (with the same Apple ID) is enabled. Previously purchased unlock features are not affected and will work with or without subscription.\n\nAuto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your account settings.

      "label": "New: Full-screen view, lock screen widgets and Apple Watch Ultra support. And widgets are back!\n\nWeathergraph is a beautiful visual hourly weather widget and forecast for Watch, iPhone, iPad, and Mac, with the Apple Watch app and complications.\nPowered by Apple Weather, Foreca, Dark Sky, Open-Meteo, and yr.no/met.no.\n\nIt shows:\n- Nowcast (real-time rain & snow forecast updated every 15 minutes – PRO only)\n- Rain & snow alerts based on nowcast data (PRO, watch-only so far, coming to iPhone and iPad)\n- Hour-by-hour temperature (main colorful line)\n- Hour-by-hour precipitation — rain, and snow (blue chart)\n- Hour-by-hour cloudiness (cloud cover) and sunshine (clouds on top + sun rays)\n- Hour-by-hour wind speed (red line) and direction (red arrows)\n- Hour-by-hour precipitation or dew point (dotted line)\n- Hour-by-hour atmospheric pressure, absolute, or rate of change (purple line or arrows)\n- Hour-by-hour UV index (rainbow dashes)\n- Real day/night (sky color)\n- Daily temperature minimum and maximum (overlaid above chart)\n- Actual temperature and place (on the top)\n- Sunrise and sunset times\n\nWho is Weathergraph for?\n\nHikers, runners, bikers, kite surfers, pilots, and many outdoor enthusiasts around the world love the at-glance readability, customizability, and reliability.\n\nWeathergraph is offline capable. The app caches the last acquired forecast for up to 24 hours, allowing you to hike or run outside the network (or go running or biking with a wifi-only Apple Watch) and still see the most recently fetched data. The data refreshes automatically once a connection is available.\n\nThe hourly forecast is updated every hour, nowcast and rain alerts update every 15 minutes. If rain or snow is expected during the next 3 hours, you will get a notice on a widget (iPhone, iPad & Mac), a large complication (Watch), and a detailed 3-hour precipitation chart in the app.\nNowcast and alerts are powered by Foreca and depend on the precision of rain radars in your area.\n\nYou can unlock professional Apple Weather, Foreca, Open-Meteo, and Dark Sky forecast sources, weather alerts, nowcast, and all styles and options via a reasonably priced subscription, which covers the cost of data and allows me to further improve Weathergraph. One-time Weathergraph Forever unlock is also available.\nThank you for your support!\n\nIf you liked Dark Sky, Weather Line, Weathertron, or Weather Strip, then Weathergraph might be the best replacement :).\n\nPrivacy policy and terms of use:\nhttps://weathergraph.app/privacy\n\nPlease note:\nSubscriptions made on Apple devices will be charged to your credit card through your iTunes account. Your subscription will automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to cancel once activated.

It also displays the current temperature and humidity.\n• Display barometric pressure (sensor value) or mean sea level pressure (MSLP - value used in weather forecast services or stations).\n• Units support for pressure: mb, inHg, kPa, atm, Torr, psi, hPa, mmHg. Units for altitude: meter, feet.\n• Calibrate the barometer using altitude/location from the GPS. Calibrate the altimeter using the nearest airport information/METAR, or manually enter the QNH of the nearest airport. Offset sensor output value.\n• Measure the height (building/mountain/hiked/climbed) using the \"Relative Altitude\" feature (can be enabled in the app's Settings).\n• Notification about pressure change. \"Notification custom rule\" for you to define how and when the app sends notifications.\nNotify when air pressure changes indicate that extreme or worse weather may occur.\n• \"Pressure Tracking\" and \"History Graph\" require \"Background App Refresh\" or \"Always Location Service\" with \"Exact update interval\" (paid feature) enabled.\n• \"My Area\" allows you to define your frequent stay places, and the app tracks air pressure with location data.\n• Export history to CSV format and Today widget (paid features).\n• This app is the digital version compared with an aneroid or mercury barometer and can be adjusted to MSLP with additional features.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE:\nYou can change your barometer/altimeter appearance with:\n• Seven different housing colors.\n• Black, white or blue disk background.\n• Four different app backgrounds.\n• Three different types of needles.\n• Marker needle for easily monitor.\n• Dark or light Today widget theme.\n\nNOTES:\n• App only works on devices with a barometer sensor, such as iPhone 6/6s/7/8/X/11/12/13 (including Plus models), iPad Mini 4/Air 2/Pro, or later.\n• Weather icons on the dial: This only shows the air pressure trend like in an analog barometer.\n• Each time your device reboots, open the app for tracking with the \"Exact update interval\" feature work.\n• You may take the phone/tablet far away from computers, cables, and other magnetic sources to get accurate results.\n\nIf you like this app, please support us - you can remove ads or unlock paid features from the menu: Shop.\nWe welcome your ideas and suggestions - please email us at: support+barometer@pvdapps.com.\nFollow our official Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/barometerplus/ or Twitter account: https://twitter.com/pvdapps."

Las cuatro variables básicas que se necesitan son las siguientes:\n\n- Hora actual: Corresponde a la hora a la cual se está realizando la estimación.\n- Hora del amanecer: Corresponde a la hora de la salida del sol.\n- Temperatura ambiente: Corresponde a la temperatura ambiente, en grados Celsius.\n- Punto de rocío: Corresponde a la temperatura del punto de rocío, en grados Celsius.\n\nAdemás de estas cuatro variables básicas existen cinco variables avanzadas, cuyo uso permite adecuar el modelo matemático para que la estimación generada sea más parecida a la realidad. Para obtener una buena estimación es necesario que las variables anteriores sean tomadas desde una estación meteorológica instalada en el lugar donde se desea realizar la estimación."

      "label": "#1 Earthquake app for iPhone and iPad.\n\n\r\n\r\nThis app is brought to you by SMS Tsunami Warning, the award-winning earthquake monitoring app since 2011. \n\r\n\n\r\nThe app turns your phone into an alert system for earthquakes and tsunamis. It monitors seismic activity worldwide 24/7 and it delivers an alert to your iOS device if conditions are met (magnitude, user’s distance from quake, etc.). Alerts are delivered as push notifications with a loud siren sound. \r\n\r\n\nAPP FEATURES\r\n\n\r\n- Live earthquake map\r\n- Beautiful simple design, easy to use\r\n- No ads\r\n- Data feeds from various sources\r\n- Metrical / Imperial measurement systems \r\n- earthquake alerts / tsunami alerts\r\n- Loud siren sound\r\n- Quake data (location, magnitude, depth, distance, population density nearby, etc.)\r\n- Great educational tool\r\n- Support for the latest iPhone and iPad models.\r\n\r\n\nThe user interface is simple and easy to use. For a better reading, the map only shows \"significant\" earthquakes (with magnitude equal to or bigger than 4.5 on the Richter scale) detected globally in the last 24 hours. In the Settings screen, you can set your parameters for receiving the alerts (ie. user’s distance from the quake’s epicenter and magnitude). After the parameters are set, you can enable (or disable) the alarm system in one touch for total peace of mind. The app supports both metric and imperial measurement systems (Kilometers / Miles) to assess distances.\r\n\r\n\nEach quake is represented by a marker on the map. Tap on the marker to open the details panel and dig more into the quake's data (depth, population estimates, etc.). The app is directly connected to our web platform, where you can learn more about a specific seismic event or, in general, get access to a vast literature concerning earthquakes and tsunamis (fault lines, features, history, etc.). \r\n\r\n\nThe app is a great educational tool and it offers a vital alert service, especially to those living by the coastline or in seismic regions.\r\n\r\n\nThe app is free and it contains NO ads. Push alerts are offered as in-app purchase for tiny $2.99 yearly fee (it may change slightly based on your country). \r\n\r\n\nEnd User License Agreement (EULA) available here: https://www.sms-tsunami-warning.com/pages/service-terms-mobile"

      "label": "***THIS APP IS BEING DISCONTINUED. PLEASE READ BELOW***\n\nOn January 31st, 2023, the AmbientTool App will be discontinued. \n\nThe AmbientTool App allows you to connect the Ambient Weather WS-2902 Weather Station Console, versions sold from December 2016 to May 2018, to your Wi-Fi router and the internet during the initial setup. \n\nIf your WS-2902 console disconnects from Wi-Fi for any reason and needs to be reconnected after the app discontinuation date of 01/31/2023, you will no longer be able to reconnect your console to the Ambient Weather Network (AWN). \n\nThis does NOT affect any WS-2902A, WS-2902B, and WS-2902C consoles purchased AFTER May 2018. These consoles utilize the Awnet App for the setup process. Moving forward, the WS-2902D will no longer require an app for internet connectivity, allowing any user to connect using an internet browser.\n\nIf you own one of the affected consoles, it will continue to work until you have to update any Wi-Fi settings; this may include a firmware update or after resetting your console. Once the AmbientTool App is sunset and you need to perform one of the above activities, your console will still showcase your weather station readings. However, the console will stop reporting your personal weather station dashboard information to AWN, including data collection and tracking.\n\nTo maintain a connection to AWN, you will need to upgrade to the Ambient Weather WS-2902D Console BEFORE January 31st, 2023. To purchase a a replacement console through the AmbientTool Upgrade Program click here: https://ambientweather.com/ws-2902d-c-ambienttool.\n\nAmbient Weather is offering a limited-time discount for those affected by this app discontinuation. You will be eligible for a $35 console rebate through the end of 2022. \n\nPlease see our support page https://ambientweather.com/ambienttool-upgrade-program for details on the app discontinuation and claiming your rebate."

En los más de diez años de existencia, SENSAR se ha convertido, además, en una red de trabajo entre profesionales con actividades formativas, divulgativas, e innovativas con el objetivo de promover la Seguridad del Paciente en el ámbito de la anestesia, el paciente crítico y el tratamiento del dolor. SENSAR colabora con la Sociedad Española de Anestesia, Reanimación y Tratamiento del Dolor (SEDAR), la Sociedad Española del Dolor (SED), la Sociedad de Anestesiología Chilena (SACh), La Sociedad Uruguaya de Anestesiología y la “Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation” (apsf), así como con otras muchas sociedades nacionales e internacionales en diferentes proyectos. .\r\n\r\n\tAdemás organiza diferentes cursos de seguridad del paciente. Una de las líneas estratégicas es el mejor manejo de las situaciones de crisis en la anestesia y el paciente crítico, por lo que en 2016 desarrolló la primera edición del Manual de Crisis en Anestesia y Pacientes Criticos SENSAR (ISBN 9788491130741).\r\n\r\n\r\n\tPITELO es la herramienta online del sistema multihospital de comunicación y análisis de incidentes de seguridad del paciente. Mediante PITELO todos los hospitales inscritos en SENSAR pueden compartir las comunicaciones, sus análisis y medidas adoptadas. Su nombre hace referencia al acrónimo de los principales factores contribuyentes que se analizan en los incidentes: Paciente, Individuo, Tarea, Equipo, Lugar de trabajo y Organización."

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

They'll love them!\n\n\"Find Them All: My Pets\" is the latest addition to our collection of educational games for children aged 2-8.\n\nWith \"My Pets\", your children will discover all about cats and dogs of all breeds and also hamsters, rabbits and other members of the family. \n\nThis multi-lingual, entirely spoken game offers numerous fun things to do:\n- Find the animals on the screen \n- Take their photos \n- Solve puzzles \n- And for the older ones, quizzes and videos!\n\nYour children will learn all about pets and have fun doing so!\n\nTHEY'RE TALKING ABOUT US\n\"A really nice game, very complete and very varied that children love from the age of two!! It means they can spend a little quiet time while still learning something and having fun.\"\n\n\"It is, without doubt, one of the best early learner apps that I've tested up to now. It is really worth trying out. Children can spend hours without getting bored and it's not for nothing because they learn lots of facts while exercising their grey cells.\"\n\nNEW\nEven more fun with the \"mic\" enabling kids to record themselves replacing the animals' name!\n\nHERE'S A THOUGHT!\nMake the game last longer by printing out game albums: cut, fold, collect!\n\nFEATURES\n- Contents: 96 animals to discover.\n- Entirely spoken: children are autonomous, even the youngest ones.\n- Multi-lingual: the names of the animals are available in several languages. You can choose to change the language in which the game is played.\n- Educational: discover animals through photos, sound, videos and audio commentary.\n- Adapted to each age group: numerous activities during short games with difficulty levels adapted to the child.\n- Safe: No adverts, no external links and a special parents' zone.\n- Multi-user: each child can have their games with their settings.\n- Printable booklet: albums can be printed and assembled through folding.\n\nHOW TO PLAY THE GAME\n- The child looks for the animals on the scene on the screen. He or she then unlocks an animated card for that animal and can listen to its name in several languages or record his or her voice.\n- They then win a camera which means they can explore the scene creating their own photo album.\n- Night falls: they must find the animals in the night, with the help of a torch…\n- And win the chance to convert their photos into a jigsaw puzzle (4 to à 42 pieces)!\n- Then comes the PhotoQuiz; they have to take a photo and answer a series of questions to win a picture of the animal.\n- And finally, they have to find the cameraman to discover videos of the animals.\n\nABOUT OUR \"FIND THEM ALL\" COLLECTION\nOur collection comprises four games with different themes: Looking for Animals, Dinosaur World, Fairy Tales and Legends and Pets. Various versions exists (with in-app purchases, as a complete version or in a bundle). \n\nHELP AND SUPPORT\nPlease feel free to contact us through the game's \"Settings\" menu or on our website www.find-them-all.com or our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/FindThemAll!"

      "label": "This interactive, beautifully illustrated and animated app for the iPHONE is perfect for the toddler or speech-delayed child who is learning how to put two-three words together or any child who is learning basic English phrases. It provides many opportunities to both hear (receptive), see, and say/record (expressive) 10 different verb + noun combinations, such as: eat the carrot, drive the train, close the door, drink the juice, sleep on the bed, turn on the light, and more. A delightful cat performs them, with 28 possible animation combinations. It is also a great way to teach the article “the” in a meaningful phrase context. \n\n**For more verb and character choices, we suggest upgrading to the full version of this app.\n\nFirst Phrases Lite includes user settings for up to 3 children.\n\nHow you play: Tell the cat what to do! By touching the illustrated parts of the phrases in order (verb+ object forms: “eat the carrot”) the child hears the pre-recorded spoken phrase modeled. The user has the option to repeat this action once, twice or three times in the settings for maximum auditory input.  The child then watches an animation of the cat performing the command to help the child associate the words and their meaning. Now it’s the child’s turn to say it and tell the cat what to do! Touch the microphone and record, listen again, and watch the animal follow your direction. Use visual support if needed by tapping the shapes above the microphone.\n\nThis format is especially powerful for children with speech delays and autism spectrum disorders who need strong visual support with as little background clutter as possible, and for use in speech therapy sessions. The format also is a terrific way to support early literacy for left to right orientation, reading (with text on feature) and word boundaries. Options include text on/text off, recording feature on/off, presentation of the phrase in 3 segments (verb + the + object) or 2 segments (verb + the object). \n\nDeveloped by noted speech-language pathologist and author of Childhood Speech, Language & Listening Problems: What Every Parent Should Know, Patti Hamaguchi, M.A., CCC-SLP.\n\nHamaguchi Apps for Speech, Language & Auditory Development is committed to bringing you the highest-quality interactive and colorful apps at the most affordable prices.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY: We do NOT collect personal data from our users and have no ads! Personal data regarding user performance on the tasks on this app are self-contained and not transmitted in any way.\n\nTo find out more about this app and our other upcoming projects, visit our website: www.hamaguchiapps.com"

      "label": "Dominoes is one of the most popular games worldwide. Although usually played as a group, it can also be enjoyed individually.\nThis version has been specifically designed with pre schoolers in mind including farm animals as a way to engage children who haven't started the process of learning to read numbers and count. This allows them to clearly distinguish each card.\n\nThe game showcases six animals: a cow, a rooster, a duck, a piggy horse and a lamb and the child is presented with the challenge of selecting and placing the correct card in the series.\n\nIn this app children will learn to:\n      - Follow instructions and maintain concentration\n      - Identify the cards and follow a sequence\n      - Develop visuospatial abilities in relation to the animals' location within the card and correctly choosing the following card in the sequence\n      - Develop the ability to relate and associate\n      - Exercise memorizing skills as the player needs to remember the dealt cards and choose the correct one\n\nFirst level is designed to teach the child the game by choosing the correct card out of two. On the second and third level the child has to choose two correct cards to complete the series. The third level introduces the double cards and their correct position in the game. The fourth and fifth levels deals the player with six cards to play a domino game. The fifth level introduces a mystery card which makes the child identify the need to draw a card from the boneyard to continue playing.\n\nThis game has been designed by preschool teachers with ample teaching experience."

Peppa likes playing with her friends, going to school, learning ballet, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George, but most of all she loves jumping in muddy puddles.\n\nABOUT Entertainment One\nEntertainment One (eOne) is a market leader in the creation, distribution, and marketing of award-winning kids' content that connects with families around the world.

      "label": "There's never been a better time to get into Astronomy! Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text. This app never transmits data from your device.\n\n\nNote: Non-English localizations focus on solar system objects and constellation names."

From sunup to sundown, Toca Life: Farm is fun on the farm!\n\nEXPLORE LIFE ON THE FARM\nThe four locations in Toca Life: Farm will give you everything you need to tell your farm stories. Tend to the animals in the barn — feed them and clean up their poop! Once you've taken care of the animals, head to the house, where you can have a meal then grab your banjo for an impromptu jam session.

Harvest your produce and head to the store, where you can sell your food, make new products and buy goods!\n\nTURN YOUR HARVEST INTO FOOD\nPlant your seeds and find out how to make them grow! Tinker with your tractor to see what it can do! The food machine magically turns your raw ingredients into food: Use milk to make cheese, then use the cheese and corn to make cheese puffs! Use berries to make jam, wheat to make bread, and then use those ingredients to make donuts! Discover all the foods you can make and how you can make them!\n\nCREATE AN ORIGINAL VIDEO OF YOUR STORY\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice as you’re telling the story, along with your characters’ movements. Create farm videos up two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share later!\n\nFEATURES:\n- Explore four locations: barn, house, field and store.\n- Create stories for 29 new characters plus all the animals!\n- Feed the animals, milk the cow and gather eggs from your hens.\n- Bottle the milk from the milk tank.\n- Help the vet check the animals.\n- Let the pigs (or people!) wallow in the mud.\n- Clean up different types of animal poop!\n- Grab the banjo, fiddle, guitar or washbucket bass and jam into the night!\n- Pick fruit in your orchard.\n- Farm your crops from planting to harvest.\n- Use your tractor's different functions to farm faster!.\n- Fire up the food machine to turn your harvest into food.\n- Record your stories in the app and share with your friends!\n- No time limit or high scores — play for as long as you like!\n- No third-party advertising\n\nWE LISTEN\nSo many of you asked for a farm in the Toca Life series, and we're excited to give you what you want!

It is a world that we cannot see but that is literally all around us.\nThe Architecture of Radio is a 360 degree data visualization of what this world might look like. It shows the cell towers, GPS satellites and Wi-Fi routers around you that allow us to live our digital lives.\n\nNew: support for Iphone X, XR, XS and XS Max Screens\nNew: Cardboard support!\nImmerse yourself in the Infosphere in Virtual Reality using a cardboard or compatible headset*\n\n*Carboard support only for iPhone. iPhone 6s or newer recommended for best performance.\n\nWhy should I use this app?\n\nOut of curiosity! We are increasingly dependent on a global ecosystem of digital signals. We use them for so many things, yet we cannot see them. We can see the roads we use to travel, the buildings we live in, but not the infrastructure that is changing the world. How can we understand this world without understanding how it works? \nThe purpose of this app is to make the invisible visible so we can look at it, think about it and discuss it.\n\nWhy Should I not use this app?\n\nThis app is not a measurement tool. It’s purpose is to inspire, to see the world through a different lens. The app is based on real world data and gives you a pretty good idea of the density of digital signals around you, but it won’t tell you where to move the couch to get a better WIFI signal.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is a data visualization, based on global open datasets of cell tower, Wi-Fi and satellite locations. Based on your GPS location the app shows a 360 degree visualization of signals around you. The dataset includes almost 7 million cell towers, 19 million Wi-Fi routers and hundreds of satellites.\n\nIs this really what radio signals look like?\n\nWe can’t see radio with our eyes. The waves that we use for our cell phones and Wi-Fi are way outside the spectrum of visible light. In order to “see” radio, it has to be interpreted or translated into an image that we can see. There are many ways to do that but it will always be an interpretation.\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is an impression of the infosphere, a way of seeing it."

      "label": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training. It is yet another beautifully designed and easy-to-use app for kids“ by lilmagoolie.com"

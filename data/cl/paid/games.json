      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out \"Papa's Freezeria HD\" for iPad!"

A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English.

      "label": "In 911 OPERATOR, you take on the role of an emergency dispatcher, who has to rapidly deal with the incoming reports. Your task is not just to pick up the calls, but also to react appropriately to the situation – sometimes giving first aid instructions is enough, at other times a police, fire department or paramedics’ intervention is a necessity. Keep in mind, that the person on the other side of the line might turn out to be a dying daughter’s father, an unpredictable terrorist, or just a prankster. Can you handle all of this?\n\nPLAY ON ANY CITY IN THE WORLD*\n\nCheck out thousands of cities from all around the world. The Free Play mode lets you choose a city to play on - the game will download its map, along with real streets, addresses and the emergency infrastructure. You can also try the Career mode, which contains 6 cities with unique events – survive an earthquake in San Francisco and save Washington, D.C. from bomb attacks.\n\nMANAGE TEAMS\n\nA number of police, fire department and paramedic units are at your disposal. The forces may use a variety of vehicles (from common ambulances to police helicopters), essential equipment (e.g., bulletproof vests, first aid kits and technical tools) and consist of team members with different abilities.\n\nPEOPLE’S LIVES ARE IN YOUR HANDS!\n\nMain features:\n\n- Over 50 recorded dialogues inspired by real calls: serious and dramatic, but sometimes also funny or annoying.\n- Real First Aid instructions.\n- Opportunity to play on any city in the world!\n- 6 selected cities in Career mode, featuring unique calls and events.\n- More than 140 types of reports to encounter.\n- 12 types of emergency vehicles (including helicopters, police cars and motorcycles).\n\n***\n(!) The game requires Internet connection to download free maps. The offline game is available after downloading the maps.\n(!) The game does check the user's location once to propose a city for download. User's location is anonymous and not stored. \n\nAll map data © OpenStreetMap authors\n\n* The term “city” is used within the meaning of OpenStreetMap service and relates to urban areas described as “city” or “town” therein."

Push through the glitchy arcade game to reveal that you are at your own Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria!\n\nBrowse our catalogs and purchase your first attractions and animatronics, customize your decorations, and above all make sure that all the equipment is working properly before opening the doors of your brand new Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria!\n\nAfter a busy day, wrap up the paperwork and shut down your business (often late into the night as you build your own business!) Be careful, however, of what could possibly lurk in the air vents. If anything should catch your attention, turn your flashlight straight into the vent to repel it, Fazbear Entertainment supplies batteries free of charge to all of its franchisees!\n\nThe next day, assuming you have survived during the night, reinvest your income from yesterday in new equipment. Develop your little pizzeria, day after day, to see it become an empire of catering and entertainment! Fazbear Entertainment provides its franchisees with all the tools and knowledge necessary to create and manage a welcoming, secure and profitable location.\n\nOh and if you feel up to it, try to salvage some of the animatronics that wander outside your restaurant. They are trying to get in for months now, better not miss on the opportunity to pick up spare parts and rake in some additional revenue. If you detect any instability or aggressiveness in any of them, use the self-defense taser that Fazbear Entertainment provides free of charge to all of its franchisees.\n\nThis puts an end to the assistance that we are legally obligated to provide. Fazbear Entertainment cannot be held responsible for the disappearances, deaths or mutilations that may occur as a result of operating the Freddy Fazbear's Pizza franchise.\n\nDon't wait any longer and start today!\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English.

Grill, stack, and serve burgers in a brand-new way!  \r\n\r\nYou're left in charge of Papa Louie's famous Burgeria, where you'll learn to take orders, grill patties, add toppings, and serve burgers to all of your crazy customers.  You need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls that feel just right in the palm of your hand: Head to the Order Station to keep an eye out for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Grill Station to drag patties onto the grill and flip burgers to cook them evenly.  Jump to the Build Station to carefully craft your sandwiches with toppings and sauces exactly how they ordered, and deliver the finished burger to earn points and tips!\r\n\r\nEach Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the burger-building process.  With full multi-touch support, the process is more fun than ever before!  Tap many burgers at once to flip them all on the grill, or keep one finger on the Build Station's bin slider for even better precision when building.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up. As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Burgeria!  Papa's Burgeria To Go also features unlockable toppings that aren't available in previous versions!\r\n\r\n**NEW FOR PAPA'S BURGERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  Use buttons in the top corners to switch Order Tickets without having to drag them back and forth.  You can also view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nGRILL STATION - We've made keeping track of your burgers easier than ever, with Timers stuck in each burger patty that you can read at a glance, showing the cooking time and how each side is cooked.  You can also buy Alarms in the Shop to add onto each Timer, so you'll get an alert when it's time to flip or remove a burger.  With multi-touch support, you can quickly flip and remove burgers by using multiple fingers.  Try a triple-tap to flip three patties in a row!\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - With a traditional drag-and-drop system, your finger would block your view, so we've completely changed the Build Station to work on smaller screens.  You'll swipe a carousel of Topping Bins across the top of the screen, and slide it carefully to line up toppings with the burger below.  Simply tap on the bottom of the screen to drop a topping from the bin above!  You can also tap a button to swap your Topping Bins with Burger Bins, which hold all of the patties you've cooked on the grill.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the bottom of the screen, so stacking burgers is a breeze!\r\n\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on burger shop game in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between grilling, stacking, and serving\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- Over 60 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- Over 50 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.

      "label": "Things get messy when you’re stuck running a wildly popular pizza parlor in Papa’s Pizzeria To Go! Top, bake, and serve pizzas in this award-winning game that’s reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.\n\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the pizzeria, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Topping Station to add a variety of toppings to each pizza.  Move to the Bake Station to cook the pizzas in the oven until they're baked just right.  Jump to the Cutting Station to cut the pizza into perfect slices.  Each station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the pizza-building process.\n\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Pizzeria!  A well-crafted pizza also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\n\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S PIZZERIA TO GO **\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers don't get in the way of the action!\n\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\n\nTOPPING STATION - We've completely redesigned the Topping Station for smaller screens.  Bins of toppings can be scrolled with your thumb, which allows us to have many more toppings than in the original game.  Tap on a bin to select that topping, then tap multiple times on the pizza to add items directly onto the pizza.  You don't need to drag individual toppings onto the pizza, so you can top faster than ever!  A quick swipe on the pizza will send it off the to the Bake Station.\n\nBAKE STATION - Papa Louie's coal-fired oven gets an upgrade!  You can buy new Oven Alarms in the Shop to help you keep track of pizzas in the oven.  Simply drag an alarm onto one of the oven timers, and you'll hear an alert when that pizza is cooked just right.  Buy new Oven Boosters to cook your pizzas even faster than before!\n\nCUTTING STATION - When it's time to cut pizzas, simply touch and drag a line across the pizza to decide where to cut.  If you want even more control to fine-tune your slices, you can also cut using multi-touch!  Use two fingers or thumbs to move each end of the line at the same time, and release to slice your pizza.  If you're having trouble cutting pizzas at the right angle, buy a variety of Cutting Guides in the Shop to cut that perfect slice!\n\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients which can't be found in the original Papa's Pizzeria.  As you play the game, you'll unlock 26 unique ingredients to serve your customers!\n\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR LOBBY - You can spend your hard-earned tips in the Shop, where you can find a variety of posters, furniture, and wallpaper styles for your lobby!  Use the brand-new Lobby tool to add items to your restaurant, and move and arrange them however you like!  Choose from over 140 customization items, and every item you add to the lobby will improve your Waiting Score for your customers!\n\nUPDATED FEATURES - Serve picky closers at the end of the day, earn paychecks as you play, and try to please the finicky Food Critic to earn a Blue Ribbon!\n\n**GAME FEATURES**\n\nHands-on pizza shop in the Papa Louie universe\nAll new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\nMulti-task between topping, baking, and cutting\nShop to buy upgrades, furniture, and posters using your in-game tips\nNew Lobby Editor to customize and decorate your shop\n90 customers to unlock with unique orders\nChallenging Closers and Food Critic\n75 in-game achievements to earn\n\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens."

      "label": "\"Catan\", the legendary strategy game provides gaming fun anytime, anywhere.\n\nTrue to the original game, you can compete with up to four players for the most settlements, the longest roads and the largest army. You can trade with each other and claim the precious land with all its resources.\n\nThe game allows you to challenge other Catan fans online via cross-platform multiplayer to prove your strategy skills or play against the AI:\nVarious computer opponents, each with their own individual characteristics, will prove themselves worthy competitors: the pirate Jean, who knows no compromise, Vincent the merchant, who never allows himself to be cheated, Sean the knight, who takes what is rightfully his...\n\nThe popular Catan expansions \"Seafarers\", \"Cities and Knights\" and two new special scenarios are available as In-App purchases.\n\nThe complete Seafarers expansion includes more than 10 additional scenarios with an extensive campaign. Become Harbormaster, discover new islands and extra game elements like ships, gold fields, treasures and pirates. Ahoy!\n\nThe Cities and Knights expansion introduces various new gameplay mechanics that add even more variety to Catan. Invest new trade goods in city improvements to build one of the three metropolises of Catan – but beware of the barbarians attracted by Catan’s new wealth! You’ll need your best knights to fend them off! C&K contains a short campaign and 7 challenging maps.\n\nExciting adventures await you in the two new scenarios \"Enchanted Land\" and \"The Great Canal\". Vanquish dragons and bag their treasures or build a canal to help barren grain fields bloom once more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Available languages: English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese\n- Original \"Settlers of Catan\" rule set\n- Update 4.0+: Synchronous online multiplayer games\n- Smart computer opponents with individual strategies\n- Scrollable game board including zoom option \n- Freely combinable game settings \n- Game statistics\n- Comprehensive tutorial\n- Seafarers LITE: New scenario \"The 4 Islands\" and two additional game variants\n- Cities and Knights LITE: Test the new expansion in the scenario “The first Island”\n- 3 different graphic sets to choose from\n\n\n***** \nCatan FAQ: \n\nQuestion: An expansion seems gone after an update or reinstallation of Catan or after restoring the device? \nAnswer: Don’t worry! Your initial purchase is already saved in your iTunes account. You can restore your InApp purchases by selecting the restore-option in the Catan IAP menu. \n\nQuestion: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating or restoring my device. Is there any way to restore it? \nAnswer: When saved games can’t be automatically restored, we’ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter „CatanWarp*“ (* = 1–15) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1–15). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well. \n\nQuestion: Are dice rolls really random? \nAnswer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We’re avid Catan players ourselves. We’ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game! \n\n*****\nQuestions or suggestions for improvements: \nMail to ios@usm.de \nWe are looking forward to your feedback! \n\nFor more information on news and updates: www.usmgames.com \nor visit us on www.facebook.com/UnitedSoftMedia and twitter.com/USM_News \n\n*****"

      "label": "Awarded Best Handheld Game of 2008. Discover the title that launched a legacy!\n\nWith over 17 million units sold worldwide, discover the original title that shaped the puzzle-adventure genre and launched a legacy. Digitally remastered in HD for mobile devices and with new, never-before-seen animated cutscenes, it’s time to run the cerebral marathon with Professor Layton and the Curious Village.\n\nThe tale begins as Professor Layton, a true English gentleman and famous archaeologist, drives to the remote settlement of St Mystere with his apprentice, Luke, in response to a request from the widow of a wealthy baron. The baron’s will indicates that the family treasure, the Golden Apple, is hidden somewhere within the village, and whoever finds it will inherit the whole of the Reinhold Estate. The Professor and Luke must search the town for clues leading to the precious heirloom.\n\nFeaturing a distinctive artistic style that oozes old-world charm, the game’s quirky cast of characters instantly comes to life. The animated cutscenes, remastered in HD, tell key parts of the tale in gorgeous detail. And ever-present in the background, the original soundtrack, beloved by many players, keenly captures the mood of the Layton universe.\n\nWith puzzles created by Akira Tago, author of the ‘Atama no Taisou’ (lit. ‘Head Gymnastics’) books, Professor Layton and the Curious Village brings together more than 100 brain teasers including slide puzzles, matchstick puzzles, and even trick questions to flex players’ observation, logic, and critical thinking skills. In addition, rather than just selecting challenges from a list, players uncover puzzles through conversations with the villagers or by investigating their surroundings. \n\nIf you are obsessed with mind-bending puzzles, Professor Layton and the Curious Village is for you!\n\nGame Features: \n• 1st instalment of the Layton Series\n• Over 100 puzzles, designed by Akira Tago, that can be tackled on the way to solving the case\n• New!

You no longer have to fantasize about being a goat, your mobile dreams have finally come true!\n\nGameplay-wise, Goat Simulator is all about causing as much destruction as you possibly can as a goat. It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff. more! When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game. \n\nDISCLAIMER\nGoat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n* You can be a goat \n* Get points for wrecking stuff - brag to your friends that you're the alpha goat \n* MILLIONS OF BUGS! We're only eliminating the crash-bugs, everything else is hilarious and we're keeping it \n* In-game physics that bug out all the time \n* Seriously look at that goat's neck \n* You can be a goat"

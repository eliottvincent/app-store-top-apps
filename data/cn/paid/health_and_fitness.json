I love this app so glad I found it \nnauf4l: was planning to buy a 100$ jump rope which counts skips as i always do 5k skips a day. So after a month was considering this when i came across this app after installing 5 apps of the same.Glad i paid about 2$ for this as it is totally worth it. \nFrankWurst: Accurate jump counter based solely on Apple Watch. App integrates into My Health and Activity App seamlessly. Great product.\ntafty：I enjoy the skipping experience with this app. And it syncs well with Apple Watch\n\nContact me\nE-mail:89208242@qq.com\nTwitter: @haozes\nTelegram Group: t.me/yaoyaonow  \n\nDesign by Haozes\nThanks for the translation: 橙子、金小粉、孟金羽、蔡沛森、Adgar, Fabio Carrilho, Tomás Feliú Ribeiro, Francesco Tirsi, Leonard Pitt Diehl, Zhimin Yang, Massimiliano Benini,Radu Ionescu,Andrés Leon,Dikran Jessaijan, Krishna"

      "label": "AutoWake is the first haptic smart alarm for your Watch. \n\nIt can wake you up by tapping you on your wrist using your Watch's haptic engine. You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

      "label": "Cardiograph is an application which measures your heart rate. You can save your results for future reference, keep track of multiple people with individual profiles, add notes and locations, and even print out your measurements for sharing or safe keeping.\n\nCardiograph uses your device's built-in camera to take pictures of your fingertip and calculate your heart's rhythm - the same approach used by professional medical equipment!\n\n\"I know you have the disclaimer on the screen but I don't care, Cardiograph saved my life. Your app was key to understanding what was going on and help the doctors understand too.\"\nBob Spadafora - *****\n\n\"Comparing heart rates with family over the holidays is fun.\"\nTxyak – ****\n\n\"Wanna impress a friend with a cool app. This is the one to get.\"\nMattyray – *****\n\n\"After having two heart valve replacements and a by-pass, I feel it is not only smart - but also necessary - to have such a reliable heart rate monitor with me everywhere I go.\"\nDantv – *****\n\n\"I am an EMT and it helps me actually see what is going on. It is by no means definitive like a monitor but it is a great indicator of problems I would not see otherwise.\"\nGranniem – ****\n\n\"I had a pulse oximeter on one hand, medical quality, and my iPhone app in the other and the app was dead-on accurate.\"\nLike it but hate it – *****\n\n\n=== See Cardiograph in action ===\nhttp://macropinch.com/cardiograph \nhttp://youtu.be/isIjcCFYEho\n\n\n• Measure your heart rate\n\nIt's never been easier to know what your heart rate is! Without any external hardware, just using the built-in camera of your smartphone or tablet, you can get accurate readings almost instantly.\n\nKnowing how fast your heart is beating can be very useful when exercising, if you're under stress, if you have a heart-related medical condition, or even just out of curiosity.\n\n\n• Track your results\n\nEvery measurement you take is saved to your personal history, so you can keep track over time. In addition to the date and time of the measurement, you can also save the location at which it was taken (and see them on a map), and even add a quick note to effortlessly organize your history.\n\n\n• Multiple profiles\n\nCardiograph is perfectly tailored to allow multiple people to use the app on a shared device. You can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them has their own individual measurement history.\n\n\n• Export & Print\n\nEach measurement can be exported in full detail to a portable format that you can later send via e-mail, upload on the web or even print right from the app itself (with an AirPrint™ compatible printer).\n\n\n• Clean and intuitive design\n \nInspired by real-life medical equipment, Cardiograph is a pleasure to use. The streamlined and clutter-free design makes it seem instantly familiar, so you can focus on using the app instead of navigating through series of confusing screens.\n\n\n• Built-in user guide\n\nIf you're having trouble with the app, or you want to make the most out of it, you can access the comprehensive help manual right from within the app itself.\n\n\n• Universal application with iCloud® sync\n\nCardiograph is an universal application - it runs on the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod touch.\nInstall Cardiograph on multiple devices with iOS 5.0+, and all your profiles and measurements will be in sync! Manage your profiles and measurements on one device, and the changes are instantly reflected on all the others.\n\n\nPlease note: If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\n\n\nFollow the latest news:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch \nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

Try the free DanceTime Lite app!\n\nCheck out DanceTime Deluxe on YouTube\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax9bnvKIh3E\n\n** FEATURES **\n***** 26 Different Dance Rhythm Patterns - swipe or tap to select\nPercussion Only - leave it running as long as you want and the rhythm stays constant\nDanceTime Deluxe contains 26 different rhythms: American Tango, Bachata, Bellydance, Bhangra, Breakdance, Cha Cha, Flamenco, Foxtrot, House, Jive, Kizomba, Lindy Hop, Mambo, Mambo On2, Merengue, Paso Doble, Quickstep, Reggaeton, Rock and Roll, Rumba, Salsa, Samba, Street, Tango 2/4, Tango 4/4 and Waltz. \n\nThe tempo is fully variable, so some of the rhythms can be used for more than one dance. For example, a slow Samba works well for a Bossa Nova, and the Waltz pattern can be used for English, Viennese etc.\n\n***** Variable Tempo / Speed\nThe tempo slider in DanceTime Deluxe allows the speed of playback to be changed in one bar-per minute increments from extremely slow to very fast. It is designed to take each pattern from absolute beginner to professional and beyond so you can adjust the tempo as you progress with your dancing. Learn your dance steps then practice at your pace.\n\n***** Instructor Counting in Normal or Bar Mode\nWhen you are learning to dance it is really handy having your instructor count the steps for you. DanceTime Deluxe has a counting feature that works in Normal (1234...1234...) for normal dance practice, or Bar (1234...2234...3234...) mode for choreography up to 8 bars.\n\n***** Tempo Display in Both Bars and Beats-Per-Minute\nMusicians tend to work in beats-per-minute, whereas dancers mostly work in measures, or bars-per-minute. With DanceTime Deluxe, it's easy to convert between the two, whatever the time signature of the dance.\n\n***** Metronome\nDanceTime Deluxe also features a metronome. This is a useful tool for musicians, or when you don't want the rhythm of the dance, but simply the bars and beats marked out sonically.\n\n***** Restart Button\nUse the Restart Button in conjunction with the tempo slider to bring DanceTime Deluxe in time with the piece of music you're listening to. You can even use it to measure the BPM of the music. \n\n********************************************************\n\nEach of the rhythms in DanceTime Deluxe has been crafted with world class dancers, choreographers and producers to ensure that you are dancing to the key elements of each dance rhythm. That's not just one, but 26 different dance styles covered by this app!\n\nWhatever dance you're learning or teaching, DanceTime Deluxe has the rhythm for you."

But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance.

HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling.

Taptanium™ certified nature audio comes from the best sources such as Hawaii and has been mastered to perfection with the highest attainable level of attention to detail, utilizing artificial intelligence to detect even the most distant human-made noise intrusions that humans are almost incapable of recognizing under normal conditions. Only the highest quality nature sounds in the world are able to receive this certification.\n\nAway features Taptanium™ neural 3D audio™. If you put on headphones, Away can create an incredible sense of immersion. The nature and water plays all around you, not just on your ears. This is called externalization, and it's encoded in a way that your brain naturally decodes as if you were there.\n\nYou will sleep, relax, meditate and focus better with Away because Away masks unwanted noise. Your ears will love Away because Away plays soothing high-quality nature sounds recorded in 3D. Your eyes will love Away because the forest comes as a motion-controlled 3D parallax illustration with daytime transitions. Get the great sleep and productivity you deserve.\n\nHear the wind and leaves swirling all around you, birds singing during the day, Hawaiian Coqui frogs singing at night and distant American Bull Frogs resonating through the valley. Get closer to the river or waterfall or retreat to the calm pond in the back with ducks during certain times of the day. In the morning, listen to the funny sounds of wild Hawaiian chickens recorded on the beautiful Garden Island of Kauai in 3D. Hear birds waking up and birds singing happily. Away is a treasure chest of sounds. And if you like, blend in music specifically composed and conducted for Away in Hollywood.\n\nAway includes so many things:\n• The Great Away Forest with a great variety of nature sounds to discover\n• Find your favorite spot to listen or sleep within the forest\n• Change the time of day and hear the soundscape adapt\n• Unlimited playback time, infinitely looped (very long loops)\n• Taptanium™ neural 3D audio™ (incredibly immersive)\n• Taptanium™ certified quality nature audio\n• Mixer: Mix and match some extra nature sounds and music\n• Adjustable fade-out and sleep timer\n• Full background audio support\n• Universal app for iPhone and iPad\n• No in-app purchases\n• No subscription\n• Beautiful audiovisual experience\n• Music composed for Away in Hollywood\n• NEW: Optimized for iPhone X, XR, XS & XS Max, 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max & iPad Pro!\n\nGet Away today, sleep great tonight!\n\n\n≈ Questions? ≈ \nTweet @taptanium, email franz taptanium com or send an email through the in-app contact support page.

It has to be a walk or a run to provide enough heart rate data for the prediction algorithm to work.\n2. The workout app must be used with GPS enabled.\n3. This app must be connected to the Apple Health app so that the recorded data can be displayed in the watch app, the complication or on the iPhone.\n\nWith iOS 14, you can display the widget on the home screen of your iPhone to see the latest measurement directly.\nThis app only works with an Apple Watch Series 3 or later!"

      "label": "The Scoliometer by Spiral Spine allows users with scoliosis to measure their ribcage and vertebral rotation. \n\nBy using the app regularly, users can determine which therapies decrease their spinal rotation. \n\nThis Scoliometer may also be used to determine whether scoliosis may be present.\n\n\nHow it Works:\n\nThe Scoliometer by Spiral Spine quantifies the rotational aspect of scoliosis and pinpoints the highest degree of rotation for each curve.\n\nBy measuring the spinal rotation before and after different exercise and spinal therapy sessions, users can determine if the body responded favorably to that session, and to what degree (through a decrease in rotation and a lower Scoliometer degree reading).\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Easy-to-use: three simple steps to get your reading\n1. The person with scoliosis stands in front of the person holding the mobile device with the Scoliometer app. \n2. The person with scoliosis slowly reaches their hands towards the floor, bending forward through the back.\n3. The person with Scoliometer app pulled up on their mobile device puts their thumbs under either side of the phone while looking at the app. They rest their thumbs on either side of the spine and slide the phone down the person’s back in front of them while they roll down.\n• Accurate: doctors can use it along with home users\n• Informative: users can save their previous results on their own to show changes over time by saving a screen shot of the Scoliometer at the highest degree of curvature\n\nTips:\n\nNot sure if you have scoliosis? Get the app to find out if your spine has rotation. If your readings show that rotation is present, make an appointment with your doctor to confirm if scoliosis is present. Then, use the Scoliometer regularly to track your rotation."

Disconnect together for as long as you want and do something fun and useful with your time without your electronic devices.\n\nOFFTIME also has a PRO version that, in addition, will answer you: \n\n- Schedule more than one rest at a time\n- You can create different blocking profiles to block the calls from the contacts that you wish to select while you are doing an OFFTIME.\n- Access backup copies of all your devices, so that no matter what device you use, your OFFTIME time is registered and disconnected on all your screens.\n\nThe OFFTIME team is working to improve the versions of our application, so that each time more is disconnected and you can dedicate yourself to everything that the mobile has taken from you.\n\nWhat are you waiting for to return to a life free of devices?

This application may have utility in clinical and research settings\". -J Phys Ther Sci. 2018 Jan; 30(1): 31–36.\n \nThis easy to use HIPAA compliant application is made for Chiropractors, Physical and Massage Therapists, and Fitness Professionals who wish to objectively and quickly evaluate the posture, movement, and body composition of existing or prospective patients at a health/spinal screening or any patient/client encounter. PostureScreen with its’ upgrade modules, can accurately assess the status of patients/clients and be used for prescribing corrective exercises according to the screening results. The solution encompasses analysis of Posture analysis, Body Composition analysis (both 2D and 3D analysis available) and Movement Screens (such as SquatScreen and PushUp Screen) that drive proper quantifiable objective measurement and documentation with uniform assessments. Once the analysis and exercise selection is performed, the client will receive a secure email with links to their private exercise portal to view not only still images but streaming video of their corrective protocols. Findings from the assessments are generated as both objective reports in PDF format as well as annotated jpg images, both which can be uploaded into 3rd party management software and EHRs. \n \nFEATURES:\n• Computer Vision Ai Assisted Assessments for Supported Devices\n• 1-View Quick Screen, 2-View Posture Assessments, 4-View Posture & Seated Assessment\n• Patient/Client Friendly Educational Posture and Body Composition Reports & Trend progress reports\n• Movement Screen: SquatScreen, Push-up Screen analysis links to possible underactive and overactive muscle groups with auto-exercise correctives suggestions (WebExercises Account Required)\n• Movement Screen comparison videos - side by side video analysis with annotations of overhead squat and pushup.\n• Video capture + annotation tools.\n• LeanScreen 2D Photographic Body composition analysis - uses proprietary photographic anthropometric measuring techniques. Calculate Body Fat percentage, BMI, BMR, Waist to Hip Ratio\n• LeanScreen 3D - Capture and analyze your client in true 3D! This provides same measurements of LeanScreen 2D but adds circumferential measurements of your client! (Structure Sensor Required)\n• WebExercises Platform integration for \"Suggested Exercises\" correctives based on findings (WebExercises Account Required!)\n• Pain Diagram \n• Customize email templates and PDF document text\n• SyncScreen HIPAA Compliant Cloud Service multi-device backup and Sync (subscription)\n \n*LeanScreen, SquatScreen, Comparison Module, Edit Report, SyncScreen, demographic export, pain diagram, SitScreen, 3D analysis are UPGRADE modules. App uses credits for assessments if not under subscription, the initial download comes with 25 credits. You will need to purchase additional credits or use subscription when you run out of credits. 3D Module is currently iPad only and requires Structure Sensor. You must have WebExercises account for Exercises Prescriptions.  Computer Vision Assisted Digitization only available under Unlimited Subscription for devices on iOS15 or later. \n\nPrivacy: http://postureanalysis.com/privacy-policy/\nTerms of Use: https://www.postureanalysis.com/end-user-license-agreement.html"

      "label": "健身大全及计划是一款针对健身爱好者的健身应用。训练部位包括背部、胸肌、手臂、肩部、腿部、腹部等，器材包括哑铃、杠铃、拉力器、综合器械等140多个的训练项目，可以按照训练计划进行完成，项目也可以在家里通过哑铃和拉力器等完成。 \n主要功能： \n1.动画教程：身体各大主要部位，按器材分类的动画教程。 \n2.参考计划：来自健身教练推荐的25个参考锻炼计划。满足不同的爱好者的需要。 \n3.训练记录：保存属于您的健身数据，并且随时查看。 \n\n注意事项： \n1． 健身是一个循序渐进的过程。 在一般情况下，初次参加健身训练的人都会感到兴奋，特别是当锻炼出效果的时候。这在很大程度上激励着你的训练热情与行动。但是，有一些人一进健身房就迫不及待地投入大强度的训练，而忽视了运动前的热身；甚至经常过度训练，把自己弄得精疲力尽，从而影响了正常生活和工作。忠告：健身是个长期的工程，不要想一天就成为你心中的那个偶像。 \n2． 训练前后，两次用餐必不可少。 早晨醒来和训练之后，是你进餐的两个重要时段。在刻苦训练的同时，你需要增加营养，如果你的早餐没有吃饱的话，你在稍后的训练中就会感到饥肠辘辘。早餐应该包含较多的糖类和一些蛋白质。此外，低脂酸奶、牛奶和谷类食品也是上佳选择。在训练之后，你应该立即进食，因为这时你的身体急需补充所消耗的能量。进食同样应包含糖类、蛋白质、水等。 \n3. 训练要多样化 它可以使你的身体机能均衡的发展。有氧运动虽对增强耐力和心血管系统有好处，但对增长力量、强壮身体作用较小。柔韧性训练也不只属于女性。只有将各种训练结合起来，才能全面地提高身体的素质。 \n4. 热身、伸展运动是前提 训练之前要做伸展运动，伸展之前要热身。首先，做10分钟左右低强度有氧运动，形式可选择快步走、蹬车等。这不仅可以提高身体温度作好运动准备，而且还能减少在做大强度运动时受伤的机会。当身体组织变暖以后，你可以再做5~10分钟伸展运动，尤其是要伸展那些将要用到的目标肌肉群和身体部位。 \n5. 恢复（休息）对训练来说，也是同样重要的。 在训练期间，必要的恢复时间是不能忽视的。因为身体需要充分的休息以恢复状态。作为一个初练者，不要在一周内进行多于4次的大强度训练。在同一个训练日，相同的肌肉组织不要多次剧烈训练。若在之前的训练中出现疼痛，在后面的训练中就不要勉为其难。每天保持至少8小时的睡眠，因为足够的睡眠会使你的精力和身体得到恢复。 \n6. 不要反复做同样的训练动作。 身体与训练的关系是刺激、调整、适应。若长期使用相同的动作，身体会逐渐从而使训练出现停滞期。应不断变换训练动作或形式，以达到最佳运动效果。\n离线浏览，不用联网也可以浏览，速度快，无广告。"

And because each limb moves independently, your core has to brace harder to prevent you from tipping to one side.\n\nHow To Do It: Perform as straight sets, completing all the prescribed sets for one exercise before moving on to the next. On all one-handed (or one-legged) moves, repeat with opposite limb."

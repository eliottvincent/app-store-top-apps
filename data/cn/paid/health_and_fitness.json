I love this app so glad I found it \nnauf4l: was planning to buy a 100$ jump rope which counts skips as i always do 5k skips a day. So after a month was considering this when i came across this app after installing 5 apps of the same.Glad i paid about 2$ for this as it is totally worth it. \nFrankWurst: Accurate jump counter based solely on Apple Watch. App integrates into My Health and Activity App seamlessly.

You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

      "label": "Cardiograph is an application which measures your heart rate. You can save your results for future reference, keep track of multiple people with individual profiles, add notes and locations, and even print out your measurements for sharing or safe keeping.\n\nCardiograph uses your device's built-in camera to take pictures of your fingertip and calculate your heart's rhythm - the same approach used by professional medical equipment!\n\n\"I know you have the disclaimer on the screen but I don't care, Cardiograph saved my life. Your app was key to understanding what was going on and help the doctors understand too.\"\nBob Spadafora - *****\n\n\"Comparing heart rates with family over the holidays is fun.\"\nTxyak – ****\n\n\"Wanna impress a friend with a cool app. This is the one to get.\"\nMattyray – *****\n\n\"After having two heart valve replacements and a by-pass, I feel it is not only smart - but also necessary - to have such a reliable heart rate monitor with me everywhere I go.\"\nDantv – *****\n\n\"I am an EMT and it helps me actually see what is going on. It is by no means definitive like a monitor but it is a great indicator of problems I would not see otherwise.\"\nGranniem – ****\n\n\"I had a pulse oximeter on one hand, medical quality, and my iPhone app in the other and the app was dead-on accurate.\"\nLike it but hate it – *****\n\n\n=== See Cardiograph in action ===\nhttp://macropinch.com/cardiograph \nhttp://youtu.be/isIjcCFYEho\n\n\n• Measure your heart rate\n\nIt's never been easier to know what your heart rate is! Without any external hardware, just using the built-in camera of your smartphone or tablet, you can get accurate readings almost instantly.\n\nKnowing how fast your heart is beating can be very useful when exercising, if you're under stress, if you have a heart-related medical condition, or even just out of curiosity.\n\n\n• Track your results\n\nEvery measurement you take is saved to your personal history, so you can keep track over time. In addition to the date and time of the measurement, you can also save the location at which it was taken (and see them on a map), and even add a quick note to effortlessly organize your history.\n\n\n• Multiple profiles\n\nCardiograph is perfectly tailored to allow multiple people to use the app on a shared device. You can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them has their own individual measurement history.\n\n\n• Export & Print\n\nEach measurement can be exported in full detail to a portable format that you can later send via e-mail, upload on the web or even print right from the app itself (with an AirPrint™ compatible printer).\n\n\n• Clean and intuitive design\n \nInspired by real-life medical equipment, Cardiograph is a pleasure to use. The streamlined and clutter-free design makes it seem instantly familiar, so you can focus on using the app instead of navigating through series of confusing screens.\n\n\n• Built-in user guide\n\nIf you're having trouble with the app, or you want to make the most out of it, you can access the comprehensive help manual right from within the app itself.\n\n\n• Universal application with iCloud® sync\n\nCardiograph is an universal application - it runs on the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod touch.\nInstall Cardiograph on multiple devices with iOS 5.0+, and all your profiles and measurements will be in sync! Manage your profiles and measurements on one device, and the changes are instantly reflected on all the others.\n\n\nPlease note: If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\n\n\nFollow the latest news:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch \nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

However, some people live a normal life with blood oxygen levels below 95%. \n\nThe Apple Watch can estimate your percentage of oxygen in your bloodstream and stores the data in the Health Store. With the Oxygen Saturation app, you always see your latest value directly on your wrist. This App supports all complications, so make your Apple watch a real Fitness Gadget!!\n\nHow to Use:\n-\tATTENTION: Oxygen Saturation only works if you have an Apple Watch Series 6, because this Apple Watch has the sensor you need to measure your oxygen saturation.\n-\tThe app needs to connect with the Apple’s Health app to display the recorded data on your Apple Watch, as complication or your Iphone.\n-\tUsing iOS 14 you can add a Widget to your home screen on your IPhone to display the latest measurement.\n- In case you are still not receiving any data, please open your Apple Health App and check if it is able to measure your oxygen saturation."

You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling.

      "label": "健身大全及计划是一款针对健身爱好者的健身应用。训练部位包括背部、胸肌、手臂、肩部、腿部、腹部等，器材包括哑铃、杠铃、拉力器、综合器械等140多个的训练项目，可以按照训练计划进行完成，项目也可以在家里通过哑铃和拉力器等完成。 \n主要功能： \n1.动画教程：身体各大主要部位，按器材分类的动画教程。 \n2.参考计划：来自健身教练推荐的25个参考锻炼计划。满足不同的爱好者的需要。 \n3.训练记录：保存属于您的健身数据，并且随时查看。 \n\n注意事项： \n1． 健身是一个循序渐进的过程。 在一般情况下，初次参加健身训练的人都会感到兴奋，特别是当锻炼出效果的时候。这在很大程度上激励着你的训练热情与行动。但是，有一些人一进健身房就迫不及待地投入大强度的训练，而忽视了运动前的热身；甚至经常过度训练，把自己弄得精疲力尽，从而影响了正常生活和工作。忠告：健身是个长期的工程，不要想一天就成为你心中的那个偶像。 \n2． 训练前后，两次用餐必不可少。 早晨醒来和训练之后，是你进餐的两个重要时段。在刻苦训练的同时，你需要增加营养，如果你的早餐没有吃饱的话，你在稍后的训练中就会感到饥肠辘辘。早餐应该包含较多的糖类和一些蛋白质。此外，低脂酸奶、牛奶和谷类食品也是上佳选择。在训练之后，你应该立即进食，因为这时你的身体急需补充所消耗的能量。进食同样应包含糖类、蛋白质、水等。 \n3. 训练要多样化 它可以使你的身体机能均衡的发展。有氧运动虽对增强耐力和心血管系统有好处，但对增长力量、强壮身体作用较小。柔韧性训练也不只属于女性。只有将各种训练结合起来，才能全面地提高身体的素质。 \n4. 热身、伸展运动是前提 训练之前要做伸展运动，伸展之前要热身。首先，做10分钟左右低强度有氧运动，形式可选择快步走、蹬车等。这不仅可以提高身体温度作好运动准备，而且还能减少在做大强度运动时受伤的机会。当身体组织变暖以后，你可以再做5~10分钟伸展运动，尤其是要伸展那些将要用到的目标肌肉群和身体部位。 \n5. 恢复（休息）对训练来说，也是同样重要的。 在训练期间，必要的恢复时间是不能忽视的。因为身体需要充分的休息以恢复状态。作为一个初练者，不要在一周内进行多于4次的大强度训练。在同一个训练日，相同的肌肉组织不要多次剧烈训练。若在之前的训练中出现疼痛，在后面的训练中就不要勉为其难。每天保持至少8小时的睡眠，因为足够的睡眠会使你的精力和身体得到恢复。 \n6. 不要反复做同样的训练动作。 身体与训练的关系是刺激、调整、适应。若长期使用相同的动作，身体会逐渐从而使训练出现停滞期。应不断变换训练动作或形式，以达到最佳运动效果。\n离线浏览，不用联网也可以浏览，速度快，无广告。"

And because each limb moves independently, your core has to brace harder to prevent you from tipping to one side.\n\nHow To Do It: Perform as straight sets, completing all the prescribed sets for one exercise before moving on to the next. On all one-handed (or one-legged) moves, repeat with opposite limb."

The next day, Lil Wayne may take over.  Get a unique, up-beat playlist every time you run.  \n\n** Keep the perfect pace **\n\nPrefer a consistent pace? No problem. You can easily set a pace for yourself.  You can even include a warmup song if you'd like.\n\n** It's YOUR music. **\n\nA run is a terrible time to have to skip through tons of songs you don't like.  Everyone's got their own taste in workout music.  That's why the app plays YOUR music from YOUR iTunes library.\n\n** It's here to help. **\n\nNeed a speed boost while you're running?  Just press the speed buttons in the app.  Cooling down? Press the down arrow.\n\nGot a song that helps get you going?  Set it as a \"Pump Up Song\" and you can play it when you need it the most.\n\n** It's super smart. **\n\nThe app learns which songs you don't like while running & it stops playing them.  Simple as that.\n\nWant more control?  You can also set a blacklist of songs that you don't ever want the jog.fm app to play.\n\nIf you love a song, you can flag it during or after your run and it'll be played more often.\n\n** It plays nice. **\n\nDo you use other fitness apps like RunKeeper or Nike+ (in \"outdoor\" mode)?  Just launch the other fitness app first, then launch jog.fm.  Works like a charm.\n\nIn Nike+, make sure you go to \"Settings\" and be sure to turn off \"Music Tied to Run Controls\"\n\n\n** Please Note **\n\nThe jog.fm app must remain on top with the screen on while running.  \n\nDo not turn your screen off while running.\n\nThis app is not a streaming service.  It plays music from your iTunes library.\n\nThere is a one-time setup that will take about one minute (depending on the size of your library).  The app needs to analyze your songs to figure out which ones to play.  An internet connection (WiFi recommended) is required for this setup step because the app is powered by the Echo Nest.\n\nThis app is not yet compatible with iTunes Match.  It'll work, but you may find some long gaps between songs.  \n\nThis app is for running or walking.  We are working on adding more workouts soon!\n\nPlease do not run or walk in traffic."

It is useful to read this section before starting the exercises.\n\nSettings - Choose your favourite tone, turn vibration on/off, and show/hide info text while doing breathing exercises.\n\nMore info - Visit the website and read more about Anant Yoga Foundation and this application.\n\nIf you have any further questions or comments, please, feel free to contact us at yogi_anantpal@hotmail.com"

E.g. 7 day average Weight, Step Count from last 24 hours, Yesterday walking distance. All data types have many period types to choose from\n- Configure unit\n- Set custom icon, from a selection of more than 100 icons\n- Complication second line can show icon, unit, or can be hidden\n- Set colors, separately for value and icon (only for multicolor watch faces)\n- Option to hide unit\n- Complications update every 20 minutes, if it's not enough you can open the app any time to see the most up-to-date data\n- Standalone watch app means there is no iPhone app, you can configure everything on your watch\n\nPrivacy:\nThe application only stores data needed for your complications, and stores this data locally, on your watch. The app never connects to the internet or any 3rd party service.\n\nTroubleshooting:\n - Application doesn't show on Watch after purchase:\nPlease go to the App Store on your Watch (not iPhone) and find the app here either by searching the name, or by going to Account (at the bottom), Purchased, and download the app from here.\n- Application/complication shows 0 for some data:\na) There is no data in Health for that type and period.\nb) You didn't authorise HealthKit access on the first launch. On your iPhone go to Health app > Account > Privacy > Apps > Health Glance.\nc) New data added on your iPhone takes couple minutes to sync with your watch."

      "label": "iDrumTune Pro is the world’s most advanced, accurate and intelligent system for assisting and educating on drum tuning – used by thousands of drummers all over the world. Now with Drum Kit Designer feature and detailed online tutorials.\n\nFeatured in Modern Drummer 'New and Notable' - July 2018  \n\n\"an invaluable aid not only for drummers but also studio engineers and producers\" - Sound on Sound Magazine\n\n\"I can’t recommend this app highly enough ... for the money, it is indispensable. It's simple, accurate, looks good, and the tuning information is worth the cost of the app alone.\" - www.mikedolbear.com\n\n“***** I never knew I could have this much fun tuning drums!” – Adamrod (App Store review)\n\n“***** Just tuned my first drum and this app is awesome!” – bburt85 (App Store review)\n\n“***** Buy this app if you are a drummer!!!” Lildrummerboy (App Store review)\n\nThe original and most innovative electronic drum tuning app - iDrumTune Pro brings unrivalled accuracy and features that have never been possible before for assisting with drum tuning. Built by world experts in drums and musical acoustics, and backed up by a detailed online training course on Drum Sound and Drum Tuning.\n\niDrumTune Pro includes the following features:\n\n* Pitch Tuning – to make your drums sing and allow you to play musical phrases around the kit\n\n* Lug Tuning – to ensure that the drumhead is evenly tuned and gives a smooth and warm tone\n\n* Resonant Head Tuning – to allow you to be sure that the two heads are working together and giving rich overtones\n\n* Spectrum Analyzer – so you can really start to understand what frequencies are excited and heard when playing the drums\n\n* Drum Kit Presets – so you can save and load your favourite tunings and share them with the world. Now also includes the interactive Drum Kit Designer feature.\n\n* The Science of Drum Tuning – and extensive manual on the science and art of drum tuning and getting the best out of iDrumTune Pro \n\niDrumTune is the first and by far the most intelligent and accurate system for analyzing drum sounds and assisting tuning – developed by drummers, music producers and acoustics research Professors. iDrumTune provides you with a measurement of the drumhead vibration frequency, much in the same way to an acoustic guitar tuner which measures the vibration frequency of a guitar string. In Pitch Tuning mode, you simply hold the iPhone over the center of a drum, about 2-4 inches away, and strike the drum in the center.\n\nThe iDrumTune readout shows the recorded sound waveform and gives the strongest frequency recorded. There is also a tuning indicator bar which shows the drumhead tuning relative to musical notes, so iDrumTune can be used to ensure that your drums are in key with each other or the song you are playing. A frequency spectrum view also allows more detailed analysis and helps with tuning the drum at the lug positions.\n\niDrumTune provides advanced tuning features including an intelligent filter function, Lug Tuning mode and Resonant Head Tuning mode. The filter allows unwanted frequencies to be ignored by the analysis algorithm, whilst Lug Tuning mode offers the simplest and most innovative method for tuning an even frequency response at the lug positions on the drumhead.\n\nThe Preset Manager allows you to save all your favourite drum tunings and call them up when you are in the middle of the process. Drum kits can also be exported and imported, so you can share your favorite tuning setups and load new ones in from other drummers.\n\nDrum Tuning isn’t easy, and drums don’t respond exactly the same way every time you hit them. For that reason, it's valuable to know a little about the science of drum tuning. iDrumTune includes a comprehensive text on the science of drums and drum tuning in order to help you get the best of iDrumTune and to become an expert drum tuner!\n\nWatch the iDrumTune tutorial videos and read reviews on iDrumTune at www.idrumtune.com"

Or create your own sound palette by recording the sounds around you into Note’s sampler instruments using your phone’s microphone. \n\nIf you want to take your ideas further, use Ableton Cloud to send your projects to Live (version 11.2.5 or later) without leaving the app. Open your project from Live’s browser, then keep working – you can edit all your MIDI notes, and all your samples and sounds from Note are exactly the same.\n\n\nBegin with a beat: \n• Choose from 56 Drum Sampler kits\n• Tap out a beat using the 16-pad grid\n• Quantize your beat to fix any loose timing\n• Nudge notes to correct mistakes\n• Add more layers of rhythm\n• Create beat repetitions with Note Repeat\n• Change parameters to shape your sound\n• Experiment with effects \n\nStart with a melody:\n• Choose from 261 synth sounds and 36 Melodic Sampler instruments\n• Play your melody or chord progression with either the 25-pad grid or the piano roll\n• Set a key and scale to get instantly harmonic results, or leave your options open\n• Overdub more layers of harmony\n• Change parameters to shape your sound\n• Add effects to experiment with sound design\n\nSample your environment:\n• Create your own kits by recording percussive sounds into Note’s Drum Sampler \n• Record tonal sounds to create your own Melodic Sampler instruments\n• Manipulate your samples by cutting, filtering or repitching them\n• Shape or transform your sounds with effects\n\nCapture improvisations:\n• Play something, then tap the Capture button to keep it\n• Play at the tempo that feels comfortable and Note will detect it\n• Note will recognize the length of the phrase\n• A loop is created automatically\n• Quantize it, add to it, or change the sound\n\nCreate variations:\n• Note features a grid-based Session View layout\n• Double your loops to create variation within clips\n• Duplicate your clips and create different versions of your ideas\n• Create eight tracks with up to eight clips on eight scenes\n• Try different layer combinations and song structures \n• Export your work in Session View as an audio file to listen and share"

Frequency spectrum store & load, RT60 store,  and Chart store. Stored files can be sent as Email.\n\nIncludes ISO Octave Calibration feature - corrects for your device's microphone response. Also includes wideband calibration. The calibration discs are moved up or down so as to obtain a flat response, and match the overall SPL to that of an external meter.\n\nUse: home theater, audio engineer, car audio, etc\n\nOnline manual at: https://sites.google.com/site/bofinit/iaudiotool\n\nPlease join the AudioTool Discussion Group to request features or report problems:\n\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/audiotool-discussion-group\n\nAudioTools's Spectrum Analyzer component uses FFT on batches of samples recorded at the microphone. Hann windowing reduces aliasing. Recorded spectra may be stored as files in the device memory, and then loaded later and displayed together with the live spectrum. \n\nThe \"Store\" button will store the current live spectrum. The \"Load\" button brings up a list of stored spectra. One of these can be chosen, or the \"Cancel\" item selected to return to the main display, or the \"Clear\" item selected to remove the currently loaded spectrum.\n\nData collection can be paused and restarted.\n\nThe deciBel meter component uses IIR filters and exponential averaging to calculate Flat, A and C weighted response at speeds of Fast, Medium and Slow.\n\nA pair of cursors can be shown on the RTA and Chart Recorder displays: each can be moved to any position, and will display the SPL & time/frequency values measured there. Initially, both cursors are positioned mid-screen - simply drag them to a new position with the fingertip. The cursors can be turned on and off in the Menu.\n\nThe loudspeaker polarity checker can be used to check whether a loudspeaker is wired in phase: connect the AudioTool output to the speaker under test, select \"Polarity\" from the signal generator screen, then return to the RTA screen. If the speaker is out of phase (polarity reversed) AudioTool will show \"Pol ---\", otherwise \"Pol +++\" if the speaker is in phase.\n\nThe Noise Criteria (available from the Menu) function shows  a set of NC contours overlaid on the 1/1 Octave RTA display and the calculated real time current NC value is also shown.\n\nThe Chart Recorder shows a moving trace of the SPL measurements over the last few minutes.\n\nReverberation (RT60) measurements can be made by starting the RT60 component and using a loud clap (or similar) to trigger the measurement. RT60 times measure how much reverberation or echo there is in a room or auditorium.\n\nThe Signal Generator generates White and Pink Noise, Sine, Square, Triangle and Ramp waves, and Impulses. The generator uses multiple cycled buffers that are refreshed randomly so ensuring truly random White/Pink noise. The Pink Noise algorithm uses Kemmet's method to adjust White Noise into Pink.\n\nSine/Square/Ramp/Triangle Frequency can be set via the arrow buttons or directly entered using the keyboard.\n\nThe Impulse signal is a delta, issued approximately once per second. \n\nThe accuracy in frequency of the generated periodic signals is quite good: on the iPad, errors were of the order of 1% throughout most of the range. Sine wave fidelity is good throughout most of the audio range. Other signals' leading and trailing edges show ringing and decreasing frequency response artefacts in the upper ranges.\n\nDisclaimer: iAudioTool's performance depends on the iPad/iPhone hardware, and is not guaranteed to meet any audio measurement or safety standards."

[build in subtitle is also supported]\n\n* Extra Features\n\n- USB Sync: Use itunes to fast sync movies to GPlayer.\n- WIFI Upload: Upload movie even you don't have the cable.\n- File Management: Support New/Rename/Cut/Paste/Delete.\n- Movie Thumbnail: Easy to find the movie you want to view.\n- Different Play Mode: Support Loop off/Loop One/Loop all.\n- Screen Lock: View your movie even on the bed.\n- Dynamically Menu: Dynamically choose audio/subtitle channel and encoding method.\n- Gesture support: Easier way to do seek while playing the movie.\n- Resume Function: Don't worry about closing your application suddenly.\n- TV Out: Both cable TV out and AirPlay are supported.\n- iTunes Backup: By default, we will not backup media data when you do iTunes sync or iCloud backup, and you can't see the files in iTunes, you can enable it in the settings page to backup your media data.\n\n* FAQ\n\n- How do I put files into GPlayer? \nTo add files to your GPlayer app, you have to go to iTunes, and select the “Apps” tab. At the bottom of this page, there’s a “File sharing” section – just select GPlayer in the list, and add files from there. Note that you don’t have to sync your iPhone or iPad to iTunes to add movies. Just drop files in the “File sharing” tab, and they’ll be uploaded immediately. You can even use a friend’s iTunes to add videos to your own iPhone. Also, adding files over WiFi is supported. Indeed, WiFi is significantly slower than USB, and ruins the battery life.\n\n- What kind of streams does GPlayer play? \nGPlayer is able to play RTSP and MMS streams. For now those can’t be added to the media library, but you can click an RTSP or MMS url in Safari or Mail for example.\nIf you want to use GPlayer to open HTTP/FTP streaming, add \"gplayer:\" prefix in the URL.\n\n- I want to explicitely open an attachment with GPlayer? \nIf you want to watch an attachment in GPlayer(from Mail for example), just do a long press on the attachment. A menu will pop-up that will let you pick GPlayer as a player.\n\n- iTunes won’t let me install GPlayer on my iPhone or iPod Touch? \nUnfortunately, we had to drop support for older iOS devices such as the iPhone 3G or the first two versions of iPods. Indeed, after some testing, we realized those weren’t fast enough to provide a pleasant experience.\n\n- Why HD MKV movies don’t play smoothly? \nCurrently, only iPad 2 supports 720p MKV file, that’s to be expected. The other iDevices have limited computing power, and cannot handle the complex task of decoding HD movies in real time.\n\n- The audio and the video is not in sync? \nThat is because the CPU is not power enough to do video decoding, you can try to enable \"Skip Frame\" in the settings page.\n\n- Is there a TV-out support? \nYep, supports iPod gen4, iPhone4, iPhone4S and iPad 1/2.\n\n* Contact us\n\nMail: gplayersupport@hotmail.com\nWebsite: gplayersupport.wordpress.com\n\n* If you want to help to translate GPlayer to your mother language, just drop a mail to gplayersupport@hotmail.com, that will help people in your country enjoy this software, and we will put your name in thanks page!"

Under one year’s reforming and improving, the UI and practicality of our products both have a very big promotion. Our target is that make every customer who choose us feel satisfaction and comfortable. \nWe trust we will be the best and looking forward to get your feedback on our products.

      "label": "This app is a speaker polarity tester. Find out if your speakers are wired correctly (in phase or out of phase). Test your surround speakers, stereo speakers, PA speakers, in fact any speaker with wiring terminals on the back.\n\nThis speaker polarity tester was designed by the same people who built the Audio Toolbox, and the polarity tester in that unit was known as the most accurate and reliable polarity tester available. Now that technology is available in your iPhone. \n\nUse this app to test your home speakers, recording studio monitors, or as part of your professional contractor work. Speakers wired backwards are the most common error in sound system setup, cause big problems, and are easily corrected. This app will give you the answers, no matter how difficult the wiring may be to trace. \n\nSpeaker Pop works by watching for a proprietary \"pop\" sound from the speaker, and doing DSP analysis of the sound to determine if the speaker cone is moving in the correct direction.\n\nAs long as you use a standard 1/8\" stereo plug, you can use any normal 1/8\" to RCA adapter to get the signal into your system. You can also to record the \"pop\" test signal to a CD, DVD, or another iPod, and play this signal through your speakers. \n\nWorks with iAudioInterface and iTestMic.\n\nSelect the speaker type filter, Woofer, Midrange, or Tweeter. This selects either a 125Hz, 500-2000Hz, or 8000Hz filter, to make the readings more reliable.\n\nOnce you have the test signal coming out of the speaker, position your phone near the speaker (we suggest you flip it over to point the internal mic directly at the speaker -- the display will flip). In a few seconds you will get the reading on the screen, either a Plus or a Minus. Plus indicates correct speaker polarity, Minus means you need to swap the wires coming into the speaker.\n\nWe also have stereo and surround test signals available for download from our web site which are ready for burning to CD or DVD. See our web site or for more information. Note that iDVD will not burn encoded surround files, a more advanced DVD burning authoring program is required. Some folks have had success with Toast. We also sell test DVDs on our web site.\n\nSee our other audio apps: AudioTools, our premier audio and acoustics test and analysis app, SPL, the professional grade sound level meter for the iPhone, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real time analyzer, FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the Energy Time Curve app, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time analysis, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator. Watch for more coming soon."

Tuner T1 Pro also comes with a handy Tone Generator that plays any musical note as reference for tuning. A must-have tool for musicians.\n\n• Simple to use with all the essential features.\n• Live pitch graph displays the exact pitch, note and deviation in realtime.\n• Extremely accurate (can be tuned to an accuracy of ±0.1 cents).\n• Tone generator that can generate reference tones over a note-range of 3 octaves.\n• Ability to set the frequency of A₄ (for tunings where A₄ is not 440 hertz).\n• Option to visualize pitch on piano keys.\r\n• Option to set detection latency - By setting a lower latency value, pitch detection will be faster. This works great for cases like vocal practice. By using a higher latency, pitch detection will not respond to momentary unintended sounds and noise (works great for instrument tuning).\r\n• Smart Detection - Use machine learning to enable pitch detection only when certain instruments or vocal sounds are detected."

      "label": "Chord! is a chord and scale reference that works with any fretted instrument like guitar, basses, ukulele, banjos,… It computes and analyses all the possible fingerings for chords, scales, and arpeggios.\n\nWith Chord!, you can also write a song by simply dragging and dropping chords, transpose it in any key, compute the fingerings with any tuning and generate a beautiful print-ready PDF, etc.\n\nYou can also import your existing songs in text format (please note that the app does not ship with songs). You can also link audio tracks from your music library and play them at the same time while adjusting their pitch and/or speed.\n\nYou don't even have to know music theory to use it: behind its brute force, the app knows how to handle by itself some subtleties of music to give meaningful results.\n\nIf you don't have to be an advanced player to use the app, you can however take a look under the hood and tweak the parameters if you like! Whatever is your level or your instrument, Chord! will adapt and give you the most precise answer.\n\nYou can search for any chord, split (like D/F#), or not. If you're a beginner, you can choose the chord from a list, but you can also use the intelligent keyboard to enter the chord as it is written. If this keyboard is a great way to enter chords, it is also very useful to discover and understand how the chords are formed. You can also enter some notes on a neck to find which chords it can be. You can hear how each fingering sounds. Chord arpeggios are also supported, as well as drop voicings (drop 2, drop3, etc.).\n\nThe app also ships with the biggest list of named scales (and you can create your own scales). It analyses and presents them with nice interactive views (scale, score, and keyboard). Of course, it can also lay down these scales on a neck (with sound) and compute their fingerings. Like for chords, you can even search for a scale from its fingering!\n\nEach scale can be harmonized (decomposed into chords). You can also enter a sequence of chords to find which scale you can use to improvise onto.\n\nYou can use one of the hundred tunings that ship with the app, or you can add your own ones, for any instrument, with or without a capo, even with broken strings if you want!\n\nThe app uses custom and unique algorithms to generate charts, easily input complex harmonic structures, extract chords from fingerings, determine finger positions, compute keys of scales, generate chords from scales and find scales that go well with some chords.\n\nFor example, Chord! is the right tool in these situations:\n• You want to have your songbook available at any time, in your pocket;\n• You're a beginner and you want to know how to play easily a D/F# chord;\n• One gave you a ukulele and you want to know how to tune it and how to play the G Hawaiian scale;\n• You want to know on what scale you can improvise for some chord sequence (and the answer can be different than the Pentatonic minor!);\n• You want to print your song and share it with your band.\n• You want to experiment with this nice open tuning, moreover with a bottleneck;\n• Your little sister can't make bar chords and you want to show her how she can do without bars, with three (little) fingers only;\n• You want to impress your little sister by showing her how you can play the same chords with two bars!\n• You want to understand how this fingering for C13 is actually a fingering for C13;\n• You broke a string and want to know how to play some chords without;\n• You want to know how Django managed to play with two and a half fingers.\n\nThe app fully supports left-handed instruments.\n\nMain functions of the app:\n- Write, transpose, fingerize, print, and share songs;\n- Search chord fingerings (or chord charts);\n- Search chords from fingerings;\n- Search scale fingerings;\n- Search scales from fingerings;\n- Search chords from scale;\n- Search scales from chords."

Whether you've built up your collection for decades or just got sent an album full of b-sides of your favorite artist, you need a place to carry your own music.\n\nLet Doppi be that place. Doppi (pronounced doh-pie) raises the bar in iOS app design in an essentially simple music player, built just for your local music files.\n\nEnjoy your music with: \n\n• A beautifully simple interface\n• Fluid gesture-based navigation\n• Always-reachable search and playback controls\n\nSupports MP3, M4A, FLAC, and more. Browse and play music:\n\n• Received via AirDrop\n• Copied from the Files app\n• Shared from other apps (selecting \"Copy to Doppi\")\n• Added to the Doppi folder in Files or via iTunes File Sharing\n• Synced from iTunes\n• Downloaded from Cloud Music Library\n\n————\nImportant: \nDoppi does not support Apple Music offline downloads outside of Cloud Music Library.\n————\n\nWith Doppi:\n\nBig, Beautiful Artwork\nYour music's artwork takes center stage on the Now Playing screen and throughout your library.\n\nMake It Your Own\nChoose from 6 highlight colors and 32 beautiful icons, switch between 4 light and dark themes, rearrange your library tabs, and more—all from Preferences.\n\nSearch From Anywhere\nPull down from anywhere in your library to invoke Search. Hit Return to instantly trigger the top result.\n\nPlay and Add Quickly\nPlay an album or artist right from the library using their embedded Play buttons, and add songs to Up Next using the Add (+) buttons.\n\nMark Your Likes\nTap the heart on the player (or choose Like from a menu) to Like tracks. Liked music appears in the Liked Songs playlist, Liked Albums on Search, and is more likely to play in Shuffle All.\n\nMake Playlists\nCreate all-new playlists, duplicate them, or copy them from Apple Music. Tap and hold on anything to add those songs to a list.\n\nAdd Lyrics\nSearch for lyrics on the web right from the app and add them to your songs. Enjoy them on Doppi's beautiful player interface.\n\nManage Your Music\nEverything in your library has useful actions — just tap and hold to reveal a menu. For example, if you're not feeling some of your music, you can exclude it from Shuffle All, hide it from your library, or delete it (if it's from imported files).\n\nLess, But Better\nEvery screen in Doppi has been carefully designed with clean typography, pleasing contrast, and elegant motion. Enjoy your music without unnecessary distractions.\n\nEasily Readable\nDoppi fully supports Dynamic Type and includes high contrast themes, so your eyes won't get in the way of your ears.\n\nContinue Album\nEver shuffled your music, found a song you loved, and wished you could keep playing the album without stopping the song? Doppi can make it happen — just navigate to the album and press Play.\n\nGive your music the lovely home it deserves.\n\n————\nImportant:\nDoppi does not include any music. It was designed to play the music files that you own and that you transfer manually to your device. It does not support music from any streaming service."

      "label": "Stage Plot Maker helps you build clear, readable stage plots to communicate your band's technical requirements to a sound engineer. You can build a collection of stage plots for different kinds of gigs, then print or email them directly from your mobile device.\n\nA tablet is recommended for building stage plots. Once you build a stage plot, you can copy it to your phone for quick access on the go.\n\nStage plots can include a diagram to show the placement of elements on stage; numbered input and output lists; a list of other required items like chairs and music stands; the name and photo of each performer; notes for the sound engineer; and your contact info.\n\nThe app includes graphics for the following items:\n\n- Inputs: vocal mic, instrument mic, area mic, clip mic, kick drum mic, DI box, XLR input\n- Outputs: wedge monitor, spot monitor, fill monitor, in-ear monitor, headphone amp\n- Instruments: amp, cymbal, drum, kick drum, keyboard, grand piano, pedal steel, xylophone\n- Other: stairs, riser, stool, chair, music stand, horn stand, guitar stand, guitar rack, power outlet, mixer, laptop, isolation panel, fan\n\nThis app does not include graphics for small instruments that performers carry with them onto the stage, only large instruments like keyboards and drums that require prior placement on stage. The app design assumes that graphics for smaller instruments clutter stage plots and are relatively unimportant to the sound engineers and stage techs who will use them. Instead of a graphic for these instruments, stage plots can include a graphic for the input they use (a mic or DI box) with a custom label like \"trumpet mic\" or \"DI for acoustic guitar.\"\nIf you do not agree with this approach to stage plot design, or if you want to make stage plots that look different from the examples shown in the screen shots and demo video, you should select a different app.\n\n*** If you have a problem or a suggestion, please contact me before writing a bad review. I respond promptly to all emails and posts in my support forum. ***"

      "label": "EōN is a new relationship to \"recorded\" music as we have always known it by immersing the listener in an endless sound (and visual) experience, like an album whose duration would have no fixed limit.\n\nEōN produces an infinite music, in constant evolution, abundant in variations, composed by electronic music pioneer Jean-Michel Jarre, accompanied by a constant progression of organic visual elements.\n\nOnce the EōN app is activated, you will listen and watch a new unlimited music experience constantly unfold, designed to be absolutely unique for each listener, always different each time the app is launched.\n\nYou can enjoy a different journey everytime, listening as many times and as long as you want, the only limit being your device’s battery!\n\nIn addition, once downloaded, EōN is fully autonomous requiring no internet connection. Thus it is possible to launch the app anywhere and at any time.\n\nJEAN-MICHEL JARRE ABOUT EōN:\n  \"-Eon- the name of an ancient Greek God associated with unlimited time and eternity.\n\nI named this project EōN as it symbolizes exactly what it is: an infinite musical and visual creation, which offers to everyone a unique experience, which will never happen again: on each device and each activation of the application EōN, you will hear and see an ever-evolving orchestration of music and visuals. EōN is an endless organic work, never repetitive, that will live and grow indefinitely at your fingertip.\n\nLike in life, every moment lived in EōN will never happen again.\n\nPersonally, I truly feel that EōN is probably one of my most exciting creative projects since Oxygene. I always wanted to create a specific music for each listener, able to evolve constantly in terms of rhythms, tones, tempo, melodies and textures. Here it is. EōN is conceived and composed as a different journey for everyone, with no end determined.\n\nI had a clear idea of the organic, living visuals I wanted to accompany my music, and I was very lucky to spend some time in Tokyo at Sony Computer Science Laboratories, Inc. (Sony CSL), where I discovered Alexis André and his singular visual world. Sony CSL with Alexis have conceived and developed an algorithm generating an endless flow of ever-evolving graphics, which, like the music, are infinite and never repeatitive.\n\nThe algorithm and audio engine that orchestrates the music of the EōN app have been engineered by Alexis Zbik & Vianney Apreleff from BLEASS after defining the rules of the system together. \"\n\n\nCREDITS\nConceived and composed by Jean-Michel Jarre\nDigital Graphics by Alexis André of Sony Computer Science Laboratories, Inc.

Enjoy these key features:\n\n• 50+ essential, hand-picked licks (various genres)\n• Color-coded \"Smart Tabs\" for FAST learning\n• NO videos (videos are a slower way to learn licks)\n• Real audio recorded by real musicians\n• Each lick is split into smaller, easier parts\n• Half-speed playback\n• Landscape mode for longer tabs\n• Metronome toggle to keep time\n• Loopable parts\n• Lick Store w/ Voodoo Fire & Metal Masters add-ons\n• Mystery Pack (Get 25 free licks by sharing the app)\n\n...And coming soon over the next few updates:\n\n• Fingering notations for all tabs\n• Backing tracks for all licks!!!\n• iPad version\n\n---------------------------\n\nIntroducing \"Smart Tabs\". \n\nThe heart and soul of Guitar Lick Master lies in our revolutionary \"Smart Tabs\". Each lick features an interactive, color-coded tab that drastically simplifies the lick learning process. Most licks only have 3-4 parts total - you'll be amazed how quickly you pick them up, and how easily you remember them! \n\n---------------------------\n\nFaster Learning Without Videos\n\nSince the 1980's, video tutorials have been one of the most common ways to learn guitar licks. But as a modern teaching aid, video has some severe limitations. While sometimes informative and entertaining, passive, non-interactive videos are an extremely inefficient way to learn this type of material; the only way to control what you learn and at what speed is by pausing and rewinding countless times until it sinks in. \n\nWatching an instructor sit and play *feels* productive, but it actually creates more work than is necessary and as a result is very time-consuming. For starters, their guitar is usually facing the wrong direction (unlike playing in front of a mirror). This requires your brain to flip the image. Multiple camera angles are a nice touch but with a maximum of two eyeballs, most humans can only watch one camera angle at a time. If we want to see the whole picture we have to pause and rewind again and again. The worst aspect of videos though is that licks aren't broken down into easy-to-learn parts for the viewer; the instructor usually just plays through it a few times from memory and expects you to rewind the video until you memorize it. After wasting months pausing and rewinding lick tutorials, we realized something was wrong. The world needed a modern solution!\n\n---------------------------\n\nHere's a little test: Which number do you find easier to read?\n\n5557874634\n\nvs \n\n555-787-4634\n\nThe second one is easier to read and will be easier to remember too. Why? Because it's organized and broken down into smaller parts. This is precisely the simple technique we've applied to every lick in Guitar Lick Master!\n\nDownload Guitar Lick Master and start building up your arsenal of awesome licks today!"

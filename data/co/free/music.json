This initial version comes with four different instruments: Egg, Shaker, Tambourine and Bells. Just swipe the screen to change between them.\n\tUnlike similar apps, Rassel is based on a unique audio rendering engine that accounts for continuous velocity changes based on how the sampled instruments are agitated. The device’s gyroscope is directly mapped to this velocity which makes any movement sound the way a real instrument would. We’ve tried to fine-tune the app to be as lifelike as possible, both in sound and handling response. We think we got pretty close.\n\nFeatures:\n- Instruments: Egg, Shaker, Tambourine and Bells \n Choose between loose, normal or tight setting\n- There is also a loudness boost option"

      "label": "The guitar tuner app used by professional guitar makers, guitar repair shops and musicians around the world. \n\nThe app listen and analyze the sound in real time from the built-in mic, headset, guitar clip on or from any other external microphone. It is so accurate that it will be your best friend for guitar intonation!\n\nBecause Pro Guitar Tuner is chromatic you can tune most types of stringed instruments. \n\nHigh-quality samples of real instruments are also accessible (i.e. tune by ear if preferred!). A massive library of different tunings for guitar, bass, balalaika, violin, ukulele and more makes it easy to find more qualities and characteristics from your instrument. \n\nThe interface:\nTo make it more intuitive, we give you information about the current pitch in many different ways:\n\n*Cents for the current pitch\n*A red/green light indicating the closest pitch\n*A note wheel corresponding to the chromatic scale\n*A fretboard with the current tuning setting displayed\n\nStandard guitar is set as default but the guitar tuner can be used to tune many different instruments, such as: \n*Guitars - Standard, 4-string, 5-string, 7-string, 8-string\n, 9-string, 10-string, 11-string, 12-string, and 13-string guitar\n*Bass guitars - Standard, 5-string bass and 6-string bass\n*Ukuleles - std (Soprano), Pocket, Concert, Tenor, Baritone, Bass, and Contrabass\n*Banjo - 4-string, 5-string, 6-string\n*Mandolin family - Mandolin (Soprano), Piccolo, Mandola (alto), Octave Mandolin (tenor), Mandocello (Baritone), Mandobass, Irish Bouzouki, Cittern, and Greek Bouzouki\n*Violin family - Violin, Viola, Cello (violoncello), Double bass and 5-string Double bass\n*Balalaika family - Prima, Piccolo, Secunda, Alto, Tenor, Bass and Contrabass\n\nAfter you have selected an instrument you choose a specific tuning. The app provides you with over 200 custom tunings.\n\nThe tuning options are divided into groups to make them easier to find. For guitar, the categories are:\n*General tunings\n*Raised tunings\n*Lowered tunings\n*Dropped tunings\n*Double dropped tunings\n*Major open tunings\n*Minor open tunings (cross-note)\n*Modal tunings\n*Miscellaneous tunings\n\nIf you have certain tunings that you often use, you can save them as favorites. This gives you easy access to them under favorite tunings.\n\nIn the app, you can choose to subscribe to Pro Guitar Tuner Premium. It´s  a monthly subscription that gives you the following features: \n\n*No Ads\n*All Tunings\n*All Instruments\n*Extra Settings\n\nIf you choose to purchase a monthly subscription, after your confirmation, the subscription will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period.

Record with the peace of mind that you can refine your tracks in the future.\n\nMULTI-TRACK\nUse up to four vocal layers in the recording studio to record overdubs, ad-libs, harmonies, and more.\n\nPROCESS EXISTING AUDIO OR VIDEO\nApplying Voloco effects to audio you recorded elsewhere is easy in our audio editor. You can also apply Voloco effects like reverb or auto voice tune to the vocals of pre-recorded videos––use Voloco as a voice recorder and changer. This recording app and voice changer lets you import video of a celebrity interview and make them sound like a child or an angry alien. Be creative!\n\nEXTRACT VOCALS\nSeparate vocals from existing songs with vocal remover and create something incredible.Want to hear Elvis with pitch correction?

You can even separate and edit vocals from music videos or try using Voloco as a karaoke app by separating vocals with our vocal remover.\n\nEXPORT\nIf you want to finish your mix with another app, that's easy. You can rap or sing over a track, record yourself, and export just your vocals as AAC or WAV for final mixing in your favorite DAW.\n\nTOP TRACKS\nCheck out some of the professional-quality tracks users have made with Voloco in the Top Tracks section of the singing and recording app.\n\nLYRICS PAD\nJot down your lyrics so you have everything you need to make a top track right in the app or belt karaoke with your friends.\n\n50+ EFFECTS\nVoloco features over 50 effects grouped into 12 preset packs.

      "label": "UV Index Widget - Worldwide brings one of the most useful pieces of weather data, the UV Index, front and center. Use this app to track your UV exposure, help plan your day outside, and avoid burning.\n\nUV Index Widget - Worldwide is a handy little app to check the current radiation level from the Sun (the UV Index), the highest UV Index forecast for today, and the forecasted UV Index for the next 7 days, anywhere on Earth. You can also add the UV Index to your Home Screen using the accompanying widgets, set notifications for when the UV Radiation exceeds certain levels, and automatically add the UV levels to your Apple Health app.\n\nThe app will instantly show the current UV Index (UVI) at your location in an intuitive way. Tap and hold to see the peak UV Index for today. You can also see when the Sun rises and sets, and at what time the UV Index is at its highest level.\n\n7-day hour-by-hour forecast:\nThe Forecast tab will show hour-by-hour UVI forecast for the next 7 days.\n\nMy Skin:\nIn the My Skin section, choose your skin type to get personalized safety information and recommendations. You can also track your sun exposure, which will notify you when the risk of getting a sunburn is high. The app can also track your Vitamin D generation from sun exposure. Vitamin D generated is automatically added to the Apple Health app.\n\nPlaces:\nIn the Places tab you can select any place on Earth to view the current UV radiation and 7-day forecast for that location. Handy when you are about to travel somewhere and want to get a heads up on the UV radiation level where you are going.\n\nWidget:\niOS 14 home screen widgets are now supported. Choose between 7 different home screen widgets, and add them to either you Home Screen or the Today screen.\n\nNotifications:\nThe app can notify you when the UV Index goes above a certain level. Set the desired UV Index you wish to be notified about, and you will receive a notification if the UV Index at your location goes over this treshold. The app can also notify you when you are at high risk of a sunburn, and remind you to reapply your sunscreen.\n\nApple Health app:\nThe app will automatically store the hourly UV Index for your location in the Apple Health app. Open the Apple Health app to view your UV Exposure history.\n\nApple Watch:\nYou can now check the UV Index on your watch. Tap and hold to view todays peak UVI, just as in the iOS app. The watch app also contains a My Skin section and 4 day hourly forecast. In addition you can check the UVI any time right on your favourite watch face, using the included UVI complications. \n\nThe app will work anywhere in the world, and is a perfect companion whether you are at home or travelling.\n\n---\n\nInformation about UV Index Widget - Worldwide subscription:\n-At confirmation of purchase, or following the completion of a free-trial period, payment will be charged to your iTunes account.\n- Yearly subscriptions are available.\n- Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n- Your subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current subscription period.\n- Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current subscription period.

      "label": "«Magnetology» is an application which permits one to watch the forecast of geomagnetic storms and the state of Earth´s geomagnetic field.\n\nWHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT?\n\nGeomagnetic storms adversely affect the health of humans.\n\nThey can cause aches, dizziness, rapid heart rate, and abnormal blood pressure.\n\nPeople with abnormal conditions of the blood and of the cardiovascular and autonomic nervous systems are particularly susceptible to the influence of geomagnetic storms.\n\nThe degree of magnetic storms’ influence on a particular person depends on many factors, including health status, stress, physical and emotional fatigue, natural predisposition.\n\nNot only can geomagnetic storms have a negative impact on humans, but also on communications, navigation, and power. Drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are most vulnerable to impact of geomagnetic storms.\n\nBy taking into account the forecast of geomagnetic storms, you can plan difficult decisions, avoid high physical stress, and protect yourself from negative consequences.\n\nOur application will help you with this.\n\nABOUT THE NATURE OF THE GEOMAGNETIC STORMS\n\nThe Earth's geomagnetic field changes occur under the influence of the Sun. The intensity of the impact is not constant and depends on the ongoing processes on the solar surface.\n\nThe strength of geomatic field disturbances is characterized by the value of Kp index. The Kp index can be assigned values from 0 to 9, where 0 is the absence of disturbances and 9 represents extremely strong perturbations of the earth´s geomagnetic field.\n\nDisturbances with a Kp index of 5 and above are called storms.\n\nThe number of geomagnetic storms per year can reach 50!\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\n- David Howell for English localization;\n- Johan Milani for French localization.\n\nIN COMING UPDATES OF THE APPLICATION EXPECT\n\n- Personal forecasts.\n\n* The app uses data of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration."

Devices with built-in sensors will get values from it and for those without sensors, the pressure value is reported by the nearest weather station.\n\nWith our clean and intuitive app, you can see the  current pressure with just one look. You can save any current value to compare pressure from other days. What's coolest is that you can swipe through multiple units and instantly see the pressure in the value you are interested in, including:\n- pounds per square inch\n- millibar\n- hectopascal\n- kilopascal\n- millimeter of mercury\n- bar\n- inch of mercury\n\nYou can also change preferred units in settings.\n\nWith one screen swipe, you can see an altimeter gauge with current values, our precise altitude calculation algorithms (which involve GPS, network services and calibrated pressure sensors) we deliver you the most accurate elevation info as possible, in barometric units or if you prefer, you can swipe over to metric and imperial units.\n\nThe third screen of the application has clear, accurate weather info, which includes:\n- temperature\n- wind speed\n- wind direction\n- humidity\n- cloudiness\n- dew point temperature\n- fog\n\nDevices with pressure sensors now have the possibility to switch from average elevation reported on the Altimeter screen to barometer-based elevation only You are also now able to calibrate with your own mean sea level pressure value.\n\nThe history screen has been redesigned and you can now choose from four different values - MSL pressure, ground level pressure, temperature and elevation. You can also now easily filter data according to any time span you want.\n\nA brand-new functionality of custom notifications has also been added. You can now add time-based notifications: just setup the time and days on which you want to receive notifications with current pressure values and voila. You can also set a pressure level alarm, above or below which the device will warn you. What’s even more, you can receive notifications after pressure changes by the value you set.\n\nAn autosave function is now available. You can set a time interval at which your device will automatically save pressure, temperature and elevation values to give you up to the minute information about weather changes.\n\nhttps://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/terms/barometer\r\nhttps://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/privacy/barometer"

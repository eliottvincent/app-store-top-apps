      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Dabei können die Inhalte jedes Schuljahres einzeln hinzugefügt werden, so dass die App auf den individuellen Kenntnisstand der Kinder in jeder Klassenstufe der Grundschule zugeschnitten werden kann.\n\nAls besonderes Feature bietet die Zahlenbuch-App einen Werkzeugkasten, der es z. B. ermöglicht, Zehner- und Zwanzigerfelder aufzurufen und mit Plättchen zu füllen. Diese Toolbox unterstützt so bei vielen Aufgaben durch eine optionale Visualisierung. Diese kann entweder passgenau zur Aufgabe aufgerufen, selbst erstellt oder individuell bearbeitet werden. Ergänzt wird die Toolbox mit einer Funktion zum Freihandzeichnen.\n\nDas kann die Zahlenbuch-App:\n\n• Für jedes Schuljahr werden jeweils die 6 zentralen Themen intensiv interaktiv geübt und gefestigt.\n\n• Der neue Werkzeugkasten bietet zahlreiche Möglichkeiten zur visuellen Unterstützung. \n\n• Die Kinder erhalten während des Übens ein direktes Feedback zu ihren Lösungen.\n\n• Der übersichtliche Auswertungsbereich hilft Ihnen bei der Einschätzung des Lernstandes des Kindes.\n\n• Die Aufgabentypen sind den Kindern bereits aus dem Zahlenbuch bekannt und passen so als interaktive Ergänzung genau zu den in der Schule verwendeten Materialien.\n\nKlasse 1:\n\n• Zahlen erkunden\n\n• Zahlen bis 20\n\n• Plusaufgaben\n\n• Minusaufgaben\n\n• Plus und Minus\n\n• Gemischte Übungen\n\n\nKlasse 2:\n\n• Zahlen erkunden\n\n• Zahlen bis 100\n\n• Addition im Hunderterraum\n\n• Subtraktion im Hunderterraum\n\n• Multiplikation und Division\n\n• Gemischte Übungen\n\n\nDie Inhalte der Klassen 3 und 4 erscheinen in Kürze.\n\nBildungseinrichtungen können die Zahlenbuch-App in der Schulversion ganz einfach über das Volume Purchase Program im Apple School Manager im Bereich „Apps und Bücher“ erwerben. Beim Kauf von 20 oder mehr Lizenzen erhalten Bildungseinrichtungen einen Rabatt von 50%!\n\nFür Eltern empfehlen wir die Zahlenbuch-App, mit der bei Bedarf einzelne Klassenstufen erworben werden können.\n\n\nWir freuen uns sehr über Feedback.

Images have been included to aid the placement of the magnets using a human anatomical-topographical point of reference system. In addition, there are notes and specific recommendations that all Biomagnetists should follow when scanning. Top 10, Top 5 and protocols by diseases lists have been updated. The information contained in this guide will help the practitioner better comprehend BMPs and will allow an improved implementation of the Biomagnetic Pair technique."

And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

It is a world that we cannot see but that is literally all around us.\nThe Architecture of Radio is a 360 degree data visualization of what this world might look like. It shows the cell towers, GPS satellites and Wi-Fi routers around you that allow us to live our digital lives.\n\nNew: support for Iphone X, XR, XS and XS Max Screens\nNew: Cardboard support!\nImmerse yourself in the Infosphere in Virtual Reality using a cardboard or compatible headset*\n\n*Carboard support only for iPhone. iPhone 6s or newer recommended for best performance.\n\nWhy should I use this app?\n\nOut of curiosity! We are increasingly dependent on a global ecosystem of digital signals. We use them for so many things, yet we cannot see them. We can see the roads we use to travel, the buildings we live in, but not the infrastructure that is changing the world. How can we understand this world without understanding how it works? \nThe purpose of this app is to make the invisible visible so we can look at it, think about it and discuss it.\n\nWhy Should I not use this app?\n\nThis app is not a measurement tool. It’s purpose is to inspire, to see the world through a different lens. The app is based on real world data and gives you a pretty good idea of the density of digital signals around you, but it won’t tell you where to move the couch to get a better WIFI signal.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is a data visualization, based on global open datasets of cell tower, Wi-Fi and satellite locations. Based on your GPS location the app shows a 360 degree visualization of signals around you. The dataset includes almost 7 million cell towers, 19 million Wi-Fi routers and hundreds of satellites.\n\nIs this really what radio signals look like?\n\nWe can’t see radio with our eyes. The waves that we use for our cell phones and Wi-Fi are way outside the spectrum of visible light. In order to “see” radio, it has to be interpreted or translated into an image that we can see. There are many ways to do that but it will always be an interpretation.\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is an impression of the infosphere, a way of seeing it."

      "label": "Infant Visual Stimulation provides visual stimulation to help with your child’s early development. It is one of the best apps for babies and newborns. It contains high contrast pictures in flashcard format, especially designed for newborns and babies. This is what our customers have to say about this top baby app:\n\n\"The best baby app, hands down! This app rocks!!!\"\n\"Simply amazing!\"\n\"Great for infants and toddlers....and adults! \"\n\"Amazing for visually impaired!\"\n\n- How Will Infant Visual Stimulation Flashcards App Help My Child? \n\nA newborn’s vision is not fully developed at birth and he sees the world mainly in shades of gray, black and white. Newborns have a visual preference for images with a high contrast in colors. Within a week from birth, a baby is able to see red, orange, yellow and green too, but keeps preferring looking at simple, high contrast pictures.  \n\nYou can encourage your baby’s visual development by making sure that there are enough high contrast images in your baby’s environment. As the months go by, your baby’s vision will continue to develop, and soon he will be able to see the full range of colors and more detail. You can continue using this baby flashcard app as your baby grows into a toddler because babies love to play repetitive games with their caregivers.\n\nThis visual stimulation baby flashcard app can also be used for children with visual impairment to help them differentiate between foreground and background in images. \n\n- How To Use Infant Visual Stimulation Flashcards App\n\nInfant Visual Stimulation provides 254 high contrast pattern images. Simply flip through the pictures, while talking to your baby or let your baby listen to the recorded music or music of your own choice.  \n\nThis app comes with three lesson packs: Basic, Intermediate & Shapes!\n\nYou can experiment with the flashing speed of the cards. Watch your baby to see how long he is able to look at one specific picture and adjust the flash speed settings accordingly. Some babies like to look at the pictures a little longer than others, but in general babies have short attention spans and the flashing speed should not be too slow. \n\nThere are 13 music tracks. Parents can select the tracks they like or choose to play it randomly. Now, visual and aural stimulation can be more fun and engaging for babies.\n\nThis educational app is easy and fun to use. It will provide hours of stimulation and entertainment for your baby."

      "label": "Open up the world-famous Peekaboo Barn, perfect for toddlers. \n\nInside the little bouncing barn, friendly farm animals are waiting to pop out and surprise your little one. Try and guess who they are; tap the doors to find out! More animals, animations, and sounds than ever.\n\nWork with your child to learn the names of animals and hear the sounds they make. Younger children will love opening the barn doors to find new animal animations, as they learn about cause and effect and become familiar with animal names and sounds. Older children will enjoy guessing animals by sound, then seeing the animal names, which helps develop early literacy skills.  \n\nMultiple Language Features:\n\nWe started with a child's voice in English. It's her real voice, which some kids really enjoy, but she does say \"wabbit\" and \"wooster.\" If this is a concern for you, you can switch to any of 12 adult voices; our adult narrators say everything clearly and perfectly, just like the teachers they are. You can try many languages from around the world—or record your own language, or grandma's voice. There are tons of ways to explore the languages of Peekaboo Barn!\n\nPress the Language button on the Options screen to try them out.\n\n—Choose from the built-in narrators: child's voice in young English; adult's voice in American English or Spanish.\n—World languages also included: Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, German, French, Australian, and UK English. \n—Record your own voice: We added this feature so parents, children, and visiting relatives and friends can capture their own voices and star in Peekaboo Barn.  Now you can record the animal names in your native language--or grandma's voice, or grandpa's--and, if you're recording a new language, you can save the appropriate written version too, and both will show up the next time you play. (Please note, we can only support the writing systems that are supported by your device.)\n\nFEATURED BY APPLE \nOne of the first apps to be released for toddlers, since 2008 Peekaboo Barn has been downloaded over a million times, and played over 100 million times worldwide.  It has been a top 20 educational game on the iTunes store nearly every day since its launch, and has been featured by Apple often.  It won The Best Toddler App Ever award in 2009, and was named one of the top 50 iPhone apps for kids by Babble.com in 2010 and 2011.  It is recommended by The New York Times, MSNBC, USA Today, Wired, Telegraph UK, Ireland’s The Independent, Parents Magazine, and the Washington Post.\n\nPeekaboo Barn was made for you and your toddler by artists and educators, not marketers, robots, or companies repackaging clip art. Our team has backgrounds in cognitive science and child development, and we’ve worked in educational media everywhere from Penguin USA to the Smithsonian Institution.

      "label": "Got an English text and want to see how to pronounce it? This app will turn your English text into its phonetic transcription using International Phonetic Alphabet.\n \nFeatures:\n \n- See phonetic transcription of the whole text, not just the dictionary forms of separate words.\n- Choose between British and American* pronunciation. When British dialect is selected the [r] sound at the end of the word is only voiced if followed by a vowel, which follows British phonetic convention.\n- International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) symbols used.\n- The structure of the text and sentences in it (line breaks, punctuation marks, etc.) is preserved in phonetic transcription output making it easier to read.\n- You can output the text and its phonetic transcription along each other line-by-line to make back-reference to the original text easier.\n- An option to vary pronunciation depending on whether words are in stressed or weak position in the sentence, as in connected speech.\n- In addition to commonly used vocabulary the database contains a very substantial amount of place names (including names of countries, their capitals, US states, UK counties), nationalities and popular names.\n- Where a word has a number of possible pronunciations (highlighted in blue in the output) you can select the one that agrees with the context by tapping on it.\n- Print out the output results, share via email or copy to pasteboard.\n- Let the built-in speech synthesiser read your text out loud. Control the playback and follow IPA transcription of the current word with a highlight.\n- Custom URL scheme to open toPhonetics from 3rd-party apps.\n\nGestures (IPA transcription screen):\n1. Single tap\n    - Tap a word to set the cursor to it and speak it (you can mute/un-mute it with the button at your bottom-right).\n    - Tap in a blank space to stop speech and hide the cursor.\n2. Double-tap\n    - Double-tap a word to open it in the built-in dictionary; if the word has multiple pronunciations you'll see the list of them first.\n    - Double-tap in a blank space to reset the font to the size set in iOS preferences.\n3. Pinch in or out to make the text smaller or larger.\n4. Start to slide horizontally to select a part of your text. The Speak button respects current selection.\n\n\n*) American transcriptions are based on the open Carnegie Mellon University Pronouncing Dictionary."

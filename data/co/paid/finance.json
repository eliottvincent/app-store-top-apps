Professional! Highly Recommended... finally the currency application I have been waiting for so long...\"\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ \"...I tried all other similar apps, and I am proud to announce that this app is simply the best of them all..\"\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ \"Smart, intuitive and flexible!... slick interface with great functionality which further impresses with its great selection of currencies and immediate updates. Good job! Highly recommend!\"\n\nFeatures:\n\n-- Simple Interface -- \niCurrencyPad was designed to be fast and easy to use. Just select the currencies to convert and tap in the amount to convert. A convenient calculator allows for basic math calculations, showing the results as the values are tapped. Swipe across the display to swap the left and right currencies, or swipe up and down to select different currencies. Tap and hold to copy/paste. \n\n-- Favorite Currencies -- \nWhile iCurrencyPad offers exchange rates for 160+ currencies from around the world, you may be interested in only a few currencies. To reduce clutter on the screen, iCurrencyPad allows you to select and sort your Favorite Currencies, so only those currencies that interest you appear on the screen, thereby making the application easier and faster to use. \n\n-- Charts -- \nDetailed charts show the history of exchange rates for any two currencies. Tap on the chart for the exchange rate on any particular day. Tap with two fingers to show the change in rates between any two dates. Rotate the device for a larger chart in landscape view. Charts for most currencies are available for 1-day, 5-days, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, 5-years and 10-years. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Listing -- \nThe exchange rates listing shows a base currency compared to all other currencies, similar to the electronic exchange rate boards seen in \"Change\" shops around the world. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Updates -- \niCurrencyPad updates Exchange Rates on demand, or automatically at pre-defined intervals ranging from 15 seconds to 1 day. Exchange Rates are automatically updated when the app is launched, or auto-updates can be turned off when roaming. An Internet connection is required to update rates, either via cellular network or a Wifi connection. Without a connection, rates can still be accessed and converted using the last data downloaded. \n\n-- Easy to Get Started -- \nA short 20-second tutorial will play when you first launch iCurrencyPad and guide you through the app's features. \n\n-- Languages -- \nThe user interface is offered in 9 languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese and Arabic. Please visit the App Store in your language for a translated description and screenshots.\n\n-- Reviews -- \n\"...iCurrency Pad is a great piece of software powered by a stunning design and usability. It’s beautiful, useful, powerful yet simple and straightforward...\" \n\n-- MacStories (http://bit.ly/94Y9IT)"

No problem: Just insert it in the right place easily by entering a new line.\n\nYou can place the cursor everywhere you like in the calculation: It's like a note where\nyou can change anything you like in any place with the advantage, that changing numbers\nor operators updates your calculation immediately!\n\nCalcTape can be considered an \"Excel Lite with a calculator interface\".\n\nYou can also keep the calculation for your records (documents) and create templates: \nReplacing the figures in your template and getting the correct results is a breeze.\nCommenting figures and results gives sense to your calculations, so you can understand\nwhat you did when viewing the calculation a month later.\nCustomize CalcTape to your needs and place only those buttons on your keypad that you really\nneed everyday. Create your own functions to e.g. add a specific percent rate with a tap on\na single button.\n\nCalcTape features:\n- Save your calculations into files\n- Create own functions or text snippets to be entered when pressing a button (long press a button to enter the Button screen)\n- Create own keypad layouts (change assignment of all buttons except numbers and backspace / change button sizes)\n- Select between different keypad layouts (the \"function keypad\" contains no numbers and is nearly completely customizable)\n   to get more buttons or other functions, 2 keypads are directly accessible in the main screen\n- Share your calculations using standard iOS sharing capabilities, e.g. email\n- Sync your calculations with iPhone, iPad, Mac and PC using iCloud Drive.\n- Calculate TAX, VAT and other percent values easily\n- Use CalcTape for budget, accounting and expense tracking in the office and at home, everyday.\n\nCalcTape, more than a calculator.\n\n\nFAQ:\n- Start a new calculation on the same sheet by simply tapping the \"=\" key twice.\n- Do a long tap on a button to assign another existing function or to create a user function for it.\n- If you accidentally hit \"AC\" you can use \"Undo\" to get your calculation back."

Your details will be attractively displayed on the one hand in the form of a bar chart, on the other hand the bar chart is used as a control panel to simulate various scenarios. This simulation allows you to vary the most important parameters in small steps, so that \"what if\" scenarios can be simulated playful. For example, increase the duration of a savings plan, a single swipe from left to right across the graph is sufficient. \n\nALL FEATURES AT A GLANCE\n- All calculations are done in real time directly after entering the data.\n- Add extra payments or conditions in the mortgage calculator.\n- Add extra payments in the savings plan calculator.\n- Calculation dialog to calculate the financing requirements.\n- Changing the language / currency within the app.\n- Rapid change between year and month.\n- Calculator function in data entry.\n- Graphical simulation.\n- Results field adjustable.\n- Bar and pie chart for clear presentation of the results.\n- Start month can be assigned.\n- If necessary, additional help texts can be displayed for each input field.\n- Automatic backup of data entered.\n- Comparison between calculation variant A and B.\n- Create PDF / HTML reports, print and email.\n- Direct printing of all reports via AirPrint.\n\nFREE TRIAL\nFirst try, then buy: You can download and test the demo version of MarkMoney free. In contrast to this full version interest payments can only be calculated quarterly there. In the full version interest payments can be calculated, of course, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually. Thus, they are not forced to buy a pig in a poke.\n\nFAST SUPPORT\nUnfortunately, Apple does not allow you to respond to questions in the ratings. So please send us your questions and always contact us directly. Our support will help you and will answer usually within a very short time. We welcome your criticism, ideas and suggestions.

Compared to other apps the price is kept particularly low and the programme was designed as a universal app. This means you do not have to pay twice for the iPad and iPhone versions. In terms of functions this app is a match for any other more expensive app. Have a look at our features! We are continuously developing the app, always look forward to hearing your wishes and suggestions and will try to incorporate them.\n\nEASY TO USE.

We were working on the pro forma balance sheets and cash flows for a new project I'm working on.  They were all asking why I had switched to the iPhone for I used to be a die hard \"brandX phone\" fan. I said that one could do so much more. They said \"yea...sure\" (they were all using \"brandX phones\") until I started using your calculator. We were analyzing different payment and amortization schedules. They were so impressed by how easily we could figure out the amount of interest, principal and remaining loan balance for any certain period or combination of periods that in the end they were saying \"I have to get me one of those\".   Great product. Thanks.\""

      "label": "Account Book is an app which helps you to control your finances. Who doesn't know that feeling of having less and less money in your account at the end of the month eventhough you haven't bought anything special? This is where keeping a household account book comes in handy. But how many actually do this? Sitting down every day and detailing your exact spending only to find that at the end of the month your bank account still shows the same deficit as before. \n\nThis app will help you to order your finances in an easy way. Due to the clear and simple layout, you can enter your daily expenses and incomes in only a few seconds. \n\nInitially, it is advisable to enter your monthly fixed costs (e.g. rent) and income (e.g. salary) to have them calculated as a flat rate by this clever app. This way you don't have to deduct your rent every month or add your salary...but rather this is done for you automatically. This app can automatically deduct or add a fixed amount monthly or annually, so you are spared a lot of work. \n\nSimply enter your flexible expenses each time and add a short commentary if you like. So if, for example, you go shopping simply enter that you spent € 20 at the shops. The date is then automatically added and your expense is booked. \n\nNext time you go shopping, you don't have to type in \"Shopping\" as this item will be suggested to you automatically. Simply add the amount you spent. \n\nOf course, this system works the other way round as well. When you have income, for example you sell your old television on Ebay and earn € 50, you can book that amount in just a few seconds and this way never lose overview of your finances. \n\nSo you don't lose the complete overview however, you can also have graphically displayed in which month you had a positive or negative balance. This way you can oversee the whole year and determine when you spent a lot and on what you spent your money on.  \n\nTo recognize in advance when it could become difficult at the end of a month again, it is displayed to you what percentage of the month still remains and how much money you have at your disposal. This way you know in advance, for example, that you still have half the month to go but only have € 200 to spend. Therefore, start saving! \n\nThis app is an investment which pays for itself on day one and turns into profit after that. \n\nAdditionally, it should be mentioned that studies have proven that people who use (household) account books handle their money more consciously and end up with more money at the end of the month than people who do not. This is mainly explained by those people asking themselves if they really need that € 2 packet of chewing gum or if it is simply a pointless expense which will haunt them at the end of the month."

Non financial data, such as the change in mileage and average fuel consumption can also be calculated, and displayed in brief or in detail. \n\nA carbon footprint can also be calculated, depending on the consumption of the vehicle, as well as the mass of carbon dioxide (CO2) it produces (total and average per day and per mile traveled). \n\nCar Manager also allows all these data (costs, fill-ups, vehicle information) to be exported and sent by e-mail directly from your iPhone as a CSV file (comma separated values, which can opened and processed by Excel or any other spreadsheet program), should you feel the need to create your own personalized statistics. \n\nThe application also enables you to manage a directory containing all the information about the service providers for your vehicles: insurance companies, garages, stores, clubs, associations, etc. You can then easily locate them thanks to the Maps interface. \n\nCar Manager also provides you with a Tools section, which allows you to geolocate your current position or your parking spot in a single click, so you can easily go back there later with the integrated GPS visual guiding function (or with Maps directions). This tools section can also help you find various services around your location: gas stations, garages, restaurants, hotels and others. \n\nCar Manager also gives you the opportunity to stay tuned to car news: it comes with a number of RSS feeds (internet information channels) allowing you to be informed of anything related to cars and motorsports. You can of course add any RSS feed you want. \n\nThe application automatically adapts itself to the units of measurement effective in your country: kilometers or miles for distances, liters or gallons for fuel. \n\niOS 7.1 or higher. \nUniversal application with full resolution support for iPad"

The data stays on your device only.  If you want to sync your data, you can encrypt it before uploading it to the cloud.\n\n-- USER REVIEWS –-\nBeyond spectacular! - This app is so fantastic- as with many other reviewers, I've tried other budgeting apps like Mint. But this is the only app that actually works. It incentives me to spend less money on some days, have extra to spend on the weekends. Thank you for not adding too many bells and whistles!\n\nLife Changing - I am the WORST with finances and I've tried other apps, including Mint, which I used for a week and quit. But this app?? It's amazing. I can't speak highly enough of how much this app is getting my life together. I'm aggressively saving, paying off all of my bills and I know exactly what I get to spend a day. I will never NOT use this. I hope it's here forever.\n\nHelps you be Accountable - This app turns my financial life into a game that I feel I can win.  Daily Budget really works and it's core design sets it apart from other apps.\n\n-- IN MEDIA –-\n“Take the blah out of budgeting” – Seventeen Magazine\n “An utterly fantastic approach to saving” – Apppicker\n“Super-quick, easy way to show how well we're doing” - Appadvice\n\n-- HOW IT WORKS --\n1. Enter your regular income, like salary or monthly allowance.\n2. Enter your recurring expenses, like rent or gym.\n3. Enter your saving goal, like 10%.\n4. Watch your Daily Budget gets calculated and know how much you can spend every day!\n*Daily Budget is calculated simply as:  (Income – Expenses – Saving)/Number of days in a month. \nWatch your budget grow as you stay below your daily budget.  Now, saving money is suddenly a fun game!"

The built in calculator lets you focus on two selected currencies on one screen. The built in calculator remains on the screen at all times making data entry quick and easy.\n\nApple Watch\nUse Currency+ on the Apple Watch. See your favorites currency list and your Currency Alerts directly on the watch.\n\nToday Widget\nUse the Today Widget to quickly see the conversion rates between all your favorite currencies. Tap the rate to reverse the conversion. Tap any of the currencies on the list to set as the base currency.\n\nSupport For Over 150 World Currencies & Precious Metals\nFor times where you want to keep track of many currencies at one time, the favorites list is where you need to go. You pick from  over150 world currencies and precious metals (powered by Yahoo.com). Selecting any currency in your list, enter a value and the rest of the currencies in your list will show you that amount in their own currency in real time.\n\nHistorical Charts\nCurrency+ has historical charts. You can view historical currency conversion charts for any two currencies. Touch the chart with a single finger to see data from any period in the past. Touch the chart with two fingers to compare currency exchange rates from any two past periods. Show charts for 1 day (real time intraday), 5day, 3 month, 6 month, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years.\n\nCurrency Trends\nWith Trends, you can select any of the 150+ world currencies and compare it to a list of other currencies to see how it has performed over time. See if your currency has strengthened or weakened. Select your time period from days to years. Export your work to an email, text, note, etc using the trend share sheet.\n\nBackground Rate Updates & Currency Alerts\nCurrency+ will go out and update your currency rates without taking your device out of your pocket. Whenever you open Currency+, your data will always be up to date. Do you want to be notified when a currency goes above or below a certain value? If so, Currency+ can notify you of these changes without the need to open the app. You will receive a push notification on your device whenever the currency you are watching goes beyond the limit you set.\n\nEditable Calculator Tape\nCurrency+ has an integrated calculator tape that keeps track of everything that you do. You can send any value from the tap to any of your favorite currencies. You can edit/delete/insert tape values and your calculations will automatically update. Finally, you can put comments on any of your tape values to help you keep track of what your numbers stand for.\n\nInverse Currency Calculations\nNeed to do inverse or reverse currency calculations? Currency+ can switch between standard and inverse currency conversion modes on the fly.\n\nTransaction Fees or Taxes\nCurrency+ can factor in transaction fees (or tax) automatically. Individuals rarely convert money at published exchange rates - most banks and exchange offices charge a fee. Enter the transaction fee percentage to give you a better estimate of your 'real' conversion rates.\n\nMake the leap with Jump Gap Software's Currency+, the currency converter that takes you around the world and back."

      "label": "More than 30 years ago we saw the birth of the most popular financial calculator ever created--you probably had one (and probably still do!).\n\nCalculator12 puts a rock solid emulation of that calculator on your iPhone, iPod touch and iPad, whether you need it for school or are looking to retire old faithful. What you get is true (albeit non-programmable) emulation with 100% compatible operation keystroke for screentap and computational and operational reliability every bit as good as the original.\n\nBut wait, there's more! (sorry about that). Calculator12 is not stuck in the 80s. You have the option to work with cash flows in the cash flow diagram format, changing values or inserting/deleting cash flows with just a tap. Three independent cash flow scenarios can be evaluated side-by-side, and with capital multiplication you can evaluate an exit strategy for outside investors. Results can be emailed from Calculator12 so you don't have to redo things like an amortization schedule or comparative investment report at your lap or desktop. \n\nAnd you can see what was once hidden... the contents of the financial registers or optionally the stack are always displayed. For me at least confirming the accuracy of my entries relieves a lot of anxiety and prevents confusion when the results don't stack up. It's not programmable, but advance payment leasing functions have been pre-programmed in as well as conversions to APR and Effective Rate to fill some of the gaps. And it is blisteringly fast--what used to take 30 seconds now is done almost before your finger leaves the touchscreen. \n\nCalculator12 was the very first emulator of that physical machine on the App Store, v1.0 released July 30th of 2008, introducing features (now almost universally copied) that take advantage of the unique features of iOS to improve your ability to deal with financial problem solving. There are lots of emulators now, but only one that has moved out of the 80s. (this one!)\n\n*** This application listing provides an upgrade path for early adopters to the redesigned and renamed Calc-12E. It is identical to Calc-12E and is maintained on the App Store to provide a way for existing customers to upgrade their original purchase to Calc-12E free-of-charge... It will appear on your home screen as Calc12E***"

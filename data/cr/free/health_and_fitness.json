      "label": "** The most downloaded kegel app in the World ** - according to Sensor Tower analytics\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dr. Kegel app provides 5 exceptional features that form a powerful men’s health-boosting machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. KEGEL TRAINING PLAN - The core feature to improve performance\r\n\r\nKegel Training provides a step-by-step plan for strengthening Pelvic Floor (PF) muscles. PF muscles play a critical role in male intimate health. They help trap blood in the groin area & control male organs.\r\n\r\nWithout training, PF muscles lose tone. This can lead to weak rigidity (ED), “quick finishes'' (PE), & other male diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut since the Pelvic Floor is a group of muscles, it means that you can strengthen them just like any other muscle in the body & boost men’s health. Dozens of the latest urological studies prove this can help last longer, get & stay up easier.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's SUPER EASY to work out with Kegel Training\r\n\r\n\r\n* The workouts take just 5 minutes a day. Which is perfect even for the busiest ones;\r\n* The workouts are simple. Just do PF exercises to the rhythm of your phone’s vibrations;\r\n* You don’t need any additional equipment to work out;\r\n* You can work out even laying on the couch. You don’t even have to move, literally;\r\n* No one will notice that you’re working out. This means that you can do it even in a crowded office.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. GROIN FITNESS - Special fitness that helps to boost men’s health faster\r\n\r\n\r\nGroin Fitness includes a set of specially selected exercises that are directly targeted at the groin area. It helps to achieve 2 goals at the same time:\r\n\r\n1. Increase blood flow to the groin;\r\n2. Strengthen the PF muscles in an extra way.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis multiplies the effect of Kegel Training and helps to achieve desired results faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Performing Groin Fitness requires no equipment;\r\n* The video & audio instructions from our professional coach will help you do exercises correctly;\r\n* And the workouts take just 2-5 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis makes Groin Fitness perfect even for beginners.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. PROGRESS TRACKER - Monitor how workouts strengthen PF muscles\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress Tracker allows to take measurements & see how your PF muscles become stronger. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt provides daily, weekly, and monthly statistics overviews. So you can see the visible progress & increase the motivation to reach the goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. DAILY CHALLENGES - Everyday activities that boost men's health\r\n\r\n\r\n​​Besides the PF muscles, men's health also depends on eating behaviors, mental health, physical activity & social life.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges provide a set of special activities that help to build healthy habits in those areas of life, that have the greatest impact on men's health.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. INSIGHTS - Summary of scientific facts about Health, Relationship, Nutrition & more.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Insights tab, you’ll find main highlights from the hundreds of latest scientific research made into 2-minute stories with juicy illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncorporate the tips from these stories into your daily life to become more productive or simply to amaze others with your knowledge.\r\n\r\nAS YOU CAN SEE DR. KEGEL PROVIDES A COMPLEX SOLUTION TO BOOST MALE INTIMATE HEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s a revolutionary way to improve performance, last longer, get & stay up easier.

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

      "label": "Final Surge® is used by athletes and teams of many sports around the world, including running, cycling, triathlon, duathlon, and Xterra where performing your best is what it’s all about.\n\nThe Daily View shows basic workout data, plus whether the workout status is planned or completed. If completed, the workout is color-coded to indicate whether the workout was completed as planned (Green). If the workout was not completed as planned, color-coding indicates whether the workout was simply missed (Red)… or was under, or over, performed (Yellow).\n\nIn the Daily View, tap on the Quick Complete button to easily enter workout data, including just one tap on the Complete As Planned button to automatically enter Distance, Duration, and Pace for the workout, plus you can easily add How You Felt, your Perceived Effort, and Workout Notes. These features make manual entry a snap, but of course, the App automatically syncs workout data from your sports watch and other devices through platforms like Garmin Connect®, Strava®, Polar Flow®, and others.\n\nThe Quick View button puts the most important workout information only one tap away, which is especially nice when you have several workouts or are a coach working with several athletes. \n\nThe Quick Comment button opens a messaging-style screen where comments between coach and athlete for each workout are readily available.\n\nOf course, if you are using a sports watch or similar tracking device and want to dive into every workout detail, just tap on the top of the workout to show the Details View. The Details View has the following 5 tabs: Planned Versus Completed, Laps (Splits), Workout Map, Workout Graphs, and Comments between Coach and Athlete for each workout.\n\nThe Final Surge App also has a Weekly View that doesn’t require you to awkwardly put your phone into a landscape position. An entire week of workouts is shown, and just like with the Daily View, workouts are color-coded to instantly show you the status of each workout. Tapping on any of the workouts in the Weekly View opens the same 5 Workout Details screens available for the Daily View.\n\nCoaches can easily access a list of their athletes and teams with one tap, and review and manage their Athletes’ Workout Calendars and Teams’ Workout Calendars with the same detail as the Athlete’s View. The App includes Push Notifications to notify of workout completions, workout comments and other real-time occurrences in training.\n\nTeam and Group calendars, internal message boards and individual messaging make this App ideal for high school, collegiate, professional and club teams.\n\nThe App syncs with Garmin Connect, Strava, and other platforms to access all major sports watches and similar tracking devices and provides highly accurate geopositioning information with corrected elevation.\n\nThe App supports the new running power tracking and advanced cycling power metrics, such as weighted power, max power, average power, and intensity.\n\nThe App also tracks your Vitals, including your weight, sleep, blood pressure, etc. to monitor your overall heath and progress due to improved fitness. It also includes a Workout History capability to review summary presentations of your past workouts.\n\nEasily load Training Plans for virtually any kind of race from the world’s best coaches and work with a coach to receive individualized training to reach your most aspirational goals. The App includes a Coach's Mailbox for direct private communication and private Social Walls that provide a complete social media experience to drive athlete motivation and engagement.\n\nYou can track Workout Gear (bikes and shoes) and save your favorite Workout Routes. Your own customized Workout Zones (HR and power) can be used to make sure you are always performing an optimized workout. The App can access leading Workout Calculators to always make sure you are working out at the right pace. \n\nThe New Final Surge App Version 3 gives a whole new meaning to... Train with a purpose™."

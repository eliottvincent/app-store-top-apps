      "label": "Simple fasting and meal tracker app is the easiest way to keep track of your eating habits, get personalized insights about your health, and make your daily fasting routine better. Benefit from the most popular, healthy, and effective weight-loss method, trusted by hundreds of millions adopters worldwide!\n\nPerfect for establishing a basic eating discipline, Simple is ideal for keeping yourself in good shape during self-isolation, with our educational and motivational content on staying mindful about your eating habits.\n\nPopularized by celebrities like Hugh Jackman and Beyoncé, intermittent fasting is the most ancient eating pattern known to humans. It's trusted in most religions, but anyone can use its benefits.\n\nUnlike popular new fads, intermittent fasting makes your body work precisely as it was designed by mother nature. It helps lose and control your weight and reinstating normal processes in your body that you’ve lost due to frequent eating.\n\nEven shorter fasting periods (12 hours or more) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and lower the risk of metabolic diseases.\n\nJust remember: IF is not a diet, fad or quick fix. It does not tell you what you can’t eat but instead asks that you eat within a specific window of time each day. This is a simple lifestyle change that will jump-start weight loss and better health by enabling your metabolic system to work as it was designed.\n\nBut many people are deterred from trying IF because they think it’s difficult and they don't know how to start. \n\nThat’s where Simple comes in. You don't have to know anything about Fasting.\n\nBecause we are not just a fasting tracker, our mission is not to offer you just an Intermittent Fasting tool.

      "label": "** The most downloaded kegel app in the World ** - according to Sensor Tower analytics\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dr. Kegel app provides 5 exceptional features that form a powerful men’s health-boosting machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. KEGEL TRAINING PLAN - The core feature to improve performance\r\n\r\nKegel Training provides a step-by-step plan for strengthening Pelvic Floor (PF) muscles. PF muscles play a critical role in male intimate health. They help trap blood in the groin area & control male organs.\r\n\r\nWithout training, PF muscles lose tone. This can lead to weak rigidity (ED), “quick finishes'' (PE), & other male diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut since the Pelvic Floor is a group of muscles, it means that you can strengthen them just like any other muscle in the body & boost men’s health. Dozens of the latest urological studies prove this can help last longer, get & stay up easier.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's SUPER EASY to work out with Kegel Training\r\n\r\n\r\n* The workouts take just 5 minutes a day. Which is perfect even for the busiest ones;\r\n* The workouts are simple. Just do PF exercises to the rhythm of your phone’s vibrations;\r\n* You don’t need any additional equipment to work out;\r\n* You can work out even laying on the couch. You don’t even have to move, literally;\r\n* No one will notice that you’re working out. This means that you can do it even in a crowded office.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. GROIN FITNESS - Special fitness that helps to boost men’s health faster\r\n\r\n\r\nGroin Fitness includes a set of specially selected exercises that are directly targeted at the groin area. It helps to achieve 2 goals at the same time:\r\n\r\n1. Increase blood flow to the groin;\r\n2. Strengthen the PF muscles in an extra way.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis multiplies the effect of Kegel Training and helps to achieve desired results faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Performing Groin Fitness requires no equipment;\r\n* The video & audio instructions from our professional coach will help you do exercises correctly;\r\n* And the workouts take just 2-5 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis makes Groin Fitness perfect even for beginners.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. PROGRESS TRACKER - Monitor how workouts strengthen PF muscles\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress Tracker allows to take measurements & see how your PF muscles become stronger. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt provides daily, weekly, and monthly statistics overviews. So you can see the visible progress & increase the motivation to reach the goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. DAILY CHALLENGES - Everyday activities that boost men's health\r\n\r\n\r\n​​Besides the PF muscles, men's health also depends on eating behaviors, mental health, physical activity & social life.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges provide a set of special activities that help to build healthy habits in those areas of life, that have the greatest impact on men's health.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. INSIGHTS - Summary of scientific facts about Health, Relationship, Nutrition & more.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Insights tab, you’ll find main highlights from the hundreds of latest scientific research made into 2-minute stories with juicy illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncorporate the tips from these stories into your daily life to become more productive or simply to amaze others with your knowledge.\r\n\r\nAS YOU CAN SEE DR. KEGEL PROVIDES A COMPLEX SOLUTION TO BOOST MALE INTIMATE HEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s a revolutionary way to improve performance, last longer, get & stay up easier.

When you focus your energy on the things you want: achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting + good you are creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen. \n- They open you up to possibility.

      "label": "Get to a healthier and more active life with Google Fit!\n\nIt’s hard to know how much or what kind of activity you need to stay healthy. That’s why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\n\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You’ll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO’s recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nSEE YOUR WORKOUTS\nGet insights and see stats such as heart rate, speed, pace, route, and more for your runs, walks, and bike rides.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and steps. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.\n\nMAKE EVERY MOVE COUNT\nAll physical activity can help you lead a healthier life, and with Google Fit you can track it all in one place. Working with your favorite fitness apps and devices, Google Fit builds a journal of your activity. And to make sure Fit never misses a workout, you can manually add any activity your other apps didn’t track - from Aerobics to Zumba!\n\nCONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES\nGoogle Fit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices that are compatible with Apple Health to give you a holistic view of your health, so you’ll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Headspace, and more.\n\nCHECK IN AT ANYTIME, FROM ANYWHERE\nSee a snapshot of your activity history across Google Fit and your integrated apps in your journal. Or, see the full picture in browse, where you can find all of your health and wellness data.\n\nLearn more about Google Fit and see a list of supported apps at: https://www.google.com/fit"

It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

It can even use your physical activity and local weather to adjust the goal specifically for you every day.\nINTEGRATES: Your activity level affects how much water you need to drink. Connect to Apple Health, Fitbit, Under Armour Record, or Withings HealthMate to use your activity level to automatically adjust your goal. You can also save your hydration records to Apple Health or Fitbit.\nHISTORY: See your hydration progress over time in a daily and monthly view. How many days in a row can you reach your goal?\nFRIENDS: Keep an eye on your friends’ progress to make sure they are staying hydrated. Start some friendly competition to see who can meet their goal the most days in a row.\nFUN REMINDERS: This app will send notifications when you begin to fall behind and need to drink more water. The HidrateSpark smart water bottle will also light up and glow to remind you to stay hydrated.\nNEVER LOSE IT: Losing your water bottle is no fun, so we made it harder for this to happen. When location services are turned on, this app will record the last place it was connected to your HidrateSpark smart water bottle, and show you a map so you can go back and get it.\n\nThis app works best when paired with a Hidrate Spark Smart Water Bottle. But even without one, all the other features will still work for you as a water intake and hydration tracker! You can get a hydration goal, manually record your fluid intake, track your history, share with friends, and get hydration reminders on your iOS device.\n\nBenefits of water:\n\nHEALTH: Alongside a healthy diet and proper exercise, hydration can help dramatically improve your physical health.\nSKIN: Proper hydration helps skin retain moisture for a bright, healthy glow\nCOGNITION & MOOD: Your brain is 75% water, so proper hydration can have a positive impact on cognitive function and mood.\nATHLETIC PERFORMANCE: Even 1-2% dehydration can decrease physiological performance, and 5% dehydration can decrease your physical performance by 30%. So if you want to win, you better be hydrated.\nWEIGHT LOSS: Combined with a healthy diet and exercise, drinking water can increase your metabolism and help you avoid eating and drinking extra calories.\nINCREASED ENERGY: Drinking plenty of water helps with blood circulation, thus decreasing your feeling of tiredness and fatigue. \nAVOID HEADACHES: Staying properly hydrated can help avoid headaches.  \nHEALTHIER SKIN: Staying properly hydrated helps your skin stay hydrated to help it look younger and healthier.  \nBOOST IMMUNITY: Staying properly hydrated can help you fight off illness and infections.\nPREGNANCY: Pregnant and breastfeeding moms need to be properly hydrated so they can support their new baby. \n\nLearn more about HidrateSpark products at www.hidratespark.com"

This HIPAA compliant solution allows clinicians to remotely monitor an unlimited number of patients and see who most needs their attention and who is doing well, all with a click of button. \n\nQardioDirect App:\n\n• Gives healthcare professionals an additional way to onboard new patients easily\n• Works with Qardio devices for in-clinic and at-home measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, ECG, heart rate, irregular heartbeat detection, blood oxygen level, temperature, weight, BMI and full body composition\n• Lets doctors demonstrate Qardio products to patients\n\nHow it works:\n\nPatients use FDA-cleared Qardio devices to monitor their health outside the doctor's office, which automatically share vitals with their provider.\n\nProviders use HIPAA-compliant QardioMD services. When a patient takes a measurement, the data is displayed in the secure QardioMD web portal.\n\nQardio does the rest. QardioMD continuously displays patient data, and with easy to use filters shows who needs priority attention.\n\nQardioDirect and Apple Health work seamlessly together, enabling easier health tracking with all your health and wellness information in one place. \n\nWhat other doctors have to say about Qardio:\n\n“I believe that good, high quality home blood pressure monitoring devices are going to be critical for achieving better blood pressure control in the US population. I’ve been very impressed with the QardioArm device, which we are currently using in the Health eHeart Study.” - Mark Pletcher, Health eHeart Study Principal Investigator, UCSF\n\n“As a physician, I believe people need to take control of their health and outcomes and this product being so easy to use, portable and most importantly accurate is a product I would recommend to all. Since stopping my denial and becoming a patient myself, I have done just that. Folks, the newest data regarding BP is irrefutable and having just one reading at a doctor’s office every so often is, in my opinion, the wrong way to detect hypertension and products like these should become part of a person's routine, especially as we age and our vessels become less compliant.” HB, Physician and QardioArm User, Amazon Review.\n\nQardioArm and QardioCore have regulatory clearance in the United States, European Economic Area, Canada. Qardio’s products and application should be only used in conjunction with professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment, and not as a substitute, or a replacement for it."

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

      "label": "Join the millions of medical professionals who use MDCalc daily to support clinical decision making at the bedside. Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

      "label": "The simplest program to track breastfeeding, pumping, bottle feeding, solid food consumption, diapers, sleep schedule, height and weight, and more.\n\nWith the click of a button, your feedings and baby care history will be stored in the app. You will have an easy-to-maintain history of your baby’s growth.\n\nThe birth of a baby is a miracle that fills your heart with joy! A mother’s life changes dramatically with the birth of her baby. It is so important for a mother and her newborn baby to establish a comfortable breastfeeding relationship.  Moms need to keep track of which breast to offer her baby, how long the baby suckles at each breast, the number of times the baby breastfeeds each day, how many wet diapers and bowel movements the baby has, how long and frequently the baby sleeps, as well as the baby’s weight and growth.  All of this information is important for the self-assessment of breastfeeding and for assessing the growth of the child.  Having this information easily accessible will be extremely useful when visiting with your pediatrician or lactation consultant.\n\nIt is important to record all of this data. Do not rely on your memory, because even the most organized mothers are often lost in the sea of information about their newborn.\n\nUse the features of the Breastfeeding application.\n\nBreastfeeding and pumping:\n- record the time and quantity of feedings and/or pumpings;\n- note which breast was fed or pumped last to ensure starting new feeding/pumping on the opposite breast;\n- record the duration of feeding/pumping;\n- pause feeding/pumping, if necessary;\n- quickly add feeding/pumping session that was similar to the most recent but updates with the current time\n- use the maximum duration of feeding setting and the application will stop recording the feeding/pumping at the set time if you are unable to press stop\n\nLiquids:\n- consider all of your child’s fluid intake (water, expressed breast milk, formula, juice, etc.);\n -track your child’s reactions to new fluids and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers;\n- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);\n\nFeeding (solid food):\n- add solid foods as your child begins eating them (cereal, vegetables, fruits, meat, fish);\n- track your child’s reactions to these new foods and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers\n- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);\n\nSleep:\n- record the time and duration of your baby’s sleep each day so you can better plan your day;\n- compare your baby’s sleep habits with recommended sleep guidelines\n\nDiapers: \n- track the number of your baby’s wet and/or dirty diapers. This information is crucial for noticing signs of dehydration, constipation, and diarrhea and alerting the child’s pediatrician if necessary.\n\nMeasurements: \n- track height and weight to evaluate your baby’s development;\n\nOther features:\n- edit or delete events as needed;\n- set reminders for various events; \n- use the application in your native language;\n- select your preferred units of measurement;\n- view statistics;\n- enter data for several children and twins;\n- backup all of your data;\n\nAlso available in PRO-version:\n- disable advertising;\t\n- auto backup every 24 hours;\t\n---\nWe offer subscription plans in the app that unlock premium functions of the app:\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Price can depend on location\n\nFor more information please visit the link https://support.apple.com/HT202039\nPrivacy Policy: https://doc.whisperarts.com/policy/breastfeeding/ios/\nTerms of Use: https://doc.whisperarts.com/terms/breastfeeding/ios/"

      "label": "Does the world need another OB-wheel-due-date-calculator app?  You bet!  OB Wheels combines three things that clinicians need to derive all the dates necessary in pregnancy care, and no other app has this combination.   \n\nIt contains a calendar calculator to determine EDD (EDC) from LMP or from a sonogram report.  The calendar calculator also provides gestational age (EGA) as of any date for a given EDD or LMP.  Because the calculator works off the real calendar, it is accurate for leap years too.\n\nThen for all of you who miss your cardboard OB wheel, the app contains one which you can rotate, pinch and zoom, and generally play with just like a regular cardboard wheel.  It's a little tricky to learn how to plant two fingers and rotate them rather than pinch-and-zoom to get rotation versus resizing.  But the wheel works and it is accurate, especially so because you can zoom in to be sure where the little date hash lines lie.\n\nFinally, the app notes the most recent committee opinion scheme from ACOG on how one might reconcile due dates from LMP and sonograms to arrive at a single final EDD.  To my knowledge, the scheme is authority-based and no better or worse than other schemes, but my practice and my learners need a single clear scheme, so this app includes one for easy reference.\n\nAs an educator and clinician myself, I am grateful for feedback.

      "label": "• THE FIRST AND ONLY LANGUAGE THERAPY APPLICATION SUPPORTED BY CLINICAL DATA:\nIn a 3-year clinical trial of 6,454 children with autism, language score in children who engaged with MITA has increased to levels, which were 120% higher than in children with similar initial evaluations. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.0001). See results at ClinicalTrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT04108290. \n\n• Received FDA breakthrough device designation (Q210093)\n\n• Based on US patent 20160210870\n\n• Includes unlimited language and cognitive exercises designed to last for 10 years\n\n• Used by over 1.5 million children with language delay\n\n• Best Autism App on Healthline list\n\n• Available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, German, French, Italian, Arabic, Farsi, Korean, Chinese.\n\nMental Imagery Therapy for Autism (MITA) is a unique, early-intervention application for children with language delay and autism. MITA trains mental integration and language, starting with simple vocabulary, and progressing towards higher forms of language, such as adjectives, verbs, pronouns, and syntax.\n\n\nMITA EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES\n\n• Based on ABA techniques of visual-visual and auditory-visual conditional discrimination.\n• Based on language therapy technique of following directions with increasing complexity.\n• Based on Pivotal Response Treatment. \n• Each activity is adaptive and delivers exercises that are at the exact level of difficulty appropriate for your child at any given point in time\n• Identify colors, patterns and sizes\n• Integrate objects into a unified picture\n• Spatial Prepositions: on/under/behind/in front\n• Time prepositions: Before/After\n• Passive verb tense\n• Subject / Object\n• Reading and Writing\n• Numbers and counting\n• Arithmetic: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division\n• Logic and reasoning\n• Mental perspective taking\n• Mental mathematics\n• Critical thinking \n• Self-control\n• Attention\n• Working Memory\n• Creativity\n• Playtime rewards will keep your child engaged while learning and having fun\n• No Wi-Fi necessary\n\nMITA develops your child’s imagination and language functions. The visual exercises follow a systematic approach for developing your child's ability to notice multiple features of an object. MITA starts with simple exercises that teach your child to attend to only one feature, such as size or color. Over time, the exercises get more difficult and require your child to attend to two features simultaneously, such as both color and size. MITA then moves on to puzzles that require attending to three features, such as color, size and shape, and then eventually to puzzles that involve attending to an ever-increasing number of characteristics. \nThe verbal exercises use higher forms of language, such as adjectives, prepositions, and syntax.\n\nMITA is developed by Dr. A. Vyshedskiy, a neuroscientist from Boston University; R. Dunn, a Harvard-educated early-child-development specialist; MIT-educated, J. Elgart and a group of award-winning artists and developers working alongside experienced therapists.\n\nMost MITA features are completely free and the free MITA version provides access to years of language therapy. Some additional features are available as a MITA Premium subscription for $69.99/year. Your subscription pays for the development of new language exercises that are added each month. \n\n• Tuition will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n• Tuition automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n• You can turn off auto-renewal by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that plan.\n\nTerms of use: http://imagiration.com/terms-of-service/\nPrivacy Policy: http://imagiration.com/privacy-policy/\nMITA in the news: https://youtu.be/giZymh3rMHc\nMITA research articles: http://imagiration.com/research/"

      "label": "This application consists of three modules: RECORDER, SMART ALARM, STOP SNORING.\n\nRECORDER\nRecords your talk or snoring while you are asleep (automatic or manual sensitivity level, records only snoring using smart snoring detection), creates the graph of noise in room during the night, takes the total time of snoring down.\n\nSMART ALARM\nHelps you wake up easy in your lightest sleep phase and allows you to get up relaxed every morning. Improve your sleep naturally, maximize your sleep efficiency. \n\nSTOP SNORING\nTries to stop your snoring by playing chosen sound or using iPhone vibration when the snoring is detected.\n\nBy using the tracker data and by defining your own factors (activities/means/drugs/custom notes) it is possible to find out which facts influence your sleep positively and limit your snoring. At your disposal there are beautiful statistic charts for simple and efficient analyzing of your sleeps/nights.\n\nSnoring detection is based on artificial intelligence (A.I.) with the support of a new Apple machine learning technology. By using a large number of snoring samples, we can achieve high accuracy in statistics and in snoring detection itself.\n\nHow to place your device correctly is shown in instructions. \n\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n\n- ADJUSTABLE RECORDING SOUND SENSITIVITY:\nFor different sound conditions in your room (a quiet or loud environment).\n\n- HIGH TECH SNORING DETECTION:\nAccurate snoring detection based on A.I.\n\n- POSSIBILITY OF RECORDING ONLY SNORING\n\n- AUDIO VISUALIZATION DURING RECORDING OR PLAYING\n\n- FAVORITE RECORDINGS\n\n- SHARING RECORDINGS WITH YOUR FRIENDS:\nSend recordings via email, iMessage or post to Facebook\n\n- UNLIMITED ALARMS: \nSet your own alarms, daily alarms, weekly alarms, etc. You can use included alarm sounds or your own iPod music.\n\n- SMART WAKE UP: \nWake you up with gradual alarm when you are in your lightest sleep phase (based on your movements).\n\n- SLEEP TRACKER:\nSleep cycle analyzes and statistics with complete history and beautiful charts.\n\n- SNOOZE BY SHAKING:\nNo need to unlock screen or enter password.\n\n- STOP SNORING:\nPossibility of playing chosen sound or using iPhone vibration when the snoring is detected. \n\n- FACTORS, WAKE UP MOOD, NOTES:\nUser can place factors (alcohol, coffee, stress etc.) to every night as well as the mood after waking up or users own notes.\n\n- ACTIVATION DELAY:\nStart monitoring after a period of time.\n\n- BACKGROUND MODE:\nMonitoring runs also in background mode. Alarm also fires from background.\n\n- APPLE HEALTH INTEGRATION\n\n- iCLOUD SYNCHRONIZATION:\nSynchronization among your devices and between free and paid version.\n\n- EXPORTING HISTORY TO CSV FILE\n\n- APPLE WATCH:\nTracks your sleep movements and plays haptic (sound, vibration) if alarm is triggered or snoring is detected.\n\n\nCUSTOMER SUPPORT\nHappy customers are our highest priority.

Enjoy your custom order at the coffee shop, without having to retype it every time, or having to turn your phone around.\n\n- Play Text - The Text tool also comes with a unique ability to Play the Text that you type in through your voice and video phone calls! So if you are not able to speak over the phone in an interview, you can just type out your responses and have the phone play it to the other side of your call.

      "label": "Decide + Be Ready - an interactive way to learn about birth control options and think through what’s important to you about your method.  You’ve got to love options, especially when it comes to birth control, but figuring out the best method for you can be overwhelming.  In 15 minutes or less, you’ll have the information you need to discuss options with your health care provider in order to make the best decision for you! \n\nFEATURES include:\n\n1) Brief educational modules reviewing all the birth control methods out there, including:\n\nHow well does it prevent pregnancy?\nHow do I use it?\nHow often do I have to remember it?\nAre there any side effects?\nWhat if I decide to get pregnant?\nConsiderations for a servicewoman\n\n2) “Info quickies” that provide information about such topics as emergency contraception, IUDs, postpartum and breastfeeding considerations, and fertility awareness methods.\n\n3) An interactive section that allows you to indicate your preferences for the method characteristics described above. \n\n4) A short checklist assessing your medical eligibility for different contraceptive methods.\n\n5) Recommendations on methods that may be a good fit for you based on your responses to items 3 and 4 above.  You can then select the methods that you wish to discuss at more length with your provider.  You can also use the “Compare Methods” function to view all the characteristics of two methods side-by-side.\n\n6) A notepad to write down questions you have for your provider.\n\n7) Your Birth Control Profile that summarizes and allows you to share your method preferences, questions you wish to ask your provider, and methods you are most interested in. You can save your profile, email it to yourself or share with your provider.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nDecide + Be Ready will cover important basics about all the methods out there and ask you questions about what you want from birth control (like how you want to use it, how often you want to think about it, and what side effects are going to bother you or make your life better), so you can find the ones that work for you.  The app will also allow you to compare methods side by side, and capture questions you have for your provider. Even if you already have a method in mind, it is good to know your options.  \n\nDecide + Be Ready can be used by anyone.  However, it was specifically developed to meet the unique needs of women in the military.  These servicewomen, when deployed or working in uniquely challenging environments, have additional things to think when choosing a birth control method, like access to methods, or the advantages of being able to manage or even skip their menstrual periods with certain methods. Physical and emotional readiness is critical for the military mission and this app will help servicewomen “be ready” in more ways than one!\n\nDecide + Be Ready is straightforward to use and will guide you through a flow of information and questions that result in tailored recommendations based on your preferences.\n\nDecide + Be Ready was developed jointly by faculty at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU), the Person-Centered Reproductive Health Program at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), and Nitid Bit, LLC.   It is sponsored and maintained by the Defense Health Agency (DHA).\nThe contents, views or opinions expressed in this application are those of the developers and do not necessarily reflect official policy or position of Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, the Department of Defense (DoD), or Departments of the Army, Navy, or Air Force.

      "label": "FIND OUT YOUR RISK OF HEART DISEASE AND HOW TO LOWER IT\n\nThis FREE app is a cardiovascular risk calculator that estimates the possible 10-year risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death. It includes the six regions of the Americas (Andean, Caribbean, Central, North, South, and Tropical) according to tables published in 2019 by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Lancet, 2019). This risk score was based on extensive review of available cohorts and were adapted to 21 global regions based on analysis of the burden of cardiovascular morbidity. For each region, an estimate was published that requires knowing an individual's blood cholesterol level (or other information if the blood cholesterol level is not known). The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), with the financial contribution of the U.S Centers for Diseases Prevention and Control, transformed the published color-coded tables into an online electronic calculator for use on computers and smartphones, updating the previous Cardiocal app (2014)\n\n\nWho is this app for?\n\nThe calculator is intended to help the health care providers quickly calculate cardiovascular risk and discuss with patients the extent to which their risk can be reduced. It also aims to help people concerned about their health, making it easier for them to estimate the need for a medical consultation when their risk is not low. The treatment recommendations are oriented to the assisting professionals and do not constitute a guide to self-medication, which can be dangerous. Under no circumstances is this calculator intended as a replacement for medical consultation or a clinical judgment.\n\nFeatures\n\n» Click on the gear icon to choose a country. Each country belongs to one of the six regions mentioned above, and the risk calculation will give different results.\n\n» You can change the language (English, Spanish, or Portuguese), cholesterol unit (mmol/L or mg/dl), and metric or imperial units (cm or feet and inches).\n\n» The app includes country-specific protocols for the 12 countries whose health ministries have defined standardized protocols for the treatment of hypertension."

      "label": "Do you snore at night and your partner complains about it? Are you sick to death of snoring of your partner?\n\nSnore Control can be the right solution for you. This application records your talk or snoring while you are asleep, creates the graph of noise in room during the night, takes the total time of snoring down and moreover it can try to stop your snoring.\n\nSnoring detection is based on artificial intelligence (A.I.) with the support of a new Apple machine learning technology. By using a large number of snoring samples, we can achieve high accuracy in statistics and in snoring detection itself.\n\nHow it works:\nMobile microphone is used to monitor and optionally record the noise in surroundings. By using intelligent noise analysis the application detects the snoring, makes the statistics or else activates the stop snoring function (at least two snores one after another) - it quiets you down using a sound or vibration (only iPhone). How to place your device correctly is shown in instructions. \nBy using the tracker data and by defining your own factors (activities/means/drugs/custom notes) it is possible to find out which facts influence your sleep positively and limit your snoring. At your disposal there are beautiful statistic charts for simple and efficient analyzing of your sleeps/nights. \n\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n\n- SNORE ANALYZER (TRACKER):\nSnoring analyzes and statistics with complete history and beautiful charts.\n\n- HIGH TECH SNORING DETECTION:\nAccurate snoring detection based on A.I.\n\n- ADJUSTABLE RECORDING SOUND SENSITIVITY:\nFor different sound conditions in your room (a quiet or loud environment).\n\n- RECORDING ONLY SNORING\n\n- FAVORITE RECORDINGS\n\n- SHARING RECORDINGS WITH YOUR FRIENDS:\nSend recordings via email, iMessage or post to Facebook.\n\n- STOP SNORING:\nPossibility of playing chosen sound or using iPhone vibration when the snoring is detected. \n\n- FACTORS, WAKE UP MOOD, NOTES:\nUser can place factors (alcohol, coffee, stress etc.) to every night as well as the mood after waking up or users own notes. \n\n- ACTIVATION DELAY:\nStart monitoring after a period of time.\n\n- BACKGROUND MODE:\nMonitoring runs also in background mode.\n\n- APPLE HEALTH INTEGRATION\n\n- iCLOUD SYNCHRONIZATION:\nSynchronization among your devices (optionally).\n\n- EXPORTING HISTORY TO CSV FILE\n\n- APPLE WATCH:\nPlays haptic (sound, vibration) if snoring is detected.\nIf you buy SMART ALARMS then it will track your sleep movements and it can play haptic (sound, vibration) if alarm is set.\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING:\n* It is recommended to connect your iPhone (iPad) to a charger.\n* Set \"Airplane Mode\" or \"Do Not Disturb\" on your iPhone (iPad) for undisturbed sleep.\n* Place your iPhone (iPad) according to the instructions (see screenshots).\n\n\nCUSTOMER SUPPORT\nHappy customers are our highest priority.

      "label": "Sepsis is a serious systemic infection that can quickly lead to circulatory shock, organ failure and death if inappropriately treated. It is also a serious problem in hospitals throughout the US and the world. In 2017, over 2 million people were admitted to US hospitals for sepsis (#1 cause of index admissions) at a total aggregate cost to the US healthcare system of $38.2 billion dollars (#1 most expensive condition), according to an AHRQ report. Over 270,000 people die of sepsis in the US every year, more than from prostate cancer, breast cancer and AIDS combined. Despite its large toll on public health, public awareness of this condition is poor and the quality of treatment is highly variable often due to delayed recognition and treatment.\n\nIn sepsis, time is of the essence. Successful treatment hinges on prompt recognition of symptoms, correct antibiotic administration, and hemodynamic stabilization. Lack of appropriate sepsis management knowledge at the bedside leads to delayed symptom recognition, serious complications, medical errors, increased treatment costs, and avoidable morbidity and mortality. For this reason, we created this app to provide busy health professionals with essential management information based on the latest practice guidelines in a format that is easily accessible at the point of care.\n\nThe Sepsis app was developed on the ESCAVO mobile publishing platform created specifically for mobile publishing of scientific content. The platform features an intuitive user interface, search, annotation and bookmarking functions, and calculator support. All content is extensively referenced and footnoted where appropriate. \n\nClinical topics covered in the Sepsis app include:\n- Updated with the latest definitions, diagnostic criteria, and management guidelines including the 2016 Sepsis-3 definitions and the newest Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines\n- Epidemiology, risk factors and pathophysiology of sepsis and septic shock\n- Common differentials and etiology, guidelines on performing appropriate H&P and workups\n- Management of common causes including hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP) and intra-abdominal infections\n- Sepsis management bundles, early goal-directed therapy, hemodynamic management, adjunctive therapies, mechanical ventilation of sepsis-induced ARDS, and other essential management guidelines from the SSC and the American Thoracic Society (ATS)\n- Antibiotic therapy including specific guidelines for the treatment of HAP from ATS and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)\n- Guidance on the prevention, recognition and treatment of Clostridium difficile based on the latest IDSA guidelines\n- Information on the diagnosis and management of pediatric and neonatal sepsis including the management of pediatric fever, important differences from adult sepsis, management of sepsis-induced persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), empiric antibiotic treatment recommendations for GBS infections, interventions in pediatric septic shock, and other pediatric-specific information\n- Important score calculators including the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), quick-SOFA, SIRS, APACHE II, Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS), the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, National Early Warning Score (NEWS), the Clinical Pulmonary Infection (CPI) score, the Inferior Vena Cava Collapsibility Index, and others\n- Drug administration information for the management of sepsis including antibacterial and antifungal antibiotics, the latest drugs for emerging multi-drug resistant organisms, adrenergic and other vasoactive agents, corticosteroids and diuretics\n- Relevant COVID-19 management information\n\nRecommended by:\n- US doctors on HealthTap.com\n- MDLinx.com\n- imedicalapps.com\n- The ED Trauma Critical Care Blog (edtcc.com)\n- The Russian Sepsis Forum (sepsisforum.ru)"

Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored.

      "label": "HOW DOES IT WORK?\nLook at the colored ring and pick the color you are drawn to first. There are 7 colors left. Now choose the most pleasant of the remaining colors. Continue until you run out of colors.\n\nACCURACY\nThe test requires performing color selection twice. On the second run do not try to reproduce the previous selection. Forget about it and only select colors based on your preference at this specific moment. Let your submind do the job.\nDo NOT try to associate colors with objects, — cars, clothes, buildings, etc. To get the most accurate results, pick colors you like right at this moment.\n\nWHY DOES THIS WORK?\nColors surrounded mankind since the beginning of time and influenced humans for generations. In the beginning, human life was ruled by two uncontrollable factors: night and day. Light and darkness. For thousands of years man's actions, such as attack (red) or retreat (green) were embedded into our brains. The colors of nature have had their influence on us, and these influences are deep-rooted in our psyche. Colors and their subconscious meaning are there, whether we like it or not. That meaning is independent of race, language, education level, social status, etc.\n\nThis app is the ultimate tool to understand the inner self, mood fluctuation reasons, productivity level, and more.\n\nFEATURES:\n• Anxiety, productivity and energy monitors\n• Detailed mood description\n• Works on iPhone, iPad and Watch\n• Auto syncs to all your devices\n• No registration, accounts or passwords\n• Free, Zero ads, No in-app purchases\n\nSAFE AND SECURE:\nPrivacy is not something that you are merely entitled to, it’s an absolute prerequisite. At Martspec, we believe privacy is a fundamental human right. So we build it into our products from the beginning of the design process.\nWe do not share your data with any 3rd party.

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

      "label": "The simplest program to track breastfeeding, pumping, bottle feeding, solid food consumption, diapers, sleep schedule, height and weight, and more.\n\nWith the click of a button, your feedings and baby care history will be stored in the app. You will have an easy-to-maintain history of your baby’s growth.\n\nThe birth of a baby is a miracle that fills your heart with joy! A mother’s life changes dramatically with the birth of her baby. It is so important for a mother and her newborn baby to establish a comfortable breastfeeding relationship.  Moms need to keep track of which breast to offer her baby, how long the baby suckles at each breast, the number of times the baby breastfeeds each day, how many wet diapers and bowel movements the baby has, how long and frequently the baby sleeps, as well as the baby’s weight and growth.  All of this information is important for the self-assessment of breastfeeding and for assessing the growth of the child.  Having this information easily accessible will be extremely useful when visiting with your pediatrician or lactation consultant.\n\nIt is important to record all of this data. Do not rely on your memory, because even the most organized mothers are often lost in the sea of information about their newborn.\n\nUse the features of the Breastfeeding application.\n\nBreastfeeding and pumping:\n- record the time and quantity of feedings and/or pumpings;\n- note which breast was fed or pumped last to ensure starting new feeding/pumping on the opposite breast;\n- record the duration of feeding/pumping;\n- pause feeding/pumping, if necessary;\n- quickly add feeding/pumping session that was similar to the most recent but updates with the current time\n- use the maximum duration of feeding setting and the application will stop recording the feeding/pumping at the set time if you are unable to press stop\n\nLiquids:\n- consider all of your child’s fluid intake (water, expressed breast milk, formula, juice, etc.);\n -track your child’s reactions to new fluids and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers;\n- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);\n\nFeeding (solid food):\n- add solid foods as your child begins eating them (cereal, vegetables, fruits, meat, fish);\n- track your child’s reactions to these new foods and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers\n- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);\n\nSleep:\n- record the time and duration of your baby’s sleep each day so you can better plan your day;\n- compare your baby’s sleep habits with recommended sleep guidelines\n\nDiapers: \n- track the number of your baby’s wet and/or dirty diapers. This information is crucial for noticing signs of dehydration, constipation, and diarrhea and alerting the child’s pediatrician if necessary.\n\nMeasurements: \n- track height and weight to evaluate your baby’s development;\n\nOther features:\n- edit or delete events as needed;\n- set reminders for various events; \n- use the application in your native language;\n- select your preferred units of measurement;\n- view statistics;\n- enter data for several children and twins;\n- backup all of your data;\n\nAlso available in PRO-version:\n- disable advertising;\t\n- auto backup every 24 hours;\t\n---\nWe offer subscription plans in the app that unlock premium functions of the app:\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Price can depend on location\n\nFor more information please visit the link https://support.apple.com/HT202039\nPrivacy Policy: https://doc.whisperarts.com/policy/breastfeeding/ios/\nTerms of Use: https://doc.whisperarts.com/terms/breastfeeding/ios/"

It allows you to track childrens' growth over time and display the data points on any of the included WHO and CDC growth charts. You can track height, weight, head circumference and BMI and determine the corresponding percentiles.\n\nThere is also a percentile calculator for quick percentile lookup in case you just want to know the percentile of today's measurements.\n\n\n# Data Storage\n\nYou can add as many children and measurements to the built-in database as you like. The data is encrypted – if you have a passcode on your device – meaning it is secure should you lose the device.\n\n\n# Sharing\n\nThe measurements are directly added to the growth chart PDFs. You can email these PDFs, print them out (if you have an AirPrint enabled printer nearby) or share them with other means provided by iOS, such as storing into your Dropbox or box.com. You can do the same with a spreadsheet file containing all this kids on your device, or one file per kid. Finally, there is an export option so you can transfer all your data to a different device of yours or a colleague.\n\n\n# Units\n\nWhether you're used to the metric system and have all data available in centimeter and kilogram or whether you're in the US and using imperial units, Charts has got you covered. You can switch the units you want to use right from the keyboard and these units will be saved as your preferred units. You can also change units from a dedicated list when viewing your child's measurements.\n\n\n# Included Charts\n\nThe app currently includes 40 official growth charts from these institutions:\n\n• World Health Organization (WHO)\n-- 0 - 24 months (weight, length, head circumference and weight for length)\n-- 2 - 5 years (weight, height and weight for height)\n-- 5 - 10 years (weight)\n-- 5 - 19 years (height and BMI)\n\n• Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n-- 0 - 36 months (weight, height, head circumference and weight for length)\n-- 2 - 20 years (weight, height, BMI and weight for height)\n\n\n# Requirements\n\nTo run this app you will need a device running iOS version 7.0 or newer."

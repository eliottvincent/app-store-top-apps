Navigate your city’s public transit system with accurate real-time predictions, simple trip planning, step-by-step navigation, service disruption notifications, and departure and stop reminders... all presented in a clear, bold interface. Public transport not cooperating? Easily request a ride from Uber, Lyft or VIA, or grab the closest bikeshare.  \n\n10 GREAT THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH TRANSIT:\n1) See real-time arrivals for nearby buses and trains instantly upon launch.\n2) Watch your transit vehicle approaching on a map in real-time\n3) Compare options with powerful A to B trip plans using real-time data.\n4) Launch GO for step-by-step navigation when you’re on an unfamiliar route or want to nap/read/space out.*\n5) Receive departure alarms and stop notifications as well as prompts to pick up the pace in GO.*\n6) Get push notifications if service disruptions will affect your commute.\n7) Plan trips, view transit schedules and get route itineraries—even when you’re offline! \n8) Locate bikeshare stations, see the number of bikes available, pay for passes, and unlock bikes (in select cities). \n9) Check ETA (and price) for nearby Uber, Lyft and VIA rides, and book in two taps.\n10) Easily plan and pay for a trip combining Uber, Lyft, or VIA with transit. We call it Transit+ \n\n*continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n5-STAR USER REVIEWS\n“Your app was the deciding factor in selling my car”\n“Blows Google Maps out of the water.” \n\"Probably the best thing on my phone, no joke.\"\n“The head of our local transit agency recommended this app over the one her agency created.”\n\"Truly ingenious work here. Honestly, these guys should be in charge of actual public transportation itself.\"\n\nCITIES\nTransit works in 200+ cities across North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand (see USA list below).\n\nUSA\nAlbuquerque \nAnn Arbor\nAspen\nAtlanta*\nAustin*\nBaltimore (MTA*, RTA, Charm City Circulator*)\nBoston (MBTA*, Massport, MetroWest RTA, Brockton Area Transit (BAT), Lowell RTA, Plymouth & Brockton S.

The connection is established wirelessly between a smartphone, the vehicle and – if available – a communication system via Bluetooth; the app is operated using the multi-controller on the handlebar. We recommend using the BMW Motorrad communication system for listening to music, making telephone calls and receiving navigation instructions.\r\n•\tA mobile Internet connection is required to access traffic information. This may incur costs in line with the contract between the customer and their mobile provider (e.g. for roaming).\r\n•\tPlease note that the functionality of your smartphone and the connection to the vehicle also depend on national requirements and factors; BMW Motorrad therefore cannot guarantee that it will be available at all times.\r\n•\tThe BMW Motorrad Connected app will be displayed in the language you have set for your smartphone. Please note that not all languages are supported.\r\n•\tContinued use of GPS tracking in the background may reduce the battery life of your smartphone.\r\nMake Life a Ride."

      "label": "MiraTrex PRO CHARTS™ is a powerful, yet easy-to-use marine navigation system. Whether you’re a fisherman, weekend cruiser, sailor, diver, jet-skier, or an offshore captain needing to find an exact location hundreds of miles offshore, PRO CHARTS™ will get you there and back home safely – with nothing more than your iPhone or iPad.\n\n\nKey Features:\n\n\n• High-resolution NOAA nautical chart coverage with depths for all U.S. coastal areas, the Great Lakes, major U.S. river systems, and Brazil plus global high-level nautical charts. Charts are automatically updated based on NOAA chart corrections.\n\n• Easy one-touch Waypoint and Route creation. Pre-plan your routes at home or create them at sea with equal ease. Just touch the screen to create new waypoints and routes.\n\n• Find your friends on the water. With our new Buddy-tracking feature, you can see and meet up with your friends while you’re out on the water. If you’re on your secret spot and don’t want to be seen, you can hide your location with the touch of a button.\n\n• Stay safe. Easily create and send a Float Plan of your trip to a friend or family member. Your Float Plan and location history can be forwarded to search and rescue personnel in case of an emergency.\n\n• Easy point-and-steer navigation. The red heading bug on the large on-screen compass always directs you to the next point on your route. Navigation is as easy as pointing your boat at the heading bug to stay on course.\n\n• No Network. No Problem. PRO CHARTS™ is designed so no internet connection is required to view your charts while out on the water. You simply download in advance any charts you’ll need at sea with the touch of a button.\n\n• Record your tracks. Track your position in real-time and later view your track history.\n\n• Fully indexed point of interest (POI) database including weather, aids to navigation (markers and lights), obstructions, tides, currents, your buddies, and more.\n\n\nWebsite: www.miratrex.com\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\nPlans:\n\nBase app with limited features - Free \n14 day trial of all premium features - Free\nAll premium features (Monthly) - $2.99\nAll premium features (Annual) - $29.99 (Save 16%, about 2 months free)\n\n\n\n-Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\n-Your subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period.\n\n-You will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period, for the same duration and at the current subscription rate for that product.\n\n-You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the Apple Settings app after purchase.\n\n-No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.

The Nexar app is constantly being upgraded and we’re committed to building a service that will improve your driving experience and eventually save lives.\n\nHOW DO I GET A NEXAR-POWERED DASH CAM?\nYou can order a dash cam right from the app or from buy.getnexar.com.\n\n---\n\nFEATURES\n\nRecords as you drive\nWhen paired to a compatible camera, Nexar starts recording automatically, whenever you start driving, and streams video to the app. The app works in the background so you can use other apps while driving.\n\nDetects dangerous incidents\nNexar uses AI algorithms and sensors to automatically capture dangerous incidents like hard brakes, sharp turns, and fast accelerations.\n\nProvides instant evidence\nIn case of an accident, the footage is automatically displayed on the Nexar app.\n\nBacks up to the cloud\nAll driving incidents are automatically uploaded to your free and secure Nexar cloud account.\n\n1-Click Report™  for insurance claims\nCreate detailed summaries of driving incidents, including place, time, impact, and footage, to save you time, money and unnecessary stress.\n\n360 Collision Detection\nNexar’s machine learning algorithms identify (and prove) all types of collisions, even when they occur beyond the camera’s frame.\n\nView & share your videos\nAfter every drive, you'll be able to see its summary, including the route and any incident clips that were recorded. Share these clips and other data with friends, family, or your insurance provider, directly through the app.\n\n---\n\n6 THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW\nNexar saves what matters most. Your drives are saved to your phone based on available space. Dangerous incidents are automatically uploaded to your Nexar cloud, where they are never erased.\nNexar lets you control how much storage the app uses.\nThe dash cam connects to the app using its own WiFi signal. You’ll still be able to use your data plan.\nNexar won’t drain your data plan. The app uses data only after an incident was detected, to backup important evidence to your Nexar cloud account.\nYou can use Nexar to share your drives. Trim a driving clip and share it with your friends and family.\nYou own your data. We never share any individual’s data unless they authorize it.\n\n---\n\n24/7 SUPPORT\nNeed help? We're always here to assist. Reach us by email at support@getnexar.com or by in-app chat.\n\n---\n\nKEEP YOUR PHONE CHARGED\nAny app that uses GPS can deplete your phone battery faster, and Nexar is no different. That's why we recommend that you keep your phone charged while using Nexar - a charged phone is a happy phone!\n\n---\n\nRIDESHARE PROTECT PROGRAM\nNexar offers NY rideshare drivers a special subscription with premium features and an insurance discount with select NY insurance providers.\n\nAuto-renewable subscription payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period, your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.

The Compass shows your real-time orientation in this elevation app.\n\n5-Star Reviews:\n\"I love this app, wherever I go snowmobiling or hiking I always use it.\"\n\n\"This app really works well. I enjoy checking the altitude wherever I am. Nice!\"\n\nA simple and uncluttered interface to read:\n• Altitude or Elevation\n• Latitude\n• Longitude\n\nFeatures\n• Highest GPS accuracy for your device\n• Ground elevation from topographical map values\n• View in feet or meters\n• Built-in flashlight\n\nSharing\n• Share screenshots with beautiful backgrounds\n• Share on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Email, or text message\n\nUse the Custom Background upgrade to take a photo from the top of a mountain and take a screenshot with your altitude overlaid to show your family & friends.\n\nBackgrounds (In-App purchases):\n• Meadow landscape (Illustrated)\n• Cityscape (Illustrated)\n• Mountains (Illustrated)\n• Abstract\n• Choose Your Own\n\nNote: Many customers with high altitude illnesses or sensitivities, such as chronic lung disease, asthma, COPD, & emphysema find this app useful for avoiding high altitudes. It is also used by hikers and climbers who want to avoid high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) and high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). However, the altitude shown is potentially subject to large inaccuracies and this app should NOT be used as a primary device for determining altitude for medical reasons."

Intuition, surprise, confidence: rediscover what the algorithms try to make you forget.\n \nDérives can be shared!\nA meeting point, a cool exhibition, a restaurant to try? Send a dérive to your friends and guide them to your favourites. Leave them a note to discover when they arrive at the place you chose!\n \n \nSurprise mode!\nWanna play? Share a surprise dérive with your friends by hiding the exact address from them. Let them strive to discover the spot where you are taking them. On arrival, the address and your secret message will be revealed. Ideal for a first date, a birthday party or a little thrill in your daily life!\n \nSo download the app, discover your city and share your adventures! \n\nNeed more reasons to use Dérive? \nDérive is committed to intimate, human, local and responsible travel:\n \n- Intimate: Dérive does not collect your personal data, because it does not need it to work, and because your private life is none of our business. Even if many other applications would say the opposite ;)\n \n- Human: Moving around all the time optimizing your way is for robots, not for humans. No need to look for speed and efficiency when you just want to enjoy the ride. Dérive just helps you rediscover the pleasure of strolling.\n \n- Local: London is not New York, Paris is not Los Angeles and Rome is not Atlanta. Our cities are not gridded and designed for cars. They are full of hidden spots and are a paradise for pedestrians. So why use the same navigation app to get around?\n \n \n- Responsible: Dérive is a lightweight application. It doesn't need to constantly optimize your journey time and display a map full of information to work. As a result, there is less CO2 emitted and less impact on your battery!\n \nDérive requires a working compass on your smartphone.\n \nDérive is a project created by Hérétique."

      "label": "Map, Track, Sync and Share Your Trek From Anywhere\n\nFor adventure seekers, explorers and outdoor enthusiasts, the Garmin Explore ecosystem offers a complete mobile navigation solution that  — when paired with a compatible Garmin device¹ — lets you map, track and navigate your trek from anywhere with unlimited cloud storage.\n\nGarmin Explore provides basic trip planning or viewing of maps you’ve preloaded on your device. Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period at the same cost as your original purchase.\n\n\nTIPS FOR MAPPING ROUTES\n• For longer routes, try zooming in and mapping your route in multiple segments.\n• Tap and hold the map to quickly route between waypoints and POIs.\n• Did Footpath snap to the wrong roads? Trace over the incorrect segment to edit, or use the eraser tool.\n• Turn off snap to roads (magnet icon) and zoom in to manually trace the map. (Try switching to a satellite layer).\n• Displaying maps and continuously running GPS in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Navigate without maps or with the screen off for all day battery life.\n\n\nCONTACT US\nWe've got a lot planned for Footpath. If you have any suggestions or feedback, or if you run into any issues, please contact us at support@footpathapp.com\n\n\nTerms of Service: https://footpathapp.com/terms\nPrivacy Policy: https://footpathapp.com/privacy"

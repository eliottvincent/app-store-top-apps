Nice!\"\n\nA simple and uncluttered interface to read:\n• Altitude or Elevation\n• Latitude\n• Longitude\n\nFeatures\n• Highest GPS accuracy for your device\n• Ground elevation from topographical map values\n• View in feet or meters\n• Built-in flashlight\n\nSharing\n• Share screenshots with beautiful backgrounds\n• Share on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Email, or text message\n\nUse the Custom Background upgrade to take a photo from the top of a mountain and take a screenshot with your altitude overlaid to show your family & friends.\n\nBackgrounds (In-App purchases):\n• Meadow landscape (Illustrated)\n• Cityscape (Illustrated)\n• Mountains (Illustrated)\n• Abstract\n• Choose Your Own\n\nNote: Many customers with high altitude illnesses or sensitivities, such as chronic lung disease, asthma, COPD, & emphysema find this app useful for avoiding high altitudes. It is also used by hikers and climbers who want to avoid high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) and high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). However, the altitude shown is potentially subject to large inaccuracies and this app should NOT be used as a primary device for determining altitude for medical reasons."

It’ll decide the order that avoids traffic, prevents backtracking and means you’ll finish your delivery route significantly earlier.\n\nCircuit helps you complete your deliveries faster throughout the day. Once your route has been planned, easily access the address and extra information you need to quickly make the delivery, such as the gate code, special delivery instructions, or the recipient’s name. And, with a single tap, Circuit works with your favourite navigation app.\n\nCircuit delivery route planner provides estimated arrival times for multiple stops on your planned route, and these estimated arrival times are automatically updated as you make deliveries. Whether you're behind or ahead of schedule, the arrival times will always be up to date.\n\nIf you’re behind schedule, re-optimize the remainder of your route to avoid traffic where possible and arrive on time and within the stop’s delivery time window.\n\nUsers driving delivery routes save themselves multiple hours every day by optimising the order of their route’s stops with Circuit."

      "label": "Turn your iPhone and iPad into a Speedometer with Speedometer One! Speedometer One is also suitable for cars, boats, motorcycles, or other types of vehicles. We have various features to make Speedometer the best speed tracker app for IOS devices. We use GPS to track your speed and alert you when you are over the speed limit. There are other features that will be useful for you such as Night Mode, HUD screen, and many more.  \n\nHave you ever driven a car and worried that you go over the speed limit? Driving too fast can get you into trouble especially if there are some traffic cops nearby with their speed radar gun. That’s why we add Speed Limit Alert as one of the most important features of our app. You can enable and disable it. We support US and EU style speed limit signs and support different display units. This means that it will make it easier to drive when you visit EU or USA. \n\nAside from tracking your speed, Speedometer one also can track your distance, altitude, average speed, and top speed. \n\n=== FEATURES OF SPEEDOMETER ONE: ===\n\n\t•\tAccurate Speedometer for Cars, Boats, Motorcycle or other types of Vehicles. \n\t•\tChoose your units mph, km/h, or knots. \n\t•\tSupport Night Mode with high contrast on the screen. \n\t•\tSupport Landscape or Portrait Mode.\n\t•\tSpeed Limit Alert: Enable this option first, and \n\t•\tHUD (Head Unit Display) Mode \n\t•\tSupports USA and EU speed limit. \n\t•\tChoose over 44 themes (22 dark and 22 light) through In-App Purchase. \n\nWhen you use the HUD mode, you can put your iPhone on the dashboard near the windshield. Our app is very customizable, especially if you’ve unlocked our themes. You can choose the look and display according to your needs: your mood, eyesight, night or day. Our customization is what sets us apart from other similar apps. Try it for yourself today!\n\nIMPORTANT USAGE NOTE: \n\n\t•\tTo be able to use Speedometer One, please allow Location Services.  \n\t•\tSet what kind of vehicle you use and the max speed before using. \n\t•\tSpeedometer One is not compatible with Wifi only iPad or iPod Touch. \n\t•\tOur speed tracker is based on GPS info. GPS sensor is not always accurate due to the device hardware sensor limitation. When in doubt, always rely on your car’s speedometer.\n\t•\tGPS is most accurate when you are in wide-open spaces. Trees, tall buildings, and other things might affect your GPS accuracy. \n\t•\tProlong use of GPS will affect your battery life. \n\t•\tPlease stay safe. Focus on the road ahead and do not interact with any device when you are driving, especially when you are driving at high speed.\n\nLove Speedometer One! Give it a rating and review on our Appstore page and don’t forget to share it with your friends and family! If you encounter a problem when using the app, please send us an email about it and we will work ASAP to fix it."

You have just spotted a ship off the coast and now you want to see which ship it is exactly and where it is going – do this easily with this marine traffic app. This ship radar app allows locating and tracking vessels – whether domestic or international, small or big – all this is live and free.\n\nUsing this ship tracker is very simple. Use the marine traffic map and select the ship you want to track. You will then be shown various details about this vessel and its current route.\n\nAvailable vessel details:\n-vessel name, IMO and photos\n-vessel type and flag\n-next port and ETA\n-course and speed\n-length and width\n\nThis vessel finder app also contains a port map. With this map you can find out the most important information about large and small harbors from all over the world with just one click.\n\nIn addition, you can call up 7-day wind, wave and weather forecasts, which will help you with your passage planning and weather management. Check the weather before and during trips, ocean races, regattas, cruises and all other types of offshore passages.\n\nA compass is also integrated into this tracking app. This easy-to-use compass helps you to determine your own current position and thus helps you spotting ships with the ship radar map around your current location.\n\nAre you wondering how it is possible that all this information appears live on your smartphone or tablet? Most modern ships have an AIS (Automatic Identification System) transceiver installed. This transceiver then sends the marine traffic information to a network of ship traffic stations around the world, so that you can see the exact current ship position and details about the ship.\n\nDownload the free ship tracker app now!"

Whether you want a scenic, winding route or the fastest way from A to B, voice commands and the clear TFT display with arrows providing directions will guide you and your motorbike safely to your destination.

We recommend using the BMW Motorrad communication system for listening to music, making telephone calls and receiving navigation instructions.\r\n•\tA mobile Internet connection is required to access traffic information. This may incur costs in line with the contract between the customer and their mobile provider (e.g. for roaming).\r\n•\tPlease note that the functionality of your smartphone and the connection to the vehicle also depend on national requirements and factors; BMW Motorrad therefore cannot guarantee that it will be available at all times.\r\n•\tThe BMW Motorrad Connected app will be displayed in the language you have set for your smartphone. Please note that not all languages are supported.\r\n•\tContinued use of GPS tracking in the background may reduce the battery life of your smartphone.\r\nMake Life a Ride."

It is not intended to be a replacement for full-featured mobile navigation apps, such as Google Maps or the pre-installed Maps app. Being light-weight means, for example, that it does not let you save offline maps and it does not recalculate routes automatically when you go off-course. In comparison to those full-featured apps, it will be better for your battery life. And, of course, it will allow you to navigate GPX files and all other possibilities which are offered in the route planning screen.\n\n---\nSUBSCRIPTION TERMS:\n\nThis app offers the possibility to purchase an auto-renewable subscription: \"Unlock r.485\". The length of this subscription is one year. By subscribing to our service, any content previously blocked in the app, such as the detailed driving instructions, will always be displayed.\n\nPayment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.\n\nSubscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n\nTerms of use and privacy policy link: https://r-485-privacy-policy.blogspot.be"

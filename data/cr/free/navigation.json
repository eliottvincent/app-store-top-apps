We've also carefully designed FeedFinder so that it can be used one-handed as much as possible so that you can even be adding a review of a breastfeeding place as you breastfeed your little one.\n\nYou can use FeedFinder to find places around you where other mothers have had positive breastfeeding experiences. Every recommended place on the map will have been reviewed by someone who's breastfeeding. You'll be able to see not only how they have rated that place, but also any handy comments that they have added about their experience or the location, like whether they have toys and a menu for toddlers, or where the breastfeeding room is if it's a bit difficult to find.\n\nIf you can't find somewhere near you, or have found a new gem be sure to add the new place to the map. You'll find the process easy and convenient with FeedFinder doing most the hard work, like locating the place on the map, or adding the address details – all you'll need to do is add a star rating and your own comments. \n\nFeedFinder is part of a project by Open Lab Newcastle University, UK. Check out http://feed-finder.co.uk/ for more details."

Navigate your city’s public transit system with accurate real-time predictions, simple trip planning, step-by-step navigation, service disruption notifications, and departure and stop reminders... all presented in a clear, bold interface. Public transport not cooperating? Easily request a ride from Uber, Lyft or VIA, or grab the closest bikeshare.  \n\n10 GREAT THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH TRANSIT:\n1) See real-time arrivals for nearby buses and trains instantly upon launch.\n2) Watch your transit vehicle approaching on a map in real-time\n3) Compare options with powerful A to B trip plans using real-time data.\n4) Launch GO for step-by-step navigation when you’re on an unfamiliar route or want to nap/read/space out.*\n5) Receive departure alarms and stop notifications as well as prompts to pick up the pace in GO.*\n6) Get push notifications if service disruptions will affect your commute.\n7) Plan trips, view transit schedules and get route itineraries—even when you’re offline! \n8) Locate bikeshare stations, see the number of bikes available, pay for passes, and unlock bikes (in select cities). \n9) Check ETA (and price) for nearby Uber, Lyft and VIA rides, and book in two taps.\n10) Easily plan and pay for a trip combining Uber, Lyft, or VIA with transit.

Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device.

Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place.

Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally.

We recommend using the BMW Motorrad communication system for listening to music, making telephone calls and receiving navigation instructions.\r\n•\tA mobile Internet connection is required to access traffic information. This may incur costs in line with the contract between the customer and their mobile provider (e.g. for roaming).\r\n•\tPlease note that the functionality of your smartphone and the connection to the vehicle also depend on national requirements and factors; BMW Motorrad therefore cannot guarantee that it will be available at all times.\r\n•\tThe BMW Motorrad Connected app will be displayed in the language you have set for your smartphone. Please note that not all languages are supported.\r\n•\tContinued use of GPS tracking in the background may reduce the battery life of your smartphone.\r\nMake Life a Ride."

You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

As far as no (expensive) pricise or certified survey results are required, Hectare.app will provide reliable data and a structured protocol.\n\nThe free version of Hectare.app allows you to get to familiarize yourself with the app. Hectare.app is fully functional but doesn't show results other than the side lenghts or the circumference.

Trace over the incorrect segment to edit, or use the eraser tool.\n• Turn off snap to roads (magnet icon) and zoom in to manually trace the map. (Try switching to a satellite layer).\n• Displaying maps and continuously running GPS in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Navigate without maps or with the screen off for all day battery life.\n\n\nCONTACT US\nWe've got a lot planned for Footpath.

      "label": "MiraTrex PRO CHARTS™ is a powerful, yet easy-to-use marine navigation system. Whether you’re a fisherman, weekend cruiser, sailor, diver, jet-skier, or an offshore captain needing to find an exact location hundreds of miles offshore, PRO CHARTS™ will get you there and back home safely – with nothing more than your iPhone or iPad.\n\n\nKey Features:\n\n\n• High-resolution NOAA nautical chart coverage with depths for all U.S. coastal areas, the Great Lakes, major U.S. river systems, and Brazil plus global high-level nautical charts. Charts are automatically updated based on NOAA chart corrections.\n\n• Easy one-touch Waypoint and Route creation. Pre-plan your routes at home or create them at sea with equal ease. Just touch the screen to create new waypoints and routes.\n\n• Find your friends on the water. With our new Buddy-tracking feature, you can see and meet up with your friends while you’re out on the water. If you’re on your secret spot and don’t want to be seen, you can hide your location with the touch of a button.\n\n• Stay safe. Easily create and send a Float Plan of your trip to a friend or family member. Your Float Plan and location history can be forwarded to search and rescue personnel in case of an emergency.\n\n• Easy point-and-steer navigation. The red heading bug on the large on-screen compass always directs you to the next point on your route. Navigation is as easy as pointing your boat at the heading bug to stay on course.\n\n• No Network. No Problem. PRO CHARTS™ is designed so no internet connection is required to view your charts while out on the water. You simply download in advance any charts you’ll need at sea with the touch of a button.\n\n• Record your tracks. Track your position in real-time and later view your track history.\n\n• Fully indexed point of interest (POI) database including weather, aids to navigation (markers and lights), obstructions, tides, currents, your buddies, and more.\n\n\nWebsite: www.miratrex.com\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\nPlans:\n\nBase app with limited features - Free \n14 day trial of all premium features - Free\nAll premium features (Monthly) - $2.99\nAll premium features (Annual) - $29.99 (Save 16%, about 2 months free)\n\n\n\n-Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\n-Your subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period.\n\n-You will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period, for the same duration and at the current subscription rate for that product.\n\n-You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the Apple Settings app after purchase.\n\n-No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.

Usually, a diagram called a compass rose shows the directions north, south, east, and west on the compass face as abbreviated initials. When the compass is used, the rose can be aligned with the corresponding geographic directions; for example, the \"N\" mark on the rose really points northward.

AIS marine traffic information directly in the application for free!\nA user friendly interface for AIS marine traffic is finally here.\nForget about busy and loaded screens with thousands of dots that make information difficult to understand. Now terrestrial AIS information is intelligently shown for an easy understanding.\nIs your favorite anchoring spot busy? Is your best fishing spot taken? Now you can identify vessels, traffic in a certain area and take the best decisions where to navigate.\n\nIQ Traffic - SMARTPHONE BASED REAL MARINE TIME TRAFFIC\n\nTogether, safer on water! Introducing our innovative smart marine traffic that uses smartphone technology. Even if your boat does not have AIS, your smartphone acts like one showing you as an anonymous boat only when you are on water.  This only if you decide to create a flotilla and only if you are on water.\nThis way, everyone contributes to a safer boating experience with real time marine traffic information not available before. Be sure to spread the word to other boaters!\n\nFLOTILLA MODE\n\nDo you want to see in real time the location of your friends on other boats for easier coordination? Just create a flotilla and invite your skipper friends to it. The moment they accept and they are on water you will be able to “sea” the location information of all flotilla members for easier coordination as a group, details of each flotilla member such as: current speed, distance relative to your location, their GPS coordinates \nNow you can better plan your approaches, you can easily reach them in case they need support or join them in that perfect swimming location! \n\nPERSONAL BESTS\n\nAre you the lead skipper of your flotilla? Now you can actually prove it. \nThe app automatically logs your personal bests such as overall nautical miles covered, highest speed reached or longest leg when you are in a flotilla. \nIt is smart enough not to log your on land activities so no worries if you hop on a scooter on an island. Your land activities are not tracked or logged so your on water record stays clean and accurate. \n\nPRIVACY WHEN ON LAND \n\nWe listened! A smart solution should provide information when needed. That is why we designed our application so that it will not show your location to other flotilla members when you are on land. It will show only your last logged on water location."

Even if many other applications would say the opposite ;)\n \n- Human: Moving around all the time optimizing your way is for robots, not for humans. No need to look for speed and efficiency when you just want to enjoy the ride. Dérive just helps you rediscover the pleasure of strolling.\n \n- Local: London is not New York, Paris is not Los Angeles and Rome is not Atlanta. Our cities are not gridded and designed for cars. They are full of hidden spots and are a paradise for pedestrians. So why use the same navigation app to get around?\n \n \n- Responsible: Dérive is a lightweight application. It doesn't need to constantly optimize your journey time and display a map full of information to work. As a result, there is less CO2 emitted and less impact on your battery!\n \nDérive requires a working compass on your smartphone.\n \nDérive is a project created by Hérétique."

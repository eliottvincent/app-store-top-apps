      "label": "\"Gives you the best route to where you want to go\" - New York Times\n“You won't realize how much time you can save planning until you use this app” - LA Times\n“Killer app” - WSJ \n\"MBTA has a favorite transit app — and it's called Transit\" - Boston Globe\n\nTransit is your real-time urban travel companion. Navigate your city’s public transit system with accurate real-time predictions, simple trip planning, step-by-step navigation, service disruption notifications, and departure and stop reminders... all presented in a clear, bold interface. Public transport not cooperating? Easily request a ride from Uber, Lyft or VIA, or grab the closest bikeshare.  \n\n10 GREAT THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH TRANSIT:\n1) See real-time arrivals for nearby buses and trains instantly upon launch.\n2) Watch your transit vehicle approaching on a map in real-time\n3) Compare options with powerful A to B trip plans using real-time data.\n4) Launch GO for step-by-step navigation when you’re on an unfamiliar route or want to nap/read/space out.*\n5) Receive departure alarms and stop notifications as well as prompts to pick up the pace in GO.*\n6) Get push notifications if service disruptions will affect your commute.\n7) Plan trips, view transit schedules and get route itineraries—even when you’re offline! \n8) Locate bikeshare stations, see the number of bikes available, pay for passes, and unlock bikes (in select cities). \n9) Check ETA (and price) for nearby Uber, Lyft and VIA rides, and book in two taps.\n10) Easily plan and pay for a trip combining Uber, Lyft, or VIA with transit. We call it Transit+ \n\n*continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n5-STAR USER REVIEWS\n“Your app was the deciding factor in selling my car”\n“Blows Google Maps out of the water.” \n\"Probably the best thing on my phone, no joke.\"\n“The head of our local transit agency recommended this app over the one her agency created.”\n\"Truly ingenious work here. Honestly, these guys should be in charge of actual public transportation itself.\"\n\nCITIES\nTransit works in 200+ cities across North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand (see USA list below).\n\nUSA\nAlbuquerque \nAnn Arbor\nAspen\nAtlanta*\nAustin*\nBaltimore (MTA*, RTA, Charm City Circulator*)\nBoston (MBTA*, Massport, MetroWest RTA, Brockton Area Transit (BAT), Lowell RTA, Plymouth & Brockton S.

All current editions of the boating charts or maps from NV Verlag / NV Charts can be easily downloaded and used for offline navigation with the NV Charts App. All latest editions of NV Charts nautical boating charts or inland charts including | North Sea | Baltic Sea | Netherlands | Wadden Sea | IJsselmeer | Sweden | Denmark | Germany | Norway | France | USA | Caribbean | Bahamas areas are compatible with NV Charts App.\n\nOne way to have great nautical charts both on paper and on our phone or tablet is to use our popular combination pack of paper and digital nautical charts, which includes both charts in clever atlas format and a license for digital nautical marine boating charts/maps for use in the NV Charts App, including an update service. The advantage: Both your paper and digital  charts are up to date. \nIn addition you can also purchase digital boating charts as a subscription directly in the NV Charts App. The subscription duration is one year and is automatically extended. \nIf it is not yet clear where the journey is going to take you, free online charts can be displayed in the app, even without a current subscription or valid paperchart edition. \n\nThe latest information is essential for safe navigation on the water. With the NV Charts App you have the possibility to become part of the Seame boating community. You can now add marinas, anchorages and navigation warnings to the digital chart and also add and share interesting places beyond navigation, such as restaurants or points of interest with pictures. Others can respond directly with comments. The continuously edited content can be downloaded directly to be available offline. In order to make all information easily accessible, we have improved the search function: You can explore the surroundings and search directly for place names as well as anchorages, harbours, ramps, waypoints, cranes, petrol stations, or tide stations. In addition, an auto-routing function has been integrated, which allows you to navigate directly to your destination.\n\nTogether navigation on board is even more fun! You can now share your tracks with friends or use the data outside the app and export it as GPX file. You can share your favorite harbours and anchorages from the app simply by clicking on a link and coordinate your trip planning even better with everyone.\n\nWith the AIS function in the NV Charts App you can keep an eye on AIS signals in real-time. You can connect a Wlan AIS receiver to the NV Charts and the app display AIS Class A and B signals and navigation aids (ATON), as well as MOB AIS SART transponder distress transmitters, directly in the digital chart in real-time and the traffic situation can be assessed better. \n\nThe NV Charts App can be installed and synchronized on multiple devices. \n\nNV Charts App - Features: \n+ Search function\n+ Autorouting (Europe + other regions following soon)\n+ Velocity Made Good (VMG)\n+ Community Layer / Points of Interest(POI)\n+ Free online boating charts preview for planning\n+ In App Purchases of digital offline charts\n+ Community Layer / Points of Interest(POI)\n+ Reads all NV Chart chart areas \n+ Easy download of the maps\n+ Always the latest data \n+ Seamless zoom and panning functions\n+ Tide Forecast\n+ Online weather\n+ AIS Wifi Support\n+ AIS Sart Beacon \n+ AIS CPA function \n+ Night mode\n+ Anchor alarm\n+ Position with GPS \n+ Intuitive route planning\n+ Course markings, markings, bearing ruler \n+ Port information \n+ Display of instruments\n+ Synchronizing devices\n+ Live Position Sharing\n+ Social sharing of routes, tracks, positions\n\nNote:\nContinued use of GPS in the background can significantly reduce battery life."

      "label": "Sweep N' Park is a powerful visualization tool that helps you park where street sweeping or tow-away restrictions are expiring.  It also lets you visualize meters and hourly parking.\n\nIf you have some flexibility with your arrival time, Sweep N' Park can quite helpful.  It relies on the fact that parking is more likely to be available on streets where the street sweeper has just gone through, or where tow-away restrictions have just expired. \n\nSweep N’ Park overlays street sweep, tow-away, meters and time limit information on top of a map of San Francisco.  The spinners at the bottom of the map animate parking regulation changes over time, by allowing you to quickly change the day and hour.\n\n\n*  Tips and Tricks\n\n Sweep N' Park is most helpful on weekdays because this is when street sweep and tow-away restrictions are active.\n\n1. Parking in the Financial District just as tow-away ends\n\nMany streets in the Financial District have tow-away restrictions Monday through Friday starting at 3pm or 4pm and ending at 6pm or 7pm.  If you can time your arrival at 6pm or 7pm then Sweep N' Park makes it is easier to find parking.\n\n2. Taking advantage of street sweep, by neighborhood\n\nSan Francisco neighborhoods do the bulk of their street sweeping Monday through Friday 8am-2pm. If you arrive just as street sweep ends or even when street sweep is currently active, then it can be much easier to find parking.\n\n3. Parking in an active street sweep zone\n\nAccording to the San Francisco Public Works, it is legal to park in an active street sweep zone if the sweeper has already passed through.\n\nHere are some tricks and tips to use **AT YOUR OWN RISK**, for determining if the sweeper has already passed through one side of a particular block in an active street sweep zone:\n\na. It may be obvious from the state of the street that it has already been swept.  For example, the side of the street with active street sweep looks clean but there are a lot of leaves or trash on the sidewalk or across the street.\n\nb. If local residents (for example, cars with lettered residential parking permit stickers) are parked in an active street sweep zone, then the sweeper has likely passed by."

We recommend using the BMW Motorrad communication system for listening to music, making telephone calls and receiving navigation instructions.\r\n•\tA mobile Internet connection is required to access traffic information. This may incur costs in line with the contract between the customer and their mobile provider (e.g. for roaming).\r\n•\tPlease note that the functionality of your smartphone and the connection to the vehicle also depend on national requirements and factors; BMW Motorrad therefore cannot guarantee that it will be available at all times.\r\n•\tThe BMW Motorrad Connected app will be displayed in the language you have set for your smartphone. Please note that not all languages are supported.\r\n•\tContinued use of GPS tracking in the background may reduce the battery life of your smartphone.\r\nMake Life a Ride."

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer app with the same sophisticated brain inside as our paid version. When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

Geographic or UTM projected coordinates are shown at all times.\n\nPOINT SURVEY\nThe application allows data collection of single points, whose coordinates are got from the GPS, showing the estimated precision by a circle, as is usual in location-based programs.\nThe points are automatically numbered, recording date and time, and can be separated in different layers. User can also enter point codes, choosing them from a quick list.\n\nCONTINUOUS SURVEY\nIt is also possible to perform a continuous survey, recording vertices automatically by an interval of time, distance or height difference.\nAt any time you can view the polyline data, such as minimum and maximum heights, length and area. Vertex information can be displayed as well.\nYou can work with multiple layers, with different names and colors.\n\nRESULTS\nSurvey can be exported to a KML file, that can be sent by email from the app. This file can also be imported by TcpMDT and other CAD and GIS applications.\n\nSETTINGS\nEditing preferences lets you to change the appearance of map, points and lines captured. It also sets parameters for data collection, information displayed in real time and others.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n• Operating System: iOS 7 or higher\n• Integrated GPS\n• Internet access"

This app will quickly find the location of another phone by sending a text message request. Most phones manufactured after 2010 can accept this request, no need to install any additional app on the 2nd person's phone. It does not get any easier than this!\n\nHow it is working:\n\n• User A wants to know a User B location.\n\n• User A enters the phone number of User B into the app.\n\n• The app generates a unique URL, and the URL is sent to User B.\n\n• If User B clicks on the link, user A will see the location of user B.\n\nLimitations:\n\n• This is not a spy app. User B must agree to share the location with you.\n\n• If User B has a device without GPS (desktop computer, tablet), the determined location may have a large accuracy margin (up to 5 km).\n\n• In rare situations, when user B is behind the corporate proxy, the app can show the proxy's location, not the user's.\n\nThe user location is determined in three ways:\n\n• E.123, E.164\n• RIR\n• W3C Geolocation API\n\nAuto-renewing subscription:\nTitle: Full Access 1m\nLength: 1 month\nPrice: $1,99 (check the price in the app)\n\nEULA:\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://www.codeesteem.com/apps/phone-location/PrivacyPolicy.pdf"

      "label": "We know parking is frustrating. It really does not have to be that way. Download Polly and start saving time, money and frustration. \n\n-So who is Polly?\nPolly is a parking fairy which knows about the most ideal parking spot, near your destination.              \nIt also enables you to navigate from your current location directly to a parking spot, either on-street or in carparks.  It recognizes all the city carparks and all the streets where you can find, every hour, an excellent parking. Just download and try it!\n\n- Optimal driver experience for easy parking\nWe wish to offer the motorist a whole new way of parking: fast, efficient and economical. \nPolly users will be offered:\n1. Recommendations for parking options on the street or in a carparks around the destination, in real time and according to the chosen criteria (price, availability or distance).\n2. Intelligent navigation: from its current position to its parking location, maximizing the chances of finding parking on the street as quickly as possible;\n3. The possibility of reserving a place in a suggested carpark for a defined period in advance and benefiting from up to 40% discounts;\n4. Seamless access to the carpark: the driver no longer takes a ticket because the carpark recognizes his car, the gate opens automatically and payment is automatic;\n5. The possibility of paying for on-street parking and in the carparks straight from the application;\n\n* In cities where this service is available\n\n- How does it work?\nJust tell Polly where you would like to park. Polly will provide you an ideal parking recommendation, in real time and in person, nearby your destination. Choose your favorite option, and Polly will navigate you directly to a parking spot. For better decisions, please note that during navigation for parking on the street, you will see signs showing whether the parking is allowed and how far you are going to the destination. And yes, Polly remembers where you left your car.\n\n- Already there \nIn case you have reached your destination - at a touch of a button, you will see a screen with the best options for finding convenient parking around your current location. All you have to do is choose your preferred choice and press Go. Polly will surprise you with finding an ideal parking spot.\n\n- For me, only carparks\nThe supply of carparks in Polly is large and rich thanks to a foot mapping process carried out by its ground crew. You can ask Polly to list the details of all the carparks in your target area, and a navigation route to the selected parking lot. At any stage, you can change and choose another parking lot.\n\nאנחנו יודעים שחניה היא משימה מתסכלת ולא פשוטה. ובדיוק בשביל זה הגיעה פולי לעולם. הוריד את פולי ותתחיל לחסוך כסף, זמן והרבה תסכול.\n \nאז מי זאת פולי ?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 פולי היא פיית חניה שיודעת לנווט אותך למקום חניה בקרבת היעד שלך .היא מכירה את כל החניונים בעיר ואת כל הרחובות בהם ניתן למצוא, בכל שעה, חניה מעולה. היא כל מה שצריך כדי להחנות מכונית בעיר עמוסה. פשוט, הורד ותנסה אותה !\nאיך זה עובד ?\nעם הקלדת כתובת ,יוצגו לבחירתך, אפשרויות למציאת חניה בעיר. יש לבחור את האפשרות המועדפת עליך, ופולי כבר תנווט אותך למקום חניה . לתשומת ליבך,במהלך הניווט לחיפוש חניה ברחוב, יוצגו סימנים המציגים האם החניה מותרת לך ואת מרחק ההליכה שלך ליעד . וכן, היא מאפשרת תשלום על חניה והיא זוכרת איפה חנית.\nאתה כבר שם?\nהגעת ליעד - בלחיצה אחת על פולי, יוצג מסך עם המלצת החניה של פולי ואפשרויות נוספות למציאת חניה נוחה סביב מיקומך הנוכחי. מסלול לחניה ברחוב, חניונים והסברים. כל מה שנשאר לך הוא לבחור את האפשרות המועדפת עליך וללחוץ סע . פולי כבר תפתיע אותך במציאת חניה חלומית.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\nהמשך השימוש של ה- GPS פועל ברקע יכול להקטין באופן דרמטי את חיי הסוללה"

This means that it will make it easier to drive when you visit EU or USA. \n\nAside from tracking your speed, Speedometer one also can track your distance, altitude, average speed, and top speed. \n\n=== FEATURES OF SPEEDOMETER ONE: ===\n\n\t•\tAccurate Speedometer for Cars, Boats, Motorcycle or other types of Vehicles. \n\t•\tChoose your units mph, km/h, or knots. \n\t•\tSupport Night Mode with high contrast on the screen. \n\t•\tSupport Landscape or Portrait Mode.\n\t•\tSpeed Limit Alert: Enable this option first, and \n\t•\tHUD (Head Unit Display) Mode \n\t•\tSupports USA and EU speed limit. \n\t•\tChoose over 44 themes (22 dark and 22 light) through In-App Purchase. \n\nWhen you use the HUD mode, you can put your iPhone on the dashboard near the windshield.

      "label": "Featured in Watercolor Artist Magazine, Artists Magazine, LifeHacker, Apple News, The Guardian, AR / VR journey, and more!\n\nDa Vinci Eye is the essential digital tool for non-digital artists. Don’t just take our word for it - we’re one of the top five Graphics & Design apps in over 100 countries.\n\nDa Vinci Eye is used by thousands of creatives from painters to bakers to make incredible artwork. The app is not just for tracing, it offers a wide range of drawing tools, lessons, daily drawing prompts, and a supportive community to share your artwork!\n\nIMPORTANT!: Please read how this app works below and the device requirements for AR Mode BEFORE purchasing.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\n• Create incredible artwork from your own photos\n• Make hyper-realistic drawings with our strobe feature\n• Record time-lapse videos of your drawings\n• Separate images into layers by color value, then view those areas on your canvas\n• Easily learn the fundamentals of drawing\n• Breakdown any image into step-by-step instructions\n• Video tutorials\n• Use filters to make drawing even easier\n• Zoom in to capture micro details in your drawings\n• Connect with our community to share your artwork\n• Insanely fast customer support!\n\nPERFECT FOR ANY ARTIST\n\n• Bakers\n• Cartoonists\n• Tattoo Artists\n• Illustrators\n• Fiverr Designers\n• Hobbyists\n• Makeup artists\n• Nail Technicians\n• Animators\n\nNo matter what skill level you’re at — Da Vinci Eye is here for you!\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nHow many times have you been drawing a portrait for hours only to realize that the nose or the eye is in the wrong place? You can use Da Vinci Eye to layout artwork before you begin or even check your work as you progress.\n\nHaving a hard time seeing where lights or darks go? Breakdown images into layers by color value. Then virtually project those layers on top of your image. You can see exactly where to place the darkest darks, mid-tones, and highlights.\n\nCAN'T THINK OF WHAT TO DRAW?\n\nCheck out our inspiration section for user uploaded reference photos. If you have a great pic, you can even upload your own content for other artists to draw.\n\nLEARNING HOW TO DRAW?\n\nWe have lessons using our unique patent-pending learning method. You can also turn ANY photo into a step by step shading drawing lesson.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nBased on a tool that has been used by artists for centuries, this app is a digital version of a Camera Lucida.\n\nYou suspend your iPhone or iPad above or in front of your canvas with a stand, tall glass, or other objects easily found around your house. \n\nWhen you look through your phone, you will see both the image and the canvas simultaneously. It's similar in functionality to an art projector or light box, but with the ability to do so much more.\n\nYou can draw on any surface, zoom in to draw micro details in your drawing, and you don't have to draw in the dark.\n\nWILL THIS HELP ME LEARN HOW TO DRAW?\n\nUsing Da Vinci Eye, you will be training your eye to recognize proportions and draw with shading while training your hand to translate precise lines and strokes on paper. You’ll learn faster and more efficiently using our proven techniques compared to any other app.\n\nAR MODE REQUIREMENTS\n\nTo use AR mode, you must have an A10x or A11 processor and above. We recommend using:\n\n– iPhone 8 and newer (iPhone 7 and below will not work)\n– iPad Mini 5th Generation and newer\n– iPad Air 2019 and newer\n– iPad Pro 3rd Gen (Any pro made after 2018) and newer\n\nAR & CLASSIC MODE\n\nAR mode anchors your image to an object in the real world. This lets you move your canvas or phone, and the drawing and projected image will stay aligned.\n\nClassic mode is like a normal art projector, where if you move your phone or canvas, the drawing will no longer be aligned.\n\nAR mode is especially useful for drawing or painting on an easel. However, in most cases, Classic mode will achieve the same result.\n\nTAKE YOUR DRAWING TO THE NEXT LEVEL\n\nDownload Da Vinci Eye today! No one ever regretted sharpening their drawing skills."

      "label": "Yes, this app will help you draw like a pro!\n\nWhether you're drawing on paper with a pencil, or cookies with royal icing, Camera Lucida will help you become a better artist.\n\nBe sure to read the reviews and the functionality you get with Camera Lucida!  There are lots of competitors and we know Camera Lucida costs a bit more, but no other app comes anywhere close to matching the functionality you get with 12 years of software development and refinement!\n\nUnlike hundreds of apps that enable you to create digital art, Camera Lucida instead enables you to create amazing physical art!  Our app works by having your iPhone or iPad's camera pointed at your drawing surface.  By watching your screen as you draw, you will be able to to see your reference image superimposed with your drawing - guiding your hand as little or as much as you want while you create your art.  Better than a projector and more versatile than a light table, Camera Lucida has been fine-tuned for over a decade to provide artists with the features they need to be accurate and creative.\n\nFor over a century, artists have made use of the camera lucida optical device to superimpose a live view of their subject onto their drawing or painting surface.  Allowing the artist to trace what they see in front of them, the camera lucida is an invaluable aid in creating a lifelike and realistic drawing.  Truly a camera lucida for the 21st century!\n\nWith our Camera Lucida iPhone/iPad application, artists and non-artists alike can now draw anything they have a photo of.  When looking at your screen, you'll be able to simultaneously see the image you want to draw as well as your drawing surface as you create your work of art.  Camera Lucida isn’t a projector, instead the app shows you a virtual image and you draw by watching your paper and hand on the screen as you draw!  It’s really clever and cool!\n\nWith over 12 years of continuous development, Camera Lucida's functionality eclipses the competition.  Check out these features:\n   -  Advanced image filters to help you see with an artist's eye.\n   -  Multi-device support to enable you to stream live video of your drawing to a second device.  *Requires iOS 10.3 or higher to receive hosted video.  Also, newer devices are recommended due to the processing requirements.*\n   -  Support for saving and restoring sessions, including automatically realigning your camera, sketch and reference image.\n   -  Full color palette control, including using your own paints, markers, etc.\n   -  Use any camera on your device and adjust for tilted and mirrored setups manually, or use an in-app purchase do do it automatically.\n   -  Secondary video feed support to enable you to draw from a live subject, not just a photograph.   *Requires iOS 10.3 or higher to receive hosted video.*\n   -  Time-lapsed recordings of you creating your drawing you can share on social media.  \n   -  Support for external bluetooth keyboards to aid in creating large art through mirroring your display.\n   -  Advanced tools such as vertical split screen sliders, timed image fading in and out, etc.\n   -  A projector mode that can be used when you’re using the app with a projector.\n   -  Video tutorials you can watch from within the app or from YouTube.\n   -  A full user manual available from within the app.\n   -  Continued support for iOS all the way back to 9.3 with only minor restrictions on functionality.\n   -  Customer support that you can count on and an active user community for inspiration.\n\nTo use our application, you just place your iPhone or iPad between your drawing surface and your eyes and trace what you see on the screen!\n\nIMPORTANT:  To use Camera Lucida, you need to fix your iPhone or iPad in place above your drawing.  We use a stack of books or a flower vase to do this.  Tutorials are included in the app to help you get started.  Also, some advanced functions such as receiving the multi-device video feed require iOS 10.3 or higher.\n\nContact: lucidaPete@gmail.com"

      "label": "Color Gear is a handy tool that helps to create harmonious color swatches. To find the right color combination, designers and artists use color theory and the basis of it: color wheels and harmonies. Or maybe you have just started to learn the basics of color science and you need a simple app to study the color harmony in practice.\n\nUse color wheel that suits your needs\nOur app supports two color models — Full Color Wheel (RGB model) and Basic Itten's Color Wheel. Color scheme by Itten is typically used by artists, and RGB is designed for online use. For both of them you can apply one of the 10 color combinations \\ harmonies.\n\nAbility to extract colors from your image\nSelect the desired picture from your phone and application's algorithms will extract colors. Then  you can choose favorite colors and save the palette.\n\nGet matching colors to your custom color\nJust type in your color code and discover color harmonies with this particular color.\n\nUse color editing tool\nIt is very important to balance the quantitative ratio of color in order to make your palette look harmonious in practice. The application has a convenient function to quickly swap colors in the images. There are 3 pictures and gradient in the palette editing carousel. You can see how the selected colors look in different ratios. \n\nEasy to manage and share\nAlso you will be able to save, export and remove palettes. To share the desired palette just choose mode — text HEX codes or image. You can always copy a particular color code under color swatch to the clipboard.\n\nDeveloping Color Gear we tried to make it professional and easy to use. Two color circles, 10 color harmonies, ability to input a color code manually, and convenient palette editing tool that are always at hand in one application."

Ever wanted to try painting your masterpiece but were put off by the mess and expense? Now you can!\r\n\r\nArtRage Vitae isn't just about color: It knows how much paint you've used so you can mix it and spread it on a textured canvas. It knows how wet your paint is so you can blend it with other paints. It even knows about the roughness of your paper so your pencils can be used for soft shading.\r\n\r\nIt's not just a special effect either - ArtRage Vitae is a live simulation of the properties of real artistic media that lets you get creative with colors and textures using tools you already know how to use!\r\n\r\nArtRage Vitae takes full advantage of the Apple Pencil support for pressure & tilt, and 3D touch on your iPhone when available.\r\n\r\nJoin the ArtRage community:\r\nForums: forums.artrage.com\r\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/artrage\r\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/artrage_paint/\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\nReal world painting tools: Oils, Watercolors, Paint Rollers, Pencils, Crayons and more. Each tool has a range of familiar properties such as how much thinner is applied to the paint, or how soft a pencil tip is. Tools apply texture as well as color, and blend under the brush.\r\n\r\nAdd Layers to your painting and work on individual elements without damaging others. ArtRage supports a wide range of layer effects, layer blend modes, and layer contents can be scaled moved and rotated independently.\r\n\r\nImport images, converting them to oil paint for mixing and blending or as Reference Images pinned to the canvas as a visual guide. Load photos as Tracing Images which are overlaid on the canvas, and have ArtRage select colors automatically as you paint.\r\n\r\nThe interface has been designed to maximize your creative space without hiding away critical functions such as tool and color selection. As you paint, it gets out of the way so that you don’t have to stop and manually adjust panels.\r\n\r\nRecord your paintings! The ArtRage Script system lets you record strokes while you paint for playback in desktop versions of the product at higher resolution.\r\n\r\nShare your paintings on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Creative Cloud, Dropbox, DeviantArt or any other sharing app on your device.\r\n\r\nTools:\r\n\r\n• Oil Brush, Watercolor, Airbrush, Palette Knife, Paint Roller, Paint Tube, Inking Pen, Pencil, Marker Pen, Chalk, Crayon, Glitter Tube, Gloop Pen, Eraser, Flood Fill, Cloner.\r\n\r\n• Paint simulation monitors the physical properties of your paints to allow natural blending, smearing, and other real world behavior.\r\n\r\n• Preset support to save your favorite settings for later use.\r\n\r\n• Supports the Apple Pencil's Pressure and Tilt properties, and 3D Touch where available to add realism to the simulated paint strokes.\r\n\r\nLayers:\r\n\r\n• Unlimited layers with Photoshop standard blend modes, visibility and opacity controls. Scale, rotate, and position layer contents independently.\r\n\r\nUtilities:\r\n\r\n• Record your paintings as Scripts then play them back in a desktop version of ArtRage.\r\n\r\n• Unlimited Undo / Redo. Load photos as References or Tracing images.\r\n\r\n\r\nFiles:\r\n\r\n• 4096 x 4096 Canvas now available on all devices.\r\n\r\n• Control the texture and color of the canvas to create different effects. Canvas presets can be stored for later.\r\n\r\n• Export PTG, JPG or PNG to services such as Email, Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox, and more. Share images on Facebook or Twitter. Import photos to a new file or a layer, with camera support.\r\n\r\nInterface:\r\n\r\n• Easy access pods provide functionality without getting in the way. Elements vanish as you paint so you can paint underneath. Multi-Touch shortcuts for canvas manipulation, Undo/Redo, and Brush Size.\r\n\r\nStylus & Input Support:\r\n\r\n• Apple Pencil Pressure & Tilt.\r\n• Supports 3D Touch.\r\n• Includes support for Wacom, Adonit and Pogo styluses."

Just attach your iPhone to the same rig you have your camera, run Camera Tracking Pro and that’s it.\n\nCamera Tracking Pro for iOS will use top notch Augmented Reality and Machine Learning techniques to identify elements on your real life scenes and use them to track the camera movement.\n\nSounds good?\n\nAlso, by using your hands and your imagination, you can also use Camera Tracking Pro for iOS to simulate events like  earthquakes, tsunamis, helicopters and planes taking off or landing, soldiers on the battlefield, race cars, boats and more. Imagine what would take to create keyframes manually to make the camera or other objects on your 3D application perform these events.\n\nThe impossible is now possible with Camera Tracking Pro for iOS.\n\nMore informations at:\nhttps://katkay.com"

      "label": "* A quick sketch of Galadriel (played by Cate Blanchett) from \"The Lord Of The Rings\" film series; done using Vermeer's Lens, a 2B pencil and blue ballpoint pen on an A4 printer paper. \n\n◉ Vermeer's Lens is no ordinary drawing app. It is a drawing app that helps you make real sketches on paper.\n\n◉ Vermeer's Lens is an augmented reality drawing app that works like an AR projector. It projects any photo you've selected from your photo library on any paper or sketch books you prefer drawing on. \n\n◉ Vermeer's Lens allows you to trace out the images you want to draw before shading. But it is more than a tracing tool, as it also allows you to capture areas of different tones and highlights - achieving a more lifelike picture. \n\n◉ Vermeer's Lens is a great tool for portrait drawing.\n\n◉ Vermeer's Lens can also be used in short drawing/sketching practices for beginners.\n\n◉ Vermeer's Lens enables even beginners to make stunning drawings. \n\n◉ Through its precise algorithms, what is traditionally difficult, such as portraits, can now be done without the need of construction lines.   \n\n◉ This app works on most phones without using Apple's ARKit which can only run on newer high performance chips. It's a simple effective tool for a simple hobby.\n\n*** See \"Developer's website\" below for a video demo\n\n*** A Youtube channel (see \"Developer's website\") is set up to provide you with examples of Vermeer's Lens in action. Content will be regularly uploaded so long as there are people interested in this app.\n\n*** This app works on most phones without using Apple's ARKit which can only run on newer high performance chips. It is simple, reliable and stable.\n________________________________________________________\nHow it works :\n\n> a photo is chosen from your photo library and  “projected” over the paper to draw on.\n\n> This projection is achieved by imaging the paper on the phone screen, and overlaying the translucent photo onto it.\n\n> With the phone held in a phone-holder, you can use its screen as a lens, through which you trace out the photo onto the paper.\n\n> Phone can be tilted and rotated to the angle most comfortable to you, while Vermeer’s Lens transforms the photo to match the perspective of the paper.\n\n> Not just the outlines, even the different subtle tones and contours of a face could be captured, to get that 3-D effect.\n\n> Opacity of the overlaying photo could be adjusted to allow close comparison between your drawing and the photo.\n\n> The overlaying photo responds to on-screen gesture: you could move, scale and rotate the photo during sketching.\n\n> A zoom option allows you to zoom in on your drawing for delicate pencil work.\n\nin addition :\n\n> A Vermeer’s Lens channel is also created on youtube to provide our users with additional \"instructions & tutorials\"on the use of this app to create art (videos updated regularly).\n\nThis is linked directly to the app via the  “Demo” button.\n\n> You can email us for support/feedback directly via the “Contact Us” button on the main menu of the app. Or leave a message (go to the “about” tab) on our youtube channel    (see “Developer’s website” below).\n\nFor more info and demo:\n\n> See “Developer’s website” below"

      "label": "\"The perfect -one of a kind- app organizer!\"\n\nMister Icon helps you keep a neat and tidy home screen by providing a range of decorative text labels and matching wallpapers.\n\nCreate beautiful, practical, aesthetic home screens.\n\nNo ads, in-app purchases or subscriptions!\nJust a simple, one-off payment.\n\n\n-- USER REVIEWS --\n\n\"This is THE app to easily and neatly organize your screen.\"\n\"I've been looking for something like this for years.\"\n\n\n-- THE BASICS --\n\nIf you have a lot of apps, it can often be difficult to find the one you are looking for, but Mister Icon's text-based label icons can help bring some order to your iPhone or iPad.\n\nMister Icon does not provide any means of making 'folders', and does not do all the hard work for you.\n\nMister Icon simply provides a range of pre-prepared text icon labels that you can add to your home screen and display next to your apps. It's then up to you to move the icons around until you're happy.\n\nFor example, install a 'Games' icon to your home screen, then move all your favorite games nearby so that it's easier to find them the next time you swipe past.\n\nThe icons are easy to install and there is no need to use the Shortcuts app, unless you want to make the icons perform special actions when you tap on them. The Tips & Tricks section in Mister Icon includes detailed instructions on both installation methods, so you can choose whichever suits your needs best.\n\n\n-- THE ICONS --\n\nThere are more than 150 icon labels to choose from, and each icon is available in 20 different styles, including several 'round' options.\n\nUse any of the 36 built-in color schemes, or create your own custom color schemes, then apply them to both icons and wallpapers.\n\nMister Icon allows you to easily label the different screens on your iOS device, so you can effectively create a 'kids' page, a 'work' page, a 'news' page, or simply number each of your home screens from 1 to 15.\n\nThe icons can be reorganized the same way as normal apps - simply tap and hold on any icon until it starts wobbling, then drag it into the desired location.  Be creative and use Mister Icon's icons in whatever way works best for you!\n\n\n-- THE WALLPAPERS --\n\nThe included wallpapers are simple in design, but highly functional, and can be easily matched to your icon colors.  Different wallpapers have been designed for each iOS/iPadOS device model, from the smallest iPhone SE right through to the largest iPad Pro.\n\nSome wallpapers allow for a 'seamless' effect when used with icons of the same color. Similarly, a circular label effect can be achieved through use of the app's 'round' icon sets and matching wallpaper backgrounds.\n\nSpecial 'hidden notch' and 'hidden island' wallpapers are available on relevant devices to allow you to blend in the 'notch' or 'island' at the top of your home screen, if you want to.\n\n\n-- THE DETAILS --\n\nPlease visit mistericon.com for more information, along with some sample icon arrangements that might provide useful inspiration for organizing your own home screens.  If you're unsure about what this app does, please be sure to take a thorough look through my website before purchasing.  If you're lazy or just don't care about neatness, then my app is probably not for you.\n\nIf you don't speak English then my app is probably not for you either, as the icon labels are in English only (aside from some Arabic numerals).\n\nMister Icon contains NO ads, NO in-app purchases and NO subscriptions.  Buy once and access all of the icons, plus the matching wallpapers, including any added to the app in the future.\n\nI hope you will find my app to be a useful and fun way to help tidy up your home screen.\n\n-- Mister Icon --"

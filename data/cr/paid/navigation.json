      "label": "Theodolite is a multi-function viewfinder that combines a compass, two-axis inclinometer, rangefinder, GPS, map, nav calculator, and geo-overlay photo/movie camera into one indispensable app. Theodolite was one of the very first augmented reality (AR) apps when it was released in 2009, and it’s been downloaded and used by millions of customers since then. Uses are endless, and the app is great for land measurements, outdoor sports, sightseeing, navigation, and finding your way around. Theodolite is a pro grade app and is used extensively by surveyors, geologists, architects, engineers, competitive sportsmen, first responders, military personnel, and search and rescue workers around the world. \n\nTheodolite lets you take data-overlay photos and movies with 2X-8X zoom. Overlay geographical data, angle markings, date/time, author/company info, and project notes directly on photos and movies for later reference. The same data is written into the metadata record of images, making image files self-contained data records. Third-party apps can tap into Theodolite's advanced camera functions with a camera sharing feature.\n\nView current position on the built-in map with optional offline Outdoors maps that include topo contours, roads, trails, landmarks, campgrounds, ski lifts, and more. Live map markers continually update distance/heading relative to the current location and also show wayfinding info in the main viewfinder. Draw polygons on the map to mark things like property boundaries and trails, and import/export polygon data via KML.\n\nShare map markers and nav calculator points with other users of Theodolite via text messages or e-mail. This powerful capability opens up a wide range of collaborative uses including team land surveying, accident investigations, spotting wild fires, triangulation of landmarks, and advanced tactical observation and targeting. With an optional in-app purchase to enable team tracking, you can share location with up to 20 people on Theodolite's map.\n\nTheodolite includes features for serious users like a reference angle mode, nav calculator, map marker import/export, manual and automatic data logging with CSV and KML export, clipboard integration, %grade display, mil compass readout, optical rangefinders (including a mil-based reticle, sniper-style stadiametric graphs, and a variable 4X-24X scope), and night filters to improve use in dark conditions.\n\nTheodolite can provide location in military grid reference system (MGRS) coordinates, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, British/Irish National Grids, US National Grid, Maidenhead locator system, Map Grid of Australia, and six latitude/longitude formats. Optional US State Plane coordinates include SPCS27 and SPCS83 zones covering all US States. The optional Datum Pack adds over 230 geodetic datums to the app to improve position computation from GPS data, covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.\n\nAR Layers include navigational aids like the sun, moon, planets, and Polaris (North star), and the optional US Mountain Summits layer that shows over 70,000 US mountain summits in the viewfinder.\n\nTheodolite has been shown in Apple Keynotes, featured on the App Store, and has been a #1 selling Navigation app in App Stores around the world. Since its introduction in 2009, Theodolite has defined augmented reality navigation. The app continually introduces new technologies, pushing the limits of iOS app development and taking advantage of new hardware capabilities.\n\nFind out why Apple named Theodolite one of the most amazing apps available and showed it being used to explore the Great Wall of China. Where will you take it on your next adventure?\n\nNote: Theodolite is an iPhone app -- see “Theodolite HD” for use on an iPad. And be sure to check out the all-new \"Theodolite for Watch\" and put Theodolite on your wrist!"

      "label": "Ship Finder shows live moving ships on a worldwide map. The intuitive design combined with incredible performance puts you in control. Watch in full screen, view in AR, search, add filters and so much more!\n\nShip Finder has been top rated and top ranking since 2009 and covers most of the world, tracking 20,000+ ships simultaneously.\n\nOur incredible app performance means that you can see all tracked vessels at once - no clustering here!\nSimply tap a ship to see its name, type, photos, speed, dimensions and much more.\nPowerful features such as filters, search and the ability to save favourite ships are included. (You can choose Apple or Google maps too!).\n\nAdd and browse bookmarks to saved locations around the globe to quickly navigate to areas or ports of interest.\n\nYou can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. \n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are.

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer, GPS tracker and trip cost monitor for iPhones and cellular iPads. \n∙∙ When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! \n∙∙ The cost monitor shows you the current cost of the journey as you drive and tells you each passengers share. \n∙∙ GPS tracker records your trips so they can be analyzed, viewed and shared at any moment.\n\n‣‣ COST MONITOR. What's the cost of my driving?\nBased on gas price for a gallon or litre, MPG (U.S. or UK) or liters per 100 km the app will tell you what the cost is as you drive. You can add an extra cost per kilometer or mile! Useful for all cost aware drivers and for splitting the cost between passengers.\n\n‣‣ GPS TRACKING. Where I've been? How long did it take to get from A to B? \nSpeedometer records your trip statistics even when GPS tracker is switched off. When you need point by point data to see on the map later or export (Google Earth and GPX), speedometer gives you the first class GPS tracker.\n\n‣‣ INFOTAINMENT. \nWhen switched on, infotainment shows trip stats or weather/wind forecast  when you wait. Way better than just showing you a 0 speed!\n\n‣‣ Easy to set speed limits and SPEED LIMIT MEMORY option\nSet speed limits with 4 or 8 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! With SPEED LIMIT MEMORY you just apply the speed limit once and the app applies it for you automatically the next time!\n\n‣‣ MODES\nUse MENU>MODES to turn the app into a Rally computer, G-Force monitor, Camera alerter or taximeter! Currently there are 12 modes available and we are constantly adding new ones.\n\n‣‣ WAYPOINTS.\nSpeedometer gives you the unique way to leave a note with location and even optional photo or audio note attached! As easy as double tap on the big speed digits! You'll find more in a documentation section (star button).\n\n‣‣ RED LIGHT & SPEED CAMERAS\nImport camera data into speedometer in Garmin or iGO csv formats from poi-factory.com, scdb.info or poi-plaza and let speedo alert you on a camera approach and set speed limit automatically before you pass the speed camera!\n\n‣‣ SUNSET/SUNRISE\nWith the sunset and sunrise information that our speedometer provides, you'll be able to avoid driving in the dusk.\n\n‣‣ BARO VSI. Barometric Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI, IVSI) in both scale and graph forms.\n\n‣‣ VOICE COACH. When enabled and configured, voice coach will be telling you active track distance and duration as well as current speed and altitude.\n\n‣‣ MAPS. Google's native, Apple map, Blank map and Offline maps.\n\n‣‣ Siri shortcuts: New Track, Stop Track, Speed limits.\n\n+ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and cellular iPads. All in retina graphics.\n\n+ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KM/H AND KNOTS. Maximum/TOP, average speed, distance traveled.\n\n+ BACKGROUND MODE! Speedometer will work in background if told so and will still warn you with audio alert when exceed a preset speed limit. You can use other apps while speedometer does its job in the background!\n\n+ PRIVACY. Speedometer never shares your location data with 3rd parties or ad agencies. Location data is used solely for tracking your speed and recording the GPS tracks and never leave the app unless you decide to share by means of a track export. It always let you know when background mode is on and never runs in background unless it is explicitly told to do so.\n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone as well as on any cellular iPad. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS (external GPS module is required). \n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nDrive safely, keep the log and notes and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal companion no matter what journey you are going on!"

      "label": "“Awesome!!! The best speed app on iphone” 5 Stars by kurtonic\n\nSpeed Box is a Speedometer and GPS app for both your iPhone and iPad. It displays your current speed, distance, direction and altitude along with your top speed and average speed. The app also keeps a record of the speed and altitude for the last few hours.\n\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n========================\n\n* MPH, KM/H and KNOTS\n* Show decimal speed (e.g. \"45.7 mph\")\n* One app for both the iPhone and iPad\n* \"Speak speed\" - Tap screen to have the speed spoken to you\n* 11 Analog and digital speedometers\n* Map view\n* Maximum and average speed\n* Altitude \n* Digital compass \n* HUD display to see speed in windshield \n* Odometer to measure distance traveled \n* Chart of the traveled speed and altitude \n* Warning signal when driving too fast \n* Export last 3 hours of data \n* Change maximum displayed speed on speedometer \n* Swipe finger over chart to display historic data \n* Display GPS accuracy by tapping the indicator in the top left corner \n\n\nUSER REVIEWS\n========================\n\n5 Stars by Darekakuta \n\"Just what I needed. My '58 chev's speedo doesn't work. This did the trick.\" \n\n5 Stars by Rawd \n\"Great My 79 Firebird speedo only goes to 140 kmh. ;). This worked perfectly.\" \n\n5 Stars \n\"Within 1 mile per hour +/- Great Job!\" \n\nSpeedBox was one of the very early Speedometer Apps for the iPhone. Take advantage of my experience and the refined algorithms that can get a much greater accuracy from the iPhone then a lot of other apps. I regularly update my application to make it even more accurate and usable. \n\nUsers have already used our application to verify the accuracy of their car's speedometer or they tried measuring the speed they achieved while skiing. Can you come up with more ideas? How about measuring the speed of the airplane you travel with? \n\nUSAGE NOTES\n========================\nThe \"GPS strength\" indicator in the top left corner should display a green dot. You can tap this indicator to display the current GPS accuracy.\n\nPlease allow the application up to a minute to find enough satellites to work correctly. \n\nIf you get a message to enable GSP, please go to ”Settings > General > Location Services“ on your iPhone and check if the little switch is set to \"On\" for Speed Box as well as for \"Location Services\" in general. \n\nATTENTION iPod touch users! Unfortunately this app doesn't work very well on the iPod touch and the iPad WiFI (without 3G) since these devices are missing a GPS!\n\n\nFEEDBACK\n========================\nIf you've got any wishes or suggestions for new features, please let me know with the contact form on this application's website (see link below).\n\nI am already working on the next update!"

      "label": "This app puts the Mayan Dreamspell Calendar in your pocket! \"13:20:Sync makes it so much easier to understand and integrate the calendar into every day life. Highly recommend it.\" \n\nThe Mayan People have described, in breathtaking precision, the cycles of both the universe and nature around us. They created a harmonic calendar that is synchronized to all those cycles. Following these cycles can help you get a stronger connection with nature around you and become conscious of your essence.\n\nThis app provides a simple way to sync along those cycles, to raise our frequency and give us a new lens to view both our day-to-day and planetary events.\n\n- Did you ever realize that our (Gregorian) calendar is not a harmonic calendar? \n- Did you know that the moon has 13 (not 12!) orbits around the earth in 1 year? \n- Why do we live with this irregular calendar?\n- Are you interested in Astrology?\n\n-> All this, and more, is explained carefully in this app. (over 15.000 words on 37 pages) Please note that these text are in English language only.\n\nIn the New Time, synchronicity is the norm.\n\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n5 star rating across the world! \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\"Entertaining as well as enlightening\" \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\nMORE INFO: \nwww.1320sync.com \n\n\nFor the beginner this app is a learning tool because it contains an extensive explanation about Tones and Seals and the synchronizing order of the Mayan Astrology. You may think it's difficult at first but soon you will feel how it all connects. \n\n\"This app is great, and allows easy manipulation of dates. I spent years in books doing in hours what I can now do in seconds.\"\n\nFor the ones who are already familiar with the Mayan Calendar this app is a handy tool to navigate the cycles, and calculate the Combined Kin for any given combination. Furthermore this app can be of great assistance to teach other people about the 13:20 cycles and is used in teachings around the world.\n\n\n=== FEATURES ===\n\n+ Kin Calendar\nThis is your main Mayan Dreamspell Calendar Dashboard with all the details you need to stay in sync. Shows the Kin of today by default, and you can calculate the Kin for any other date.\n\n+ Personal Notes\nOn this new page you can keep your personal notes for the 2 main cycles of time: the Tzolkin cycle of 260 days and the 13 Moon cycle of 365 days. And with the powerful text search function you quickly find your notes.\n\n+ Kin Picker\nSelect any combination of the 13 Tones and 20 Seals. Top section can scroll to 4 pages with information.\n\n+ Combined Kin Calculator \nCalculate the Combined Kin of any combination of Kin. You can add as many Kin as you like to calculate the Combined Kin for a group of people. \n\n+ Tzolkin with indication of the GAP day's and Wavespell and more. Tap and hold to select a Kin number directly.\n\n+ Contact Import \nAll contacts in your Contacts App will be automatically imported and assigned to the correct Kin. See all your contacts with their Mayan Reading and how you relate to them. \n\n+ 13 Moon Calendar \nFull integration of 13 Moon Calendar. (doubles as a birthday calendar!) \n\n+ 13:20 Information \nLots of information about the theory behind synchronization to help you navigate the Mayan Dreamspell Calendar. The texts provide a clear explanation of the Cycles of Time. (More than 15.000 words on 37 pages) Please note that these text are in English language only.\n\n+ Sharing\nOn all the 3 main tabs you can share the current selected Galactic Signature using your favorite app. \n\n\n# Based on the work of José Argüelles.\n# This app was made with permission of and in cooperation with the Foundation for the Law of Time - www.lawoftime.org, \n# Ariel Spilsbury."

      "label": "TrafficCamNZ displays internet accessible pictures of Traffic Cameras all over the world. Use it for any image with a fixed URL (web address).\n\nImages you choose as \"Featured\" are downloaded and setup side by side so that you can swipe across the screen to view multiple images quickly.\nTrafficCamNZ works over the cellular network though it works best with WiFi because, usually, it's faster!\n\nTrafficCamNZ can also use the GPS features in your device to show cameras around you. Try the predictive mode that predicts where you are travelling to display the next cameras (with known GPS coordinates) on your journey.\n\nTrafficCamNZ now contains details of more than 7000 cameras from around the world. You choose which cameras are the \"featured\" ones. Featured cameras are easily identified in the Library; they have a Green dot next to them.\nManaging your own personal list of cameras is easy too. This can be done in two ways:\n1. Enter a new camera directly on the iPhone and key in the entire URL (http://mywebsite/image.jpg) or\n2. Create your own XML file for importing into the application. Instructions on how to do this are available at the support web site or by contacting the developer.\n\nUsage Notes:\n* Pictures are displayed in the order they are received unless you set the image sequence number, you can then order the images how you want them\n* Check your network usage when downloading over the cellular network\n* Images are not cached, if you receive an image that isn't right (i.e. daylight when you know it is night time, that camera may not be functioning)\n* Sometimes the traffic camera pictures are not up-to-date. You may see night pictures when it is supposed to be daylight or perhaps pictures don't change. TrafficCamNZ has no control over that\n* You receive updates to the camera list automatically; a check is performed every 7 days when the application starts\n* Tap the image on the main window to display it full screen\n\nFeatures:\n* Easily flick through the loaded images with your finger - this was the original idea behind the application\n* Load your own web images\n* Free version available, loads up to 3 images\n* Full version available, loads up to 19 images on iPhone and 32 images on iPad\n* Allows XML import of camera list\n* Camera list (XML Import file) can be updated from a web site - doesn't require the release of a new application\n* No advertising\n\nMany great comments from around the world have been made about TrafficCamNZ:\n* Great little app, what a time saver. I would often leave work to find the traffic all congested, now I can check before I leave and even if it gets busy I can check on the road and take a different route. I have set my own cameras and can quickly check what's what. A real must for driving commuters, couriers or even taxi's. \n* This app works very well and is awesome if you travel a lot. Going on a road trip for work or vacation?  Google the cameras for your cities, insert the URL into the app, and cameras appear \n* I set it up for all the traffic cameras from Douglas County down through El Paso County (Colorado) and it works great!  So well in fact, that I sprung for the paid version\n* Make sure you enter in the URL's correctly - that's where some people mess up.  What you see is basically what the traffic/weather cam sees wherever they are. They have to be viewable on the Internet first. Awesome app!\n* App is very easy to use and I use it for going to work every day\n* I put 2 of the most important traffic cams on the way to work and it works perfect"

      "label": "There are hundreds of gps apps. Do we really need one more?\n\nAriadne GPS is more than a simple gps app.\n\nBesides offering you the possibility to know your position and to get information about the street, the number, etc. it also lets you explore the map of what's around you.\n\nWhat do we mean by saying \"explore\"? You'll deal with a talking map. If you have VoiceOver activated on your device, you will be able to know the street names and numbers that are around you by touching them.\nJust put your finger on the screen of your device, when showing the map and moving it you will be told the info's about the street you're touching.\nYour position is on the center of the screen. What's in front of you is on the top half of the screen and things behind you are on the bottom half of the screen.\n\nYou can also explore a different region than the one around you by telling the app the street and the city.\n\nYou can ask for information about your position at any time, also activating a function, called monitor, that will give you this info periodically (Please read the note below).\nThis app has also got some other useful features that might help when walking or traveling by bus, train etc.\nIf you add your favourite points to the app database, you can be alerted when you get closer than a certain distance to one of them.\n\nThis app is completely accessible using VoiceOver and gives you access to information that are normally unavailable to people using the speech synthesizer and can be therefore especially useful to blind and partially sighted people. \n\nNote: The features of Ariadne GPS are based on the location services and on the Maps server for what concerns the information about the position. This information may not be accurate, due to the location accuracy, which is generally below fifteen metres but in some cases can be few tens of metres and to the Maps service, which might be unresponsive at certain times (Ariadne GPS will tell you if this is the case). The aim of Ariadne GPS is to give you an idea of your position and what is around you. Please do not completely rely on it.\n\nPlease note that the use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nFor more info and suggestions please visit http://www.ariadnegps.eu"

      "label": "Pro Compass replicates the look and feel of classic pocket compass hardware in use since the 1800s, adding modern features and technologies.  The app uses advanced OpenGL graphics (normally reserved for games) to render 3D floating compass hardware for realistic operation.\n\nPro Compass offers nine different compass modes with direct read, traditional, and rosette styles capable of displaying degrees, quads, or mils (the direct read mode shows a North-South needle and reversed East-West convention).  In all display modes, Pro Compass shows both magnetic and true direction simultaneously, with a rotating outer true ring that is automatically adjusted for local magnetic declination.  Sun and Moon position are marked on the compass rings and continually updated.\n\nPro Compass displays location and altitude, with decimal, degree-minute-second, UTM, and MGRS position formats.  An optional \"Datum Pack\" adds over 230 geodetic datums covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.  The app also contains a built in two-axis inclinometer that drives two independent bubble levels and a bullseye level.  The inclinometer has angle readout dials for each axis, making it useful for many different types of measurements including slopes, pitches, sight lines, and geological angles like dip and strike. \n\nAfter using Pro Compass, you'll see why it's the best and most realistic compass available on the App Store!  Also be sure to check out the new Pro Compass for Watch, available for all Apple Watch models running watchOS 6 or later.\n\n***** IMPORTANT ACCURACY NOTE *****\n\nPro Compass reports accuracy directly from the magnetometer sensor in your device.  This accuracy is determined by the hardware, not the application itself.\n\nTo improve results, operate Pro Compass away from any electronics or other sources of electro-magnetic interference, including car dashboards, aircraft cockpits, metal structures, and other devices.  \n\nPlease contact the developer via the support link if you need additional information about accuracy or operation of Pro Compass."

      "label": "Save time and money on your instrument flight training by mastering IFR holding pattern entries at the comfort of your own mobile device.\n\nMake IFR flight training easier!\n\nIs the following scenario familiar? You receive a holding clearance from ATC, and only have a couple of minutes, sometimes only a few seconds, to choose the correct entry. By the time you've figured out what's going on, you've already passed the holding fix and don't know what to do next.\n\nIf this sounds familiar, then you need not to worry. Confusion during holding entries happens to practically almost every new instrument student. Even instrument-rated pilots occasionally have the same problem — when they don't get enough practice.\n\nHolding Trainer solves this problem and as a result, cuts the time you have to spend on expensive flight and ground lessons. With Holding Trainer, you can practice on your own time and convenience, so that choosing the best holding entry in the air becomes a breeze. \n\n\nFeatures: \n\n-Entry Trainer - Drills you on choosing the best holding entry. Practice until choosing holding entries becomes second nature and impress your flight instructor with your skills.\n\n-Holding calculator. Solve and visualize any holding scenario by entering your current bearing to the fix and a outbound or inbound holding radial. \n\n-Holding tutorial - learn how to choose the best holding entry quickly and easily.\n\nHolding Trainer for iOS is a complete rewrite based on my popular Flash-based desktop Holding Trainer app available on pilotscafe.com.\n\n***Don't get \"stuck\" next time you receive a holding pattern clearance!***\n----------------------------------\nFor only a fraction of the cost of one ground lesson with your flight instructor, you can practice this important instrument skill at your own pace and save hundreds of Dollars on figuring out holding entries in the air.\n\nThis is a great tool for anyone training towards their instrument checkride, CFII, proficiency check, or simply trying to improve their holding patterns.\n----------------------------------"

For example, an E6B can be used to calculate heading and groundspeed after taking into account forecast winds. An E6B is also used to calculate data used for performance planning such as density altitude.  Our version goes beyond the analog E6B and even beyond all other E6B apps by including functionality to calculate time, rate and radius of turns, pivotal altitude (great for flight training use), and more."

Supports Latest iOS version\n\nThis application is modeled after the instrument found in many general aviation aircraft.   It looks just like the real thing because photos of the real thing were used to create the graphics.  \n\nPitch and roll angles are represented both with the analog instrument as well a digital display.   The instrument can be zeroed and the pitch reference \"wings\" can be adjusted, just like the real instrument.\n\nOf course, the iPhone doesn't have the same type of Gyro as an aircraft, so the instrument function is simulated using the iPhones built in accelerometer, \n\nThis program has been tested on an iPhone 3g, 3Gs, 4 and iPod touch running firmware version 4.0 on up"

      "label": "BlindSquare is pioneering accessible navigation both indoors and outdoors. Know where you are, know where you're going, travel with confidence.\n\nBlindSquare is a new solution that combines the latest technology to help the blind with their daily lives. It has been developed in collaboration with blind people and carefully field tested. You need either an iPhone or an iPad to get started. It also supports some additional accessories to enhance the experience. \n\nHow does it work? \n\nBlindSquare uses GPS and the compass to locate you. It then gathers information about the surrounding environment from FourSquare. BlindSquare has some unique algorithms to decide what information is the most relevant and then speaks it to you with high quality speech synthesis. \n“What's the most popular café within 200 meters radius? Where is the post office or the library?” \n\nYou can control BlindSquare also through voice commands. The Voice Command feature is a premium service requiring purchase of credits for continuous use.  Voice Command Credits are available as an in-app purchase on the App Store.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a GPS solution:\n\nWhen you start the app, it will start telling you the interesting places and street crossings around you. By changing the radius, you can limit the area you are interested in. You can also search by search term or by category. You can select an interesting place from the search results and perform the following tasks:\n\n1) Get contact info (address, phone number) \n2) Open twitter feed or restaurant menu (if provided)\n3) Make a phone call\n4) Start tracking the place (BlindSquare will assist you by repeating the distance and the clock face direction)\n5) Start your favourite navigator for turn-by-turn instructions (TomTom, Navigon or Apple Maps)\n\nBlindSquare is aware of when you travel by car, bus or train and starts to report interesting places in front of you (for example, the next stops) and street crossings when you are passing them.\n\nYou can also save your own private places to iCloud so they will be found with your every device.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a Foursquare client:\n\nIf you like to play Foursquare, you can do the following with BlindSquare:\n \n1) Get a list of nearby FourSquare venues\n2) When you are in a place, you can check in by shaking your device\n3) Do a check in with commenting and twitter/facebook sharing\n4) Correct the location of the place\n\nBlindSquare supports the following languages: English, Arabic, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean (South Korea), Norwegian, Polish, Portugues, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\nVoiceOver usage is supported but it also includes higher quality additional speech synthesis by Acapela Text-To-Speech from Acapela Group.\n \nInstructions in English: https://www.blindsquare.com/user-guide/ and https://www.blindsquare.com/faq/\n\nPlease note: This app retrieves data in real time from Foursquare and Open Street Map. Use of a flat rate data plan is highly recommended.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nHaving only been released in May 2012, BlindSquare has already received several prizes and awards:\n\n - GSMA: Global Mobile Awards 2013, Best Mobile Health Product or Service\n - Apps4Finland 2012\n - OpenCities App Challenge 2012\n - The Finnish Information Processing Association: Best Product 2012\n\nPlease note: To use BlindSquare, your iCloud account has to be active so BlindSquare can access it to save your settings and places.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "The first and only Vector Magnetometer on the iPhone - Visualize the hidden world of magnetism around you in 3 dimensions (3GS or later!)! It can be perfectly used to explore and measure the direction and strength of the magnetic field of random objects around you (which can be quite fascinating!). With limitations (see docs) it can be used as a metal detector to find electric lines or pipes in walls (always good to check a wall before drilling in, at least better with this than not to check at all). Another application is to use this tool as a rough estimate of your north-south position on earth without using the GPS(!) - just by measuring the local earth magnetic declination (it works fine even while flying in a plane to check how the declination changes). Or simply explore your next Christmas present before opening it! Send us your results!\n\n\nThe application has four different displays modes to visualize the magnetic field:\n\n- Absolute Mode: Displays the absolute magnetic field in microtesla (μT) measured by the magnetometer.\n\n- North Mode: A compass head-up displays the geographic north along with the pointer that directs to the magnetic north (thus display difference magnetic to geographic north).\n\n- Declination Mode: Two arrows will be displayed to indicate the declination of the earth magnetic field (0° just on equator, increasing to north with blue pointer direction up or south with blue pointer direction down). \n\n- Relative Mode: This mode shows the relative strength (absolute minus compensation vector) of the magnetic field in μT. \n\n\n… and five different display modes for acceleration visualization: \n\n- Absolute Mode: Displays the reverse acceleration of the iPhone (1g up when hold steady). \n\n- X-Rotation - Y-Rotation - Z-Rotation: The arrow will display the rotation around the X-, Y- and Z-Axis of the iPhone. The digital indicator shows the angle numerically (-180° - +180°). A way to calibrate will be added with one of the next updates, so you could use this as a level.\n\n- Relative Mode: This mode shows the relative strength (absolute minus compensation vector) of the acceleration.\n\n\nFor a detailed documentation, please visit our product homepage. \n\n\nFor recreational use only. However it CAN (!) be very accurate. The measurement is performed as good as possible (we try our best) by using the inbuilt accelerometer and magnetometer to their limits. The range of the accelerometer typically has a max of ±3g (~4.2g displayed here if combined) and each magnetometer usually recalibrates internally when over ±120μT in one axis. However, tell us your experience!"

AyeTides displays tides and/or currents for over 12,500 locations worldwide and unlike many other tide apps, it does not require a network connection. With AyeTides you will never see those annoying ads or be asked to pay for additional features! Sailors, harbor pilots, beachcombers, nature photographers, and more use AyeTides to plan their outings on or around the world's oceans. \n\nHere are some of the things people are saying about AyeTides... \n\n\"AyeTides is a quality professional product”\n\n\"Your support has been the best I have experienced!\"\n\n“As a harbor pilot in New York I’ve been using your excellent tide and current app”\n\n\"I really appreciate the effort that you put into making AyeTides as accurate as it can be. It is a great program that has been very useful to us. I think we have 60 pilots using iPhones and iNavX and your app links in so well.\"\n\n\"I am a ships Pilot in BC and use Aye Tides a lot and it has become invaluable.”\n\nYou can see the day’s events in tabular form, or you can rotate the phone for an interactive graph that shows you the tide’s value at any point during the day. You can find a station on a map, by name, or based on your current location.\n\nAyeTides is updated regularly and stations are added whenever we find new data. We encourage our customers to contact us if you hare having any issues with the program so that we can help you. \n\nThis app is designed to run on your iPhone or iPod Touch. While it will run on your iPad, it does not offer the additional features available with AyeTides XL, which was designed specifically for the iPad. If you have multiple devices, you may want to consider our bundle. You get both apps at a discount!\n\nThis is the only place to install AyeTides. Other websites may look like they have AyeTides, but they do not. We only support iOS, any other version of AyeTides is not ours."

However, we will release database updates right after the new information will become available. \n\n- You can create and save the driving routes to follow them later. Application will display your current position on the route and display the route on the map.  Every route is saved in the application database, so you don't need to re-create it every time application starts up.\n\n - Tapping the \"HUD\" icon mirrors all the text, so if you position the iPhone horizontally under your car's windscreen you can see perfectly readable half-transparent reflection of the picture displayed.  Note: this mode works pretty well at night time and twilight, but on direct sunlight the screen brightness can be insufficient. \n\n- aSmartHUD can keep track on 4 speed limits, giving a warning each time you crossing it. Normally, it's legal speed limits within cities, local roads and high-speed motorways. \"Never exceed speed\" is the speed you should not exceed under any conditions. Like technical limit of your vehicle or the point where government can arrest your driving license. \n\n- 3D Trip Log Graph - unique way to represent the speed, location and altitude data in a single 3D graph. Color coded speed and altitude chart is constantly adjusted according to your moving trajectory.  In Track Preferences, you can set the transparency of all the components of the chart or switch them off completely.\n\n- Apple and OpenStreet maps in several flavors and color modes.\n- Landscape and portrait screen modes.\n- \"Records\" screen, with maximum reached speed, altitude and distance from start.\n- Different measurement units, display color schemes (6 available), log type, sounds and more.  \n- Select the music iPod Playlist, pause, play, skip or rewind it's items, set the player in Shuffle or Repeat mode. \n- Advanced location Info (longitude and latitude, GPS measurement precision) and more. \n- Local weather forecast;\n\nIMPORTANT: this features list in not complete.

      "label": "BACKGROUND:\n\nBuilt from the ground up in the rugged mountains of eastern Afghanistan, Tactical NAV comes from the mind of a U.S. Army Field Artillery officer who had a vision of creating a low-cost and highly accurate tactical navigation platform built specifically for military service members.\n\nTactical NAV's journey began in the notorious Pech River Valley of Kunar Province, Afghanistan. \n\nU.S. Army Capt. Jonathan J. Springer, a Fire Support Officer with the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), began developing the tactical navigation platform following the memorial services for Spc. Blair D. Thompson and Spc. Jared C. Plunk, who were killed in action on June 25, 2010.\n\nAfter pitching the idea and being turned away by the Department of Defense on multiple occasions, Captain Springer remained resolute in his mission to continue developing Tactical NAV — even to this day. His ultimate goals were (and still are) to make a difference for other Soldiers and honor the men and women who were killed and wounded in battle.\n\nHe ended up using his life savings to continue moving forward with the Tactical NAV project, all with the ultimate hope of saving military lives and helping his fellow service members accomplish their mission at home and abroad.\n\nTactical NAV officially launched on the App Store on February 14, 2011.\n\nMISSION:\n\nTactical NAV's mission is to provide military service members with a low-cost, highly accurate, and exceedingly powerful mobile tactical navigational solution.\n\nVISION:\n\nOur vision is to assist and support our nation's service members with their mobile navigational needs and further enable them to operate and win during Multi-Domain Operations (MDO).\n\nBUILT FOR ACCURACY:\n\nTactical NAV's performance is on par with the AN/PSN-13 Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR), and it has the feedback to prove it.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n\nPurpose-built by Soldiers and created to save military lives, Tactical NAV was the very first MGRS-focused app on the App Store. It has proven to be effective across a multitude of environments all throughout the world.\n\nTactical NAV has been successfully evaluated against other software platforms and devices such as Nett Warrior, JCR, BFT, JBC-P, and ATAK. Its accuracy is within 1-to-3 meters of these officially approved systems issued by the Department of Defense.\n\nIAPs & SUBSCRIPTIONS: \n\nTactical NAV contains in-app purchases (IAPs) and subscriptions. Currently, tactical drawing mode is available as an in-app purchase, and offline mapping is also available to users as either a monthly or yearly subscription. All revenue generated from these features goes towards further developmental coding and updates, and a portion of all proceeds are donated to charities that specifically benefit disabled veterans.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n• A military-quality precision targeting platform\n• Purpose-built for the individual Soldier\n• Offline mapping capabilities (complete usage of the TACNAV platform with no emission of a cellular signal)\n• WGS 84 standard (MGRS, UTM, BNG, and USNG coordinates)\n• Tactical drawing mode (e.g., useful for Joint Fires planning, creating overlays, route planning, and so forth)\n• Waypoint plotting functionality with military graphics (per FM 1-02.2)\n• Compass \"FastLock\" function for capturing quick azimuths\n• Snap and save photographs onto the main map for intelligence purposes and AARs\n• Location, waypoint, and photo-sharing capabilities (via email and text)\n• One-button night mode function for low-light situations \n• \"Go to Grid\" option for intelligent pinpoint planning and drawing of overlays\n• Created and tested to ensure utmost accuracy and reliability \n• iOS native code built for austere and contested environments\n• And so much more!!!\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n \nThe Department of Defense does not endorse Tactical NAV, nor should it be used in life-threatening or combat situations in place of a government-issued device."

We love this mode! We found it much more convenient compared to traditional car dashboards (especially on the roads of Western Europe, which are full of speed cameras and where you need to watch your speedometer all the time). And last but not the least - it just looks cool.  Note: this mode works pretty well at night time and twilight, but on direct sunlight the screen brightness can be insufficient.\n\n- \"aSmart HUD\" can keep track on 4 speed limits, giving a warning (sound and visual) each time you crossing it. Normally, it's legal speed limits within cities, local roads and high-speed motorways. \"Never exceed speed\" is the speed you should not exceed under any conditions. For example, it can be a technical limit of your vehicle or the point where government can arrest your driving license. \n\n- You can skip/rewind/play/pause your current iPod music track, select the playlist or set the Shuffle or Repeat iPod mode.\n\n- Weather forecast time intervals and temperature units (C, F) are selectable in Preferences.\n\n- You can quickly take a photo of what's going on the road. Photo will be automatically saved into the Photos Album. The speedometer image, map and a some of other useful information will be placed over your photo. \n\n- Landscape and Portrait screen layouts support.\n\n- Three different compass styles, sound themes, colors, etc.\n\n- 4 functionally different display themes.\n\n- Speed history log chart. \n\n- \"Location Info\"  - longitude and latitude, GPS measurement precision and some more data.\n\n- \"Records\" screen (left upper button on the \"Location Info\" screen), where you can see your maximum reached speed (during the current trip or all of your trips), maximum altitude and maximum distance from start.\n\n- Tap the speed indicator to switch into speed fullscreen mode. \n \nIMPORTANT: for more screenshots and details visit the http://atoll-ordenadores.com website\n\nLimitations \n- The precision is affected by the satellite signal quality. If unsure, use the program only for reference, don't rely on it for 100%. Application requires real A-GPS chip - so, no iPod and not-3G iPad supported. On iPad 3G application function only in \"double pixel\" mode.\n\nThanks to everyone for your suggestions about additional functionality! THE BEST AND FASTEST WAY TO CONTACT US IS SENDING YOUR REQUESTS AND BUG REPORTS to support@atoll-ordenadores.com.

If you purchased a compatible vehicle before this functionality is available, your vehicle will require a no-charge MyLink radio software update at your Chevrolet dealer to support in-vehicle use of the BringGo app. For more details about this exciting vehicle app integration or launch timing, please contact your dealer or call 1-855-4- Support. \n______________\nPREMIUM NAVIGATION FEATURES \n• Turn-by-turn voice directions \n• Find Places: millions of onboard POIs\n• Stunning 3D landmarks \n• Lane Guidance to show you the correct lane to be in \n• Realistic Signpost Display \n• Map data from NAVTEQ onboard\n• Text-To-Speech voice guidance  (speaks street names)\n• Auto re-routing \n• Multiple routing options; faster time, shorter distance, ECO\n• Search by Address, Point on Map, ZIP and more \n• POI Search\n• Save and edit favorites \n• Recent destinations \n• Auto zooming (at intersection & on speed) \n• Route Planning\n• Route summary for trip information \n• Speed Limit warning \n• Current Location information\n\n______________\nMAP COVERAGE\nUnited States, Canada, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii. \n______________\nIN-APP PURCHASES\n1.

      "label": "Boat Beacon is an internet AIS receiver and transmitter for your iPhone and iPad. It is the only AIS ship tracking app to provide Collision Warnings, share your boat’s position & use real-time AIS data.\n\nConnected to the largest network of AIS shore receivers world-wide covering most major ports, harbours and popular coastal areas.\n\n“An outstanding app, with great potential. Both interesting to use and very user friendly. This could be a life saver and especially of interest to small boat users. Everyone who goes on the water should have this on and use it!”  ***** Sun Dream, App Store Review\n\nBoat Beacon is specifically designed for boaters & provides continuous Bearing, Range & Closest Point of Approach (CPA) calculations and alarms in addition to standard AIS information even when in the background.\n\nBoat Beacon does not require any external AIS transponder or receiver equipment.\n\nKey Features\n------------\nOver-the-horizon collision avoidance (30 miles radius) using continuous CPA calculations - highlights boats that are on a potential collision course and alerts you with an alarm.\n\nContinually transmits and receives position information via the internet and calculates and alarms CPA even when the app is in the background.\n\nShares your position with Internet AIS Systems and apps and other Boat Beacon users in real time.\n\nReal time ship map view with North up and Heading up modes so you can look in the direction of the ships on the map to locate them.\n\nNav display showing own boat's speed, course, heading and position.\n\nMan Overboard tracking, SART Alarm, Anchor watch and Theft alarms.\n\nApple Watch App included\n\nExport tracks\n\nBoat-to-Boat & Boat-to-Group Messaging. \n\nLocal AIS and GPS via Wifi.\n\nBoat Beacon InApp Add-ons:-\n\nLiveView - Augmented Reality Camera view with ships, compass & horizon overlaid. Works with FLIROne Infra-red cameras as well to see ships & people in the dark & through fog (IAP)\n\n\"AIS Sharing\" to other apps like Navionics & iNavX (IAP subscription)\n\nUS, UK and IE Marine raster charts  (IAP).\n\nLet Friends and Family see where you are and where you're headed to with our free Boat Watch app or on web-based AIS systems like MarineTraffic which have free web viewers available.\n\nArm all the crews in a race with Boat Beacon and have real time updates on the race positions on the water and back in the club house.\n\nKeep a watch and in touch with other boats in your flotilla when sailing in a group.\n\nBoat Beacon requires internet access to work. Most popular coastal areas have cellular data access extending 12 or more miles out to sea. \n\nSubscriptions\nThe \"AIS Sharing \" subscription is monthly ($5.99) or yearly ($16.49), and will automatically renew at the end of the subscription period unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase, and will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be managed by the iTunes account holder and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase.  No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.\n\nTerms of Use: http://seanav.net/termsofuse.php\n\nPrivacy Policy: http://seanav.net/privacy.php\n\nSupport: help@pocketmariner.com\n\nYour position can be shared and seen on all our apps without using an MMSI number. To be seen on Global AIS systems like MarineTraffic you will need an MMSI number. In the US you can obtain one  by visiting http://www.boatus.com/mmsi or email us for a free internet MMSI number.\n\nPlease note that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nNOT FOR NAVIGATION\nBoat Beacon should only be used for basic navigation reference and should not be solely relied upon to determine precise locations, proximity, distance, or direction. You will not be visible to other ships on VHF only AIS systems."

      "label": "Keyhole markup language (KML) is a standard format used by many other mapping and navigation tools to represent geographical information. KML Map lets you create, display, and store KML map data and attached media content (often called metadata) on the iPhone/iPod Touch. Use KML Map to view photographs on maps from the location and direction they were taken, to create your own custom maps containing point, line, and polygonal data, to display topographic maps and ground overlays on top of map layers, to visualize scientific data and metadata for a variety of applications, and much more.\n\nHere are some of the features of KML Map:\n\n•Display KML point, line, and polygonal features, ground and photo overlays.\n•Standard north up or rotating map that points in your look direction.\n•Display KML content from Safari or embedded in email. Just click and see the data in KML Map.\n•Add new map features. \n•Assign address information to new objects using reverse geocoding. \n•Elevation data is downloaded from global terrain data server (not GPS) for consistency.\n•Display ground overlays (e.g., your own maps and images) over base maps/images \n•Photo overlays are rendered on a map from the location and direction they were taken.\n•Supports multiple, variable-transparency map layers\n•Read compressed KMZ files\n•Transfer files between KML Map and your computer using iTunes File Sharing\n•Download KML and KMZ content from network URLs\n•Supports standard and custom pushpins/placemark icons\n•Shows/hides names on map\n•Quickly find an object of interest in the current map layer by name\n•Display full HTML content contained in CDATA tag (text, pictures, sound files, or movies)\n\nImportant Notice\n\nKML Map understands a subset of the KML language, specifically points, line strings, and polygons (without holes). It can display ground overlays (LatLonBox format only) and photo overlays. HTML contained within CDATA tags (including pictures, sound files, and video) are rendered in a web view window. Files containing unsupported tags will not load. File sizes should be limited to 5-7 Mbytes. If the file is too large KML Map will quit. The size of files that can be emailed is limited by the operating system. KML Map also reads compressed KML or KMZ files. However, depending on the internal structure and contents of the file, KML Map may only be able to display one KMZ file at a time.\n\nN.B.

      "label": "Pro Altimeter uses the high-fidelity barometric pressure sensor in iOS devices to measure and compute altitude.\n\nPro Altimeter has a dead simple interface.  Barometric altitude and GPS altitude are displayed in large easy to read numbers, showing units of both feet and meters, and giving realtime accuracy estimates from the hardware.  At bottom are calibration and display mode buttons. The display offers a highly-readable daytime mode with black digits on an LCD-green background, and a reversed night mode that is easy on the eyes in dark conditions. That's it!\n\nProper calibration is necessary to measure altitude from barometric pressure (this is why a pilot \"dials in\" the cockpit altimeter before taking off). Pro Altimeter offers four different methods for calibration -- choose the easiest and most convenient:\n\n1. Use GPS altitude.  This method correlates the measured local barometric pressure with the altitude measured by GPS. This method can be used when your device has a clear line of sight to the sky and a reliable GPS fix with good accuracy.\n\n2. Manually enter altitude.  This method correlates the measured local barometric pressure with known altitude from landmarks, elevation benchmarks, trail markers, topo maps, land surveys, etc.  Altitude can be entered in feet or meters.\n\n3. Manually enter pressure.  If you have a weather station, weather report, or METAR report with equivalent sea level pressure for a nearby location, this can be used to correlate local barometric pressure to altitude.  Pressure can be entered with units of inches Hg, kPa, or mb. \n\n4. Check local airports.  With the tap of a button, Pro Altimeter will locate the five closest airports within 100 miles (160km) of your present location anywhere in the world, and pull in METAR data.  From that list of five, pick the airport of your choice and Pro Altimeter will import pressure data for calibration.\n\nOnce calibrated, Pro Altimeter keeps track of the time since its last calibration.  Because weather and local barometric pressure change over time, the app will warn you when 6 hours have elapsed since the last calibration by flashing the \"CALIBRATE\" button.  You should calibrate as frequently as practical -- for example, on a hike, calibrate whenever you pass a trail marker or elevation benchmark.  But at a minimum, calibrate at least every 6 hours or whenever weather changes in your area.\n\nPro Altimeter is intended for iOS devices with a built-in barometric pressure sensor (iPhone 6 and later, iPad Air 2 and later, iPad mini 4 and later, and iPad Pro).  On older devices without a barometric pressure sensor, only GPS altitude and accuracy will be displayed.  \n\nIf you have an Apple Watch, check out the new Pro Altimeter for Watch and get all this same functionality on your wrist!"

      "label": "More infos at gps-tracker-tool.de (support url).\n\nWHAT IT'S NOT\n- You can NOT track other phones with this app! This is a \"remote control\" for one of the dedicated hardware GPS trackers from the list of compatible models.\n- You cannot send SMS from iPod/iPad devices. However, you can still use the LIVE tracking features.\n\nMAJOR FEATURES\n- app will draft SMS commands for you - no need to carry around the tracker's manual\n- built-in compass for off-road navigation to tracker location\n- offers cell triangulation as fallback\n- reverse geocoding\n- administration of multiple trackers\n- visual set-up of geo-fence\n- configurable unit system (mi, km/h – m, ft)\n- quick commands = easy accessible custom commands\n- in-app purchases to enable the LIVE tracking features for some models: Trip history, trip start & end alerts, speed alert, geo fences, KML export\n\nINCOMING SMS\nYou just copy the whole incoming SMS and switch to the app. It will then try to match it against known formats. All data can then usually be visualized on the map. Please understand that iOS DOES NOT ALLOW to intercept incoming SMS automatically! Some tracker models can be monitored via the internet.\n \nSUPPORTED TRACKER MODELS\nAnywhere (TK 108),\nAsta (EV07S*),\nELRO (GPS1),\nConcox (GT02, GT011, GT 100),\nIncutex (TK 5000*, TK 104, TK 105*, TK 106, TK 116),\nmeitrack (VT 310 v6, VT 310 v7),\nPAJ* (Allround, Easy, Gold, Motorcycle, Mini, Personal, Power, Professional),\nSimvalley (GT 60, GT 170, GT 280),\nTKstar* (Bike, 720, 816 OBD, 901, 905, 909, 915),\nToplovo (TL 202),\nWonde Proud (SPT 10, VT 10),\nXexun* (TK 101, TK 102, TK 102-2, TK 102v6, TK 103, TK 103-2, TK 104, TK 106, TK 201, TK 201-2, TK 202, TK 203, TK 206, XT 009)\n* InApp live tracking via Internet for these models possible. After you made the tracker connect to the server, the feature can be activated with an InApp purchase.\nModel names might not always be unique amongst manufacturers, so if your tracker came with a manual, you can check for compatibility here: https://gps-tracker-tool.de/compatibility/ (see also support-url)\n\nKNOWN PROBLEMS\n- Please note that while you can send iMessages, you cannot send SMS from an iPad or iPod and therefore you would have very limited functionality on these devices. Still, an iPad would be a good choice for the LIVE tracking part.\n- Since iOS 10, short messages which contain links will be broken up into two. This makes copying a whole message impossible. You might have to miss out on the app's ability to visualize an incoming message from certain trackers.\n\n(If you experience any problem or have a feature request, please send us an e-mail. You find the address in the app's help section.)"

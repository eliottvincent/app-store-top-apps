Validation published on the Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research and Journal of Sports Sciences*****\n***Featured by Apple under ‘Best New Apps’ in 100+ countries***\n***The only app which calculates the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method***\n \nMy Jump 2 is the first app scientifically developed to measure your jump height. With a great design and validated by sport scientists, My Jump 2 is as reliable as a 10000$ force platform. Scientifically probed!\n\n------------------------------\n \nPierre Samozino (PhD, sport scientist, University of Savoy): “My Jump 2 makes possible the determination of the jump height with a high accuracy, which has been validated in very recent scientific study. The other, and I think the main added value of this app is to propose the determination of the Force-Velocity-Power profile of each athlete and its own imbalance between force and velocity qualities. Very useful to optimize your strength training and improve your explosive performances.”\n\nJean-Benoit Morin (PhD, sport scientist, University of Nice): “My Jump 2 is the cutting edge, scientifically validated and most practical application to measure athletes vertical jumping performance, and the only one to include the complete \"Optimal Force-Velocity Profile\" analysis we recently validated. I'm using it with athletes, students, and research subjects. The entire Jumping Force-Velocity-Power and Optimal F-V Profile approach in your pocket!”\n \n------------------------------\n \nMy Jump 2 gives you advanced information of your jumps using the camera on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. Just record a jump, select accurately its take off and landing and lets My Jump do its magic. My Jump 2 calculates the height, flight time, velocity, force and power of your vertical jumps. Also, it gives you the contact time, vertical stiffness and reactive strength index (RSI) of your Drop Jumps. Moreover, it allows you to calculate your Force-Velocity profile using Samozino's method. Complete analysis of your jumps right on your hand!\n \nFEATURES:\n \n• Accurate measurement of your vertical jumps. Scientifically demonstrated!\n• Calculate the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method. You can know your maximal theoretical force, velocity, power and how far you are from your optimal capabilities! You can even get information about which quality (force or velocity) you should work to increase your explosive performance.\n• Record stunnig slowmo videos up to 240fps or import as much as you like from your camera roll.\n• Different jump types: countermovement jump (CMJ), squat jump (SJ), drop jump (DJ), CMJ free arms, horizontal jumps and repeated jump test!\n• Annotate the external load used (CMJ & SJ) or the height of the box (DJ) to organize your best performances in different categories.\n• Multi-user. My Jump 2 allows you to create as many users as you want. Monitor all your team on your iDevice!\n• iCloud sync (iOS 13+)\n• History. Record as many jumps as you want for each user created. With My Jump 2 you can analyze the evolution of your performance during time. You can even observe exactly how much you have improved!\n• Export your data to Excel, Numbers, Google Drive and more!\n• Beautiful, intuitive like design.\n• Universal app: purchase once and install it on your iPhone, iPad and Mac (10.15+)\n \nNote: My Jump 2 works better with slow-motion videos.\n \nMY JUMP 2, A JUMP PLATFORM RIGHT ON YOUR HAND!"

      "label": "Flyskyhy forms your flight instrument during flight and shows all information you need for that. You get the normal data like altitude, climb rate, ground speed, and glide angle. But it also calculates and shows the current wind direction and strength, very important for your safety.\n\nA moving and rotating map shows your current flying position and flight trail. It indicates where you have gone up (in a thermal), and where you have had faster than normal decline. With that, you can easily find back that thermal that you lost. The map also shows the nearest known landing spots, and whether they are reachable by normal glide, given your current altitude and wind direction.\n\nIntegration with Bluetooth varios SensBox, FlyNet, GoFly iPico, XC-Tracer, BlueFlyVario, or SkyDrop gives accurate altitude and lift information. That turns your iPhone into an full-fletched GPS-vario, including vario tones.\n\nThe app makes a full log of your flight, that can be analyzed afterwards. Besides normal data like start and landing positions, duration of flight, and an altitude graph of the flight, Flyskyhy also calculates the scoring distances for you. So you can immediately see whether you have broken that FAI triangle record.\n\nYour live location is reported on livetrack24.com or loctome.com if you desire, so anybody can follow your flight while it is happening. If you are flying together with friends, then their location is shown on your map during your flight. So you never have to wonder anymore whether they are in front of or behind you.\n\nThe flight display has multiple screens which are all fully configurable. You can move all elements to other spots, delete and add elements, and resize them.\n\nThrough in-app purchases, the app also supports airspaces and waypoints.\n\nThe app is optimised for paragliding and hang gliders, but can be used with all  kinds of airsports.\n\nMain features during the flight;\n• Altitude, climb rate, ground speed, air speed, direction, glide angle and many more\n• Wind strength and direction\n• Moving map of the flying area\n• Spots where you have had lift, great for thermal coring\n• Shows whether you can still reach a landing spot with the current altitude and wind\n• Live tracking of your flight on livetrack24.com or loctome.com\n• Shows live location of your friends during flight\n\nAfter the flight:\n• Full logbook of all your flights\n• Basic flight data like start/landing, duration, height difference, distance flown, and many more\n• Calculation of 5-points, open triangle, and FAI triangle distances\n• Graph of altitude and climb rate\n• Signed IGC and KML log files of flights\n• Transfer the log to iTunes or send by email\n• Upload the flight directly to XContest, ParaglidingForum, DHV-XC, and other Leonardo servers\n• Open flight in Google Earth on the iPhone\n• Replay the flight and relive it!\n\nBy purchasing the Waypoints Extension you get access to:\n• A fully zoomable and scrollable map with the waypoints and optimised route. The map also shows start and landing spots, as well as restricted airspaces (with the Airspace Extension)\n• Enter new waypoints, either on the map or by specifying the parameters\n• Full route support with start time, goal, entry/exit points, etc. \n• Many instruments to guide you along the route\n• Visible and audible indication when a waypoint has been reached\n• Complete waypoints organiser\n• Import and export of various waypoint file formats\n\nBy purchasing the Airspace Extension you get access to:\n• Airspaces of 30 countries\n• Display of airspaces on the map with configurable colors and formats\n• Display of your vertical position w.r.t. airspaces\n• Visible and audible warnings when approaching and entering an airspace\n• Shows local airspaces by touching a spot on the map\n\nNote: a live internet connection is required for live tracking of your and your friends locations\nNote: continuous GPS and screen usage makes the battery drain faster than normal"

Wouldn’t it be great to be able to dive deeply with one big breath and take incredible pictures for your friends at home? The Apnea Trainer makes it possible! By using it to train three times a week, you can quickly double your underwater time.\n\nThis is the same training principle used by apnea divers. It’s based on a yoga technique which strengthens the diaphragm muscles allowing you to fill your lungs with more oxygen and releasing more carbon dioxide while exhaling. The system is relatively simple and depends on finding the right time intervals which are provided by the program, thus letting you relax and concentrate on your breathing. This will guarantee maximum training success.\nThe program will also come in handy just before the actual dive since a pranayama mode is already included. The Apnea Trainer will help you keep your whole body calm and give you the perfect preparation for those amazing, long-lasting dives. \n\n\nFeatures:\n+ Training to improve free diving time\n\n+ Pranayama mode to calm your body before diving or snorkeling\n\n+ Custom time settings for pro divers\n\n+ Optical and Audio instructions\n\n+ Easy to use interface\n\nUpdated user interface with the help of Bjoern Maser by www.minimalist.ch."

      "label": "****Designed by sport scientists, trusted by elite athletes****\n****Validated in the prestigious Journal of Sports Sciences****\n\nWhat is your maximal strength? Which weight should you use in your next training session to optimize results? My Lift is the first scientifically designed app to measure your 1-Repetition Maximum (1-RM) in the most accurate way possible. \n\nKnowing your 1-RM in every single training session is essential to adjust your training intensity and get the best adaptations. However, performing an actual 1-RM test could be dangerous and fatiguing and, if performed every day, it will most likely lead to overtraining or injuries. \n\nTo solve this problem, My Lift uses scientifically validated algorithms that can estimate your 1-RM with high precision by simply recording your exercise. To do this, My Lift uses the high-speed video recording available on most iPhone and iPad devices to measure the velocity at which you are performing the exercise, which is highly correlated with your maximal strength capabilities. This novel approach is used by sport scientists and top-level coaches thanks to advanced instrumental like linear transducers or force platforms, but now you can measure your 1-RM like a pro just with your iPhone or iPad!\n\nMy Lift is very intuitive and easy to use: you just need to record one repetition of the desired exercise with 1 to 4 different submaximal loads and select its start and beginning in the app with its accurate frame-by-frame navigation. After that, My Lift will show you your 1-RM! \n\nLet's say you got a workout which includes 4x5 repetitions at your 80%1-RM. Well, you just need to pick a load and record one repetition with My Lift. It will tell if that load really corresponds to your 80% or not, so you can increase or decrease the weight to train in the right zone!\n\nMy Lift has a lot of great features that will help you measure your 1-RM in a very simple, yet powerful way:\n\n-Estimates your 1-Repetition Maximum (1-RM) in a very simple way by measuring your movement velocity, a novel approach used by top sport scientists and elite coaches\n-Measures what %1-RM corresponds to a specific load so you can adjust your training and get the best results\n-Calculate your movement velocity to monitor your performance!\n-Analysis of velocity loss to monitor fatigue.\n-Track the trajectory of your lift and measure instantaneous position and velocity\n-Works with some of the most widely-used upper and lower body exercises by default: bench-press, deadlift, pull-up, military press, back squat & hip thrust. You can even create your own exercises!\n-Multi-team and multi-user: create as many teams and users as you want\n-Progress analysis: save as many tests as you want and see your progress through time to check if you have improved or worsened your performance. You can even see the percent of change from one test to another!\n-Data export: export your whole database to a csv file and play with your data in Excel!\n-iCloud sync (iOS 13+)\n-Universal app: purchase once and install it on your iPhone, iPad and Mac (10.15+)\n\nMy Lift, train smarter and get the best results!"

By freedivers, for freedivers, our freedive apnea trainer helps you with static apnea tables and lung capacity training so you can effectively increase the time when diving underwater.\r\nSee why STAmina Apnea Trainer is one of the best apnea apps to improve the breath-holding time for freediving, scuba diving and spearfishing, as well as surfing, running, and other water sports with 6 different apnea tables types.\n\n\r\n■ FREEDIVING & SPEARFISHING APNEA TRAINER FEATURES:\n\n\r\n◉ 6 APNEA TABLE OPTIONS \r\nSTAmina Apnea Trainer can create / generate custom apnea (exercises that are automatically created based on the maximum breath-hold and match the user’s level) or let you select from the following customizable table types:\r\n\r\n- O2 deprivation table – accustoms a body to lower oxygen levels. This is achieved by increasing the amount of time that you hold your breath on each attempt, while the resting time is fixed.\r\n\r\n- CO2 Tolerance table – helps a body to adapt to high carbon dioxide levels. This is achieved by decreasing the length of resting time between fixed breath-hold periods.\r\n\r\n- Wonka table – a variation of CO2 tables. Apnea timer starts after the first contraction, the rest time takes one breath.\r\n\r\n- Mix table – tables where apnea time increases and rest time decreases with each round.\r\n\r\n- Custom table – allows mixing of different approaches to create a custom training, thus generating the most effective training program.\r\n\r\n- Pranayama – a breathing technique to decrease stress in the body and relax the nervous system.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ APPLE HEALTH SYNCRONIZATION \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED TRAINING WITH VARYING DIFFICULTY\r\nWhen you start working with the application, you set your personal record in breath holding. Based on this data, the app will offer a personalized training program with exercises of 3 difficulty levels to choose from: easy, normal, and hard.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED EXERCISE SETTINGS \r\nEach exercise can be edited by setting your own number of repetitions, breath hold time, rest time, etc.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ TRAINING REMINDERS \r\nGet the notification to start your apnea training. Set a reminder in the apnea diver app for the day and the time & get a notification to do a breath holding training session.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONAL STATISTICS AND DETAILED TRAINING HISTORY\r\nAll your workouts and exercises are recorded in the freedive trainer app to track the detailed progress of each training.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ VOICE GUIDANCE\r\nTraining may be accompanied by voice guidance with male/female voices recorded by professional voice actors. STAmina supports English, French, Russian voice guidance.\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n◉ HEART RATE AND OXYGEN SATURATION TRACKING\r\nTrack your heart rate while doing breath holding exercises (a compatible HR monitor or pulse-oximeter is required) \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CONTRACTIONS TRACKING \r\nUse our freedive trainer to track unlimited contractions, analyse captured data after exercises\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CLOUD SYNC / BACKUP\r\nAccess your data on multiple devices and easily restore it in case you switch devices/phones.\n\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\nStamina Apnea Trainer allows training breath hold effectively for anyone who cares about all kinds of diving including:\r\n> beginner or professional freedivers;\r\nspearfishers;\r\n> scuba divers to learn how to dive longer on one tank;\r\n> surfers in case of unexpected breath hold;\r\n> underwater sports athletes such as underwater rugby, hockey, etc.\r\n> runners who want to train breath holding & high tolerance to CO2 while running\r\n\r\n_______\r\nInfo https://getstamina.app/\r\nContact https://www.facebook.com/staminamobile/\r\nSupport hello@squarecrowdapps.com"

      "label": "The 'YO YO Endurance Test' provides an important instrument for determining the level of physical efficiency of an athlete.\nThe physical capacity is evaluated quickly and easily by placing two cones spaced 20 meters each other.\nThe athlete has to run at full speed from one cone to another and then return again on the first cone. This path must be repeated for six times without any break, and get  the split times every time the athlete passes on the first cone.\n\nThis application will track all the split time and at the end will be calculated two parameters that determine the outcome of the test. More these values are low and better will be the athlete's performance.\n\nBasically the final result is given by a mathematical formula that processes the delta between the averages of the last two split times and the first two split times  and thereby the athlete's ability to maintain its maximum speed for a certain period of time.\n\nThe second value obtained on completion of the test, is the first result considering also the total time of the test.\n\nThe 'YO YO Endurance Test' can be used to determine the level of athletic in all sports (football, running, basketball, volleyball, cycling, tennis etc.)\nAt the end of the test you can get for each athlete the final result (eg. \"Above average\" or \"Poor\") and the Vo2Max estimate\n\nYou can manage more Athletes and save personal data and notes.\nYou can analyze test results.\nAutomatic Sync between devices thanks to iCloud\nInfo section where you can better understand how prepare the test and you can visit linked website and video where get more info about YO-YO Endurance Test\n\nIf you find this application useful, please give a positive review in the AppStore, so we can further improve and develop new options.\n\nFor any further information, please send an email to:\nsupport@bitandweb.com\n\nThanks"

In addition, the interactive swingweight calculator aids in customizing your racquet to fit your own stroke pattern, while the stiffness calculator allows you to simulate different racquet configurations. \n\nRacquetTune not only makes it easier to decide when it is time to restring, it is also an invaluable tool when testing different racquets and strings and in identifying which of your racquets is best suited for different types of games. RacquetTune also allows you to check whether your stringer is consistent in his work. \nRacquetTune includes the following user-friendly tools:\n\nTension measurement \n- Quickly determines the tension and stringbed stiffness. \n- Able to detect changes in tension as small as 0.1 kg/0.2 lb.\n- An accuracy indicator ensures results are consistent. \n- Graphical presentation of sound waves helps you find the ideal way of tapping the strings. \n- Settings can be customized to serve tennis, squash, racquetball and badminton racquets, respectively. \n- View the tension history for each racquet as a list or a graph.\n- Email a spreadsheet with test data.\n\nSwingweight calculator \n- Add as many weights as you wish to the frame. \n- Move and change weights to visualize how swingweight, balance and sweet spot location are affected.\n- Enter target values for the racquet and let RacquetTune distribute the weights automatically.\n\nStiffness calculator \n- Simulate various racquet and string configurations\n- Vary tension, string type and racquet head size. \n- Shows load-displacement curves, stiffness and elastic energies \n- Handles the large deformations encountered in actual play \n\nView a demo video at racquettune.com\n\nRacquetTune has been featured in tennis magazines in USA, Italy, France, Germany, Sweden and Norway. \n\n\"The app is very, very impressive. I get more tension diagnostic questions than just about anybody in the universe, so this is a very good thing to be able to recommend.\" \nJonathan Wolfe \nUS Racquet Stringers Association\n\nNote, that the actual string tension in the racquet and the setting seen on a stringing machine are two different things and therefore incomparable - more information can be found at racquettune.com."

Just make sure to use an official target or the app won't work. With an approved target, it's brilliant.\"\n– Stone Glasgow, United States\n\n\"A great tool for getting people to see their shot fall and make adjustments.

Even if your are flying accidentally within a cloud or under poor visibility conditions!\n\nBy typing to „Alt 3“ - usually after the adjusting phase - or any time later you can reset „Alt 3“ to „0“.\n\nMoreover you can use the App to\n\n    - record you flights \n    - view your recorded flights in the integrated map view  \n    - send your recorded flights by mail as kml-files or gpx -files to your friends \n    \nOne last note: \nThe app reacts a little somewhat slower, as e.g. a Bräuninger- or Flytec Vario, if you use the internal pressure sensor of the iPhone, because the sensor doesn't provide data as often as an external sensor. \n\nThe app requires a good GPS signal, if no internal or external pressure sensor can be used. \n\nPlease make sure in any case, that you have a good GPS signal,  if you use the app. \nThe app does NOT work - completely and reliably - in buildings or other situations in which you have no or a bad GPS signal! \nHowever, this should not be a problem, since you usually flying under a clear open sky. ;-) \n\nUsage - without - an internal or external sensor is possible, but subject to known the limitations of a pure GPS operation, such as using only open-air, a good GPS signal and altitude changes > 5m with at least 1-2 m/s. \n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\nEven if the App is running in background, the GPS location service is used by the App, if you record your flight!"

Includes predefined standard events and splits but also it allows you to create your own events and splits.\n\nThe application can be used to time one or multiple athletes in the same race. You can set the application to work in Miles or Kilometers.\n\nKeeps all your events history for later review and analysis. Each performance can be shared by email.\n\nMissed the gun?. Don't worry, you can predefine the start time of the timer. \n\nIt allows you to Import/Export athletes. This is useful when you have a big roaster of athletes and needs to be imported to the app. Also if you have the app installed in different devices (iPad and iPhone), it facilitates the process of keeping on sync the roaster. \n\nIt allows to predefine Teams of athletes (before the meet). These teams, along with individual athletes, are available to pick from when using the app during meets; these expedite you the process of timing events during the meet.\n\nSmart Stop feature: because this app know the event and split distance, it knows exactly when the final lap is, so it will stop the stopwatch at the end of the final lap, regardless of the button you use (lap or stop). \n\nBecause StopWatch for Cross Country and Road races knows the event and split characteristics, you can record: \n\n-The distance for each split \n-The estimated time at the finish line\n-The pace for each split\n-The average pace for each runner at the end of the event.\n\nIf you have questions, suggestions or issues, before writing it in a review, first don't hesitate to contact us to stopwatchtf@gmail.com"

It automatically calculates your pressure groups and can even find your minimum surface interval. It’s quick and simple and super easy to use. \n\nTo calculate your pressure groups just enter your depth (feet or meters) and time (min) for your first dive. Then enter your surface interval between dives in minutes. After that enter your second dive depth and time the same way, and the program will calculate your final PG, ABT, RNT, TBT and new no decompression limit. \n\nTo calculate your minimum surface interval between dives enter the depth and time of your first dive. Then enter the depth and time of your second dive. The program will now find your minimum surface interval and then calculate your final PG, ABT, RNT, TBT and new no decompression limit. \n\nThis program uses only the standard PADI dive tables. It can NOT calculate reverse profile dives. Reverse profile dives are when the second dive is deeper than the first. Unless you absolutely know what you are doing always dive shallower than the last dive. \n\nDisclaimer: This application is not a replacement for diving tables, dive computers, or experience. Please do not rely on Ez Dive Planner as your sole dive planner and make sure to double check all information before diving.

You can use Dive Log at the dive site or on the dive boat to capture the information about the site while it is fresh in your mind (or your dive guide's mind). You can even capture the GPS coordinates of the dive site using the built in location services of your iOS device. Details about your actual dive can be added immediately after your dive or at the après dive event and later be saved to your desktop computer. The dive buddy feature is fully integrated with Contacts on your iPhone or iPad, letting you capture information about your newest dive buddy or quickly add an existing buddy to a particular dive. The dive data and statistics features let you have an immediate answer the next time your dive guide asks how much weight you used on your last dive or have all the information you need about your dive history when you fill out that next dive waiver.  Metric and Imperial values are supported for all appropriate logbook fields. You can easily enter values using the appropriate units for the situation and view them in your preferred measurement system. You can even explore detailed dive profiles from popular dive computers that you download with your desktop software and later upload to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad. Dive profile data can also be transferred directly from certain dive computers directly via Bluetooth or using a supported Bluetooth accessory and an associated in-app purchase.  \n\nOn Windows, Diving Log 6.0 (www.divinglog.de) is fully integrated with Dive Log on iPhone/iPad and has built in synchronization. Diving Log 6.0 has extensive support for importing data from dive computers and other dive log applications. \n\nOn Mac OS X, logbook information can be imported to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad from a number of compatible applications using the free Dive Log Manager application available from More Mobile Software (www.moremobilesoftware.com/divelog-sync). Dive Log DT (available on the Mac App Store) can be used to directly import a number of dive computers and file formats and can synchronize with Dive Log on iOS.\n\nDive data can be directly downloaded on a Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch from Bluetooth LE capable dive computers such as the Suunto EON Steel, Suunto EON Core, Suunto D5, Scubapro Galileo 2 (G2), Aladin Sport (Matrix), Aladin H (Matrix), G2 HUD, Aladin A1, Shearwater Teric, Peregrine, Petrel 2, Perdix, Perdix AI, NERD 2, Oceanic VTX, Pro Plus 4, Geo 4.0, VEO 4.0, Aeris A300CS, Aqualung i300C, i550C, i750TC, i770R, Sherwood Wisdom 4, Mares Genius and certain heinrichs weikamp OSTC computers as well as the DiveNav Inc. bluebuddy and Tech Buddy dive logger accessories. Supported Bluetooth LE accessories are available separately.\n\nMares Bluelink Pro is a Bluetooth LE accessory by Mares and available for purchase separately (www.mares.com). The Bluelink Pro allows you transfer dive data from certain Mares dive computers (Puck Pro, Smart, Smart Air, Quad and Quad Air) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nDive Computer Buddy (aka DCbuddy) is a Bluetooth LE accessory by DiveNav Inc. (note that the DCbuddy itself is no longer available).

It creates a Readiness score in a scale of 1 to 9 based on perceived sleep quality, muscle soreness, fatigue and stress. Then, it compares daily scores with the average of the previous two months using a very intuitive traffic light system: green is ok, orange is moderate fatigue and red is high fatigue.\n\nAlso, Readiness has great features that can help coaches and athletes to improve their training:\n-Create as many teams as athletes as you want with no restrictions\n-Register as many tests per athletes as you want\n-Export the whole data in a CSV file to Excel or other popular apps\n-Check your evolution with intuitive graphs"

      "label": "Dive Plan is a digital decompression table and log book, made using general public information, most compatible with PADI, SSI, SDI, NAUI, NAVI diving tables, and it is comparable with most of the other current diving organizations and their dive tables. Recreational dive planners are decompression tables in which non-stop time under water is calculated. The Dive Planner can be used to practice for your dive certification exams, and can be used as a general guide for planning dives, and logging your dives so you never forget what to enter into your paper log book. \n\nDive Plan works for diving with air (21% Oxygen) filled tanks, as well as enriched air (nitrox from 21% to 40% oxygen). Please note that when diving on an altitude, special considerations must be taken into account, and different dive tables should be used.\n\nDive computers use much more sophisticated algorithms for calculated non-decmpression limits, based on the whole dive, whereas the recreational dive tables are much more conservative and assume a square profile dive where the diver spends the entire dive at one depth."

      "label": "***Validation published on the Journal of Applied Biomechanics***\n\nWe know you love running, but do you know how do you run?\n\nDesigned by sport scientists & coaches of elite runners, Runmatic is the first scientifically designed app that analyzes your running and sprinting technique to help you to improve your performance and prevent injuries.\n\nRunmatic takes advance of the slowmotion recording capabilities of your iOS devices to accurately analyze your running and sprinting technique. Using scientifically validation equations, Runmatic calculates the contact-flight times, force, efficiency, frequency and even the asymmetry of your legs in a simple, accurate way. Runmatic can also analyze your stride informing about relevant variables such as pronation, pelvic drop or strike pattern, which could help you prevent injuries. \n\nRunmatic is an extraordinary tool for sprint analysis as well. It can measure total time, splits and contact/flight times with a precision comparable to professional timing gates. Moreover, it can create Kinograms (following the methodology by ALTIS) to analyze the quality of motion of each phase of the sprint. You can even calculate the most relevant angles of your body!\n\n\n****Pr. Jean-Benoit Morin, PhD, Expert in running biomechanics: \"This is a very useful app to evaluate and monitor the mechanics of the runners' strides. It's accurate, it's scientifically validated and it uses equations derived from our research (Morin et al., 2005). The tools often used to perform this kind of analyses are much more expensive and generally less practical for the general population. Runmatic solves this problem and allows runners to analyze and monitor their running mechanics in an easy way\"\n\n****Arturo Casado, Olympic runner, 2010 European 1500m Champion: \"Runmatic is very helpful for my training. It let me better understand how do I run, which is critical to improve my running economy and, therefore, my performance. Is like a lab in my pocket!\"\n\nRunmatic has a lot of great features that will help you monitor your running and sprinting performance in a very simple, yet powerful way:\n\n-Calculate contact time, flight time, frequency, max force, displacement of the center of mass and leg stiffness with scientific accuracy\n-Analyze your stride to calculate your pelvic drop, pronation and strike patter, which could help you prevent injuries.\n-Measure total time, splits and contact and flight times of your sprints.\n-Analyze the quality of the sprint by creating Kinograms (ALTIS methodology).\n-Multi-user: create as many users as you want\n-iCloud sync (iOS13 only)\n-Progress analysis: save as many runs as you want and see your progress through time to check if you have improved or worsened your performance. You can even see the percent of change from one test to another!\n-Data export: export your whole database to a csv file and play with your data in Excel!\n-Universal app: purchase once and install it on your iPhone, iPad or Mac (10.15+)\n\n\nRunmatic, analyze your running/sprinting mechanics and improve your performance!"

Nevertheless, the application can run without GPS, WiFi and internet connection, in this case, the user has to give the weather data.\n\nThe application is made up of four tabs that are described next:\n\n- Results: in this tab, the recommended main jet, needle type and clip position, pilot jet and air screw position are shown (screw position is expressed in turns from fully tightened). These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine configuration introduced in the next tabs. Under the recommended main jet, the calculated real value with decimals is shown. The air density and density altitude are shown too. In addition, this tab lets do a fine tuning adjustment to adapt to a concrete engine (you know that each engine has its own personality). \n\n- Weather: you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. The values of this screen can be manually set or can be loaded by the application reading the data from the nearest weather station (from the GPS tab).\n\n- Engine: you can set in this screen the information about the engine, that is, the model year, model and carburetor, and the oil mix ratio that you\\'re using.\n\n- GPS: This tab allows to use the location service (using GPS or WiFi) to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity).\n\nThe app let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, meter and feet for altitude, and mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg y atm for pressures.\n\nValid for the following models from 2005 to 2021:\n- 50 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 50 SX Factory Edition: 2021.\n- 50 SX Mini: 2017-2021.\n- 65 SX: 2017-2021.\n- 85 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 105 SX: 2006-2012.\n- 125 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 125 SXS: 2005-2007.\n- 125 EXC: 2005-2016.\n- 125 XC: 2017-2018.\n- 144 SX: 2007-2008.\n- 150 SX: 2009-2021.\n- 150 XC: 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2017, 2018, 2019.\n- 200 EXC: 2005-2016.\n- 200 XC: 2005-2012.\n- 250 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 250 SXS: 2005-2007.\n- 250 XC: 2007-2019.\n- 250 EXC: 2005-2018.\n- 300 EXC: 2005-2018.\n- 300 XC: 2009-2018.\n- 300 MXC: 2005.\n* Please note that the application is valid only for engines that use carburetor.

Using the app, you can be as anonymous as you like since you track under an Alias, and you can even set the tracks to be private (not listed or searchable on locatoweb.com). \n\nThe app only records your position when a track has been set up and started and lasts until you stop it. It is frequently used to track bicycle rides, road trips, hiking trips and other outdoor adventures where you want to show your friends and family where you are, or to simply track your adventures for your own pleasure.\n\nThere is also a safety aspect of using LocaToWeb. If you have the track running and something happens, your wife, husband and friends can see the exact location of where you are. Maybe you are riding your bike and falls off hitting your head, or you just want to be safe when walking home alone at night. \n\nKey features:\n\n- Share your position to web in real time\n- Monitor duration, distance, speed and altitude\n- See your exact position and track line on a map\n- Capture and upload photos while tracking\n- Set up race groups that tracks several participants\n- Choose your units system (metric/imperial)\n- Possible to keep the screen alive while tracking\n- Resume a track that has been stopped\n- View and edit your archived tracks anytime on the web site\n- Just install and track, no registering is required\n\nNote that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "The most advanced sports timer in the AppStore! \nFeatured by Apple in the TV-ad \"Strength\". \n\nSprintTimer is a unique sports timer and photo finish app that employs the same techniques as the fully automatic timing equipment (FAT) used at the Olympics. Start the timer and point the camera towards the finish line. The app creates an image where you can scroll to get the time for each competitor with a 0.01 s accuracy*. SprintTimer also includes a motion/human-activated Video Finish for longer races and a Start Sender for wirelessly controlling SprintTimer from another device.\n\nSprintTimer is used by coaches, teachers, and athletes all over the world for practice and competition in, for example, track & field, cycling, skiing, speed skating, car racing, rowing, kayaking, horses or greyhound racing. \n\nSprintTimer has several advantages over a manual stopwatch: \n- One person can time all participants\n- Higher accuracy*\n- Easier to determine the order\n- The image and the results can be saved\n- Can operate \"hands-free\" when started\n- The timer can be started manually, with a sound, or remotely from another device\n\n*See webpage: sprinttimer.app/accuracy\n\n——— Reviews and Comments ———\n\n\"Without a doubt the best App available on the market for sprinters and coaches who want accurate timing to see their development.\"\nspeedendurance.com\n\n\"AMAZING\"\nthepegeek.com\n\n\"Amazing app for physical education teachers or coaches!  I have used it for timing during our track and field, speed quickness & agility, fitness testing, & many more units.  It is very accurate and easy to use and gets the job done quickly!  A must-have!\"\nmertonphysed.weebly.com\n\n \"The app is very professionally set up and you can very easily capture your whole Track event.\"\nwww.melhamada.com\n\n\"Very useful app for measuring and/or verifying close finishes to track and field or road races.\"\nphysedreview.weebly.com\n\nSatisfied users from all over the world:\n- Brilliant.  A fantastic app for use in school athletics lessons\n- Amazing. This application is awesome and the results are really accurate.\n- What a brilliant app! Our £9k photo finish camera broke down and this app was a real lifesaver and worth way more than £1.50! Highly recommended.\n- This app is wonderful. We use it to time all our meets.\n- This is a great app and it is getting better from release to release\n- Nice, nice, nice! Using it for our youth track team. Love it! 5 stars!\n- Exactly what I needed - Fantastic app\n- Thank you so much for developing this amazing app just when we ran out of options.\n- Congratulations on developing a really clever and useful app.\n- Love what you did with the SprintTimer app.\n\n——— In-App Purchases and Subscriptions ———\n\nThe Start Sender and Results Manager features require the purchase of SprintTimer Pro, available as a subscription at $4.99 per year. There is a 2 weeks free trial period.\n\nShould you choose to subscribe to SprintTimer Pro, the purchase will be charged to your Apple ID account. The subscription will be auto-renewed 24 hours prior to the end of the period. You can manage it from the user settings in iTunes after purchasing it, and you will also be able to cancel the auto-renewing subscription from there.\n\nIf you purchase a new SprintTimer Pro subscription during a free trial you will forfeit any free trial remaining from your first subscription.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy: https://sprinttimer.se/privacy\n\n\nIcon runners made by Freepik from Flaticon.com"

      "label": "An extensive overhaul of the app is now complete, making a 4.5/5 star app even better! This upgrade is packed with lots of new features and a new interface that supports both portrait and landscape modes.\n\nWith iTouchStats Basketball, you are in control over how much data you want to track.  The most popular method is to track individual player stats for one team while tracking just the opponent's team stats, as shown in the 1st screen shot.  Or you can track individual player stats for both teams, as shown in the 2nd screen shot.  Which stats you track for each team is up to you.   Even the use of the game clock and shot location tracking are optional.  \n\nA unique feature of iTouchStats Basketball is the quick stat icons that appear next to a player's photo or jersey.  These icons coordinate with the stat button colors, giving you an easy way to see a player's key stats without needing to leave the main scoring screen.  Icons include: Points (Green), Fouls (Red), Turnovers (Orange), Assists (Yellow), Steals (Gray), and Blocks (Brown).  By double-tapping on a player, you can get even more stat details including shot charts and shooting percentages.\n \nNEW ▸▸  One of the coolest features added in v4.0 is the team bench that appears at the bottom of the score keeping screen.  The bench greatly improves player subbing and also gives you easy access to viewing the stats of the players not in the game.  You can even register a stat to a player on the bench if a sub-in was missed.\n \nNEW ▸▸  User Definable Rating System (This system has the ability to give individual values to each stat, allowing a quick easy way for a coach or parent to see how a player performed in a game based on these values.)\n\nNEW ▸▸  User Definable Stat Button (This definable stat button can also be turned off in the game reports.)\n\nNEW ▸▸  Team quick stats are displayed in the scoreboard. \n \nNEW ▸▸  iCloud Data Backups\n\nNEW ▸▸  Half Timeouts have been added as an option.\n\nNEW ▸▸  Running Clock is an added Rules option.\n\nIMPROVED ▸▸  Game and season PDF reports.  Not only has the look improved, but you can now choose which stats are displayed on PDF reports.  For example, if the game clock is not used and deflections are not tracked, then you can turn these fields off in PDF reports.\n\nIMPROVED ▸▸  Stat viewing options.  You can now view a team or player(s) stats by periods.  For example, you could use this to compare how your starters did in the 2nd half vs. the 1st half.  You could even do this over multiple games!\n    \nIMPROVED ▸▸  Season, Team, and Player management.  For users who track multiple seasons, you will now only see data relating to your \"Default\" season, but changing between seasons can be done easily. \n\n▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸\nDETAILED STAT LIST\n▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸\n▸ 2-Point, 3-Point, Free Throws, Field Goals (Made, Attempts, and % for each) \n ▸ Rebounds (Offensive, Defensive, Dead Ball)  \n▸ Assists  \n▸ Blocks  \n▸ Steals  \n▸ Turnovers (optional Forced or Unforced: Out of Bounds, Lost Ball, Ball Handling, Bad Pass, Back Court, 3 Sec, 5 Sec, 10 Sec, Shot Clock, Other)  \n▸ Fouls (optional: Offensive, Defensive, Flagrant, Team Technical, Player Technical)  \n▸ Charges Taken \n▸ Deflections   \n▸ Forced Jump Balls \n ▸ Efficiency (Stat formula taken from http://www.nba.com/statistics/efficiency.html) \n▸ Rating (User Definable Rating System)\n ▸ Minutes Played  \n▸ Games (Started, Played)  \n▸ User Definable Stat Button\n\n▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸\nView app videos and download sample PDF reports at iTouchStats.com\n▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸"

      "label": "This app is designed for various types of automobile rallies that require measurement of time, speed, or distance between segments of the rally route including stages and checkpoints.\n\nTo make sure that all initial conditions are set properly when using GPS, touch the \"Reset/Pause\" button and choose the \"Reset, New Rally\" option. Also, it is very important to allow the GPS devices, whether Apple's internal GPS or the third-party Dual GPS Receiver, time to determine the current location and to begin interacting with the app by driving around a bit before you start using the app on a rally course.\n\nBegin computing distance, time, and speed by touching the \"Start Rally\" button. Alternatively, when the app has been either restarted to zero distance or paused, you may select a minute for the \"Next Starting Time.\"\n\nGPS inputs trace the path along the rally route. From time to time you may measure time, speed, and distance for a stage or a checkpoint. These measurements will be stored in a table and the points will be indicated on a map.\n\nAn alternative view showing the odometer measurements more prominently is available by touching the \"Mode\" button in the upper menu bar.\n\nYou may subtract distance when you travel off course. A toggle button switches between on course (blue line) and off course (red line) travel. \n\nDistance measurement can be set to miles or kilometers and time measurement can be set to minutes and seconds or decimal minutes. The distance may be displayed with either 2 or 3 digit precision. Make your selections by touching the Settings with a \"sprocket\" button beside the \"About\" button.\n\nThe app is designed to adjust the GPS coordinates of a moving vehicle owing to the time between reception of new GPS signals and to the time lag between the time the signal was generated from satellites and the time when processing actually occurs in the app.\n\nAlso, you may adjust the location coordinate by the distance between the GPS receiver in the car (either the iPhone or iPad or some third-party GPS receiver) and the position on the car where a rally may measure time or location at timed controls (sometimes this is the front of the car or the center of the front wheels).\n\nThese three potential errors in coordinate measurement are discussed at length in a 6-part thread in the Facebook \"Road Rally Tech Talk\" forum.\n\nTo fine-tune the app's distance between GPS receiver and front wheels (if necessary) and clock time figures to the rally's official measures with the options in the Adjustments popup. Unlock to make adjustments and lock to save the changes you make and to prevent inadvertent changes.\n\nYou may pause or gain time on a particular stage by adding or subtracting time on a stage. Also, you might wish to \"bump\" the recorded GPS distance +/- to align with official rally distances. Touch the button in the lower right-hand corner to access the \"bump\" function.\n\nA log view shows additional information at each stage including the latitude, longitude, and the current speed at the time the New Stage button was touched.\n\nFor better GPS reception and improved accuracy, third-party wireless GPS receivers are recommended. This app has been tested with Bluetooth connectivity to a Dual XGPS150A GPS Receiver. This app works with both iPhones and iPads, even those without Cellular connectivity. However, there can only be one Apple device with Bluetooth activated within range of the Dual Receiver. Place devices not running this app in Airplane mode and be sure that the Dual Receiver is connected with the device and app you are using. When Dual is connected to the app, the button in the lower right-hand corner of the map display will show \"Dual\" in green letters, otherwise, the button will show \"Apple\" in red letters. You may have to restart your Apple device and perhaps restart the Dual Receiver once or twice to get a successful connection.\n\nDisclaimer: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

Includes the individual and relay events for elites, college and high school. You can time relay teams with a single button, recording individual splits along with total individual and teams times.\n\nIt includes support for 3 type of courses: SCY (25y), SCM (25m) y LCM (50m). Also it has 26 predefined events (21 individual and 5 relays). \n\nThe application can be used to time one or multiple swimmers in the same race. Also it includes a module which allows you to time relay events. \n\nKeeps all your events history for later review and analysis. Each performance can be shared by email. \n\nIt allows you to Import/Export swimmers. This is useful when you have a big roaster and needs to be imported to the app. Also if you have the app installed in different devices (iPad and iPhone), it facilitates the process of keeping on sync the roaster. \n\nIt allows to predefine Teams of swimmers (before the meet). These teams, along with individual swimmers, are available to pick from when using the app during meets; these expedite you the process of timing events during the meet. \n\nSmart Stop feature: because this app has preloaded the events, it knows exactly when the final lap is, so it will stop the stopwatch at the end of the final lap, regardless of the button you use (lap or stop). \n\nLaps can be set at one length of the course or two lengths of the course based on your preferences.\n\nBecause StopWatch for Track and Field knows the event characteristics, you can record: \n\n-The distance for each lap \n-The swimmer estimated time during each lap\n-The estimated time of your relay team\n-The individual lap times and total time per leg in relay events \n\nIf you have questions, suggestions, issues, before writing it in a review, first don't hesitate to contact us to stopwatchsm@gmail.com"

Please note that Boulder Trainer is a small private project, which I started by my own and I'm trying to keeping it alive and professional which is not always as easy as it appears. \n\n\n\nLike Boulder Trainer on Facebook: www.facebook.com/BoulderTrainer\n\nSupported by:\n\n+ Metolius Climbing: www.metoliusclimbing.com\n+ Beastmaker: www.beastmaker.co.uk\n+ Bergfreunde: www.bergfreunde.de\n+ Core Fingerboard: www.coreclimbing.co.uk\n+ Moon Climbing: www.moonclimbing.com\n+ OCUN: www.ocun.cz/en\n+ So iLL: www.soillholds.com\n+ ant works: www.antworks.com"

      "label": "EasyTag-Note is an easy way to make notes on the performance-defining events of a game or practice as it unfolds - simply tap buttons to describe the KPI (key performance indicators) of your activity. You add the buttons that you need and aren’t bound by someone else’s predefined ideas of what is important to your team.\n\nFrequency statistics are displayed and data can be exported for number crunching. The time and duration of each note is recorded, allowing events to be imported into video analysis software from where valuable video coaching resources can be created.\n\nEasyTag-Note works as a standalone app but is also designed to integrate with Dartfish software. Use its Quick Import function to match tagged events to the corresponding moment on video. Now you can use Dartfish for editing, analysis and video presentations to your team.\n\nEasyTag-Note Features:\n• Create custom panels or easily modify the provided templates\n• Make your panel unique – you decide what’s important.\n• Time stamping of fixed or open duration periods of activity\n• Pre-roll setting allows you to assess an event before deciding to tag it \n• Mark favourite events for later review.\n• Export data (CSV file) via email\n• Statistics display and bar graph representation of data\n• Dartfish Quick Import easily integrates your notational analysis with video. \n\nDartfish EasyTag-Note is an iOS 10 compatible update of our Easytag app and the little brother of Dartfish Note. No myDartfish subscription is required but it has more limited functionality than both these apps. \n\nAbout us: Dartfish has a pedigree in video analysis going back to 1998. We are proud to serve teams, federations and gold medallists from all round the world."

To measure the distance, you must measure the 'foot' of the target object. if the target object is not on the ground, you could image the target object's foot point on the ground and measure this point.\n4. To measure the height, you must firstly get the distance. After you get the distance, you need firstly lock the distance. Then move the cross point of the app to the target's top head and read the height result.\n5. To measure the width, you must firstly get the distance. After you get the distance, you need firstly lock the distance.

      "label": "Designed by sports scientists and coaches. Scientifically validated (publication in review in a high-impact journal). \nThe only app that accurately calculates the complete power-force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino et al.´s method (published in 2015). \n\nMy Sprint is the first app scientifically developed to measure the individual sprint mechanical outputs (force, velocity, power, effectiveness) of athletes. Innovative design, validated by sports scientists, My Sprint is as reliable as a 4000$ radar plus PC system. Scientifically approved!\n\nSprint running, power output and forward acceleration are a key combination of performance in many sports activities. Determining individual Force–Velocity profile, maximal power and mechanical effectiveness during sprint propulsion is of great interest for coaches, sport practitioners, or physiotherapists. What makes you fast?\n\nTheir opinion about My Sprint:\n\n- Dr. Samozino: “One of our main interests is to make accessible to sport practitioners the scientific evaluations we do in our labs with very specific devices. The simple method on which My Sprint is based was developed in this sense to test the sprint mechanical capabilities in field condition. The results of the validation of the method in comparison to force plate measurements were better than those we expected! And the validity of the data obtained with My Sprint is in the same extent… but with an impressive simplicity!”  \n\n- Pr. Morin: “When we developed our 2015 simple method, we found it was a great achievement to measure sprint acceleration mechanics with a very high concurrent validity compared to the gold standard force plate measurements. My Sprint takes things to another level, since it allows accurate measurements with just an iPhone!”\n\nMy Sprint calculates Power-Force-Velocity profile and measures the individual sprint mechanical outputs (force, velocity, power, effectiveness) of athletes using the camera on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. It was specially designed to take advantage of the extraordinary 120-240fps camera of the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s. You just need to perform an all-out 40 m sprint and mark the track with a reference system marks located at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 meters and you only need six visible vertical markers (like thin poles) at these markers to record the time between markers. After that My Sprint does the computations and calculates athlete´s mechanical capabilities.  \n\nFEATURES: \n\n- Accurate measurement of the split times over a sprint acceleration. Scientifically validated!\n- Calculation the Power-Force-Velocity profile using the innovative Samozino et al.´s method. You can therefore know the athlete’s mechanical capabilities that determine the entire sprint acceleration performance. These properties are integrative and encompass all the mechanisms involved in the total external force produced during each lower limb extension and the ability to orient it effectively onto the ground. \n- Record amazing slow motion videos up to 240fps (iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s) and analyse in a frame-by-frame mode as well as import videos from your camera roll. \n- Multi-user. You can create as many users as your need with My Sprint. You can assign each user to a team for a higher ease of use. \n- Performance follow-up. You can record as many sprints as you want for each user created and analyze performance through a competitive season. \n\nNote: My Sprint was scientifically validated using an iPhone 6, and it uses the slow motion video recording on the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s. On other devices, the measurements are less accurate slow motion video recording feature is not available. \n\nA SPRINT ACCELERATION MECHANICS LAB IN YOUR POCKET!"

      "label": "Finally a Stopwatch specific for Track and Field. Used by coaches, runners, parents and fans. \n\nIncludes the individual and relay distances for elites, college and high school track runners. It supports 30 individual distances and 13 relays. \n\nThe application can be used to time one or multiple athletes in the same race. Also it includes a module which allows you to time relay events.\n\nKeeps all your events history for later review and analysis. Each performance can be shared by email or shared in the different social networks. Allows you to time multiple athletes at the same time.\n\nIt allows you to Import/Export athletes. This is useful when you have a big roaster of athletes and needs to be imported to the app. Also if you have the app installed in different devices (iPad and iPhone), it facilitates the process of keeping on sync the roaster. \n\nIt allows to predefine Teams of athletes (before the meet). These teams, along with individual athletes, are available to pick from when using the app during meets; these expedite you the process of timing events during the meet.\n\nSmart Stop feature: because this app has preloaded the events, it knows exactly when the final lap is, so it will stop the stopwatch at the end of the final lap, regardless of the button you use (lap or stop). For Individual events, splits can be set at the 200m mark or 400m mark based on your preferences. When splits are set to 200m, it also allows you to use this app for indoor events. This application also supports hurled events, allowing to record splits per hurdle (touch downs), including support for events with 4, 5, 8 or 10 hurdles.\n\nBecause StopWatch for Track and Field knows the event characteristics, you can record: \n\n-The distance for each split \n-The estimated time at the finish line!! \n-The estimated time of your relay team \n-The Individual splits per leg in relay events\n\nVisit our website to see our demo videos: http://goo.gl/ymuFQ or follow us in Twitter @StopWatchTF\n\nIf you have question, suggestions, issues, before writting it in a review, first don't hesitate to contact us to stopwatchtf@gmail.com"

Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

      "label": "Twigsee for kindergarten management \r\nRoutine matters and day-to-day administration will no longer be a burden for either teachers or kindergarten managers. Twigsee handles it all. More than 85% of the organisational and administrative agenda of the kindergarten is taken care of. The kindergarten has all reports, printouts and information in one place. Communication with parents is easy and efficient, leading to satisfaction on all sides.\r\n \r\nBenefits for the kindergarten\r\ncomplete admissions process\r\nattendance and excuse records, which serve as the basis for automatic calculation of kindergarten fees and meal allowances\r\ncommunication with parents and within the kindergarten team\r\nclear electronic register of children and class book \r\nup to 100 hours saved per month \r\nall in accordance with the requirements of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs\r\nhigh data security thanks to the professional cloud platform Microsoft Azure\r\n\r\n\nParents and children are happier with Twigsee\r\nAs a parent, you must know the helplessness when the question \"What did you do today in kindergarten?\" your child always replies, \"Nothing.\" / \"I don't know.\" Every parent needs to know what's going on at preschool, what their child is doing, or what events the preschool is planning. And that's why Twigsee is here. Parents are informed about the daily activities, see photos from the day, get all the important information. \r\n \r\nBenefits for parents\r\nsending excuse slips directly from the phone\r\na clear online notice board with important information \r\nphotos of the day's activities\r\nall the information the parent receives is only about their child and the class they are in\n\n\r\n\r\nEXCUSES/ATTENDANCE\r\nExcusing children is a matter of a few clicks in the app. The parent sends the excuse directly from the phone, and a confirmation of its registration appears immediately. At the same time, it makes it quick and easy for the kindergarten to order the exact number of lunches and for the children to automatically recalculate the price of their meals and school fees. The nursery has an overview of absenteeism and attendance, which allows better capacity planning.\n\n\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION WITH PARENTS\r\nIf your children tell you that they have eaten pasta for the fourth lunch in a row, don't despair. Menus, curricula, home preparation, photos, experiences, progress, information about the daily joys and worries your children have encountered, you can see it all in Twigsee right on your phone. Photos from teachers tell you more than a thousand words. And yet a teacher only needs one click to send everything to one or more parents or even the whole class.\r\n \r\nCHILDREN'S REGISTER\r\nThe information filled in by parents during the admission process using the online form is directly stored in the child's register after admission. Important data is then easily accessible to the teachers. This includes details such as allergies, medical restrictions or information regarding pick-ups.\n\n\r\n\r\nENROLLING IN KINDERGARTEN\r\nStarting kindergarten normally involves dozens of sheets of filled-out forms and documents, consents and instructions. All this is a thing of the past with Twigsee. The parent fills in an online form and the necessary documents are generated automatically and with all the necessary details, in accordance with current legislation.\n\n\r\n\r\nREPORTING\r\n70% of the nursery management's work is taken up by administration, reporting and paperwork. Table after table, untidy folders and the associated error rate. With Twigsee you can throw away the stacks of sheets and clear your desk. Everything clearly in one system, automatically generated documentation, exports, filtering. Spend your time on what's most valuable, our children, and leave the paperwork to us.\n\n\r\n\r\nGDPR and DATA PROTECTION\r\nThe Twigsee app is fully GDPR compliant and ensures high data security."

      "label": "Aplikace Čeština pomáhá školákům a studentům procvičovat pravidla českého pravopisu a gramatiku. Obsahuje více než 5500 profesionálně vytvořených testových otázek rozdělených do více než 120 kategorií tak, jak se probírají ve škole.\n\nAplikace Čeština slouží jako doplněk při výuce, domácí přípravě nebo při přípravě na přijímací zkoušky na osmiletá i šestiletá gymnázia a střední školy. Středoškolákům pomůže zopakovat učivo českého jazyka při přípravě na maturitu. Pomáhá také při učení se češtiny jako cizího jazyka. Výběr otázek je možné ovlivnit v rozsahu učiva 1.–9. třídy základní školy nebo pomocí přidání jednotlivých kategorií mezi oblíbené.\n\nInteligentní procvičování\nAplikace Čeština chytře vybírá otázky takovým způsobem, aby studenti důkladně procvičili látku, ve které mají mezery. Otázky, ve kterých studenti dělají chyby, několikrát opakuje.\n\nDůkladné vysvětlení\nU naprosté většiny otázek je k dispozici vysvětlení daného jevu, které je v případě potřeby doplněné například i o vysvětlení významu méně častých slov nebo slovních spojení. \n\nPříprava na přijímací zkoušky\nSpeciální kategorie otázek je věnována přípravě na přijímací zkoušky. V této kategorii jsou otázky obsahově i formátem podobné těm, které se vyskytují v oficiálních testech. Otázky jsou vytvořeny tak, aby pokryly všechny gramatické jevy, které se v testech objevují, z oblasti pravopisu, slovní zásoby, skladby a tvarosloví. Aplikace dokáže vyhodnotit, v které látce žák nejčastěji chybuje, a doporučit ji k zopakování. Příprava na příjímačky je určena žákům hlásícím se na osmiletá gymnázia.\n\nPár otázek denně\nDoporučujeme naučit děti používat aplikaci Čeština denně. Po splnění denního cíle – obvykle to zabere jen 5 minut – jsou děti odměněny minihrou a mohou si samy vybrat, zda chtějí pokračovat v procvičování. V aplikaci také sbírají za pravidelné používání virtuální odměny. K otázkám z testů se lze zpětně vracet.\n\nNepotřebuje připojení na internet\nVeškerý obsah je přímo součástí aplikace Čeština, a aplikaci tak lze bez problémů používat i na zařízeních bez přístupu na internet.\n\nBez reklam\nAplikace Čeština je ve verzi zdarma omezena na 25 otázek týdně. Po odemknutí plné verze (nákup lze provést přímo v aplikaci) lze aplikaci používat bez omezení. Nákup se řídí obchodními podmínkami, které naleznete na https://yomio.cz/terms. Informace o ochraně soukromí jsou k dispozici na https://yomio.cz/privacy."

      "label": "We are a Ukrainian software developer creating apps for kids. We will continue in the hopes that there will soon be peace for our children and children all around the world!\n\nDrawing Academy from Bini Games (ex-Bini Bambini) is a unique app where kids are inspired to learn by drawing. In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain. As they draw, children process information in multiple ways, such as with their eyes and body, as well as emotionally. We created the Drawing Academy app with all this in mind.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- 150 step-by step drawing tutorials in 10 thematic sets with different complexity levels for kids aged 2 to 6\n- “ABC\" and \"Numbers” packs to get children interested in learning letters and numbers through drawing with pictures they make themselves\n- a huge variety of tools, including pencils, crayons, stickers, patterns, and paints\n- tracing and free-drawing mechanics to help prepare your child’s hand for writing with step-by-step motor-skill refinement, from the moment they first scribble to their finalized masterpieces\n- activities that form a customized age-based learning program, taking your child’s interests into account\n- unique easy-to-follow tracing exercises that guide your child’s creativity without limitations and stimulating free drawing\n\nDrawing Academy isn’t just another coloring book!\n\nNote: only part of the content in the screenshots is available in the free version of the application. To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy. Just download and go!\n\nA free 7-day trial period is available to you, or you can subscribe right after download.\n\nAfter your free trial, your subscription will automatically start unless you adjust your subscription settings at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n\nWe provide different subscription options for your convenience: monthly and annual subscription.\n\nIf you change your mind at any point, cancellation is easy through your iTunes settings.\n\nPayment for subscriptions will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nYour subscription automatically renews unless you turn the renewal feature off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n\nYou will be charged for renewal within 24 hours of the end of the current period.\n\nYou can cancel your subscription anytime through your Account Settings without any cancellation fees.\n\nYou can use your subscription on any device registered with your Apple ID.\n\nABOUT BINI GAMES \n\nBini Games (ex-Bini Bambini) was started in 2012 by four parents with experience in children's education. And today, we are a 250-people team of dedicated designers, artists, animators, and educators. To date, we have more than 30 apps, with our user base having reached 98M.\n\nWe are inspired by the idea of bringing fun into early education and enhancing a child's natural love of learning through educational apps for kids.\n\nIf you need help, have questions or just want to say “hi!”, get in touch at feedback@bini.games\nhttps://binibambini.com/terms-of-use/\nhttps://binibambini.com/privacy-policy/\n\nAll our games are safe, and do not collect any personal information."

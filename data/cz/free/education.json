Určena je pro rodiče, žáky a učitele na školách, kteří používají systém Bakaláři – programy pro školní administrativu. Aplikace umožňuje přístup k zobrazování známek, rozvrhu a suplování, domácích úkolů, absence, komunikaci mezi rodiči a školou a další informace podobně jako ve webové aplikaci. Učitelům umožňuje zadávat průběžnou klasifikaci.\n\nVýhody:\n- uživatel na svém zařízení může být připojen bez každodenního přihlašování\n- účtu možno přiřadit obrázek pro snadnější orientaci\n- pohodlné ovládání – vytvořeno přímo pro iOS\n- bezplatné používání\n- režim offline umožní prohlížet např. rozvrh a suplování bez nutnosti být stále připojen k internetu\n- pro rodiče pohodlné přepínání mezi účty více dětí i na různých školách, nebo pro situaci, kdy je učitel zároveň rodič\n- možnost převodu účtů ze starší aplikace\n- widget na plochu pro zobrazení aktuálního rozvrhu hodin\n- push notifikace pro KOMENS, domácí úkoly, známky\n\nPro přihlášení použijte adresu serveru získanou z URL řádku vašeho prohlížeče např. http://www.naseskola.cz/bakaweb, nebo v aplikaci vyberte ze seznamu škol. Login a heslo použijete stejné jako pro dosavadní internetovou verzi Bakalářů.\nAplikace může zobrazovat informativní sdělení třetích stran. Například žákům 9. tříd zobrazit zprávu o tom, že střední škola v jejich okolí má den otevřených dveří. Abychom tato sdělení mohli zobrazit konkrétní skupině uživatelů, potřebujeme využít některé informace, které o vás víme (ročník studia a vyučované předměty). Nejedná se ale o žádné citlivé údaje o vás. Na základě Obecného nařízení o ochraně osobních údajů (GDPR) od vás potřebujeme souhlas se zobrazením takovýchto cílených sdělení. Instalací aplikace s tímto vyjadřujete souhlas."

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

SolarVR allows you to literally visit and explore several stunning destinations in our solar system.\n\n- Be blown off by the Solar System Virtual Reality\n\nHave you ever been curious about the place where the Apollo 11 landed? What about the Curiosity rover? Does your mind often play with the thoughts of how the walking on the Moon or on the Mars feels like? Well, now nothing stands in the way of your thirst to explore.\n\n- Not enough?\n\nThere is also a possibility to visit ISS on its actual position. \nAnd furthermore you can scout the virtual night sky exactly as it looks like from your actual position. Pretty cool, right?\n\n- It works with and without VR glasses\n\nSolarVR operates best with the VR glasses, as it will provide the sensation of being directly in the space. If using VR glasses is not an option for you, this app will turn your phone into a direct window into the space and you can still enjoy similarly great views.\n\n- Note\n\nSolarVR is still in development, so you can look forward for new features and destinations to visit.\n\n- Please give us your feedback\n\nIf you like our app, or you have some ideas what would you like us to improve, please give our App a rating and a review. We would appreciate it :)"

      "label": "Twigsee for kindergarten management \r\nRoutine matters and day-to-day administration will no longer be a burden for either teachers or kindergarten managers. Twigsee handles it all. More than 85% of the organisational and administrative agenda of the kindergarten is taken care of. The kindergarten has all reports, printouts and information in one place. Communication with parents is easy and efficient, leading to satisfaction on all sides.\r\n \r\nBenefits for the kindergarten\r\ncomplete admissions process\r\nattendance and excuse records, which serve as the basis for automatic calculation of kindergarten fees and meal allowances\r\ncommunication with parents and within the kindergarten team\r\nclear electronic register of children and class book \r\nup to 100 hours saved per month \r\nall in accordance with the requirements of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs\r\nhigh data security thanks to the professional cloud platform Microsoft Azure\r\n\r\n\nParents and children are happier with Twigsee\r\nAs a parent, you must know the helplessness when the question \"What did you do today in kindergarten?\" your child always replies, \"Nothing.\" / \"I don't know.\" Every parent needs to know what's going on at preschool, what their child is doing, or what events the preschool is planning. And that's why Twigsee is here. Parents are informed about the daily activities, see photos from the day, get all the important information. \r\n \r\nBenefits for parents\r\nsending excuse slips directly from the phone\r\na clear online notice board with important information \r\nphotos of the day's activities\r\nall the information the parent receives is only about their child and the class they are in\n\n\r\n\r\nEXCUSES/ATTENDANCE\r\nExcusing children is a matter of a few clicks in the app. The parent sends the excuse directly from the phone, and a confirmation of its registration appears immediately. At the same time, it makes it quick and easy for the kindergarten to order the exact number of lunches and for the children to automatically recalculate the price of their meals and school fees. The nursery has an overview of absenteeism and attendance, which allows better capacity planning.\n\n\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION WITH PARENTS\r\nIf your children tell you that they have eaten pasta for the fourth lunch in a row, don't despair. Menus, curricula, home preparation, photos, experiences, progress, information about the daily joys and worries your children have encountered, you can see it all in Twigsee right on your phone. Photos from teachers tell you more than a thousand words. And yet a teacher only needs one click to send everything to one or more parents or even the whole class.\r\n \r\nCHILDREN'S REGISTER\r\nThe information filled in by parents during the admission process using the online form is directly stored in the child's register after admission. Important data is then easily accessible to the teachers. This includes details such as allergies, medical restrictions or information regarding pick-ups.\n\n\r\n\r\nENROLLING IN KINDERGARTEN\r\nStarting kindergarten normally involves dozens of sheets of filled-out forms and documents, consents and instructions. All this is a thing of the past with Twigsee. The parent fills in an online form and the necessary documents are generated automatically and with all the necessary details, in accordance with current legislation.\n\n\r\n\r\nREPORTING\r\n70% of the nursery management's work is taken up by administration, reporting and paperwork. Table after table, untidy folders and the associated error rate. With Twigsee you can throw away the stacks of sheets and clear your desk. Everything clearly in one system, automatically generated documentation, exports, filtering. Spend your time on what's most valuable, our children, and leave the paperwork to us.\n\n\r\n\r\nGDPR and DATA PROTECTION\r\nThe Twigsee app is fully GDPR compliant and ensures high data security."

Kurzy jsou akreditovány MŠMT a vytvořeny za podpory Evropského sociálního fondu. ***\n \nVybírejte z více než 100 kurzů a 6 jazyků - angličtiny, němčiny, francouzštiny, španělštiny, ruštiny a italštiny.\n \nZačněte jakýkoli kurz právě teď a vyzkoušejte si celou první kapitolu. Ani v placené části vůbec nic neriskujete, pokud vám kurz nebude vyhovovat, do 14 dní garantujeme vrácení peněz.\n\nONLINE jazyky jsou pro vás, pokud:\n \n• nemáte čas pravidelně docházet na kurz\n• máte práci na směny nebo v ní často cestujete\n• ve vašem okolí nejsou dostupné žádné vhodné jazykové kurzy\n• chcete se učit, kdy chcete a kde chcete, třeba z pohodlí vašeho gauče\n• nechcete zbytečně zameškávat hodiny, protože vám do toho něco vlezlo\n• nechcete na nikoho čekat, anebo vám vadí, že ostatní musí čekat na vás\n• nechcete mít žádné další výdaje na učebnice, dojíždění, parkování…\n• chcete studovat jazyky efektivně a více si zapamatovat\nzkrátka potřebujete, aby se kurz přizpůsobil vám, a ne vy jemu\n \nPojďte si hrát, bavit se a pilovat si u toho cizí jazyk.\n \nVítejte v jediném výukovém systému na světě, ve kterém studujete cizí jazyky podle zlatého pravidla 30 na 20 - pouze 30 % nové látky a jen 20 minut výuky denně. Studujte vaši dvacetiminutovku 5x týdně a 2 dny odpočívejte.\n \nUž se nebudete cítit zavaleni novou látkou, budete si ji postupně dávkovat. Systém se vám plně přizpůsobí a předloží vám látku k opakování podle toho, jak dobře jste si ji v předchozích dnech osvojili.\n \nNaučená slovíčka už nezapomenete, protože se je učíte řízeně. Systém si zapamatuje, jak dlouho jste se slovíčko učili a jak vám to šlo, a podle toho vám slovíčka nabízí k opakování.\n \nNenajdete tu žádný robotický obsah, naši lektoři pečlivě promysleli a připravili každou jednotlivou výukovou stránku. Učíte se jen to podstatné, co opravdu použijete.\n \nProcvičujete všechny jazykové dovednosti - poslech, porozumění, čtení, psaní, výslovnost, gramatiku i slovíčka.\n \nGramatiky už se nemusíte bát, vysvětlujeme ji tak, že ji opravdu pochopíte. Přehledně a srozumitelně.\n \nA co mluvení? V příplatkových lekcích se můžete spojit s našimi špičkovými lektory. Strach z mluvení odstraníte v konverzačních klubech, kde se v malé skupince maximálně 5 studentů osmělíte pod vedením milého lektora. Znalosti z online kurzu si pak můžete prohloubit soukromými skype lekcemi s lektorem nebo rodilým mluvčím.\n\nBavíte se motivačními prvky, které vám nedovolí skončit – natočili jsme pro vás zábavná motivační videa, přidali herní prvky a připravili 12 druhů cvičení. Nudit se rozhodně nebudete.\n \nUčení s ONLINE jazyky vám zajistí smysluplnou i smyslůplnou zábavu."

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain.

To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy.

      "label": "Twigsee for kindergarten management \r\nRoutine matters and day-to-day administration will no longer be a burden for either teachers or kindergarten managers. Twigsee handles it all. More than 85% of the organisational and administrative agenda of the kindergarten is taken care of. The kindergarten has all reports, printouts and information in one place. Communication with parents is easy and efficient, leading to satisfaction on all sides.\r\n \r\nBenefits for the kindergarten\r\ncomplete admissions process\r\nattendance and excuse records, which serve as the basis for automatic calculation of kindergarten fees and meal allowances\r\ncommunication with parents and within the kindergarten team\r\nclear electronic register of children and class book \r\nup to 100 hours saved per month \r\nall in accordance with the requirements of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs\r\nhigh data security thanks to the professional cloud platform Microsoft Azure\r\n\r\n\nParents and children are happier with Twigsee\r\nAs a parent, you must know the helplessness when the question \"What did you do today in kindergarten?\" your child always replies, \"Nothing.\" / \"I don't know.\" Every parent needs to know what's going on at preschool, what their child is doing, or what events the preschool is planning. And that's why Twigsee is here. Parents are informed about the daily activities, see photos from the day, get all the important information. \r\n \r\nBenefits for parents\r\nsending excuse slips directly from the phone\r\na clear online notice board with important information \r\nphotos of the day's activities\r\nall the information the parent receives is only about their child and the class they are in\n\n\r\n\r\nEXCUSES/ATTENDANCE\r\nExcusing children is a matter of a few clicks in the app. The parent sends the excuse directly from the phone, and a confirmation of its registration appears immediately. At the same time, it makes it quick and easy for the kindergarten to order the exact number of lunches and for the children to automatically recalculate the price of their meals and school fees. The nursery has an overview of absenteeism and attendance, which allows better capacity planning.\n\n\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION WITH PARENTS\r\nIf your children tell you that they have eaten pasta for the fourth lunch in a row, don't despair. Menus, curricula, home preparation, photos, experiences, progress, information about the daily joys and worries your children have encountered, you can see it all in Twigsee right on your phone. Photos from teachers tell you more than a thousand words. And yet a teacher only needs one click to send everything to one or more parents or even the whole class.\r\n \r\nCHILDREN'S REGISTER\r\nThe information filled in by parents during the admission process using the online form is directly stored in the child's register after admission. Important data is then easily accessible to the teachers. This includes details such as allergies, medical restrictions or information regarding pick-ups.\n\n\r\n\r\nENROLLING IN KINDERGARTEN\r\nStarting kindergarten normally involves dozens of sheets of filled-out forms and documents, consents and instructions. All this is a thing of the past with Twigsee. The parent fills in an online form and the necessary documents are generated automatically and with all the necessary details, in accordance with current legislation.\n\n\r\n\r\nREPORTING\r\n70% of the nursery management's work is taken up by administration, reporting and paperwork. Table after table, untidy folders and the associated error rate. With Twigsee you can throw away the stacks of sheets and clear your desk. Everything clearly in one system, automatically generated documentation, exports, filtering. Spend your time on what's most valuable, our children, and leave the paperwork to us.\n\n\r\n\r\nGDPR and DATA PROTECTION\r\nThe Twigsee app is fully GDPR compliant and ensures high data security."

The depth of our courses combined with the latest research in machine learning gets you using a language with high proficiency, fast.\n\nGET LEVEL PLACED FOR FREE - TRY LINGVIST\n\nLEARN 10 LANGUAGES: English, German, French, Dutch, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Estonian and Russian.\n\n=====\n\nWHY LINGVIST?\n\nFOLLOW CONVERSATIONS QUICKLY\nLearn the vocabulary that appears most often in a language first, allowing you to accelerate your learning.\n\nREAD, WRITE, SPEAK, AND LISTEN\nPerfect your pronunciation using sophisticated speech recognition technology or type your answers. Every sentence has audio to ensure you hone your listening skills.\n\nFOR SERIOUS LEARNERS\nYour learning efficiency is our focus. Enjoy a clean UI with no advertising, no unnecessary clicks, and no distractions.\n\nREMEMBER A LANGUAGE FOREVER\nUsing scientifically proven spaced repetition methodology, the vocabulary gets fixed in your long-term memory over time. You can even see your progress on increasing the intervals in the app.\n\nLEARN GRAMMAR IN CONTEXT OR AS A FOCUS\nAcquire grammar passively (inductive learning) like a native with our bite-sized sentences, or practice conjugating French verbs in our French course.\n\nSPECIALIST VOCABULARY FOR YOU\nSubmit your own words, images, or text and Lingvist will automatically gather vocabulary related to the theme for you to learn. Whether it’s Harry Potter in German, French nuclear physics, or Spanish colors, you can learn the words most important to you (available in some courses).\n\nMOTIVATIONAL STATISTICS\nPacked with data on your learning progress, you’ll be able to chart your path to success.\n\nA MUST-HAVE TOOL IN YOUR BAG\nDo you live in your target country, use a tutor or language school, or even read books, listen to podcasts, or watch content in your target language? Lingvist works best when used in parallel with other learning methods. It’s the difference between passing your test or acing it.\n\nLEARN BY DOING\nYou will learn vocabulary or conjugations (available in some courses) by “guessing” the answer. Getting it wrong is one of the fastest ways to learn, and your brain will start to remember very quickly.\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe playlist feature lets you listen to bite-sized sentences in hands-free mode.\n\nPERSONALIZED SETTINGS\nEvery learner is different. Personalize your learning to suit you, with various settings allowing you to learn with extra slow speech, strict diacritics, and even grammar tables.\n\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING PLAN\nWe'll serve you new words that are most relevant to you. As we measure your memory curves, we ask you to repeat words at the optimal time – just before you forget them. This way, you'll always know what to learn next.\n\nLANGUAGE LEARNING MADE EASY\nWhether you are planning on spending this summer in Italy and need to learn Italian, or your next adventure is taking up a course in Germany and you need an app to learn German, we have you covered. Our language learning techniques will help you to get fluent in over 9 languages.\n\n=====\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to the full learning materials for all languages we offer. Each subscription will be automatically renewed unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current payment period. When a subscription is canceled, access to the app's courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nVisit our blog to get tips, tricks, and interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Lingvist blog: https://lingvist.com/blog/\n\nFollow us to get interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/theLingvist\n▸▸ Instagram: instagram.com/thelingvist/\n▸▸ Twitter: https://twitter.com/lingvist\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://lingvist.com/privacy-policy/\nTerms of Use: https://lingvist.com/tos/"

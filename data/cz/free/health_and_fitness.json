      "label": "► ABOUT THE APP\n\nWewell is a free mobile app that helps users make informed decisions about the personal care products they purchase or use daily. It uses advanced analysis of ingredient data to generate a rating system that reflects the potential health impact of each product. Users can also create a skin profile to see how each product matches their skin type and interacts with their skin's specific conditions and characteristics. If a product has potentially harmful chemical components or does not fit the user's skin profile, Wewell offers a selection of similar, healthier alternatives.\n\nWewell brings missing transparency to the beauty and personal care industry.\n\n► INDEPENDENCE\n\nWewell operates with complete independence from any brand or manufacturer, ensuring that evaluations are based purely on the ingredients contained in each product. This means that users can trust the ratings and recommendations provided by the app as objective and unbiased.\n\n► AD-FREE\n\nWewell is completely ad-free, eliminating the frustration and distraction of in-app advertising. Users can scan products and receive ratings without interruptions or delays.\n\n► IN-APP SUPPORT\n\nWewell is committed to providing an exceptional user experience and constantly strives to improve the app's capabilities. To that end, the app features an in-app support chat, allowing users to provide feedback and receive a response within a matter of minutes. We appreciate and value your input!\n\n● THANK YOU ●\n\n---\n\nTerms of use: https://wewell.app/document/eula"

Máte doma ingredience a nevíte co z ní připravit? Vyzkoušejte funkci na hledání receptu podle ingredience. Nechybí ani vyhledávání dle typu jídla, ukládání receptů či jejich hodnocení.\n\nU každého receptu je uveden čas přípravy, obtížnost a také nutriční informace. Máte tak detailní přehled o tom, co konzumujete.\n\nSoučástí mobilní aplikace je také e-shop s vybranými produkty, které autoři receptů používají pro jejich přípravu. V kuchyni se vždy snažíme skloubit kvalitu, cenu a nestárnoucí design. Stejně tak jako na udržitelné stravování, myslíme na udržitelné vybavení, které nemusíte každý rok měnit. Na e-shopu tedy najdete menší množství produktů a značek, s kterými si ale v kuchyni snadno vystačíte a budete tak mít vše, co potřebujete :)\n\nV e-shopu je možné zakoupit také tištěné kuchařky, které pocházejí ze stejného pera jako recepty v aplikaci. V kuchařkách navíc najdete exkluzivní recepty, které v aplikaci nejsou. Pokud tak milujete vůni knih, rádi vaříte podle kuchařek a nebo chcete někomu udělat radost, knižní Jíme zdravě je tou správnou volbou.\n\nTěšíme se na vás! :)"

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

For each night you get a straightforward report of how long you slept and how restful you were during the night.\n\nAUTOMATIC MODE:\n \nSimply wear your Apple Watch overnight and each morning Sleep++ will analyze your sleep and give you a report about how long and restfully you slept.  \n\nMANUAL MODE:\n\nIf you want to have more precise control over the start/end time of each night recorded you can also use manual sleep tracking.  This is also useful if your nightly routine makes it difficult for Sleep++ to determine when you went to bed. \n\n1) Wear your Apple Watch while you sleep.\n2) Tell Sleep++ when you start sleeping.\n3) Tell Sleep++ when you wake up.\n\nNOTES:\n\nSleep++ integrates with the Health App providing you a safe and private way to share your activity data with Sleep++.  This data is used for automatic sleep tracking.  You can also optionally have Sleep++ save your Sleep Analysis into your Health database after each night."

    "summary": {
      "label": "The app has five basic modules: depression, anxiety & panic attacks, self-harm, suicidal thoughts and professional help resources.\n\nThe module DEPRESSION contains the WHAT CAN HELP ME feature, including suggestions that could help the user feel better (e.g. exercise, meditation, listening to music, watching videos, drawing, guided relaxation). ACTIVITY PLANNER, which motivates the user to create a to-do list of tasks (check off, edit or delete the accomplished goals anytime) and WHAT MADE ME HAPPY to help the individual focus on the positives of the past day.\n\nThe module ANXIETY & PANIC ATTACKS aims on helping the user overcome intense feelings of anxiety and panic attacks. It includes two types of breathing exercises, designed to immediately help the individual to calm down. The first exercise focuses on deep breathing only – switching between inhaling and exhaling. The second exercise is focused on the ‚box breathing‘ technique– full inhale, holding your breath, full exhale and again holding your breath.\n\nAnother feature included in this module is COUNTING of simple mathematical equations to help the user focus on something other than the anxious thoughts and physical reactions that accompany each panic attack. The equations are automatically generated and include addition, subtraction and multiplication of numbers 0 to 9, and are immediately corrected. The last feature in this module includes more suggestions on what to do when feeling anxious\n\nThe module SELF HARM tries to distract from the urges. Once again it provides two breathing exercises. The feature WHAT CAN HELP ME includes suggestions what to do instead of hurting yourself (take an ice-cube or red marker and move it across your skin where you would usually hurt yourself, write down your emotions and describe how you feel and then destroy the piece of paper, scream, exercise or try to diffuse the intense emotions through painting or guided relaxation).\n\nThe SUICIDAL THOUGHTS module provides a list of reasons and activities and which could prevent the thoughts or at least show the value of one‘s life. The users create their own EMERGENCY PLANS. The app enables the user to make list of safe activities as an alternative scenario to follow in crisis. The plan includes: who will I contact, what will I say/write, what will I do or where will I go in case of an emergency. It is ideal to create the plan when one is able to think rationally or with the help of another person. This feature also includes a list of people who care about the individual and would potentially be hurt by his actions.\n\nIn the REASONS TO STAY ALIVE section, users can create a list of people, things and activities they like or care about enough to stop them from committing suicide. There are a few default entries in the list for users to have an idea what kind of reasons they might put in. And again – the breathing exercises are included in the SUICIDAL THOUGHT module.\n\nIn the last module – PROFESSIONAL HELP RESOURCES – there is a list of phone numbers with the option of directly calling the ambulance, hot lines and crisis centres. We also included links to chat rooms in case anyone prefers typing over speaking.\n\nThis app is here for anyone who needs an urgent help in case of depression, anxiety or other issues. The app offers help but it doesn’t replace a consultation with qualified doctor or other specialist. It’s necessary to seek professional help when the situation gets worse. If the app doesn’t help or if you’re unsure whether it has a positive influence on your mental health, please consult its using with your doctor.\nThe advice provided in this application comes from professional practice and is also available in the following sources: \nhttps://positivepsychology.com/anxiety-coping-skills/\nhttps://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/self-harm/helping-yourself-now/\n\nThe app is open-source with source codes available here: https://github.com/ichlubna/mind"

      "label": "This app is the remote control for all Lovense wearable toys. \n\nDesigned for:\n1.\tSolo Play\n2.\tDiscreet Public Play\n3.\tLong Distance Play\n\nUse one smartphone for close range control, syncing vibrations to music, and sound activated vibrations (uses your phone's microphone).  Range for close range control is up to 30 feet when you have a direct line of sight. 360° range is between 5-10 feet, based on your surroundings.\n\nUse two smartphones to drastically increase your partner's control range. This is perfect for those wanting discreet public play within larger spaces. Simply connect with your partner's phone within the app and give up control! The person with a toy should have their smartphone within 3-5 feet of them at all times. The app can run in the background, so it can be in your purse or pocket while your partner has complete control via their smartphone. This feature is also great for long distance couples. \n\nYou also have the ability to create your own vibration patterns. Our fun tap and slide control interface makes it easy to make unique patterns. Our powerful vibration motor allows a large range of possibilities. After creating a pattern, you can share it (anonymously) with the world. Take a look at the vibration patterns already uploaded and download the ones you like! \n\nOther Settings (must select for each partner):\n-\tGive full control to some (don't need to continually allow them to gain control)\n-\tVibration notifications during text messages\n-\tNotifications when you partner logs into the app\n-\tAuto-play a pattern when it’s sent to you\n\nNot seeing a feature you would like? Contact us at support@lovense.com! Our full time development team would love to incorporate your suggestions into our app."

Upgrade to a Strong PRO subscription ($4.99/month or $29.99/year) for an unlimited number of routines and to unlock additional PRO features.\n\nStrong will automatically charge your iTunes Account at the end of your subscription or free trial period unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of your current period. Subscriptions renew at the original price. You can turn off auto-renew at any time and still receive full functionality until the end of your current period, but no refund can be provided for unused portions of the subscription. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nIf you’ve previously purchased “Unlock Strong” or “Strong Combo Pack”, you’ll be able to use the Restore Purchases option in the app for access to all Strong PRO features.\n\nThese prices are for customers in the United States and may vary depending on your iTunes Account settings.

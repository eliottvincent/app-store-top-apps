Náladu si můžeš uložit mezi své vlastní.\n\nPoslouchej žánry\nVyber si z 80 žánrů a poslouchej, co miluješ.\n\nPoslouchej svoje osobní hity\nTvoje nálada #mojeHity obsahuje písničky, kterým dáváš palec nahoru a o kterých si myslíme, že by se ti mohly líbit. Sdílej svůj osobní mix s hashtagem #mojeHity.\nVyzkoušej osobní náladu #mojeNovinky – písničky nově přidané do Youradia, o kterých si myslíme, že je chceš slyšet.\n\n\nA jak ti Youradio ulehčí poslech hudby?\nSoustředíme se na výběry jen nejlepších songů. Není pro nás důležité mít každý song v katalogu, protože hodně songů není dobrých. Neznamená to, že bychom měli jen populární hudbu, naopak nabízíme i mixy pro náročnější posluchače.\n\nTím, že víme, co posloucháš, můžeme ti nabízet hity nebo novinky přímo pro tebe. Každý posluchač je jiný, musíme mu nabídnout správnou hudbu, která se mu bude líbit.\n\nNemusíš řešit nahrávání hudby z PC do mobilu každou chvíli.\nHudba ti nebude zabírat tolik místa, jako když jí nahráváš do mobilu.\n\nPokud nevíš, co přesně poslouchat, nech se inspirovat našimi mixy, nebo si jen vyber žánr či interpreta, kterého miluješ a nech se inspirovat.\n\nJednoduché ovládání – Youradio hraje jinak než rádia, ale je stejně snadné jej ovládat.\n\n\nVíce o Youradiu\nhttps://www.youradio.cz/about\n\n\n\nYouradio Premium za 89 Kč/měsíčně ti navíc nabízí\n• 180 minut hudby na cesty pro poslech offline bez připojení k internetu.\n• Song si můžeš pausnout\n• Hudba i aplikace jsou bez reklam\n\n\nMáš 30 dnů na otestování prémiové verze.\n\nOchrana osobních údajů (Privacy policy): https://www.youradio.cz/terms\nPodmínky použití (Terms of use): https://www.youradio.cz/terms\n\n\nMěsíční předplatné pro Premium Verzi\nPouze pro Českou Republiku 89 Kč\n\nPořiď si měsíční předplatné Youradio Premium prostřednictvím aplikace.

SA Contacts protects you from iTunes sync accidents which can delete your contacts if, for example, you no longer have access to an Exchange server.\n5. Restoring or changing contacts from the spreadsheet is as simple as uploading the file to your phone via USB, email or web. It couldn't be easier.\n6. You can print a hardcopy of your iPhone contacts. \n7. You can now export iPhone contacts to an Excel file which can then be imported to Outlook Contacts directly. \n8. You can also import contacts from an Excel file that has been exported from Outlook to your iPhone.\n9. You can now export/import iPhone contacts to/from a Gmail CSV-format file(UTF-8 encoded or Unicode encoded).\n10. You can upload export files over to Dropbox/GoogleDrive or download import files from Dropbox/GoogleDrive.\n11. You can password protect your export file.\n12. All Contact fields except Ringtones can be exported/imported.\n13. You can organise your contacts into groups easily on a spreadsheet and also assign a contact to multiple groups.\n14.

The date and start odometer are entered automatically.\n \nThere are no pretty graphs, fancy reports or a multitude of settings, just simple, quick entries.\n \nAll entries can be exported to a CSV file for manipulation (graphs and wiz-bang formulas) in a spreadsheet.\n\nFeatures details:\n- Add entries for each trip including distance, places, reasons and general notes.\n- 1 to 3 taps for a new entry\n- Include start and end times, if required\n- Export to CSV\n- PDF by month, last month, last 3 months, last year, or all\n- Email CSV and PDF\n- Popup monthly summaries"

In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

This implies you need to make sure that your ESX hosts have IP addresses that are *routable*, otherwise you will not be able to access the VNC console. IPs in the form 10.x.x.x or 192.168.x.x are *not* routable, if your ESX has one of these, you will not be able to access the console through vCenter. Even if the IPs are routable, you need to make sure that the port configured (in the range 5900-5909) is allowed through your firewall for each ESX device you want to connect to.\n\nIn case of a stand-alone ESX(i), a private IP can be used, but the port(s) needs to be forwarded in a similar manner (E.g. if your ESX has IP address 192.168.1.100 and your Internet-facing IP address is say 1.2.3.4, you need to make sure both the SSL port (443) and the VNC ports used (5900-5909) are being forwarded to the *same* IP address - 1.2.3.4:443 -> 192.168.1.100:443 and 1.2.3.4:(5900-5909) -> 192.168.1.100:(5900-5909).\n\nFurthermore, please make note of the fact that only the 8-character password is encrypted with the standard VNC client. All VNC client traffic is sent unencrypted across the network. If security is a concern in your organization, you need to be aware of this. You can disable your VNC terminal once you are done with the Console session (use Configure Console and disable VNC altogether).\n\nVMWare Tools needs to be installed on each and every VM that is monitored through iVMControl's console connection. Check the Vmware knowledge base on other requirements:\n\nhttp://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=1246\nMake sure you enable gdbserver through the FW, e.g.\nhttps://www.unixarena.com/2014/02/configuring-vmware-esxi-virtual-machine-console-vnc.html/\n\nUsage:\n- Single click, pan and zoom are standard as any iPhone application\n- Tap with two fingers for right click\n- Ctrl-Alt-Del button sends a Ctrl-Alt-Del sequence to the VM\n- Keyboard button will raise/lower the keyboard.\n\n** NOTE ** VMware decided to offer read-only access to the management APIs for the *FREE* version of ESXi. This applies to all management applications, and is enforced by VMware. What this means for iVMControl is that if you have a FREE ESXi, you will be able to use only the 'read-only' (monitoring) functions of iVMControl."

      "label": "This application offers a unique approach to project management, which represents your project not just as a plan, but as a coordinated mechanism moving towards the goal. \n\nThe original technique allows you to break down project objectives into smaller goals, processes and resources, but not get lost in the details, but always see the overall structure of the project as a whole. After all, project management is not a mechanical observance of the plan, but the achievement of project goals, which should not be overlooked.\n\nThe application combines the classic project approach based on Gantt charts and project management through workflow diagrams. As a rule, Gantt charts are ideal for presenting project schedules, but they are not so convenient for reflecting the complex structure of the relationship between processes, goals and resources.\n\nMore formally, the program allows you to build a customized, based on the BPMN notation, PERT diagram of the project (with events and processes at nodes). Then this description of the project is used to generate a Gantt chart and track the progress of the project. \n\nSo, inShort is a powerful project and business process management tool, which can be applied not only in office but also for personal purposes. You can further explore the capabilities of the program with the detailed interactive User Guide.\n\nKey features of the application: \n• Building the diagram of processes and resources of the project (PERT network diagram of the project, based on BPMN notation). \n• The ability to drill down the elements of workflow diagrams. \n• Tracking the execution of the project. \n• Integration with the standard Calendar.\n• Displaying the list of project tasks in the form of a Gantt chart. \n• Separation of physical and information flows of the project. \n• Ability to specify the expected time of execution, both directly and parametrically. \n• Export of charts into PDF files and OPML outlines.\n• Project management according to the methodology of the Theory of Constraints. \n• Working calendars taking into account various schedules of work for implementation of tasks. \n• Work resources and their assignment to tasks. \n• Queues of tasks: organize the work with active tasks in accordance with the elements of the GTD methodology.\n• Checklists for diagrams — monitor the sequence of actions for project management step by step.\n\nAdvanced features of project management in accordance with the Theory of Constraints technique: \n• finding the critical path; \n• positioning of time buffers of the project; \n• calculation of buffer sizes; \n• calculation of late starts for feeding paths of the project; \n• tracking of time indicators during project execution. \n\n***\ninShort Pro — application version for experienced and advanced users, contains advanced and service functions useful for in-depth work with diagrams.\nFunctions included in inShort Pro:\n• Working with layers of diagrams;\n• inReview: publications of user diagrams surveys by experienced project managers, indicating successful findings and weaknesses in the diagrams. The procedure for sending diagrams for analysis is described in the Terms of Use.\n\nThe inShort Pro version is available by monthly subscription. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\ninShort Pro Subscription Terms of Use link: http://www.shortki.com/inShort/proTerms.html\n***\n\nCannot solve a problem? Draw it inShort and sort things out with it there. It's like voodoo but it works."

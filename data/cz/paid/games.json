Pokuste se kontaktovat všechny své agenty pomocí jednoslovných nápověd dřív, než se to povede soupeřům. Ale dejte si pozor! Setkání s nájemným vrahem zhatí všechnu vaši snahu.\n\nINSPIROVÁNO DESKOHERNÍM BESTSELLEREM\nKrycí jména vychází ze stejnojmenné deskové hry, která byla přeložena do 45 jazyků a získala 29 mezinárodních ocenění, včetně “deskoherního Oscara” v podobě Spiel des Jahres nebo české ceny Hra roku.\n\nZÁBAVNĚJŠÍ NEŽ KDY DŘÍV\nDíky celé řadě zajímavých vylepšení, odměn, nových herních módů, tematických slovních balíčků nebo speciálních slovních misí vám Krycí jména nabídnou ještě víc zábavy než kdy předtím.\n\nHRAJTE KDYKOLIV A KDEKOLIV\nSystém asynchronního multiplayeru vám dovoluje hrát s ostatními hráči i ve chvíli, kdy nejsou online. Hrajte společně s dalšími agenty, ať jsou kdekoliv, nebo se jednoduše pusťte do hry se svými přáteli. Postavte se denním výzvám a trénujte své agentské schopnosti.\n\nSTAŇTE SE ELITNÍM AGENTEM\nZa správného agenta mluví především jeho činy. Kontaktujte své agenty dříve než protihráči, řešte pravidelné denní výzvy a vymýšlejte ty nejlepší nápovědy pro ostatní hráče. Budujte si pověst elitního tajného agenta, pronikněte do tajů života špiónů. A kdo ví, možná získáte i vlastní tajnou agentskou skrýš.\n\nBAVTE SE S PŘÁTELI\nVyzvěte na souboj své kamarády, nebo se utkejte se náhodnými cizinci díky našemu unikátnímu systému párování hráčů. Ať se rozhodnete pro cokoliv, nezapomeňte, že nově odemčené herní módy či svou unikátní sbírku slov můžete kdykoliv využít při hře s přáteli."

Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription.\n\nThe payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and the subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, at the subscription price option you have previously selected.\n\nYour subscription can be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. There is also a button in-game that take you to these settings.

      "label": "New version of the multi-awarded board game. Now in 3D. Includes improved AI, 3D landscape, new exclusive features.\n\n*** Carcassonne fits that opening game niche that every game group needs. -Tyler Nichols, Board Game Quest\n*** Carcassonne = Great game, great mechanics, great pieces, great fun! -The Board Game Family\n\nA TILE PLACEMENT GAME OF CREATING LANDSCAPES, CLAIMING AREAS, AND GAINING POINTS\nDiscover or re-discover Carcassonne, the multi-awarded tile-based game in which players draw and place their tiles to build a medieval city. Place your cities, roads, abbeys or fields to enlarge your landscape, then place your followers, the meeples. Knights, robbers or farmers... Each meeple will help you control your territory and win points.\nBut be careful, you will need all your best strategy and tactics to maximum your points! Place your tiles and your meeples wisely to stop your opponents and win the game.\n\n6 EXPANSIONS: ENLARGE YOUR LANDSCAPE AND OPTIMIZE YOUR POINTS\nThanks to the mini expansions \"\"The River\"\" and \"\"The Abbot\"\", you can embellish your landscape and vary your game to enjoy new ways to play! Double or even triple your points thanks to the new buildings in the Inns & Cathedrals expansion! And with the Traders & Builders expansion, score more points with the trading commodities and build faster with the builders! Discover the city of Carcassonne covered with a blanket of white snow in the Winter Edition... and look out for the Gingerbread Man and the bonus points he'll give you! Beware of the Dragon in \"\"the Princess and the Dragon\"\" expansion! He could eat your Meeples if you're not cautious. And be kind with the Princess: she might prefer you to other Meeples and toss them out of the cities!\n\nFEATURES\n• Accessible and tactical gameplay adapted from the award-winning Carcassonne board game    \n• 6 expansions:\n- The River, the Inns & Cathedrals, the Traders & Builders, the Winter Edition and Princess & Dragon are all available to purchase from the Game Shop.\n- Unlock The Abbot for free using your Asmodee account.\n• Up to 6 players! Play against the computer in solo mode, face off your friends in Pass and Play or challenge players from around the world in online mode\n• There is no more 3 but 4 different behaviors you can chose before starting a game with AIs. They all propose a better challenge than the previous ones. Players who want to experiment a true challenge will play against the Conqueror AI who is the strongest AI of the game.\n• Try out the aerial top view to refine your strategy!\n• Additional strategic layers compared to the physical version:\n- field view which allows you to see the field possession of each player\n- remaining tile list: allows you to see the tiles which are remaining in the draw pile\n\nLanguages available: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish\n\nYou can follow us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and You Tube!\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/asmodeedigital/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/asmodeedigital\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/asmodeedigital/\nYou Tube: https://www.youtube.com/asmodeedigital"

      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.

Under her rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This Alliance will seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance’s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.\n\nMeanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright.\n\nThe stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately take root."

      "label": "Papa's Burgeria is now available to play on the go, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.  Grill, stack, and serve burgers in a brand-new way!  \r\n\r\nYou're left in charge of Papa Louie's famous Burgeria, where you'll learn to take orders, grill patties, add toppings, and serve burgers to all of your crazy customers.  You need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls that feel just right in the palm of your hand: Head to the Order Station to keep an eye out for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Grill Station to drag patties onto the grill and flip burgers to cook them evenly.  Jump to the Build Station to carefully craft your sandwiches with toppings and sauces exactly how they ordered, and deliver the finished burger to earn points and tips!\r\n\r\nEach Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the burger-building process.  With full multi-touch support, the process is more fun than ever before!  Tap many burgers at once to flip them all on the grill, or keep one finger on the Build Station's bin slider for even better precision when building.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up. As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Burgeria!  Papa's Burgeria To Go also features unlockable toppings that aren't available in previous versions!\r\n\r\n**NEW FOR PAPA'S BURGERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  Use buttons in the top corners to switch Order Tickets without having to drag them back and forth.  You can also view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nGRILL STATION - We've made keeping track of your burgers easier than ever, with Timers stuck in each burger patty that you can read at a glance, showing the cooking time and how each side is cooked.  You can also buy Alarms in the Shop to add onto each Timer, so you'll get an alert when it's time to flip or remove a burger.  With multi-touch support, you can quickly flip and remove burgers by using multiple fingers.  Try a triple-tap to flip three patties in a row!\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - With a traditional drag-and-drop system, your finger would block your view, so we've completely changed the Build Station to work on smaller screens.  You'll swipe a carousel of Topping Bins across the top of the screen, and slide it carefully to line up toppings with the burger below.  Simply tap on the bottom of the screen to drop a topping from the bin above!  You can also tap a button to swap your Topping Bins with Burger Bins, which hold all of the patties you've cooked on the grill.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the bottom of the screen, so stacking burgers is a breeze!\r\n\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on burger shop game in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between grilling, stacking, and serving\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- Over 60 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- Over 50 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out the original \"Papa's Burgeria\" for iPad!"

Some of its key features are:\r\n- Create multiple parties to maintain the state of multiple campaigns at once.\r\n- Allow for multiple devices to synchronize at the same time, allowing remote play, or everyone around the table to see all stats without sharing their device.\r\n- Choose which scenario the group wants to play, and the application will automatically set up all the monster stats, monster ability decks, and loot deck for that scenario.\r\n- Mark each scenario as started or completed, and track your progress.\r\n- The application supports opening sections in a scenario. Doing so will automatically instantiate the monsters (normal & elite) in that section.\r\n- At any point you can draw from the Monster or Ally Attack Modifier deck, or from an extra Boss deck.\r\n- Input the initiative of your heroes and draw Monster Ability cards for each of the monsters. Heroes and enemies will automatically be sorted by initiative, and the ability cards of each monster drawn and revealed.\r\n- Support for auto calculations of move and attack values on Monster Ability Cards.\r\n- Maintains the hp, xp, loot, and the various conditions of each of your heroes and monsters easily.\r\n- Create Summons from your Hero, and track their various statistics.\r\n- Create NPCs and set their name and hp, as well as their conditions. You can also input their initiative or snooze them.\r\n- Maintains the status of the 6 Elements.\r\n- Stop at any point, and resume your session in the state it was when you left.\r\n- Undo or redo any actions between each round.\r\n- If you do not want to input player initiatives, you can disable player initiative or even hide players.\r\n- If you do not want to play a pre-made scenario, create your own custom session by adding any monsters from the game.\r\n- The app takes into account the majority of the scenario and sections special cards and hp for monsters."

Set across three continents during the turbulent Middle Ages, spectacular conflicts and scheming rivals line the path to power as the great kingdoms of the medieval world vie for supremacy. Be it through diplomacy or conquest, trade or subterfuge, you must secure the resources and loyalty required to rule an empire from the shores of Western Europe to the sands of Arabia.\n\nTHE STRENGTH OF NATIONS\nUnlock up to 17 playable factions and build them into major world powers through statecraft, subterfuge or all-out war.\n\nTHE KINGDOMS EXPANSION\nAvailable via in-app purchase, this massive expansion includes 24 playable factions across four unique, fully featured campaigns. Wage war from the jungles of the Americas to the deserts of the Holy Land, from the deceptively gentle shores of the British Isles to the frigid Baltic plains.\n\nTHE ART OF WAR\nDeploy infantry, archers and cavalry into huge real-time battles, with a full range of medieval weaponry at your command.\n\nTHE TOOLS OF STATE\nUse sophisticated diplomacy, lucrative trade agreements and daring agents to forge alliances or destabilise your rivals.\n\nTHE TEST OF TIME\nShape the destinies of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East through five momentous centuries of combat, competition and conquest.\n\nTHE POWER IN YOUR HANDS\nTake command, with a brand-new user interface and enhanced touch controls for fingertip control of the battlefield. Or, play with any iPadOS-compatible mouse & keyboard.\n\n===\n\nTotal War: MEDIEVAL II requires 4.3GB of free space.

Play 40 different levels, and build bridges over deep valleys, canals, and rivers. Stress tests reveal whether the bridge you build can withstand the daily stress of continual use from cars, trucks and, more recently, super-heavy tank trucks.\n\nYou can choose from a range of materials for each individual bridge, such as wood, steel, cables, or concrete pillars. Use the appropriate materials and stay within budget to build the perfect bridge. The choice of different materials means that there are numerous solutions and approaches and you can build each bridge in any number of ways – your budget is the only limit. The refined grid system allows you to realise your idea of the perfect bridge with even more precision. Let your imagination and creativity run free! And if you happen to run into a dead end, you can pick up valuable tips from the brand new help system! \n\nAwesome Add-Ons: SlopeMania & Trains\n\nIn the SlopeMania add-on you find yourself on the Tiltin Islands, home to three brand new islands where you'll even be building your bridges inside colorful grottoes! The 24 tricky, never-before-seen levels will have you using sloping lanes to overcome the massive height differences. The \"Crazy Levels\" are the real brainteasers and require out-of-the-box thinking and unusual solutions.  \n\nPurchase the Trains add-on and get the Choonited Kingdom island group, with a total of 18 new levels across three islands. Build massive bridges that can withstand the enormous weight of the two new vehicles on offer – a commuter train and a heavily loaded freight train. The idyllic and beautifully designed landscapes will make the heart of every railroad fanatic skip a beat.\n\n\"Trains\" and \"SlopeMania\" are now available at an affordable price as an in-app purchase!\n\nFEATURES:\n•             40 Levels on the island nation of Camatuga\n•             Free build mode and help system\n•             5 Settings: city, canyon, beach, mountains, hills\n•             Improved grid system  \n•             Map with unlocked worlds/levels\n•             4 different building materials: wood, steel, cables, concrete pillars\n•             Color coded load indicator for different building materials\n•             Three different load bearing levels: car, truck and tank truck\n•             High score per level\n•             Facebook connection (upload screenshots and bridge scores)\n\nFEATURES SlopeMania Add-On\n•             Completely new Tiltin Islands\n•             Option to build sloping roads – even for Camatuga\n•             Additional \"Grotto\" setting\n•             24 \"sloping\" levels inc. especially tricky \"Crazy Levels\"\n•             Explosive tank truck as an exciting new vehicle\n\nFEATURES Trains Add-On\n•             Open up 3 new islands with 18 new levels.\n•             Build bridges for modern commuter trains and heavy freight trains!\n•             New scenery: Enjoy the view of picturesque mountains and ravines!\n\n\nOS 7 or higher required"

      "label": "With 20 millions of downloads worldwide Real Drift Car Racing is the most realistic drift game on mobile devices, and yet easy to control and fun to play thanks to an innovative drift helper.\r\nGet ready to drive high performance cars (turbo or naturally aspirated) and make them drift at high speed in tracks designed specifically for drift racing.\r\nImprove your racing and drifting skills and earn virtual money to tune and customize your car.\r\nRace to battle the world record of the leaderboard or just for fun in the freeride mode.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n• The most realistic drift racing simulation on mobile devices;\r\n• Customizable difficulty: from total novice to professional drifter;\r\n• Extensive customization options: change body color, body vinyl, rims model, rims color and tire signature;\r\n• Extensive tuning options: increase engine power, add a turbo, change handling settings (weight distribution, camber angle etc.), change gear ratios and shift speed;\r\n• Photo mode to share your coolest drifts with your friends;\r\n• Realistic simulation of all aspect (engine, drivetrain, tires, etc.) of the car;\r\n• Specific engine sound for every car with turbo whistle and blow off valve;\r\n• Backfire effects with sounds;\r\n• Accurate points calculation: earn points by drifting at high speed, at high drift angle and, by light touching walls during a drift;\r\n• Online and local leaderboard to challenge your friends and people all over the world;\r\n• Big training track to improve your drifting and racing skills;\r\n• Cool dubstep soundtrack by Liquid Stranger and Simplify Recordings.\r\n• 35 racing tracks specifically designed for drifting;\r\n• 19 different cars with specific and realistic setup;\r\n• Challenging career mode with 38 championships with growing difficulty;\r\n\r\n\r\nGAMEPLAY\r\n• Accelerometer (gyroscope) or touch steering mode;\r\n• Slider or touch throttle;\r\n• Automatic or manual transmission;\r\n• Metric or Imperial units of measurement;\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANCED POINTS SYSTEM\r\nPoints grow proportionally to drift angle, drift time and speed.\r\nThere are also 2 different points multiplier: \"Drift Combo\" multiplier and \"Proximity\" multiplier.\r\nDrift Combo multiplier is increased by 1 whenever points reach a power of 2000 (1000, 2000,4000, 8000 etc.). If you change drift direction, points are added to Total Points Indicator (located in the top left of the screen) and reset. If points reach every multiple of 2000 again, Drift Combo is increased by 1 again. This works only if you keep drifting without too long interruptions between one drift and the other (less than 1 second), otherwise Drift Combo multiplier will be reset to 1.\r\nProximity multiplier is increased when you drift with the back of the car near a wall (less than 1.5 meters) proportionally to closeness. You'll notice this bonus with a slow motion effect and a text showing the multiplier factor.\r\nIf you hit anything you'll lose your partial points and all multipliers.\r\n\r\nWe will update and improve Real Drift constantly. Please rate and give your feedback for further improvement of the game.\r\nFOLLOW US\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Real-Drift/788082697884714"

Players control members of the Night Chasers, a group of heroic warriors, as they embark on an adventure to save their lands from an evil threat.\n\n[Game Features]\n◆ Thrilling match-3 battle experiences\nMatch three Emblems to clear them from the board and make your heroes attack. Clear four or more to generate Magic Emblems, allowing your heroes to unleash powerful skills. Perform combos to launch even more powerful attacks and vanquish your enemies!\n\n◆ Traditional Japanese-style RPG experience\nIn a world of magic and swordplay, players will control members of the Night Chasers as they embark on an adventure together. Enter deep caves, explore ancient ruins, unlock treasure chests, fight against ferocious monsters, upgrade your equipment in town, and gain new information from villagers in the local taverns. A exciting RPG experience is waiting for you in Hero Emblems II!\n\n◆ Substitute Heroes\nEach Hero possesses their own unique skills and backstory. There's Zack, the Human Warrior; Lucien, the Marten Knight; Sid, the Felinian Black Mage; Abner the Bard, and many more! Lead your favorite heroes into battle!\n\n◆ Thrilling Japanese character voices in battles\nPersonalized character voices make combat a thrilling, intense and fun experience!\n\n◆ More equipment\nEnemies attack with a wide range of debuffs such as Poison, Ignition, Petrification or Curses. To fight against these tough opponents, you will need to choose your Heroes'  weapons and armor carefully, and make good use of accessories to resist enemy debuffs and boost your Heroes' abilities!\n\n◆One-time payment, IAP-free, and ad-free\n\n\nA New Chapter in the Night Chasers' History\nA long time ago, there was a mercenary group known as the Night Chasers. Instead of making money, these heroic warriors went around helping those in need. During the war, they helped a great many people who were suffering under tyranny and injustice. However, in the ensuing age of peace, the Night Chasers were no longer needed, and were forced to disband.

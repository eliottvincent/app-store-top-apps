You just need to select the note to play on the C key of the keyboard.\n\nHarmonium contains two sound flavours : \n- Traditional Harmonium, with deep sound of original reeds\n- Modern flute organ, simpler, heavenly \n\nEach sound flavour has a simple set of reeds, or double (with octave).\n\nThe harmonium can be tuned between A 380 Hz and 470 Hz.\nAn option enables harmonium to play while your iPhone / iPad is playing music. This is very convenient for training yourself to accompagny your prefered artists! Play karaoke with your harmonium!\n\nFor getting the best sound from this instrument, it is advised to use a good headphone or a pair of speakers with loudspeaker.\n\nWe should distinguish Harmonium from Shruti (or sruti). Actually, the harmonium is a melody instrument and is usually used to follow the melody played by the soloist (sitar, bansuri, vocal, tabla, ...). The Shruti is only used to play continuously a set of notes (drone) for create the musical atmosphere."

A must-have tool for musicians.\n\n• Simple to use with all the essential features.\n• Live pitch graph displays the exact pitch, note and deviation in realtime.\n• Extremely accurate (can be tuned to an accuracy of ±0.1 cents).\n• Tone generator that can generate reference tones over a note-range of 3 octaves.\n• Ability to set the frequency of A₄ (for tunings where A₄ is not 440 hertz).\n• Option to visualize pitch on piano keys.\r\n• Option to set detection latency - By setting a lower latency value, pitch detection will be faster. This works great for cases like vocal practice. By using a higher latency, pitch detection will not respond to momentary unintended sounds and noise (works great for instrument tuning).\r\n• Smart Detection - Use machine learning to enable pitch detection only when certain instruments or vocal sounds are detected."

Simply click the \"Create Video\" button from within the app. No longer do you need expensive software to create those beautiful animations you've seen on the internet. Want to customize the background image or put a logo in the center? We made that available as well. In fact, you can customize just about all aspects of the visualizer. You can even import audio files from apps like iMessage or Mail using the share sheet. We want to keep improving the app so If you have any suggestions, be sure to leave a review and tell us what feature you're missing!\n\nThe features:\n• Amazing, 60fps realtime visualization for any audio file, iTunes music (not Apple Music), or Spotify song\n• Video exporting of your audio visualization (does not support Spotify)\n• Custom background image\n• Background presets\n• Background effects\n• Custom logo image\n• Visualizer customization\n• Particle customization\n• Video export settings\n• Video animation options\n• Presets\n• More to come!!!\n\nHere's how it works:\nThe sound we hear is made up of many frequencies. The visualizer decomposes the audio input into its frequencies and displays the lower frequencies at the top/left of the audio spectrum and the higher frequencies at the bottom/right of the spectrum. This can create some cool-looking shapes that all correspond to the currently-playing audio track!\n\nWhether you're a producer that wants to see the frequency range of their song, an audiophile, or someone who wants to take a deeper look into their music, this app is definitely for you."

      "label": "Simple 12-string guitar tuner to tune up your 12-string guitar. This is for the standard eEaAdDgGBBEE 12 String Guitar tuning.\n\nTuning your guitar can be a difficult task for you if you are just beginning guitar. The good news is, the more you do it, the easier it becomes. A nicely tuned guitar can make your music sound a lot better and help you greatly while you're are just getting the hang of finger placement for notes.\n\nA 12 string guitar is split up into 6 pairs of 2 strings. The thicker string of the pair is tuned to the same note and octave as a regular 6 string guitar. The thinner string, on the pair of strings 3-6, is tuned one octave higher than it's pair. On the first and second pairs, the notes are the same octave and each string in the pair should sound exactly the same to it's other string in the pair. This is eEaAdDgGBBEE tuning. The lowercase letters means that it is one octave higher then it's counterpart. \n\nTouch the note for the string you want to tune and then turn the tuning pegs on your guitar and match it up with the note that is being played.\n\nTip: Make several passes tuning each of the strings. For example you might have noticed that if you have tuned all the strings once, and then back to the first one you tuned, it might be off a little bit. This is because you are increasing or decreasing the tension on each of the strings as you tune it and the instrument's body might bend ever so slightly due to this difference in tension. This causes the other strings to slightly change in pitch. So make sure you keep on checking and tuning the strings until all are in tune, so make several passes.\n\nAlso you can use this simple tuner for your standard 6-String Guitar, it is the same tuning, only the strings on the 6-String Guitar are EADGBBEE, which is right part of this 12-String Guitar Tuner. So use just right part of this tuner to tune up your 6-String Guitar.\n\nAny questions using the App? Write support@tuneinstrument.com and we we'll get back to you promptly.\n\nIf you need to tune other music instruments simply have a look into our other applications: Violin Tuner Simple, Cello Tuner Simple, Banjo Tuner Simple, Mandolin Tuner Simple, Double Bass Tuner Simple, Viola Tuner Simple, Guitar Tuner Simple, Ukulele Tuner Simple, Bass Tuner Simple.\n\nFollow us on Twitter: @TuneInstrument\nLike us on Facebook: facebook.com/Tuneinstrument\nFollow us on Google+: Tuneinstrument\nSubscribe to YouTube channel: www.youtube.com/TuneInstrument\nSign up for newsletter and or visit us: www.tuneinstrument.com"

      "label": "\"LO‑FI‑AF is a very capable lo‑fi toolkit capable of surgically targeted destruction and it could easily find applications in just about any musical genre\" -SoundOnSound\n\nUnfiltered Audio's lo-fi-af is now available on iOS as a Standalone app or AUv3 plugin!\n\nlo-fi-af takes your sound on a journey of artifacts and noise throughout recorded history, from tape warbles and vinyl noise to MP3 chirps and cell phone speaker chatter. lo-fi-af's many sections and versatile algorithms can place your sound in a different decade, or give it a thoroughly modern spin through compound processing.\n\nThe first section is a convolution reverb preloaded with impulse responses from broken microphones, toy speakers, cell phones, and more. With this section alone, you can place your sound into an entirely different space.\n\nThe Spectral section then splits your sound into thousands of frequencies before reconstructing it with a twist. Here you can reproduce the sound of a pirated MP3 or pitch shift your signal with clean perfection.\n\nYour signal then takes a trip through the digital section. All sorts of hazards are present here, from a skipping CD stutter effect to a multimode bitcrusher.\n\nFinally, the rich, colorful analog section adds that vibe that you crave. A maximizer, a tape saturator, a noise generator, an analog-style filter, a pitch warbler, and a radio demodulator all work together in harmony to toss your sound into the past.\n\nBut wait! That's only one possible signal chain. The Convolution, Spectral, Digital, and Analog sections can be completely rearranged in any order. Dozens of presets will get your started on your sound warping adventure.\n\nAs an AUv3 plugin, lo-fi-af has been tested to work perfectly with Garageband, Drambo, AUM, Cubasis, Beatmaker, Nanostudio, apeMatrix, Loopy Pro, and more! Additionally, with its clear layout and smart resizing, lo-fi-af can be used on tablets and phones with ease.\n\n(Note for Drambo users: Drambo does not yet have automatic Plugin Delay Compensation for managing plugins with latency. As a result, tracks with lo-fi-af will not line up properly with other tracks. An upcoming patch for Drambo will add this feature in.)"

      "label": "Music files aren't dead. Whether you've built up your collection for decades or just got sent an album full of b-sides of your favorite artist, you need a place to carry your own music.\n\nLet Doppi be that place. Doppi (pronounced doh-pie) raises the bar in iOS app design in an essentially simple music player, built just for your local music files.\n\nEnjoy your music with: \n\n• A beautifully simple interface\n• Fluid gesture-based navigation\n• Always-reachable search and playback controls\n\nSupports MP3, M4A, FLAC, and more. Browse and play music:\n\n• Received via AirDrop\n• Copied from the Files app\n• Shared from other apps (selecting \"Copy to Doppi\")\n• Added to the Doppi folder in Files or via iTunes File Sharing\n• Synced from iTunes\n• Downloaded from Cloud Music Library\n\n————\nImportant: \nDoppi does not support Apple Music offline downloads outside of Cloud Music Library.\n————\n\nWith Doppi:\n\nBig, Beautiful Artwork\nYour music's artwork takes center stage on the Now Playing screen and throughout your library.\n\nMake It Your Own\nChoose from 6 highlight colors and 32 beautiful icons, switch between 4 light and dark themes, rearrange your library tabs, and more—all from Preferences.\n\nSearch From Anywhere\nPull down from anywhere in your library to invoke Search. Hit Return to instantly trigger the top result.\n\nPlay and Add Quickly\nPlay an album or artist right from the library using their embedded Play buttons, and add songs to Up Next using the Add (+) buttons.\n\nMark Your Likes\nTap the heart on the player (or choose Like from a menu) to Like tracks. Liked music appears in the Liked Songs playlist, Liked Albums on Search, and is more likely to play in Shuffle All.\n\nMake Playlists\nCreate all-new playlists, duplicate them, or copy them from Apple Music. Tap and hold on anything to add those songs to a list.\n\nAdd Lyrics\nSearch for lyrics on the web right from the app and add them to your songs. Enjoy them on Doppi's beautiful player interface.\n\nManage Your Music\nEverything in your library has useful actions — just tap and hold to reveal a menu. For example, if you're not feeling some of your music, you can exclude it from Shuffle All, hide it from your library, or delete it (if it's from imported files).\n\nLess, But Better\nEvery screen in Doppi has been carefully designed with clean typography, pleasing contrast, and elegant motion. Enjoy your music without unnecessary distractions.\n\nEasily Readable\nDoppi fully supports Dynamic Type and includes high contrast themes, so your eyes won't get in the way of your ears.\n\nContinue Album\nEver shuffled your music, found a song you loved, and wished you could keep playing the album without stopping the song? Doppi can make it happen — just navigate to the album and press Play.\n\nGive your music the lovely home it deserves.\n\n————\nImportant:\nDoppi does not include any music. It was designed to play the music files that you own and that you transfer manually to your device. It does not support music from any streaming service."

Now with Drum Kit Designer feature and detailed online tutorials.\n\nFeatured in Modern Drummer 'New and Notable' - July 2018  \n\n\"an invaluable aid not only for drummers but also studio engineers and producers\" - Sound on Sound Magazine\n\n\"I can’t recommend this app highly enough ... for the money, it is indispensable. It's simple, accurate, looks good, and the tuning information is worth the cost of the app alone.\" - www.mikedolbear.com\n\n“***** I never knew I could have this much fun tuning drums!” – Adamrod (App Store review)\n\n“***** Just tuned my first drum and this app is awesome!” – bburt85 (App Store review)\n\n“***** Buy this app if you are a drummer!!!” Lildrummerboy (App Store review)\n\nThe original and most innovative electronic drum tuning app - iDrumTune Pro brings unrivalled accuracy and features that have never been possible before for assisting with drum tuning. Built by world experts in drums and musical acoustics, and backed up by a detailed online training course on Drum Sound and Drum Tuning.\n\niDrumTune Pro includes the following features:\n\n* Pitch Tuning – to make your drums sing and allow you to play musical phrases around the kit\n\n* Lug Tuning – to ensure that the drumhead is evenly tuned and gives a smooth and warm tone\n\n* Resonant Head Tuning – to allow you to be sure that the two heads are working together and giving rich overtones\n\n* Spectrum Analyzer – so you can really start to understand what frequencies are excited and heard when playing the drums\n\n* Drum Kit Presets – so you can save and load your favourite tunings and share them with the world. Now also includes the interactive Drum Kit Designer feature.\n\n* The Science of Drum Tuning – and extensive manual on the science and art of drum tuning and getting the best out of iDrumTune Pro \n\niDrumTune is the first and by far the most intelligent and accurate system for analyzing drum sounds and assisting tuning – developed by drummers, music producers and acoustics research Professors. iDrumTune provides you with a measurement of the drumhead vibration frequency, much in the same way to an acoustic guitar tuner which measures the vibration frequency of a guitar string. In Pitch Tuning mode, you simply hold the iPhone over the center of a drum, about 2-4 inches away, and strike the drum in the center.\n\nThe iDrumTune readout shows the recorded sound waveform and gives the strongest frequency recorded. There is also a tuning indicator bar which shows the drumhead tuning relative to musical notes, so iDrumTune can be used to ensure that your drums are in key with each other or the song you are playing. A frequency spectrum view also allows more detailed analysis and helps with tuning the drum at the lug positions.\n\niDrumTune provides advanced tuning features including an intelligent filter function, Lug Tuning mode and Resonant Head Tuning mode. The filter allows unwanted frequencies to be ignored by the analysis algorithm, whilst Lug Tuning mode offers the simplest and most innovative method for tuning an even frequency response at the lug positions on the drumhead.\n\nThe Preset Manager allows you to save all your favourite drum tunings and call them up when you are in the middle of the process. Drum kits can also be exported and imported, so you can share your favorite tuning setups and load new ones in from other drummers.\n\nDrum Tuning isn’t easy, and drums don’t respond exactly the same way every time you hit them. For that reason, it's valuable to know a little about the science of drum tuning. iDrumTune includes a comprehensive text on the science of drums and drum tuning in order to help you get the best of iDrumTune and to become an expert drum tuner!\n\nWatch the iDrumTune tutorial videos and read reviews on iDrumTune at www.idrumtune.com"

Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support.

SynthStation transforms your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad into a portable music production studio for mobile music creation. SynthStation gives you three powerful synthesizers for creating and modifying sonic textures used for melodies, chords, and bass lines. Built around Akai Professional’s history in synthesis and drawing on the newest MINIAK synth, SynthStation sounds great and offers wide-ranging sonic flexibility with its virtual analog synthesis.\n\nFrom the moment you start SynthStation, you'll know your way around. It is jam-packed with tools to help you create music with the convenience of your touch screen and each section works the way you work. With SynthStation, you can create and save sequences and complete songs. The app contains three different three-oscillator synths and a range of drum kits you can sequence and mix right in the SynthStation. For creating melodic and accompaniment parts, the SynthStation contains an arpeggiator with preset patterns, built-in effects and filters, and an XY touch control interface for expressive control of key parameters.\n\nPERFORM\nPlay with keys, XY and arpeggiator controls. This is perfect place to make magic happen because it gives you access to all the common controls you’ll need in a performance or creation setting.\n\nSYNTH\nComplete synthesis controls from oscillators to LFOs, envelopes, and more. You can control a wide range of filters to dial in exactly the sound you need. Choose from Sine, Triangle, Square or Sawtooth on your VCO and start creating your own signature sounds from scratch. Filter Cutoff and Resonance are just two taps away.\n\nDRUMS\nIn addition to SynthStation's three synthesizers, we've included drum kits and a visual representation of the most iconic beat making tool in the world - MPC pads. Just pick your kit and start tapping beats anywhere, anytime. Includes:\n\nDrum Kit – select the drum kit and play it with onscreen pads.\n\nDrum Edit – tune, mix, and customize your drums.\n\nSEQUENCER\nKeyboard grid – see your keyboard sequencing and edit notes easily.\n\nDrum grid – build and modify drum tracks with a visible sequencer grid.\n\nSONG/SEQUENCE\nSelect and save your Song/Sequence projects. You can recall your Songs and work on them later, and even export them for further editing in your desktop audio applications.\n\nCONTROL\nXY – two axes of control for hands-on, real-time control. Just like a joystick, the XY controller can snap back to the zero point.\n\nTempo – control tempo and even tap in the tempo you want.\n\nMIXER\nThe Mixer in SynthStation includes touch-controlled faders for each of the three synthesizers and the drum section as well as FX send for each. \n\nMixer – mix all the levels of the parts and effects. Just like a hardware mixer, there are faders, mutes, and effect routing.\n\nEffects – select and control FX type and parameters.\n\nSynthStation Studio enables you to create and produce music anywhere on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad."

Made of aluminum and glass, Metronome Touch proves a huge statement: It is as exclusive as your device. Launching Metronome Touch, your device will become a metronome.\n\nAnyone can try to make a metronome app, but success only comes when listening to customers. That's why Metronome Touch centers around functions that musicians are looking for: The ability to tap a beat, use customizable presets to save your favorite sets (bpm, time signature and accentuation), and multiple useful ways of adjusting the bpm. Metronome Touch even goes far beyond that: Neither analog nor digital metronomes can synchronize pendulums. But Metronome Touch can. This opens completely new ways when practicing, performing on stage or doing studio recordings.\n\nShould you be teaching students, they can follow your lesson more accurately while concentrating on their own devices synchronized with Metronome Touch. You will gain your student's attention when using this outstanding technology. If you have ever been on stage with bad acoustics, you will love Metronome Touch: It will provide every single band member with a perfect steady and synchronized rhythm on stage. Even when recording a song in separate soundproofed rooms, Metronome Touch keeps you in perfect sync.\n\nEasily adjust Metronome Touch to your likes and needs with the light or dark design - relying on absolute clear vector-based display graphics  - and many well chosen professional metronome sounds.\n\nMetronome Touch is constantly being developed further to ensure the highest customer satisfaction.\n\nFEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY\n\n• Precise engine \nA completely new developed engine makes this app one of the most precise pendulum metronomes available on the App Store. Highest accuracy is supported on all iOS devices.\n\n• Ableton Link synchronization technology\n Metronome Touch was the first metronome worldwide offering pendulum synchronization on iOS devices. You can keep band members‘ metronomes or a whole orchestra in sync.\nAbleton Link provides new ways of practicing together or in a group. \n\n • Memory function\n There is an infinite number of customizable presets to save your favorite sets of bpm, time signature and accentuation.\n\n • Numerical entry\nUsing bpm display let you directly enter tempo values from 20 up to 999 bpm.\n\n• Tap2bpm \nUse the tap field that will interpret your finger taps as bpm.\n\n• Beat count and accentuation\n Choose a beat count from 1 up to 12 beats and free customizable accentuation.\n\n• Styles and sounds\n Customize Metronome Touch to your likes and needs.

      "label": "You wish you could play any video file on your iPhone/iPad, no matter its format?  that's why we made GPlayer.\n\n@ZDNET: GPlayer fills the iOS void left by VLC!\n\n* Follow our Twitter @GinkgoTech to get the free code when new version released.\n \n* GPlayer was honored as \"app of the Week\" in the Appcast.\n\n* Supported File Format Extension \n\n- AVI(without packet-b frame), WMV, RMVB, ASF, H264, MKV, TS, M2TS... most of all movie file formats.\n- MP3, WMA, WAV, OGG, FLAC... most of all audio file formats.\n- SMI, ASS, SUB, SRT, TXT... most of all subtitle file formats. [build in subtitle is also supported]\n\n* Extra Features\n\n- USB Sync: Use itunes to fast sync movies to GPlayer.\n- WIFI Upload: Upload movie even you don't have the cable.\n- File Management: Support New/Rename/Cut/Paste/Delete.\n- Movie Thumbnail: Easy to find the movie you want to view.\n- Different Play Mode: Support Loop off/Loop One/Loop all.\n- Screen Lock: View your movie even on the bed.\n- Dynamically Menu: Dynamically choose audio/subtitle channel and encoding method.\n- Gesture support: Easier way to do seek while playing the movie.\n- Resume Function: Don't worry about closing your application suddenly.\n- TV Out: Both cable TV out and AirPlay are supported.\n- iTunes Backup: By default, we will not backup media data when you do iTunes sync or iCloud backup, and you can't see the files in iTunes, you can enable it in the settings page to backup your media data.\n\n* FAQ\n\n- How do I put files into GPlayer? \nTo add files to your GPlayer app, you have to go to iTunes, and select the “Apps” tab. At the bottom of this page, there’s a “File sharing” section – just select GPlayer in the list, and add files from there. Note that you don’t have to sync your iPhone or iPad to iTunes to add movies. Just drop files in the “File sharing” tab, and they’ll be uploaded immediately. You can even use a friend’s iTunes to add videos to your own iPhone. Also, adding files over WiFi is supported. Indeed, WiFi is significantly slower than USB, and ruins the battery life.\n\n- What kind of streams does GPlayer play? \nGPlayer is able to play RTSP and MMS streams. For now those can’t be added to the media library, but you can click an RTSP or MMS url in Safari or Mail for example.\nIf you want to use GPlayer to open HTTP/FTP streaming, add \"gplayer:\" prefix in the URL.\n\n- I want to explicitely open an attachment with GPlayer? \nIf you want to watch an attachment in GPlayer(from Mail for example), just do a long press on the attachment. A menu will pop-up that will let you pick GPlayer as a player.\n\n- iTunes won’t let me install GPlayer on my iPhone or iPod Touch? \nUnfortunately, we had to drop support for older iOS devices such as the iPhone 3G or the first two versions of iPods. Indeed, after some testing, we realized those weren’t fast enough to provide a pleasant experience.\n\n- Why HD MKV movies don’t play smoothly? \nCurrently, only iPad 2 supports 720p MKV file, that’s to be expected. The other iDevices have limited computing power, and cannot handle the complex task of decoding HD movies in real time.\n\n- The audio and the video is not in sync? \nThat is because the CPU is not power enough to do video decoding, you can try to enable \"Skip Frame\" in the settings page.\n\n- Is there a TV-out support? \nYep, supports iPod gen4, iPhone4, iPhone4S and iPad 1/2.\n\n* Contact us\n\nMail: gplayersupport@hotmail.com\nWebsite: gplayersupport.wordpress.com\n\n* If you want to help to translate GPlayer to your mother language, just drop a mail to gplayersupport@hotmail.com, that will help people in your country enjoy this software, and we will put your name in thanks page!"

      "label": "Bebot is a musical instrument that anyone can play. Instead of a keyboard, it has an easy-to-use touch control system. And it's all built into a friendly animated robot, who performs your music while you play.\n\nAlthough it looks simple on the outside, inside is a powerful synth engine which lets you create and edit your own sounds and apply effects. The controls are easy to use, making it fun to tinker and experiment with sound. If you just want to get playing, there's also a wide selection of preset sounds.\n\nThe touch control system lets you lock in a scale so that you'll never play a wrong note, which makes it easy to play, even on your iPhone. It's polyphonic, which means you can use multiple fingers at once to play chords and harmonies. Plus, you can perform sweeping slides and expressive gestures that would be practically impossible on a regular keyboard.\n\nWhile it's designed to be simple and fun, that doesn't mean it's only for beginners. Bebot has been used both on stage and in the studio by accomplished musicians and performers including Dream Theater, How To Destroy Angels and The Flaming Lips.\n\nTo see and hear Bebot in action, check out the demo videos at normalware.com, including a walkthrough demo by keyboard wizard Jordan Rudess.\n\nNow with Audiobus and Inter-App Audio, you can connect Bebot to other apps such as GarageBand to record, multitrack and add effects, making Bebot more versatile and useful than ever.

      "label": "SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps. Studio Six Digital is dedicated to making the iPhone and Touch a professional audio and acoustics test device.\n\nCheck out our full line of professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the professional digital iPhone sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real-time analyzer,  FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the energy-time curve function, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time measurement, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for more great acoustical and audio test apps, have a look at AudioTools, our premier app for audio professionals."

You will need to make sure the songs are downloaded to your device to listen and enhance them via Equalizer. If you want to stream and eq your music, you can try our other app: CloudEQ. It allows you to stream and eq music from SoundCloud and your Dropbox account without the need for storage on your device.\n\nFrom the reviews:\n\nEXCELLENT PROGRAM\nI connect my iphone 4 to a car audio system, with the application the music began to sound incomparably better ....\nA little clear interface, but to understand it and understand need no more than 5-10 minutes. -- P_S_B_\n***\nLOVE IT\nThis is the EQ I have been looking for, and because of bad ratings I almost passed on it! I consider myself an aspiring audiophile and have the equipment -- Klipsch, Sunfire, Nottingham, Denon, Paradigim, etc. -- (and debt) to back it up. This EQ performs flawlessly and is very easy to use. It enhanced my music dramatically. Yes, dramatically! Just make sure you are running the recommended IOS, as the developer suggests. -- J. Paul DiMaggio\n***\n\n\nPLEASE if you have concerns or encounter problems with the app: post on http://www.audioforge.ca and we will explain how things work, until you can use all the features of the app to the fullest. Thank you"

      "label": "XAir Monitor Mixer is a personal monitor mixer for select Behringer and Midas digital mixers. It allows each musician on stage to choose exactly what they hear in their monitor without affecting (or being able to affect, even by accident) the band's main mix.\n\nXAir Monitor Mixer supports the Behringer X18, XR18, XR16, XR12, and the Midas MR18 and MR12.\n\nXAir Monitor Mixer deliberately does not include controls that would allow a musician on stage to accidentally mute channels or otherwise alter the main mix.\n\nUsage:\n\n1. Connect to the same WiFi network as the XR18.  In most cases, this should be enough for the app to find your mixer. However, if your sound engineer has changed the default address of the mixer, you'll have to enter that address in the app's connection screen.\n2. Choose which monitor you want to mix. If your sound engineer hasn't named these in a way that makes it obvious which is yours, ask him which is yours.\n3. Mix away. :)\n\nIf you have feedback, suggestions, or bug reports, please visit the forums at xairmonitormixer.tetzfiles.com or send an email to xairmonitormixer@tetzfiles.com.\n\nNote: support for mixers other than XR18 was recently added. If you run into any issues, please let us know. Ensuring proper compatibility with all supported mixers is our top priority."

The enormously popular ELECTRIBE-R instantly became a must-have item for track-makers around the world, and now it’s been reborn as an app for iPhone.\n\nWith this app, we’ve effectively “put the original hardware chassis into your iPhone,” by faithfully reproducing the sound engine and design of the ELECTRIBE-R. We’ve also included the latest preset patterns and many new functions that are currently featured on the “iELECTRIBE for iPad”, released in 2010. , taking a further evolutionary step in technology. Taking advantage of the ease of use that you expect on iPhone, we have maximized the intuitive nature of the ELECTRIBE to make this new product worthy of its name: the iELECTRIBE mkII.\n\nIt won’t take long for you to enjoy the ultimate experience of the Electribe series. This apps intuitive nature and familiar interface make it easy to create beats with an analog feel that’s like nothing else.\n\n● Amazing rhythm machine that generates powerful grooves\nWe’ve perfectly replicated the thick-sounding synth engine of the ELECTRIBE-R and its intuitive step sequencer. Now you can instantly obtain extreme tonal changes and powerful rhythms with just one touch\nNot only can iELECTRIBE for iPhone be easily enjoyed by anyone, but it also allows detailed beat-making that transcends iPhone specs. In addition to playing back the provided audio data, you can also freely synthesize sounds from a single waveform and combine those sounds into your own original beats. This allows for the true experience of music production that connects all musicians.\n\n● Three hundred built-in rhythm patterns that only this app can produce\nWith 64 of the latest preset patterns, 192 from the first-generation ELECTRIBE-R, and 32 template patterns for various genres, this app successfully draws out the full potential of the thick sounding analog beats. There are approximately 300 inimitable rhythm patterns that you’ll hear only from iELECTRIBE for iPhone. Electro, house, techno, drum'n'bass, dubstep, hip hop, techno pop, and IDM are some of the wide range of electronic music genres that are provided.\n\n● An ELECTRIBE that you can put in your pocket and take anywhere\nWhether you’re on the train or bus while commuting to school or to work, at a coffee shop, or in your bedroom, you can enjoy beat-making anywhere and anytime you like. Your completed beats can be transferred to your DAW software via the audio export function. You can also use the WIST function to play wirelessly with a friend using two devices simultaneously.\n\n● Powerful functions that bring infinite possibilities to your grooves\nWe’ve packed maximum potential into this machine with eight types of powerful master effects featured on the upper-level models of the ELECTRIBE. This includes the ring modulation function of the ELECTRIBE-R and the cross-modulation function of the ELECTRIBE-R mkII. This app allows you to switch back and forth to choose between the two. It also includes the BEAT FLUTTER function that uses a proprietary randomizer to create fresh rhythms and the motion sequence function that remembers your knob movements. In addition, you can use an external USB-MIDI device such as the nanoPAD or nanoKONTROL for performance and control. There’s also support for the latest iOS technologies such as Inter-App Audio, Audiobus, Virtual MIDI, and iCloud.\n\nMore info at korg.com"

It will leave out beats randomly to force you to strengthen your own inner time-keeping muscles, and it has other cool features for odd meters, drum machine-style patterns, and more... this is an awesome learning, grooving, solidifying tool.\"\n\nStrengthen your inner sense of rhythm! Time Guru is the only metronome with the ability to mute its sound at random, in sequenced patterns, or both, so that you can assess whether you tend to rush or drag or loose your place with odd meters. Time Guru can periodically leave you on your own so that you strengthen your own internal sense of time, rather than relying on the constant, rigid, external time keeping of a metronome. It's like training wheels that sometimes come up off the ground.\n\nTime Guru also features:  \n-the ability to play in different time signatures or sequences of time signatures\n-create rhythmic drum-machine like patterns\n-save presets for tempo, meter, sound and muting-\n-35 loud sound sets; \n-Human or robot voice counting in English, Chinese, French, German or Russian - great for teaching!\n-tap tempo (5 to 300 BPM range)\n-super accurate, rock-solid timing via a customized audio engine. \n\nAnd of course it can function as a normal metronome. \n\nNoTreble.com says: \"I love the aesthetic and layout of Time Guru. It’s very simple and elegant. Time Guru also offers ability to set randomness of your subdivisions (great for testing your internal clock)….There is one thing that Time Guru does that I absolutely love, and for which, this app will always live on my iPhone – at the top of the screen, you will see a series of numbers (1-7). When you press a number, it is set first in a sequence and you can choose a subdivision that will then repeat that number of times (or set it to rest that number of times). Sound confusing? It isn’t, because the layout is so simple. Every time you press a new number, it is set next in the sequence and you choose your continue to choose your subdivisions.\""

      "label": "Benny Greb, well known for his contributions to the drumming education community, shared the approach that he has taken personally to develop his sense of groove and improve his own timing on his instrument in his course “The Art and Science of Groove”. Now with the Gap Click app, everyone can practice his method easily with a simple-to-use app! \n\nUnlike standard metronomes which simply state the time, Gap Click helps you improve your sense of time. Gap Click is more than a metronome with a focus on improving your ability to keep tempo, become more aware and comfortable with off beat clicks and by that, become bullet proof and accurate with all notes of the subdivision.\n\nGAP CLICK\nBy scrolling through the numbers of bars and patterns you can quickly configure a “gap” of time in which the metronome drops out. When the “one” comes back around, will your playing still be in time? How long of a gap can you play through and still maintain solid tempo?\n\nMOVING CLICK\nNext you can experiment with all kinds of off-beat patterns in the Gap Bar which moves the click from the downbeat position to a different location. Can you still play your instrument and maintain the downbeat internally even when you hear the click sound on an off-beat?\n\nBoth the “click” and the “gap” portion supports a variety of different syncopated patterns allowing you the ability to practice in binary or ternary rhythms - with more or less safety net depending on your settings.\n\nFeatures\n• Ability to choose from a variety of different syncopated patterns and # of measures for both the standard \"click\" as well as the \"gap\"\n• Use the nostalgic click wheel to find the right tempo or tap to set your desired tempo from 10 to 300bpm\n• Standard quarter-note time signatures: 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4\n\nPersonalize\n• See visual feedback for each note or rest that is played\n• Accent beat 1 of each measure or turn accents off for a greater challenge\n• Flash the screen for a visual indication when switching from the \"click\" to the \"gap\"\n• Find your favorite sound from a variety of click samples hand-picked by Benny\n\nBuy Once, Use Forever\n• There are no In-App Purchases - a one time purchase includes all current and future features. \n\nTESTIMONIALS\nWhat professionals are saying about GAP CLICK:\n• \"The skills you can sharpen by using this app are integral for what it takes to be a professional drummer in any genre.\" - Matt Halpern\n• \"When I first opened the app, it made (simple) sense, without a tutorial.\" - Chris Coleman\n• \"This app helps you lock in the pocket on a whole different level.\" - Luke Holland\n• \"The Gap Click app is something that every drummer should have in their toolbox.\" - Jared Falk, Drumeo\n\nWhat our users are saying about GAP CLICK: \n• \"If you think you have good timing, this will really put you in your place.\"\n• \"Gone are the days of programming gap clicks!\"\n• \"I’ve never had so much fun being destroyed in my practice session.\"\n• \"This is by far the best money I’ve ever spent on a practice tool.\"\n\nABOUT BENNY GREB\nBenny Greb is one of the most respected drummers in the world today. Not only has he headlined nearly every major drum festival and toured with his clinics and drum camps worldwide, but he is also recognized as a composer and bandleader in his own band Moving Parts, which won him the renowned “ECHO Jazz” award - the German equivalent to The Grammys in jazz.\n\nBenny Greb published two of the most successful and critically acclaimed educational products, “The Language of Drumming” and “The Art and Science of Groove” and he has helped create many signature products available to drummers today.\n\nFind him online at https://www.bennygreb.de as well as on social media."

Rather than providing only one mode like other tuners, insTuner supports different tuning modes applicable to different situations, such as Instant Tuning Mode for quick tune and play, Fine and Strobe Modes for accurate tuning, FFT Mode for sound analysis etc. What's more, many advanced features are provided such as Concert A calibration, historical temperaments and transpositions, which make it more powerful than other tuners. \n\ninsTuner is well-designed and easy to use. It features a unique \"fixed\" note wheel, which helps you to find the position of detected pitch easily. You can also use it as an electronic pitch pipe to tune by ear, matching the generated tones. \n\nIt is suitable for tuning acoustic or electric guitar and bass, ukulele, mandolin, banjo, bouzouki, bowed strings, woodwinds, brass, timpani and more. In fact, almost any instrument that sustains a tone can be tuned using insTuner. It supports Built-in Microphone as well as Line-in and other audio interface such as Apogee One. Clip Microphone is supported too. \n\n\n=== FEATURES === \n* Universal App, purchase once, available on all of your iOS devices: iPhone/iPhone5/iPod/iPad. \n* Supported both Landscape and Portrait mode \n* Precise to ±1/1000 semitone (±0.1 cent) \n* Tuning Range from C0 to B8, covering the range of almost all of musical instruments \n* Instant Tuning Mode\n* Strobe Tuning Mode \n* Fine Tuning Mode with a highly responsive tuning meter for perfect tuning \n* Historical Curve Mode that shows tuning results over time\n* FFT Tuning Mode for frequency analysis with Log, Linear or Note Display options \n* Real-time Spectrogram Mode with Log, Linear, Note and Median Frequency Display options for real-time audio analysis \n* Well-designed \"Fixed\" note wheel display \n* Adjustable A4 (Concert A) calibration in 0.1 Hz increments \n* >30 historical temperaments \n* Customizable temperaments\n* 12 notations \n* Needle damping\n* Customizable transposition options for transposing instruments \n* Tone generator with four wave forms\n* Line-in and Built-in Microphone Modes\n* Customizable Input Channels\n* Supported Apogee One\n* Supported Inter-App Audio\n* Supported Audio Bus\n* Optimized for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus\n\n===About EUMLab=== \nWe make the best music Apps for you!

It's an incredible tool for all audio engineers and musicians ... My mixing has improved by leaps and bounds after just a few weeks with Quiztones.”\n\n- Austin McAllister\n\n\nA professional Audio Engineer of 10 years, I've come across many ear training devices, blind tests, and software. This app is TOPS! Highly recommended! The developers are serious about what they do. You will not be disappointed!\n\n- Joel Avery\n\n——\n\nWhy We Created Quiztones EQ Ear Training Apps ...\n\nWe thought there should be an easier way to learn how to use EQ, train your ears and expedite the path to getting professional quality mixes, recordings and productions.\n\nWhen I was at music school ten years ago studying audio engineering and music production, my teacher turned an iMac around, pulled up an EQ in Pro Tools and started quizzing the class on which audio frequencies he was boosting or cutting in a mix. That's when it hit me — this should be an app, with various difficulty levels, a scoring system and the ability to import your own source material for quizzes that will teach you how to use EQ like a pro.\n\nFast forward to today — 50k app downloads later — and we're still just as excited to keep evolving Quiztones to help you take the quality of your mixes, recordings and productions to the next level."

But you can also have fun with it and record quick ideas using the built-in microphone on your iPhone or earbuds.\n\nControl your virtual rig just as easily as you would a traditional vocal multiFX with new iRig Stomp I/O integration, so you can change presets, control effects and more right from your feet.  Or go wireless with iRig Blueboard, a wireless Bluetooth controller for basic control on the go.\n\nVocaLive also supports Core Audio and Core MIDI so you can use any compatible third-party interface or MIDI controller, and Audiobus and Inter-App Audio compatible, letting you use it alongside your favorite recording or songwriting apps.\n\n\nVocaLive for iPhone features: \n\n• Real time vocal processor + recording app \n• 4-processor vocal effects chain \n• 12 professional studio-quality effects included\n• Mic Room microphone with 20 classic and modern studio mic emulations*\n• Includes metronome and vocal warm-up tools\n• 4-track looper section*\n• 2-track recorder (expandable to a full 8-track recording studio*)\n• Import and play songs directly from your Music library or computer \n• Voice Cancel lets you create sing-along backing tracks by removing the vocal track from existing recordings \n• Simultaneous multi-track recording \n• Studio section (included with Recorder) with waveform visualization and editing, touch-and-drag looping, normalization, punch-in/punch-out recording, simultaneous multi-track recording support and more\n• AutoFreeze (allows each track to have its own full effects chain)\n• Live Mode shows you your entire rig at a glance, with all the parameters you need on stage easily accessible \n• 55 presets included with 4 Favorites for fast recall \n• MIDI controllable and with built-in integration for iRig Stomp I/O, iRig Blueboard and other controllers\n• Audiobus & Inter-App Audio support\n\n* available via in-app purchase\n\nIMPORTANT: AmpliTube users can add the effects processors from VocaLive to their AmpliTube app using the “Restore my purchases” option in the in-app menu. \n\nFor more information: \nwww.ikmultimedia.com/vocaliveiphone\n\nAccessories information:\nwww.ikmultimedia.com"

You can play and modulate the sound by moving your hand through the air - just like the legendary Theremin instrument.\n\nGyroSynth makes use of the gyroscope to measure true roll, pitch, and yaw and translates them to sound parameters like pitch, volume, modulation or filter cutoff. Thanks to phenomenal accuracy (2000 degrees), you can play melodies perfectly in tune.\n\nMinimum requirements: iPhone 4 or iPod Touch 4th generation\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Synthesizers: vocal (formant synthesizer), sine wave , square (PWM modulation), saw, granular sample player with recording function and R2D2 - experimental FM modulation\n- Effects: delay and boost\n- Several control modes\n- Included musical scales allow you to effortlessly play in several styles\n- Built-in recorder and player with overdub function\n\n\"There isn’t too much more to say about GyroSynth other than wow!\" AppSafari\n\nEnjoy the new experience!"

It can even stream to a PC running Windows Media Player.\n\nIf you've heard all the hype about AirPlay and are missing out because you don't have an AppleTV, this app is for you!\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ HOW TO USE ◆◆◆◆◆\n\n√ Connect your iPod, iPhone or iPad to the same local network as your Xbox, PS3, PS4 or PC.\n\n√ Start AirMusic.\n\n√ For Xbox 360, navigate to the Xbox System Music Player and select your device from the list.\n\n√ For Xbox One, navigate to the Xbox One Media Player under Apps and select your device in the list.\n\n√ For PS3, navigate to the PS3 Music Menu and select your device in the list. If it shows nothing underneath, it probably means you selected the Movie or Photo menu instead.\n\n√ For PS4, locate the Media Player in the Store.\n\n√ When AirMusic detects a Chromecast device, an icon will appear in the AirMusic navigation bar. Tap on it to connect then select the music you want to stream.\n\n√ For a PC running Windows, start Windows Media Player, your iPhone Music will show under 'Other Libraries'.\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ IMPORTANT ◆◆◆◆◆\n\n• AirMusic is not compatible with Apple Music.\n\n• AirMusic is compatible with iCloud as long as songs have been downloaded onto your phone. Tap the little cloud download icon next to each song or album in the Music app to download them.\n\n• If AirMusic is not detecting all songs, try toggling Sync Library under iOS Settings > Music.\n\n• AirMusic requires an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch with a minimum of 50MB of disk space to work effectively. \n\n• AirMusic is not compatible with old DRM songs purchased on iTunes. Newer iTunes DRM free purchases are compatible.\n\n• When using Chromecast, you can choose and change the music directly from within AirMusic. For all other devices, you do it from these devices (ie Xbox, PS3, PC).\n\nIf you are experiencing any other issues, please contact us at airmusic@plutinosoft.com.

It comes with a stereo modulator detune effect and covers the typical clean bells and Rhodes-like sounds, spheric pads, thick beats and basses.\n\n\nThe Sequencer\n\nThe stepsequencer visualises the rhythmic structure in a compact 4x4 square matrix, making it very easy to lay out patterns.\n\n\nThe Sampler\n\nBesides A/D envelope, loop function, start offset, tune and fine tune, the puristic sampler comes without effects. You can record up to 6 seconds via microphone or copy samples via iTunes.\n\n\nShare\n\nWith nanoloop for iPhone, you can send your saved projects to other nanoloop users and your own PC via e-mail. If nanoloop is installed on the recipient's iPhone / iPod, she/he can simply tap on the file name in the received e-mail to start nanoloop and import the attached file so that it is available for editing. This makes collaboration very easy, multiple users around the world can work on the same project by simply e-mailing the file.\n\n\nExport\n\nSongs can be exported to a WAV file that is accessible via iTunes (simply drag & drop files in finder). The exported file is also copied to the clipboard so that it can be pasted in other apps that support pasting audio. If a file sharing app like Dropbox is installed, you can upload the file there.\n\nMore information can be found at the nanoloop website: www.nanoloop.com"

      "label": "Precision Strobe Tuner 1.9\n\nA General Purpose Chromatic Musical Instrument Tuner App with special Temperament and Piano Tuning Functions.\n\nThe PST combines a radial Spectrum Display with a classic Strobe Tuner and Note Dial for an ultimate visualization of pitch and tone.  The Strobe Display is highly sensitive with response speed that is practically instantaneous and has long been the preferred tool for piano tuners and instrument technicians.\n\nThe central Spectrum Display shows the input spectrum wrapped around the Display, with each Octave drawn in a separate color.   The Note Dial is marked like a clock with the twelve notes of the Scale.  All overtones of the input are shown as peaks in the Spectrum Display pointing towards their corresponding Notes.  The Fundamental Indicator Tic on the Spectrum Display shows the Note of the Fundamental along the Note Dial, with the color designating the Octave.  Use the Spectrum Display for coarse adjustment by tuning the Fundamental to the center of the desired Note Indicator.  \n\nAs the input approaches the desired Note, a Two Group pinwheel pattern becomes visible rotating in the Strobe Display.  Fine tuning is accomplished by adjusting to stop rotation.  The Strobe Display responds instantaneously to changes in pitch and is extremely sensitive.  The outside Strobe Display works just like a classic rotating disk strobe tuner.  The Two-Group pattern rotates CCW when the input is flat, and CW when sharp.  When the rotation is stopped, the note is in tune.\n\nThe previews show a general strobe display demonstration, an example of using the calibration function to measure the accuracy of a tuning fork and an example of guitar string tuning. \n\nThe first screenshot shows the display tuning a Guitar Low E string. The Fundamental appears as an Orange peak in the Spectrum Display.  This string rings bright, so the overtones are also dominant in the Display. \n\nThe second screenshot shows the display for an E 440 Tuning Fork with the Calibration Dial enabled and adjusted. This Fork is 2.9 cent Flat.\n\nThe PST also includes a Programmable Temperament Function with 5 user definable banks.  The third screenshot shows an example of a Temperament Bank set up to a typical Piano Stretch Curve.  This can also be used for tuning alternate temperaments, pedal steel guitar setups, or special guitar intonation systems.\n\nIn addition, there are several Special Measurement Banks used for String Inharmonicity characterization and Piano Stretch Curve Estimation.  Individual strings can be characterized by measuring the Fundamental and 2nd Harmonic separately.  By careful selection of a few representative measurement points, a reasonable smooth fit Piano Stretch Curve can be generated. Any number of measurements can be used. \n\nThe final screenshot shows the Input Signal Scope/Spectrum Display Page.\n\nThe Detailed Operation Manual can be viewed here:\nwww.precisionstrobe.com"

      "label": "Bebot is a musical instrument that anyone can play. Instead of a keyboard, it has an easy-to-use touch control system. And it's all built into a friendly animated robot, who performs your music while you play.\n\nAlthough it looks simple on the outside, inside is a powerful synth engine which lets you create and edit your own sounds and apply effects. The controls are easy to use, making it fun to tinker and experiment with sound. If you just want to get playing, there's also a wide selection of preset sounds.\n\nThe touch control system lets you lock in a scale so that you'll never play a wrong note, which makes it easy to play, even on your iPhone. It's polyphonic, which means you can use multiple fingers at once to play chords and harmonies. Plus, you can perform sweeping slides and expressive gestures that would be practically impossible on a regular keyboard.\n\nWhile it's designed to be simple and fun, that doesn't mean it's only for beginners. Bebot has been used both on stage and in the studio by accomplished musicians and performers including Dream Theater, How To Destroy Angels and The Flaming Lips.\n\nTo see and hear Bebot in action, check out the demo videos at normalware.com, including a walkthrough demo by keyboard wizard Jordan Rudess.\n\nNow with Audiobus and Inter-App Audio, you can connect Bebot to other apps such as GarageBand to record, multitrack and add effects, making Bebot more versatile and useful than ever.

That's why Metronome Touch centers around functions that musicians are looking for: The ability to tap a beat, use customizable presets to save your favorite sets (bpm, time signature and accentuation), and multiple useful ways of adjusting the bpm. Metronome Touch even goes far beyond that: Neither analog nor digital metronomes can synchronize pendulums. But Metronome Touch can. This opens completely new ways when practicing, performing on stage or doing studio recordings.\n\nShould you be teaching students, they can follow your lesson more accurately while concentrating on their own devices synchronized with Metronome Touch. You will gain your student's attention when using this outstanding technology. If you have ever been on stage with bad acoustics, you will love Metronome Touch: It will provide every single band member with a perfect steady and synchronized rhythm on stage. Even when recording a song in separate soundproofed rooms, Metronome Touch keeps you in perfect sync.\n\nEasily adjust Metronome Touch to your likes and needs with the light or dark design - relying on absolute clear vector-based display graphics  - and many well chosen professional metronome sounds.\n\nMetronome Touch is constantly being developed further to ensure the highest customer satisfaction.\n\nFEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY\n\n• Precise engine \nA completely new developed engine makes this app one of the most precise pendulum metronomes available on the App Store. Highest accuracy is supported on all iOS devices.\n\n• Ableton Link synchronization technology\n Metronome Touch was the first metronome worldwide offering pendulum synchronization on iOS devices. You can keep band members‘ metronomes or a whole orchestra in sync.\nAbleton Link provides new ways of practicing together or in a group. \n\n • Memory function\n There is an infinite number of customizable presets to save your favorite sets of bpm, time signature and accentuation.\n\n • Numerical entry\nUsing bpm display let you directly enter tempo values from 20 up to 999 bpm.\n\n• Tap2bpm \nUse the tap field that will interpret your finger taps as bpm.\n\n• Beat count and accentuation\n Choose a beat count from 1 up to 12 beats and free customizable accentuation.\n\n• Styles and sounds\n Customize Metronome Touch to your likes and needs. Choose between dark and light design as well as chosen professional metronome sounds.\n\n• Retina display\n Metronome Touch comes with a complete set of vector graphics for all display sizes and looks simply perfect on your device.\n\nFor more informations, app videos, faq's and pictures go to » www.cu4uc.com"

It's squonky electric fun for the whole family! \n\nWith Noisemusick you can:\n\n* Choose a sound to match your mood: blue, green, or pink\n* Practice and probe to find interesting interactions of sound\n* Discover weird oscillations\n* Use it as a raw input to other filters and effects\n* Run on an iphone or iPad; it's a Universal app\n\nTo start making sounds with the Noisemusick app, your body has to complete the circuit between the touch pads. Pressing the pads in different combinations will generate different frequencies and modulations. By lifting a finger or sliding the hold switch you can create rhythmic patterns of noise. Move your fingers to change the resistance between your finger and the pads, which changes the frequency and beating of the tone. On each board the knobs change the quality of the tone in different ways.\n\nThis is a Universal app from the Fluxama collective in Providence RI."

The metronome keeps running past the 70 second \"sleep limit\".\n\nThe haptic feedback for this app is stronger than the normal \"tick\" that you are accustomed to, and there is an audible beep that augments the tapping.\n\nSet the tempo, and your Apple Watch will vibrate to the beat. That's all there is to it.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* The metronome will ignore your wrist action.  That way, when you hold your instrument the clicking will keep going.\n\n* The audible cue keeps the tempo, along with a haptic pulse. \n \n* A button changes the haptic pulse from 2/4 to 3/4, or you can silence the pulse. \n \n* Use the slider (+/-) to change the tempo, or use the crown to scroll (fine tune). \n \nNotes:\n\n* This application will \"run in background\"; the metronome keeps running past the \"sleep\" limit  (the \"wake for 70 seconds\").  \n\n** The audible cue (beep) and the heavy haptic pulse will only happen every other beat. There is a limitation on the Apple Watch -- the loud physical haptic vibrate can't keep up to the app's beat. That means, you will hear the tempo as if it were 2/4 (two beats out of four), rather than 4/4 (four beats out of four). This time lag becomes more prominent as the tempo gets faster."

Get a camera kit and plug in a midi controller through USB, or get a 5-PIN DIN 1/in 1/out, to: USB and use the camera kit through USB MIDI Spec, NOTE: some devices handle SysEx differently and therefore we cannot promise support for SysEx, so invest in connectors and cables wisely. If you have questions involving making MIDI-USB work the best for your situation, email support. This iOS app was designed especially with small interfaces in mind. Example: an iPhone 5S or a resizable window inside AUM. If one clicks the menu eye, a feature LOCK SCROLL can be –very– important to set knobs, sliders, et cetera: if screen size is limited. LOCK PARAMs in the eye menu locks the parameters for scrolling without knocking loose the preset. In the CARTs menu double tap a cartridge to load a series of patches, the files will have a .syx extension. To use MIDI CC, in the menu eye you must first turn on MIDI CC. When MIDI CC is on it makes the tap events react like a right mouse button click. NOTE: MIDI CC, in eye menu, doesn't have to be on after CC controls are mapped. MIDI CC touch modifier will also turn off after you have successfully mapped a CC control, or when you delete the current mappings. You can turn it on again later to turn off mappings or create new CC mappings. I would suggest setting CC knobs in the bottom section of the screen – above keyboard (if visible).  Currently you must save patch in DAW – for instance: GarageBand or AUM. Once we can determine unity and saving/loading between the AUv3 plugin and the StandAlone app, external save will be eventually developed. There is a pathway set to transfer .syx files through iTunes to the StandAlone app, only. Other plans include fixing pixelated images, a quick zoom to set CC mode and updating GUI to a higher degree, make sure midi CC knobs update."

Super simple interface with powerful features.” -- J. Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support. Please contact me with questions, bug reports, feature ideas, and other feedback at support@atastypixel.com or https://forum.loopyapp.com.

SynthStation transforms your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad into a portable music production studio for mobile music creation. SynthStation gives you three powerful synthesizers for creating and modifying sonic textures used for melodies, chords, and bass lines. Built around Akai Professional’s history in synthesis and drawing on the newest MINIAK synth, SynthStation sounds great and offers wide-ranging sonic flexibility with its virtual analog synthesis.\n\nFrom the moment you start SynthStation, you'll know your way around. It is jam-packed with tools to help you create music with the convenience of your touch screen and each section works the way you work. With SynthStation, you can create and save sequences and complete songs. The app contains three different three-oscillator synths and a range of drum kits you can sequence and mix right in the SynthStation. For creating melodic and accompaniment parts, the SynthStation contains an arpeggiator with preset patterns, built-in effects and filters, and an XY touch control interface for expressive control of key parameters.\n\nPERFORM\nPlay with keys, XY and arpeggiator controls. This is perfect place to make magic happen because it gives you access to all the common controls you’ll need in a performance or creation setting.\n\nSYNTH\nComplete synthesis controls from oscillators to LFOs, envelopes, and more. You can control a wide range of filters to dial in exactly the sound you need. Choose from Sine, Triangle, Square or Sawtooth on your VCO and start creating your own signature sounds from scratch. Filter Cutoff and Resonance are just two taps away.\n\nDRUMS\nIn addition to SynthStation's three synthesizers, we've included drum kits and a visual representation of the most iconic beat making tool in the world - MPC pads. Just pick your kit and start tapping beats anywhere, anytime. Includes:\n\nDrum Kit – select the drum kit and play it with onscreen pads.\n\nDrum Edit – tune, mix, and customize your drums.\n\nSEQUENCER\nKeyboard grid – see your keyboard sequencing and edit notes easily.\n\nDrum grid – build and modify drum tracks with a visible sequencer grid.\n\nSONG/SEQUENCE\nSelect and save your Song/Sequence projects. You can recall your Songs and work on them later, and even export them for further editing in your desktop audio applications.\n\nCONTROL\nXY – two axes of control for hands-on, real-time control. Just like a joystick, the XY controller can snap back to the zero point.\n\nTempo – control tempo and even tap in the tempo you want.\n\nMIXER\nThe Mixer in SynthStation includes touch-controlled faders for each of the three synthesizers and the drum section as well as FX send for each. \n\nMixer – mix all the levels of the parts and effects. Just like a hardware mixer, there are faders, mutes, and effect routing.\n\nEffects – select and control FX type and parameters.\n\nSynthStation Studio enables you to create and produce music anywhere on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad."

      "label": "You wish you could play any video file on your iPhone/iPad, no matter its format?  that's why we made GPlayer.\n\n@ZDNET: GPlayer fills the iOS void left by VLC!\n\n* Follow our Twitter @GinkgoTech to get the free code when new version released.\n \n* GPlayer was honored as \"app of the Week\" in the Appcast.\n\n* Supported File Format Extension \n\n- AVI(without packet-b frame), WMV, RMVB, ASF, H264, MKV, TS, M2TS... most of all movie file formats.\n- MP3, WMA, WAV, OGG, FLAC... most of all audio file formats.\n- SMI, ASS, SUB, SRT, TXT... most of all subtitle file formats. [build in subtitle is also supported]\n\n* Extra Features\n\n- USB Sync: Use itunes to fast sync movies to GPlayer.\n- WIFI Upload: Upload movie even you don't have the cable.\n- File Management: Support New/Rename/Cut/Paste/Delete.\n- Movie Thumbnail: Easy to find the movie you want to view.\n- Different Play Mode: Support Loop off/Loop One/Loop all.\n- Screen Lock: View your movie even on the bed.\n- Dynamically Menu: Dynamically choose audio/subtitle channel and encoding method.\n- Gesture support: Easier way to do seek while playing the movie.\n- Resume Function: Don't worry about closing your application suddenly.\n- TV Out: Both cable TV out and AirPlay are supported.\n- iTunes Backup: By default, we will not backup media data when you do iTunes sync or iCloud backup, and you can't see the files in iTunes, you can enable it in the settings page to backup your media data.\n\n* FAQ\n\n- How do I put files into GPlayer? \nTo add files to your GPlayer app, you have to go to iTunes, and select the “Apps” tab. At the bottom of this page, there’s a “File sharing” section – just select GPlayer in the list, and add files from there. Note that you don’t have to sync your iPhone or iPad to iTunes to add movies. Just drop files in the “File sharing” tab, and they’ll be uploaded immediately. You can even use a friend’s iTunes to add videos to your own iPhone. Also, adding files over WiFi is supported. Indeed, WiFi is significantly slower than USB, and ruins the battery life.\n\n- What kind of streams does GPlayer play? \nGPlayer is able to play RTSP and MMS streams. For now those can’t be added to the media library, but you can click an RTSP or MMS url in Safari or Mail for example.\nIf you want to use GPlayer to open HTTP/FTP streaming, add \"gplayer:\" prefix in the URL.\n\n- I want to explicitely open an attachment with GPlayer? \nIf you want to watch an attachment in GPlayer(from Mail for example), just do a long press on the attachment. A menu will pop-up that will let you pick GPlayer as a player.\n\n- iTunes won’t let me install GPlayer on my iPhone or iPod Touch? \nUnfortunately, we had to drop support for older iOS devices such as the iPhone 3G or the first two versions of iPods. Indeed, after some testing, we realized those weren’t fast enough to provide a pleasant experience.\n\n- Why HD MKV movies don’t play smoothly? \nCurrently, only iPad 2 supports 720p MKV file, that’s to be expected. The other iDevices have limited computing power, and cannot handle the complex task of decoding HD movies in real time.\n\n- The audio and the video is not in sync? \nThat is because the CPU is not power enough to do video decoding, you can try to enable \"Skip Frame\" in the settings page.\n\n- Is there a TV-out support? \nYep, supports iPod gen4, iPhone4, iPhone4S and iPad 1/2.\n\n* Contact us\n\nMail: gplayersupport@hotmail.com\nWebsite: gplayersupport.wordpress.com\n\n* If you want to help to translate GPlayer to your mother language, just drop a mail to gplayersupport@hotmail.com, that will help people in your country enjoy this software, and we will put your name in thanks page!"

      "label": "\"... the sound quality blew us away.\"- Gearburn.com\nMusic player with the most powerful and acurate equalizer in the app store as well as the most advanced playlist controls.\n\n+ Play music directly from your Music Library including podcasts and music video (audio only)\n+ Adjust the powerful parametric equalizer by moving the seven control points or type in the values directly.\n+ Adjust the EQ curve for your left and right ear separately (now extends from -30 to + 30 dB. Use the StereoEQ setting for that)\n+ Select from over 10 presets or save your own. You can even share them via email and import presets from other people via email.\n+ Full background support including remote control (from docks, headsets, car stereos)\n+ Visualize the music with the spectrum analyzer.\n+ Use AirPlay to listen on your AppleTV, or your Bluetooth headsets and even a dock. \n+ Use the pre-amp slider to adjust the overall boost or cut. Make sure to turn the slider down if you experience distortion. Use the auto-normalizer function to prevent clipping automatically and have the best dynamic range possible with your eq curve. (on/off in settings)\n+ Curve screen: curve redraws as controllers are dragged. Pinch to modify Q. Three stage clipping signal on preamp slider. Keyboard entry for pre-amp. Twitter/Facebook/Weibo integration to share your current EQ curve. Bypass.\n+ Crossfade between songs. Make sure to stop the music before changing the crossfade time slider.\n+ Now playing screen includes repeat (all, single no repeat) button and shuffles like the music app. Improved stability of on the fly modifications of the playlist.

You need to convert DRM songs. Apple Music Streaming uses copy-protected songs.\n\niCLOUD:\nOnly the Apple Music app can manage songs in iCloud (iTunes Match). You will need to make sure the songs are downloaded to your device to listen and enhance them via Equalizer. If you want to stream and eq your music, you can try our other app: CloudEQ. It allows you to stream and eq music from SoundCloud and your Dropbox account without the need for storage on your device.\n\nFrom the reviews:\n\nEXCELLENT PROGRAM\nI connect my iphone 4 to a car audio system, with the application the music began to sound incomparably better ....\nA little clear interface, but to understand it and understand need no more than 5-10 minutes. -- P_S_B_\n***\nLOVE IT\nThis is the EQ I have been looking for, and because of bad ratings I almost passed on it! I consider myself an aspiring audiophile and have the equipment -- Klipsch, Sunfire, Nottingham, Denon, Paradigim, etc. -- (and debt) to back it up. This EQ performs flawlessly and is very easy to use. It enhanced my music dramatically. Yes, dramatically! Just make sure you are running the recommended IOS, as the developer suggests. -- J. Paul DiMaggio\n***\n\n\nPLEASE if you have concerns or encounter problems with the app: post on http://www.audioforge.ca and we will explain how things work, until you can use all the features of the app to the fullest. Thank you"

      "label": "SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps. Studio Six Digital is dedicated to making the iPhone and Touch a professional audio and acoustics test device.\n\nCheck out our full line of professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the professional digital iPhone sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real-time analyzer,  FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the energy-time curve function, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time measurement, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for more great acoustical and audio test apps, have a look at AudioTools, our premier app for audio professionals."

While a chord is played, related chords are highlighted so you can easily find chord sequences that progress smoothly. Once you found a nice chord sequence, you can drag and drop chords into your song to build your composition upon it.\nIf you want to start your song with a melody and find a suitable chord progression, you can do that just as well: select notes and tap the search icon to show chords that match your melody fragment. It's real fun to experiment, seeing how different harmonic contexts affect the perception of the same melodic fragment.\n\n\nCreate Beautiful Melodies and Flowing Chord Progressions\n\nIn the piano roll, notes that are in harmony as well as the chords' root notes are highlighted. This makes it super easy to create leads, arpeggios and basslines and to experiment with different chord voicings to let your chord progressions flowing nicely. \n\n\nIntuitive Editing\n\nA simple, yet feature rich and context-aware user interface helps you build up your ideas into whole songs:\nGroup sections into song parts and arrange them via drag and drop. \nDuplicate, copy and paste, playback selected notes.\n\n\nFile Export\n\nExport and share your creations with audio file export.\nEdit your song in other Apps with MIDI-file export.\n\n\nUse your Favorite Instrument Apps\n\nIt's just more fun to explore and create with those awesome Instrument Apps that are available in the App Store: Klimper supports Inter-App-Audio Instruments like Animoog and Model 15 as well as Audio Unit Instruments like Ripplemaker and Mersenne.\n\n\nVideo Tutorials\n\nThe included tutorial will help you getting started.

It's simple, accurate, looks good, and the tuning information is worth the cost of the app alone.\" - www.mikedolbear.com\n\n“***** I never knew I could have this much fun tuning drums!” – Adamrod (App Store review)\n\n“***** Just tuned my first drum and this app is awesome!” – bburt85 (App Store review)\n\n“***** Buy this app if you are a drummer!!!” Lildrummerboy (App Store review)\n\nThe original and most innovative electronic drum tuning app - iDrumTune Pro brings unrivalled accuracy and features that have never been possible before for assisting with drum tuning. Built by world experts in drums and musical acoustics, and backed up by a detailed online training course on Drum Sound and Drum Tuning.\n\niDrumTune Pro includes the following features:\n\n* Pitch Tuning – to make your drums sing and allow you to play musical phrases around the kit\n\n* Lug Tuning – to ensure that the drumhead is evenly tuned and gives a smooth and warm tone\n\n* Resonant Head Tuning – to allow you to be sure that the two heads are working together and giving rich overtones\n\n* Spectrum Analyzer – so you can really start to understand what frequencies are excited and heard when playing the drums\n\n* Drum Kit Presets – so you can save and load your favourite tunings and share them with the world. Now also includes the interactive Drum Kit Designer feature.\n\n* The Science of Drum Tuning – and extensive manual on the science and art of drum tuning and getting the best out of iDrumTune Pro \n\niDrumTune is the first and by far the most intelligent and accurate system for analyzing drum sounds and assisting tuning – developed by drummers, music producers and acoustics research Professors. iDrumTune provides you with a measurement of the drumhead vibration frequency, much in the same way to an acoustic guitar tuner which measures the vibration frequency of a guitar string. In Pitch Tuning mode, you simply hold the iPhone over the center of a drum, about 2-4 inches away, and strike the drum in the center.\n\nThe iDrumTune readout shows the recorded sound waveform and gives the strongest frequency recorded. There is also a tuning indicator bar which shows the drumhead tuning relative to musical notes, so iDrumTune can be used to ensure that your drums are in key with each other or the song you are playing. A frequency spectrum view also allows more detailed analysis and helps with tuning the drum at the lug positions.\n\niDrumTune provides advanced tuning features including an intelligent filter function, Lug Tuning mode and Resonant Head Tuning mode. The filter allows unwanted frequencies to be ignored by the analysis algorithm, whilst Lug Tuning mode offers the simplest and most innovative method for tuning an even frequency response at the lug positions on the drumhead.\n\nThe Preset Manager allows you to save all your favourite drum tunings and call them up when you are in the middle of the process. Drum kits can also be exported and imported, so you can share your favorite tuning setups and load new ones in from other drummers.\n\nDrum Tuning isn’t easy, and drums don’t respond exactly the same way every time you hit them. For that reason, it's valuable to know a little about the science of drum tuning. iDrumTune includes a comprehensive text on the science of drums and drum tuning in order to help you get the best of iDrumTune and to become an expert drum tuner!\n\nWatch the iDrumTune tutorial videos and read reviews on iDrumTune at www.idrumtune.com"

      "label": "Benny Greb, well known for his contributions to the drumming education community, shared the approach that he has taken personally to develop his sense of groove and improve his own timing on his instrument in his course “The Art and Science of Groove”. Now with the Gap Click app, everyone can practice his method easily with a simple-to-use app! \n\nUnlike standard metronomes which simply state the time, Gap Click helps you improve your sense of time. Gap Click is more than a metronome with a focus on improving your ability to keep tempo, become more aware and comfortable with off beat clicks and by that, become bullet proof and accurate with all notes of the subdivision.\n\nGAP CLICK\nBy scrolling through the numbers of bars and patterns you can quickly configure a “gap” of time in which the metronome drops out. When the “one” comes back around, will your playing still be in time? How long of a gap can you play through and still maintain solid tempo?\n\nMOVING CLICK\nNext you can experiment with all kinds of off-beat patterns in the Gap Bar which moves the click from the downbeat position to a different location. Can you still play your instrument and maintain the downbeat internally even when you hear the click sound on an off-beat?\n\nBoth the “click” and the “gap” portion supports a variety of different syncopated patterns allowing you the ability to practice in binary or ternary rhythms - with more or less safety net depending on your settings.\n\nFeatures\n• Ability to choose from a variety of different syncopated patterns and # of measures for both the standard \"click\" as well as the \"gap\"\n• Use the nostalgic click wheel to find the right tempo or tap to set your desired tempo from 10 to 300bpm\n• Standard quarter-note time signatures: 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4\n\nPersonalize\n• See visual feedback for each note or rest that is played\n• Accent beat 1 of each measure or turn accents off for a greater challenge\n• Flash the screen for a visual indication when switching from the \"click\" to the \"gap\"\n• Find your favorite sound from a variety of click samples hand-picked by Benny\n\nBuy Once, Use Forever\n• There are no In-App Purchases - a one time purchase includes all current and future features. \n\nTESTIMONIALS\nWhat professionals are saying about GAP CLICK:\n• \"The skills you can sharpen by using this app are integral for what it takes to be a professional drummer in any genre.\" - Matt Halpern\n• \"When I first opened the app, it made (simple) sense, without a tutorial.\" - Chris Coleman\n• \"This app helps you lock in the pocket on a whole different level.\" - Luke Holland\n• \"The Gap Click app is something that every drummer should have in their toolbox.\" - Jared Falk, Drumeo\n\nWhat our users are saying about GAP CLICK: \n• \"If you think you have good timing, this will really put you in your place.\"\n• \"Gone are the days of programming gap clicks!\"\n• \"I’ve never had so much fun being destroyed in my practice session.\"\n• \"This is by far the best money I’ve ever spent on a practice tool.\"\n\nABOUT BENNY GREB\nBenny Greb is one of the most respected drummers in the world today. Not only has he headlined nearly every major drum festival and toured with his clinics and drum camps worldwide, but he is also recognized as a composer and bandleader in his own band Moving Parts, which won him the renowned “ECHO Jazz” award - the German equivalent to The Grammys in jazz.\n\nBenny Greb published two of the most successful and critically acclaimed educational products, “The Language of Drumming” and “The Art and Science of Groove” and he has helped create many signature products available to drummers today.\n\nFind him online at https://www.bennygreb.de as well as on social media."

      "label": "XAir Monitor Mixer is a personal monitor mixer for select Behringer and Midas digital mixers. It allows each musician on stage to choose exactly what they hear in their monitor without affecting (or being able to affect, even by accident) the band's main mix.\n\nXAir Monitor Mixer supports the Behringer X18, XR18, XR16, XR12, and the Midas MR18 and MR12.\n\nXAir Monitor Mixer deliberately does not include controls that would allow a musician on stage to accidentally mute channels or otherwise alter the main mix.\n\nUsage:\n\n1. Connect to the same WiFi network as the XR18.  In most cases, this should be enough for the app to find your mixer. However, if your sound engineer has changed the default address of the mixer, you'll have to enter that address in the app's connection screen.\n2. Choose which monitor you want to mix. If your sound engineer hasn't named these in a way that makes it obvious which is yours, ask him which is yours.\n3. Mix away. :)\n\nIf you have feedback, suggestions, or bug reports, please visit the forums at xairmonitormixer.tetzfiles.com or send an email to xairmonitormixer@tetzfiles.com.\n\nNote: support for mixers other than XR18 was recently added. If you run into any issues, please let us know. Ensuring proper compatibility with all supported mixers is our top priority."

It will leave out beats randomly to force you to strengthen your own inner time-keeping muscles, and it has other cool features for odd meters, drum machine-style patterns, and more... this is an awesome learning, grooving, solidifying tool.\"\n\nStrengthen your inner sense of rhythm! Time Guru is the only metronome with the ability to mute its sound at random, in sequenced patterns, or both, so that you can assess whether you tend to rush or drag or loose your place with odd meters. Time Guru can periodically leave you on your own so that you strengthen your own internal sense of time, rather than relying on the constant, rigid, external time keeping of a metronome. It's like training wheels that sometimes come up off the ground.\n\nTime Guru also features:  \n-the ability to play in different time signatures or sequences of time signatures\n-create rhythmic drum-machine like patterns\n-save presets for tempo, meter, sound and muting-\n-35 loud sound sets; \n-Human or robot voice counting in English, Chinese, French, German or Russian - great for teaching!\n-tap tempo (5 to 300 BPM range)\n-super accurate, rock-solid timing via a customized audio engine. \n\nAnd of course it can function as a normal metronome. \n\nNoTreble.com says: \"I love the aesthetic and layout of Time Guru. It’s very simple and elegant. Time Guru also offers ability to set randomness of your subdivisions (great for testing your internal clock)….There is one thing that Time Guru does that I absolutely love, and for which, this app will always live on my iPhone – at the top of the screen, you will see a series of numbers (1-7). When you press a number, it is set first in a sequence and you can choose a subdivision that will then repeat that number of times (or set it to rest that number of times). Sound confusing? It isn’t, because the layout is so simple. Every time you press a new number, it is set next in the sequence and you choose your continue to choose your subdivisions.\""

      "label": "The ELECTRIBE reborn in an even smaller form A full-fledged rhythm machine for iPhone\n\n● Featured in \"Best Music Apps\"\n● Featured in \"Best New Apps\"\n\nThis app’s intuitive operation allows anyone to easily create powerful beats on the ELECTRIBE series. The enormously popular ELECTRIBE-R instantly became a must-have item for track-makers around the world, and now it’s been reborn as an app for iPhone.\n\nWith this app, we’ve effectively “put the original hardware chassis into your iPhone,” by faithfully reproducing the sound engine and design of the ELECTRIBE-R. We’ve also included the latest preset patterns and many new functions that are currently featured on the “iELECTRIBE for iPad”, released in 2010. , taking a further evolutionary step in technology. Taking advantage of the ease of use that you expect on iPhone, we have maximized the intuitive nature of the ELECTRIBE to make this new product worthy of its name: the iELECTRIBE mkII.\n\nIt won’t take long for you to enjoy the ultimate experience of the Electribe series. This apps intuitive nature and familiar interface make it easy to create beats with an analog feel that’s like nothing else.\n\n● Amazing rhythm machine that generates powerful grooves\nWe’ve perfectly replicated the thick-sounding synth engine of the ELECTRIBE-R and its intuitive step sequencer. Now you can instantly obtain extreme tonal changes and powerful rhythms with just one touch\nNot only can iELECTRIBE for iPhone be easily enjoyed by anyone, but it also allows detailed beat-making that transcends iPhone specs. In addition to playing back the provided audio data, you can also freely synthesize sounds from a single waveform and combine those sounds into your own original beats. This allows for the true experience of music production that connects all musicians.\n\n● Three hundred built-in rhythm patterns that only this app can produce\nWith 64 of the latest preset patterns, 192 from the first-generation ELECTRIBE-R, and 32 template patterns for various genres, this app successfully draws out the full potential of the thick sounding analog beats. There are approximately 300 inimitable rhythm patterns that you’ll hear only from iELECTRIBE for iPhone. Electro, house, techno, drum'n'bass, dubstep, hip hop, techno pop, and IDM are some of the wide range of electronic music genres that are provided.\n\n● An ELECTRIBE that you can put in your pocket and take anywhere\nWhether you’re on the train or bus while commuting to school or to work, at a coffee shop, or in your bedroom, you can enjoy beat-making anywhere and anytime you like. Your completed beats can be transferred to your DAW software via the audio export function. You can also use the WIST function to play wirelessly with a friend using two devices simultaneously.\n\n● Powerful functions that bring infinite possibilities to your grooves\nWe’ve packed maximum potential into this machine with eight types of powerful master effects featured on the upper-level models of the ELECTRIBE. This includes the ring modulation function of the ELECTRIBE-R and the cross-modulation function of the ELECTRIBE-R mkII. This app allows you to switch back and forth to choose between the two. It also includes the BEAT FLUTTER function that uses a proprietary randomizer to create fresh rhythms and the motion sequence function that remembers your knob movements. In addition, you can use an external USB-MIDI device such as the nanoPAD or nanoKONTROL for performance and control. There’s also support for the latest iOS technologies such as Inter-App Audio, Audiobus, Virtual MIDI, and iCloud.\n\nMore info at korg.com"

Spotify's API currently only lets the app play 30 seconds of each song, although entire songs are coming soon.\n• As stated above, the app currently plays 30 second snippets of the best parts of songs, which should be more than enough to wake up.\n• Supports Snoozing, Days to Repeat, and the other features you'd expect from an alarm clock\n• The maker of this app is not attached to Spotify in any way. The app simply plays Spotify Content from Spotify's API.\n• Most but not all Spotify songs are currently available on the app. This is outside my control, and up to which artists approve third party app usage of their content. The selection size has improved since Version 1 and is continuing to do so. Artists not on the app include Bob Marley, Ariana Grande, and Frank Ocean. Please email me BEFORE downloading the app if there's a specific song you are looking for and I can quickly check. Email me at iam@willsaid.com and I will get back to you very quickly!"

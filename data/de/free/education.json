Why not try it out and take on sailor Fiete!\nIn what is surely the most beautiful memo game, Seemann Fiete invites you to a game of “looking for pairs” in his lighthouse. Behind every porthole of the lighthouse, another exciting memo game with different themes and varying degrees of difficulty awaits you.\n\nIn Fiete Match, Fiete is the children’s opponent. In this memo game, Fiete picks up the cards and shows different reactions just like a real player - depending on whether he wins or loses. If you take a little longer to decide, Fiete sometimes even starts to yawn. The memo game in the lighthouse is thus guaranteed to make you laugh :)\n\nThis memo game is hand-drawn and can be played at various levels of difficulty. You can set the number of memo cards and also how well Fiete should play. The higher the floor in the lighthouse the trickier the tasks.  \n\nIn addition to logic, abstraction and memo, this hidden pairs game also offers kids a fun way and train their empathy.\n\nCONTENT\n\nOur card challenges include:\n\nMarine animals:\nMatch up the pairs!\n\nNautical flags:\nFind pairs with abstract images!\n\nWorld Tour:\nUse a combination of images and abstract symbols to find the matching pairs!\n\nVehicles:\nFind logical relationships in the cards.\n\nCount:\nAssign an image to the correct number.\n\nCalculation:\nFind the correct solution to the calculations!\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\n- Memo game with sailor Fiete as real opponent\n- Hand-drawn\n- Various levels of difficulty\n- Funny animations\n\nCHILDREN IMPROVE\n\n- Motor skills\n- Retentiveness / brain memory\n- Powers of deduction  \n- Faculty of abstraction\n- Logical thinking\n- Media literacy\n\nAWARDS\n\n***Best Learning Game 2013***\n- German developer prize -\n\n***Gold Award for Excellent Children's Apps*** \n- kinderappgarten.de -\n\n***Winner of the Big Indie Pitch***\n- SEGA -\n\nSUPPORT INFORMATION\n\nWe do our best to test our apps on all devices.

      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

      "label": "The game Fiete Puzzle lets children discover cute animated animals in beautiful picture book landscapes. Impressive camera tracking shots turn this puzzle into something special. The intuitive controls and large puzzle pieces are ideal for infants.\n\nIn the puzzle app, the children visit farm and zoo animals with their hero Fiete and discover fire brigade vehicles, building site vehicles and the hustle and bustle of the port, shop for groceries with Fiete in the supermarket, have a birthday party, relax at the campfire, and put Fiete and his friends to bed at the end of the day.\n\nInfants, nursery children and preschoolers will not get enough of the lovingly illustrated puzzles. Inspired by classical lift-out puzzles, the educational game Fiete Puzzle is very easy to play.\n\nThe puzzle game playfully develops language skills, visual perception, and the ability to recognise shapes.\n\nGAME PREMISE\n\n- Each puzzle is a big, beautiful picture book scene. \n- Impressive camera tracking shots literally draw children into the scenery of each puzzle game. \n- At each camera stop, there are missing puzzle pieces in the picture.\n- Puzzle pieces are displayed to the children in the upper right-hand corner of the playing field. The children must find out where the puzzle part fits in and shift it to the right place in the game with their fingers.\n- The final puzzle part is not just any puzzle part, but a very special one - its Sailor Fiete himself. \n- After the children have inserted the puzzle part into the right place with Fiete, the puzzle is finished and the children are rewarded with an animation.\n- After each puzzle game, the children can move through the puzzle and observe their complete work, before moving on to the next animated puzzle game. This is where the parents and children have time to think up little stories about the respective puzzle motif.\n\nCONTENTS\n\n- 9 puzzles with beautiful motifs and exciting themes from the children´s world.\nNo advertising for third-party products\n\nPUZZLE MOTIFS\n\nFarm\nZoo\nFire Brigade\nSupermarket\nBirthday\nBuilding site\nPort\nCampfire\nGood night\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nBeautifully illustrated images\nEasy to use\nFun with learning\nGorgeous animations\nGreat sound effects\nClear, direct feedback system  \n\nCHILDREN IMPROVE\n\nLogical thinking\nAttention\nConcentration\nMedia literacy\nVisual perception\nEye-hand coordination\nLanguage development\nShape recognition\nCognitive skills\n\nTO PARENTS\n\nDear mums and dads, we ourselves are parents, and only make apps that we would not hesitate to play with our own children.

      "label": "The math game Fiete Math makes counting easy for kids to understand. Based on the educational approach of Montessori, numbers are touchable objects that your child can group, combine and cut up. \nIn this math app children can discover the links between amounts and numbers and develop their confidence in dealing with them. This makes maths fun for kids.\n\nGAME PREMISE\n\nIn this math game the tasks take the form of wonderful harbor scenarios from all around the world. Incoming ships must be loaded by your kids. Boxes can be grouped together and separated just like building blocks. This will change the cargo number. Kids can play in new countries and harbors, win medals and unlock larger ships. This visible progression means more motivation to keep on playing.\n\nTHE BACKGROUND OF THIS APP - AN UNDERESTIMATED PROBLEM\n\nSeparating and combining numbers are important foundations to develop calculation strategies. Even an intense study of number systems and mathematic strategies during a normal school day is often not enough. Students who need more time can easily fall behind. Any problems in math are often left to be dealt with by an after-school tutor.\n\nOUR SOLUTION - AN APP WITH AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH\n\nIf your child doesn't understand the basics of numbers, repeatedly trying to solve mathematical problems will not help. This app uses a different approach.\n\nChildren learn through new, fun experiences. With this app, your child will experience and learn about the links between amounts and numbers through their own experimentation.\n\nCHILDREN IMPROVE\n\n• Fiete Math develops understanding of the number system, makes 5 and 10 structures usable and shows calculation methods.\n• The app lets your child play with numbers like building blocks. Abstract numbers are made into objects.\n• There are no time limits. Your child can complete the tasks at his or her own speed and gather important knowledge.\n\nThis App is not just a digital copy of a maths book. It innovatively uses the opportunities offered by touchscreen devices to make number systems more understandable.\n\nTo maintain your child’s motivation, we’ve made sure that this math app is fun like any other game. Best case scenario: your child won’t want to put Fiete Math down. Try that with a math textbook ;-)\n\nCONTENTS\n\n1. 1,2,3,...\nCounting, recognising groups\n\n2. SPLITTING NUMBERS\nDividing numbers in different ways, getting to know numbers up to 20\n\n3. THE MAGIC 5\nEasy calculations with 5s, progression to 10s, introduction to the decimal system\n\n4. MATH STRATEGIES\nDoubling and halving, swapping, neighbor tasks, changes in the same or the opposite direction\n\n5. PLUS\nPerfect packages, tasks from easy to hard, inverted tasks\n\n6. MINUS\nPerfect packages, tasks from easy to hard, inverted tasks\n\n7. PRACTISING\nPractice adding and subtracting\n\nThe app includes over 1,000 consecutive tasks using numbers up to 30. Once these are complete, the app randomly creates tasks from the relevant topic so the fun can go on for longer.\n\nFEEDBACK PLEASE\n\nTo develop this app, we carried out intensive research with education specialists and looked at very different teaching methods. We looked into the Montessori method, compared lesson plans, and delved into math books and textbooks by various publishers. We read teachers' manuals and spoke with educators, teachers and tutors. The most important thing is real feedback. We want to continue improving this app. Write to us with your experiences and ideas for Fiete Math: support@ahoiii.com\n\nVisit Fiete online at: www.ahoiii.com\nBeautiful Fiete products are available in our shop: www.shop.ahoiii.com\nBecome a fan!

We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

      "label": "EDURINO führt Kinder im Alter von 4-8 Jahren spielerisch und verantwortungsbewusst an digitale Medien heran. In den Lernspielen werden Schul- und Zukunftskompetenzen gefördert.\n\nKinder begeben sich je nach gewähltem Lerninhalt gemeinsam mit unterschiedlichen Spielfiguren auf Lernreisen in unbekannte Welten. Sie befreien diese jeweils durch über 20 Lernspiele von den kleinen, süßen Chaosmonstern. In der „Welt der Worte“ unterstützen sie beispielsweise die Füchsin Mika darin, Ordnung zu schaffen und erlernen dabei Grundkenntnisse für das Lesen und Schreiben. Die Spiele sind auch nach der Freischaltung aller Lerninhalte beliebig oft wiederholbar und werden in Updates zusätzlich durch kleinere Spiele ergänzt. \n \nEDURINO wird gemeinsam mit PädagogInnen und LogopädInnen entwickelt und wöchentlich in unseren Partnerkindergärten getestet. Die App ist werbefrei, ohne In-App-Käufe und offline spielbar. Durch einen gesicherten Elternbereich, in dem die Bildschirmzeit angepasst und der Spielstand eingesehen werden kann, gibt die App Kindern die Möglichkeit, selbstständig zu spielen und zu lernen.\n \n \nWie funktioniert Edurino?\n \nDie EDURINO Lernapp funktioniert mit haptischen Spielfiguren und einem mit ErgotherapeutInnen entwickelten Dreikantstift. Die EDURINO Produkte können auf www.edurino.com erworben werden.\n \nDie Spielfiguren sind der Schlüssel zur digitalen Welt. Mit dem Aufdrücken der Spielfigur auf ein Smartphone oder Tablet werden die gewünschten Lernspiele, wie z.B. Erstes Lesen & Schreiben, Zahlen & Mengen oder Erstes Englisch in der EDURINO App freigeschaltet. \n \nDer ergonomische Dreikantstift unterstützt Links- und RechtshänderInnen bei der Entwicklung einer lockeren Stifthaltung und trainiert in jeder Lernreise die Schreibmotorik durch abwechslungsreiche Übungen.\n \n \nWeitere Informationen\n \nhttps://www.edurino.com/\nhttps://edurino.com/policies/privacy-policy\nhttps://edurino.com/policies/terms-of-service"

      "label": "Tracing Projector is your personal portable drawing and composition tool.\n\nHaving Tracing Projector is like always having a sheet of tracing paper with you! Choose any image you'd like to draw, take a photo, or choose from hundreds of images supplied in the app; then look at your screen while you trace the image on paper!\n\n- Learn to Draw! Learn proportions and important lines by tracing photos of anything! Use several filters to enhance your photo, making it easier to trace.\n\n- Make real one-of-a-kind artwork you can hang on your wall! Send unique greetings on social media! Friends and family will love to see your animated drawings!\n\n- Show off your skills! Record a video while you draw and share it on your favorite social network. Your friends will be amazed! Choose from time-lapse and regular speeds, and include a narrative if you want to. \n\n- Great for face painting or artistic makeup!\n\n- Great for school projects! Need to draw an image from a book on a poster? Trace it!\n\n- Kick-start your painting or portrait! Transfer your idea from a photo to your drawing canvas to get the proportions right.\n\n- Match the Composition! Transfer your plan from a sketch to the scrapbook page or photo wall! \n\n- Challenge yourself to sketch the essence of the image before the timer runs out! Focus on composition and structure. Freehand the fine details afterward, or disable Quick Sketch and trace them directly. (Disabling requires a one-time purchase.)\n\nSeveral tools make it really easy to trace your image:\n\n- Light Table - lock your screen, turn up the brightness, and trace the image from your screen directly!\n\n- Handheld Mode -- On supported devices, Augmented Reality keeps your tracing image steady while you hold your device at a comfortable angle. (demo video https://youtu.be/YJeK5Sjdi1Q). Requires iOS 11.3 or later on iPhone 6s/6s Plus or iPad Pro and later. Works best on stable horizontal and vertical surfaces with good light and some visible surface detail.\n\n- Lock the camera focus to keep the image steady while you trace.\n\n- Lock the canvas area to keep your layout and alignment while you zoom in to get a close look at your work in progress.\n\n- Several Filter modes enhance your image, increasing contrast to give you a better result.\n\n- Use the flashlight to light up your drawing. (requires Full Version)\n\n- Use the selfie camera and draw on your face. (requires Full Version)\n\n\nOther features make it fun and easy to share your creations with your friends.\n\n- Video recording in Time Lapse mode to make things smaller and faster and cooler. You can enable normal-speed and audio on the Settings screen.\n\n- The recorded video or snapshot includes a small thumbnail of the tracing image (with an option to turn that off).\n\n- Your videos and snapshots are stored automatically and available to share later from within the app, the Files app, or iTunes.\n\n- Sharing your videos and photos is easy with a preview screen and saved photos/videos!\n\n- Interrupted while recording your drawing? No problem - Combine multiple videos to create a single video for sharing! Use the Edit feature on the Saved Files screen: select two movies and tap Join.\n\n\nTracing Projector is Enhanced For 3D Touch! Start right away from the camera or photo album from the home screen! Force-touch on the tracing image to peek at your progress while you draw!\n\n\nNotes:\n- For best results, stabilize your device above your drawing surface. A stack of books, drinking glass, or tripod works best.\n- The app requires access to your camera in order to present its overlay for drawing.\n- The app requires access to your photos in order to load an image to trace and to save the video of your drawing.\n- The app optionally uses your microphone when recording a video while you draw."

      "label": "Lingvist is the language learning app built by scientists and language experts that teaches vocabulary better than anyone else in the world. The depth of our courses combined with the latest research in machine learning gets you using a language with high proficiency, fast.\n\nGET LEVEL PLACED FOR FREE - TRY LINGVIST\n\nLEARN 10 LANGUAGES: English, German, French, Dutch, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Estonian, Japanese and Russian.\n\n=====\n\nWHY LINGVIST?\n\nFOLLOW CONVERSATIONS QUICKLY\nLearn the vocabulary that appears most often in a language first, allowing you to accelerate your learning.\n\nREAD, WRITE, SPEAK, AND LISTEN\nPerfect your pronunciation using sophisticated speech recognition technology or type your answers. Every sentence has audio to ensure you hone your listening skills.\n\nFOR SERIOUS LEARNERS\nYour learning efficiency is our focus. Enjoy a clean UI with no advertising, no unnecessary clicks, and no distractions.\n\nREMEMBER A LANGUAGE FOREVER\nUsing scientifically proven spaced repetition methodology, the vocabulary gets fixed in your long-term memory over time. You can even see your progress on increasing the intervals in the app.\n\nLEARN GRAMMAR IN CONTEXT OR AS A FOCUS\nAcquire grammar passively (inductive learning) like a native with our bite-sized sentences, or practice conjugating French verbs in our French course.\n\nSPECIALIST VOCABULARY FOR YOU\nSubmit your own words, images, or text and Lingvist will automatically gather vocabulary related to the theme for you to learn. Whether it’s Harry Potter in German or Spanish colors, you can learn the words most important to you (available in some courses).\n\nMOTIVATIONAL STATISTICS\nPacked with data on your learning progress, you’ll be able to chart your path to success.\n\nA MUST-HAVE TOOL IN YOUR BAG\nDo you live in your target country, use a tutor or language school, or even read books, listen to podcasts, or watch content in your target language? Lingvist works best when used in parallel with other learning methods. It’s the difference between passing your test or acing it.\n\nLEARN BY DOING\nYou will learn vocabulary or conjugations (available in some courses) by “guessing” the answer. Getting it wrong is one of the fastest ways to learn, and your brain will start to remember very quickly.\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe playlist feature lets you listen to bite-sized sentences in hands-free mode.\n\nPERSONALIZED SETTINGS\nEvery learner is different. Personalize your learning to suit you, with various settings allowing you to learn with extra slow speech, strict diacritics, and even grammar tables.\n\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING PLAN\nWe'll serve you new words that are most relevant to you. As we measure your memory curves, we ask you to repeat words at the optimal time – just before you forget them. This way, you'll always know what to learn next.\n\nLANGUAGE LEARNING MADE EASY\nWhether you are planning on spending this summer in Italy and need to learn Italian, or your next adventure is taking up a course in Germany and you need an app to learn German, we have you covered. Our language learning techniques will help you to get fluent in over 9 languages.\n\n=====\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to the full learning materials for all languages we offer. Each subscription will be automatically renewed unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current payment period. When a subscription is canceled, access to the app's courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nVisit our blog to get tips, tricks, and interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Lingvist blog: https://lingvist.com/blog/\n\nFollow us to get interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/theLingvist\n▸▸ Instagram: instagram.com/thelingvist/\n▸▸ Twitter: https://twitter.com/lingvist\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://lingvist.com/privacy-policy/\nTerms of Use: https://lingvist.com/tos/"

      "label": "FLORA INCOGNITA - DISCOVER THE DIVERSITY OF NATURE\n\nWhat's blooming? With the Flora Incognita app, this question is quickly answered. Take a picture of a plant, find out what it's called and learn everything you want to know with the help of a fact sheet. Highly precise algorithms based on artificial intelligence identify wild plants even when they are not (yet) in bloom!\n\nIn the Flora Incognita app you can easily view all your collected plant finds in a observation list. Maps show where you have found your plants. This way you can see how your knowledge about wild plants is growing.\n\nBut Flora Incognita is even more! The app is free of charge and without advertising, because it is part of a scientific research project that aims to improve nature conservation. The collected observations are used to answer scientific research questions that deal, for example, with the spread of invasive species or the effects of climate change on biotopes.\n\nIn regular stories, you will learn about news from the project, get insights into the scientific work or will be made curious about what is happening in nature right now.\n\nWHY SHOULD YOU USE FLORA INCOGNITA?\n- Identify wild plants simply by taking a photo with your smartphone\n- Learn more about plant species with the help of extensive plant profiles\n- Collect your findings in your observation list\n- Become part of an innovative scientific community\n- Share your findings on Twitter, Instagram & Co!\n\nHOW GOOD IS FLORA INCOGNITA?\nSpecies identification with Flora Incognita is based on Deep Learning algorithms that have an accuracy of well over 90%. It is important to take sharp and as close as possible pictures of plant parts such as flower, leaf, bark or fruit for a high identification accuracy.\n\nWOULD YOU LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT OUR PROJECT?\nVisit our website at www.floraincognita.com or follow us on social media. You can find us on Twitter (@Flora_Incognita), Instagram (@flora.incognita) and Facebook (@flora.incognita).\n\nIS THE APP REALLY FREE OF CHARGE AND ADVERTISING?\nYes. You can use Flora Incognita anytime, as long as you want. It is free to use, with no ads, no premium version and no subscription. But maybe you will enjoy searching and identifying plants so much that it will become a new hobby. We have received this feedback many times!\n\nWHO DEVELOPED FLORA INCOGNITA?\nThe Flora Incognita app is developed by scientists from the Technical University of Ilmenau and the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry Jena. Its development was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation with funds from the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety as well as the Thuringian Ministry for the Environment, Energy and Nature Conservation and the Foundation for Nature Conservation Thuringia. The project was awarded as an official project of the \"UN Decade of Biodiversity\" and won the Thuringian Research Award in 2020."

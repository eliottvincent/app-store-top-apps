      "label": "The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) – in its capacity as the central federal institution for public health and as the German national public health institute – publishes the Corona-Warn-App on behalf of the German government The app serves as a digital complement to distancing, hygiene and wearing masks. Additionally, it provides a functionality to add your digital vaccination certificates to prove your vaccination status. It uses Bluetooth technology and the Apple Exposure Notification APIs. The app is designed to help break infection chains by informing you if you were recently close to someone who subsequently tested positive for corona. However, at no time does it collect any personal information. Who you are and where you are remain secret – and your privacy is well-protected.\n\nHOW THE APP WORKS\n\nExposure logging is the core of the app and should always be active. When enabled, smartphones exchange encrypted random IDs with other devices using Bluetooth. \n\nThe random IDs only provide information about the duration and distance of an encounter. No one is able to identify the person behind these IDs. The Corona-Warn-App does not collect any information about the location of the encounter or that of its users.\n\nBased on maximum corona incubation times, the random IDs your smartphone collects are stored in an exposure log for 14 days and then deleted. If a person is diagnosed with corona and chooses to share his/her own smartphone’s random IDs, all persons previously encountered will then be notified anonymously.\n\nNo one will know when, where or with whom the exposure event took place. The infected person remains anonymous.\n\nIn addition to the exposure notifications, affected users will receive clear recommendations for action. Important: Information about the notified persons is not accessible at any time.\n\nHOW YOUR DATA IS PROTECTED\n\nThe Corona-Warn-App is designed to be your daily companion, without knowing your identity. This is why the app cannot tell anyone who you are. Data protection is fully guaranteed throughout the app’s entire service life.\n\n• No registration required: No email address and no name need to be submitted.\n• No personal information is transmitted: When you encounter another person using the app, your smartphones only exchange random IDs. They measure the time and distance of an encounter, but do not allow to identify persons or find out locations.\n• Decentralized storage: Data is stored only on the smartphone itself and deleted after 14 days.\n• No third-party access: Neither the person reporting a proven corona infection, nor those who have been notified can be traced – not by the German government, the Robert Koch Institute, any other user, nor by Apple.\n\nThis app is not intended for any use outside of Germany. Corona-Warn-App is the main corona app for Germany, where it is interconnected with the national health care system. Despite of the above, Corona-Warn-App is also available in this country. It is provided for anyone living, working, vacationing, or visiting Germany regularly or for an extended period of time.\n\nThe terms of use for the Corona-Warn-App apply: https://www.coronawarn.app/assets/documents/cwa-eula-en.pdf. By installing and using this app, you accept these terms of use."

      "label": "The Robert Koch Institute (RKI), as the central institution of the Federal Government in the field of public health and as the national public health institute, publishes the CovPass app for the German Federal Government. The app allows the digital COVID certificates of the EU to be stored directly on the smartphone. Anyone who uses it can prove their vaccination protection or recovery quickly and securely. The app can also be used to store the EU's digital COVID certificates of other people (for example family members) on the smartphone. Users of the app decide when and to whom they show their information and data.\n\n\nHOW THE APP WORKS\n\nEvidence of Corona vaccinations and recovery from Corona infection is the central function of the CovPass app. Whenever users prove their Corona status, only the information and data necessary for verification is displayed via QR code. \n\nThe QR code provides information about the validity of a vaccination or recovery certificate. For clear identification, the name and date of birth are also displayed during a check. \n\nCorona vaccinations are certified with the EU digital COVID vaccination certificate upon request. The certificate is generated by medical staff after the vaccination. It contains a QR code that can be scanned with the CovPass app. Simply hold the camera of the smartphone over the QR code and all the information of the certificate is loaded onto the smartphone. The current QR code is then displayed on the app's home screen. This can be shown if required.\n\nRecovery from a Corona infection is certified with the EU digital COVID recovery certificate. You can obtain the recovery certificate from your family doctor or local health office after surviving a Corona infection. It contains a QR code that can be scanned with the app. The certificate of recovery is then documented on the smartphone. \n\nEU digital COVID certificates from other people (for example family members) can also be managed on the smartphone. \n\nThe data of the EU digital COVID certificate is stored locally on the smartphone. Only the users decide when and to whom they show the information and data.\n\n\nHOW THE DATA REMAINS SECURE\n\nData protection is maintained throughout the entire period of use. \n- No registration: No registration with an e-mail address is necessary.\n- Local data storage: Your complete data is only stored on your smartphone.\n- Data minimization: The QR code is displayed with the minimum amount of data agreed in the EU. After the QR code has been checked, only the status of the certificate, the name, and the date of birth are displayed.  \n- Cryptographic security: The QR code is protected with a strong signature and cannot be forged."

My clear recommendation!\" - Dr. Dominik Dotzauer, physician\n\n\"Finally, an app that creates effective strength training plans for women too!\" - Sabrina Börke, sports scientist\n\nCUSTOM TRAINING PLANS\nAll plans created by the app are science based and tailored to your needs. For example, you decide how often you want to train and which muscles you want to focus on. Of course, you can also create your own plans!\n\nPROGRESSION RECOMMENDATIONS\nOur algorithm analyzes your performance in past workouts and gives you precise recommendations of how much weight and how many reps you should go for.\n\nEASY TRACKING\nTrack weights, reps, RIR, and take notes on exercises. The rest timer notifies you when it's time for the next set.\n\nCOLLECT ACHIEVEMENTS\nAfter every workout we'll show you a list of your personal records and other achievements, like performing an exercise with 100 lbs for the first time.\n\nHUGE EXERCISE DATABASE\n450+ exercise videos ensure you perform every exercise effectively and safely. In the exercise evaluations, you can find details about how good an exercise is for building muscle. The exercises are categorized by muscle and equipment, so you can quickly find suitable exercises. You can also add your own exercises for increased customization.\n\nINSIGHTS\nFind correlations and optimize your training! For example, you can see how many sets you have performed for the chest in the last 3 months and how your bench press performance has progressed as a result.\n\nEXTENSIVE PERIODIZATION\nStructure your training in cycles, schedule deloads, and plan. For example, you can create a plan where the number of sets and the level of effort (RIR) are increased from week to week.\n\nSHARE PLANS\nShare your plan with friends, followers or coaching clients. Recipients can customize the shared plan to their needs.\n\nDATA EXPORT\nEasily export your training data as a .csv file and open it with apps like Excel.\n\nAPPLE HEALTH\nSync your bodyweight, body fat percentage and important workout data with the Apple Health app!\n\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\nUse Alpha Progression for free or upgrade to the Pro version. The plan generator, progression recommendations, graphical analytics and other features are only available to Pro users.\n\nYou can choose between two subscription options: pay month by month, or commit to your training with Alpha Progression for a year and receive a discount! When you subscribe for the first time, you automatically get a free two-week trial period.\n\nDuring your trial period you can use all of the Pro features. The initial term of your paid subscription begins after the trial period and only if you did not cancel your subscription via the App Store.\n\nYour subscription will automatically renew for the subscription length if you do not cancel it via the App Store at least 24 hours before its end.\n\nDo you have questions about the app?

Over 40 different, evidence-based, techniques will help you get - and stay - smoke free. See and celebrate how long you’ve been quit, how your health is improving how much money you're saving, how many cigarettes you've not smoked, how much life you've regained, and more. \n\nGet tips on dealing with cravings, use the map to see where they congregate, add notes to see what patterns can be identified and use the graph to see how they're decreasing. Save up for treats to buy yourself with the money saved from not smoking, remind yourself why it is so important that you stay strong and get a free certificate when you’re successful. \n\nAll of which is free to use and free of ads. \n\nIf you need extra help go Pro. Our stop smoking plan gives you short daily ‘Missions’ and is proven to double your chances of quitting. Our AI Quit Coach provides a whole host of tools and a powerful sense of accountability, and is proven to further increase your chances of success. Pro gives you more help with cravings, more badges and more customization options too. \n\nBut if you really want to make this time THE time then Blitz your Quit with a proven stop smoking plan tailored to your needs by an expert advisor; four booster check-ins to get you through the first month; 24/7 access to advisors outside these times; endless support from other quitters in our chat; plus all the Pro features too. \n\nThis is the most comprehensive stop smoking program ever put into an app. \n\nSubscription details \nIf you choose to subscribe you get access to the Pro features of the app (but not Blitz your Quit, which is a separate feature).

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

Statistics also show you in which situations you are most often at risk, so that you can avoid them or approach them differently in the future.\n\nAwards:\nYou regularly receive awards for milestones achieved on your way to becoming a non-smoker, which you can share with family and friends.\n\nSavings goals:\nSet savings goals and watch getting closer and closer to them becasue of the money you save.\n\n100 reasons:\nIf you have a strong cigarette craving, 100 reasons to not smoke a cigarette will help you.\n\nApple Watch App:\nThe Apple Watch app quickly shows you the most important numbers of your non-smoking career.\n\nWidget:\nThe widget quickly shows you the most important numbers of your non-smoking career. \n\n\n\nPro support is offered as a one-time purchase or as a subscription either weekly for $ 1.99 or monthly for $ 6.99.

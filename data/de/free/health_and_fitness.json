      "label": "The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) – in its capacity as the central federal institution for public health and as the German national public health institute – publishes the Corona-Warn-App on behalf of the German government The app serves as a digital complement to distancing, hygiene and wearing masks. Additionally, it provides a functionality to add your digital vaccination certificates to prove your vaccination status. It uses Bluetooth technology and the Apple Exposure Notification APIs. The app is designed to help break infection chains by informing you if you were recently close to someone who subsequently tested positive for corona. However, at no time does it collect any personal information. Who you are and where you are remain secret – and your privacy is well-protected.\n\nHOW THE APP WORKS\n\nExposure logging is the core of the app and should always be active. When enabled, smartphones exchange encrypted random IDs with other devices using Bluetooth. \n\nThe random IDs only provide information about the duration and distance of an encounter. No one is able to identify the person behind these IDs. The Corona-Warn-App does not collect any information about the location of the encounter or that of its users.\n\nBased on maximum corona incubation times, the random IDs your smartphone collects are stored in an exposure log for 14 days and then deleted. If a person is diagnosed with corona and chooses to share his/her own smartphone’s random IDs, all persons previously encountered will then be notified anonymously.\n\nNo one will know when, where or with whom the exposure event took place. The infected person remains anonymous.\n\nIn addition to the exposure notifications, affected users will receive clear recommendations for action. Important: Information about the notified persons is not accessible at any time.\n\nHOW YOUR DATA IS PROTECTED\n\nThe Corona-Warn-App is designed to be your daily companion, without knowing your identity. This is why the app cannot tell anyone who you are. Data protection is fully guaranteed throughout the app’s entire service life.\n\n• No registration required: No email address and no name need to be submitted.\n• No personal information is transmitted: When you encounter another person using the app, your smartphones only exchange random IDs. They measure the time and distance of an encounter, but do not allow to identify persons or find out locations.\n• Decentralized storage: Data is stored only on the smartphone itself and deleted after 14 days.\n• No third-party access: Neither the person reporting a proven corona infection, nor those who have been notified can be traced – not by the German government, the Robert Koch Institute, any other user, nor by Apple.\n\nThis app is not intended for any use outside of Germany. Corona-Warn-App is the main corona app for Germany, where it is interconnected with the national health care system. Despite of the above, Corona-Warn-App is also available in this country. It is provided for anyone living, working, vacationing, or visiting Germany regularly or for an extended period of time.\n\nThe terms of use for the Corona-Warn-App apply: https://www.coronawarn.app/assets/documents/cwa-eula-en.pdf. By installing and using this app, you accept these terms of use."

The app allows the digital COVID certificates of the EU to be stored directly on the smartphone. Anyone who uses it can prove their vaccination protection or recovery quickly and securely. The app can also be used to store the EU's digital COVID certificates of other people (for example family members) on the smartphone. Users of the app decide when and to whom they show their information and data.\n\n\nHOW THE APP WORKS\n\nEvidence of Corona vaccinations and recovery from Corona infection is the central function of the CovPass app. Whenever users prove their Corona status, only the information and data necessary for verification is displayed via QR code. \n\nThe QR code provides information about the validity of a vaccination or recovery certificate. For clear identification, the name and date of birth are also displayed during a check. \n\nCorona vaccinations are certified with the EU digital COVID vaccination certificate upon request. The certificate is generated by medical staff after the vaccination. It contains a QR code that can be scanned with the CovPass app. Simply hold the camera of the smartphone over the QR code and all the information of the certificate is loaded onto the smartphone. The current QR code is then displayed on the app's home screen. This can be shown if required.\n\nRecovery from a Corona infection is certified with the EU digital COVID recovery certificate. You can obtain the recovery certificate from your family doctor or local health office after surviving a Corona infection. It contains a QR code that can be scanned with the app. The certificate of recovery is then documented on the smartphone. \n\nEU digital COVID certificates from other people (for example family members) can also be managed on the smartphone. \n\nThe data of the EU digital COVID certificate is stored locally on the smartphone. Only the users decide when and to whom they show the information and data.\n\n\nHOW THE DATA REMAINS SECURE\n\nData protection is maintained throughout the entire period of use. \n- No registration: No registration with an e-mail address is necessary.\n- Local data storage: Your complete data is only stored on your smartphone.\n- Data minimization: The QR code is displayed with the minimum amount of data agreed in the EU. After the QR code has been checked, only the status of the certificate, the name, and the date of birth are displayed.  \n- Cryptographic security: The QR code is protected with a strong signature and cannot be forged."

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features.

      "label": "HealthExport enables you to export data from the Health app to a CSV file!\n\nYou can perform exports manually within the app, or you can automate the export process with Apple Shortcuts. Another option would be to use HealthExport Remote to access your data remotely from your computer.\n\nHealthExport Remote lets you visualize your health data on a customizable dashboard accessible from a browser on your computer. You can also perform remote CSV exports on the website. Health data is automatically synced to the service multiple times per day in the background, so there is no need for opening the app on your phone anymore. The data is end to end encrypted between your phone and your browser, thus nobody except you can read it. Note that HealthExport Remote requires a monthly subscription payment due to monthly fees associated with running the service.\n\nHealth data types are divided into three categories:\n1. Aggregation based types (e.g step count)\n2. Record based types (e.g body mass)\n3. Workouts and workout routes\n\nAggregation based types can be exported with aggregation by minutes, hours, days, months, or years. The export of record based types contains all entries from the Health app.\n\nHealth Export is compatible with the Shortcut app, thus you can integrate your health data into any automated workflow.\n\nI think your privacy is very important, thus I do not collect any of your health data and I do not share your health data with any analytics provider.\n\n-----------------------------\nAggregated data types:\n-----------------------------\nActivity:\n- Apple Watch stand hours\n- Distance cycling\n- Distance downhill snow sports\n- Distance swimming\n- Distance walking / running\n- Exercise time\n- Flights Climbed\n- Stand time\n- Step count\n- Swimming stroke count\n\nEnergy:\n- Active energy burned\n- Basal energy burned\n\nHeart rate:\n- Heart rate\n- Resting heart rate\n- Walking heart rate\n\nNutrition:\n- Caffeine\n- Calcium\n- Carbohydrates\n- Cholesterol\n- Energy consumed\n- Fat saturated\n- Fat total\n- Fiber\n- Iron\n- Potassium\n- Protein\n- Sodium\n- Sugar\n- Vitamin A\n- Vitamin C\n- Vitamin D\n- Water\n\nWheelchair:\n- Distance wheelchair\n- Wheelchair push count\n\n-----------------------------\nRecord based data types:\n-----------------------------\nAudio exposure:\n- Environmental sound levels\n- Headphone sound levels\n\nBlood:\n- Blood glucose\n- Blood pressure (Diastolic)\n- Blood pressure (Systolic)\n- Insulin delivery\n\nBody:\n- 6 minute walk test\n- Alcoholic beverages\n- Body fat percentage\n- Body mass\n- Body mass index\n- Body temperature\n- Handwashing\n- Height\n- Lean body mass\n- Mindfulness\n- Oxygen saturation\n- Respiratory rate\n- Sleep: Time asleep\n- Sleep: Time in bed\n- Tooth brushing\n- VO2 Max\n- Waist circumference\n- Walking steadiness\n- Walking steadiness notification\n\nHeart rate:\n- Event: High heart rate\n- Event: Irregular heart rhythm\n- Event: Low heart rate\n- Heart rate\n- Heart rate variability (SDNN)\n- Resting heart rate\n- Walking heart rate\n\nReproductive health:\n- Basal body temperature\n- Cervical mucus quality\n- Intermenstrual bleeding\n- Menstrual flow\n- Ovulation test result\n- Pregnancy test\n- Progesterone test\n- Sexual activity\n\n-----------------------------\n\nAccessibility should be an important part of every application.

If you are not serious, it will be difficult. But if you really want it, your chances are good that you will make it with the help of this app.\n\nThere are many different strategies, methods, and tools that can help you quit. Whether one thing or the other works better for you can vary from person to person, but the experiences of millions of former smokers show that it is almost always a mixture of information, motivation and participation that ultimately led to success.\n\nTherefore, this app relies on a selection of tried and tested methods and tools, which are based on the three strategic pillars of information, motivation and participation.\n\n\nWhat tools does this app offer?\n\nNumbers::\nKeep track of the most important numbers: number of days as a non-smoker, number of cigarettes not smoked, money saved.\n\nHealth:\nReview your health progress and your physical reactions to not smoking.\n\n- Pro support -\n\n100-day program:\nThe 100-day program offers you a chapter of carefully researched and extensive knowledge about every aspect of smoking every day, which will strengthen your decision to quit, keep you motivated and prepare you for withdrawal in the best possible way.\n\nDaily tasks:\nDuring the particularly difficult initial period of quitting, you will be given small tasks every day, aimed at reflecting on the knowledge you have learned, convincing you of your decision, and keeping motivation high.\n\nCravings Help:\nIf you want to have a cigarette, you will be shown practical solutions for the respective situations in which you are currently in. Statistics also show you in which situations you are most often at risk, so that you can avoid them or approach them differently in the future.\n\nAwards:\nYou regularly receive awards for milestones achieved on your way to becoming a non-smoker, which you can share with family and friends.\n\nSavings goals:\nSet savings goals and watch getting closer and closer to them becasue of the money you save.\n\n100 reasons:\nIf you have a strong cigarette craving, 100 reasons to not smoke a cigarette will help you.\n\nApple Watch App:\nThe Apple Watch app quickly shows you the most important numbers of your non-smoking career.\n\nWidget:\nThe widget quickly shows you the most important numbers of your non-smoking career. \n\n\n\nPro support is offered as a one-time purchase or as a subscription either weekly for $ 1.99 or monthly for $ 6.99.

      "label": "The Robert Koch Institute (RKI), as the central institution of the Federal Government in the field of public health and as the national public health institute, releases the CovPassCheck app for the German Federal Government. The app is a quick and data-efficient way to check EU COVID Digital Certificates. Anyone using it can find out in seconds whether the person being checked has a valid certificate. No sensitive information or data is stored at any time.\n\n\nHOW THE APP WORKS\n\nChecking Corona vaccination status, recovery from Corona infection or a negative Corona test is the central function of the CovPassCheck app. Whenever users get the  EU COVID Digital Certificate, only the information and data necessary for verification are displayed via QR code.\n\nThe QR code as proof of full vaccination protection or recovery provides information about the status of the certificate. For clear identification, the name and date of birth are also displayed during a check. In addition, the QR code as proof of a negative test result still shows the time of testing.\n\nThe QR code can be scanned with the CovPassCheck app. Users of the app can check several QR codes in succession with just one click. This does not necessarily require an Internet connection.\n\nThe data of the checked person can only be viewed, but not saved.\n\n\nTHIS IS HOW DATA REMAINS SECURE\n\nNo sensitive data is stored during the check in accordance with DSGVO. \n\n- No registration: no registration with an e-mail address is necessary.\n- No data storage: the data remains on the smartphone of the person checked. \n- Data sparseness: After the QR code has been checked, only the status of the certificate, the name and the date of birth are displayed. \n- Cryptographic security: The QR code is secured with a signature that prevents forgery."

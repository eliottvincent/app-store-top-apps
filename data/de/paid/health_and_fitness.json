If you DON'T wear your Watch to bed, then simply take your Watch off before you go to sleep. As soon as you touch your iPhone or put your Watch back on in the morning then AutoSleep will know that you have finished sleeping. \n\nAs everyone is a little bit different. AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper. \n\nAutoSleep also works with HeartWatch our premier heart & activity monitoring app and writes your Sleep information to Apple Health. \n\n*Requires Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher.\n\nAwards\n-----------------\nBest of 2018\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1438574124/\n\nBest of 2019\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1484100916/\n\nBest of 2020\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1535572713/\n\nBest of 2021\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1591083005/"

      "label": "If you love working out with Apple Watch, but you need more advanced fitness stats, HealthFit is for you.\n\nBy analyzing the workout data stored in Apple Health, HealthFit provides the kind of indispensable tracking and insights you normally only get from premium subscription services. But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times. You can even log which bike or shoes you use, to monitor usage and flag when it’s time to replace them.\n\nHealthFit finds photos you take during your workouts automatically, bringing your activity feed to life with stunning images you can share on social media.\n\nRUNNING POWER ANALYSIS\n\nHealthFit provides advanced running power analysis with the automatically estimated critical power, the weighted average power, the power distribution chart by 25W Increments and the mean maximal power chart which shows your best average power for time periods of one second up to the length of your run.\n\nMULTISPORT AND INTERVAL WORKOUTS\n\nHealthFit is the only app to export multisport workouts as multisession activities\n\nSTATISTICS: UNCOVER HIDDEN FITNESS INSIGHTS\n\nApple Watch gathers so much fitness data, it can sometimes seem overwhelming. HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio.

You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

Die App kann ebenso dazu benutzt werden, auf spielerische Weise das Verhalten in einer solchen akuten Situation zu üben. Im Programmteil „Der kleine Lebensretter“ wird zusätzlich Hintergrundwissen zu den unterschiedlichsten Erste Hilfe-Themen vermittelt. \n\nDie Applikation bietet vier Funktionen: \nDer interaktive Erste Hilfe-Assistent gibt per Sprache und wahlweise Text oder Bild Anweisungen zu Erste Hilfe-Maßnahmen und kann so durch eine Notfallsituation lotsen. Per Eingabe mit „Ja“- oder „Nein“-Taste können die Fragen der Applikation entsprechend der Notfallsituation beantwortet werden. Der Benutzer wird auf Beachtung des Eigenschutzes hingewiesen und zur Bewusstseins- und Atemkontrolle angehalten. Der jeweiligen Antwort entsprechend wird er weitergeleitet zu Maßnahmen zur Wiederbelebung oder zu Maßnahmen, die bei Verbrennungen, Vergiftungen, Atemnot, Blutungen, Schlaganfall und Herzinfarkt dringend notwendig sind. Diese Maßnahmen werden detailliert, weitestgehend auch durch Abbildungen, beschrieben. \n\nDer „Notruf Assistent“ bietet Hilfe, um einen Notruf zu tätigen. Er enthält eine Anleitung für eine genaue Notfallmeldung anhand der fünf Ws, bietet die Möglichkeit einer Standortbestimmung mit Darstellung durch Google-Maps und zur automatischen Notrufbetätigung. \n„Der kleine Lebensretter“ beinhaltet wichtiges Hintergrundwissen in Text und Bild zu unterschiedlichen Erste Hilfe-Themen wie Gelenkverletzungen, Knochenbrüchen, Sonnenstich, Schock oder Stabile Seitenlage. „Der kleine Lebensretter“ kann weiterführend zum interaktiven Erste Hilfe-Assistenten oder allgemein als kleine Informationssammlung zu Ersten Hilfe-Themen benutzt werden. \nMit den „DRK Infodiensten“ lassen sich die wichtigsten DRK News online abrufen, aktuelle Blutspendetermine im Umkreis herausfinden und eine Übersicht über die unterschiedlichen Angebote zu Erste Hilfe Kursen einsehen.\n\nDie Applikation ist in deutscher Sprache."

      "label": "PULSALARM warns you via vibration or warning tone when you exceed your set upper and lower pulse limit and thus supports you in your pulse-based training. You can train as usual with your favorite fitness or running app. All you need to do is install PULSALARM on your Apple Watch.\n\nFeatures of the Apple Watch App:\n- Vibration and/or warning tone when the set pulse limits are reached\n- Vibration and/or signal tone when returning to the set pulse range\n- Pulse limits can be deactivated individually\n- Large, easy to read display of the current pulse\n- Fast adjustment of pulse limits (also possible while running)\n- Works together with all known fitness, training and running apps that can be started on the Apple Watch\n- Does not write data to Apple Health\n- You can use the app on your Apple Watch without having your iPhone with you\n\nFeatures of the iPhone App:\n- Calculation of your maximum heart rate\n- Individual calculation of the 5 intensity ranges (depending on your maximum heart rate) \n- Adoption of the pulse limits from the training zones\n- Setting the maximum and minimum pulse limit \n- Large display of the current pulse\n\nImportant note: without the use with an Apple Watch, the functional range of the app is limited, as no permanent pulse measurement can be carried out.\n\nNo advertising, no tracking, no third-party codes. Developed with passion and programmed in Germany.\n\nWhy use PULSALARM additionally? \nMany running apps include the pace as a target in their training plans. However, the same speed can mean a high intensity for one person and a low intensity for another. It is therefore helpful to consider your heart rate instead of speed to determine and maintain the right training intensity. \nPULSALARM helps you to do this. It turns your Apple Watch into a heart rate monitor. \n\nWhat is the big advantage?\nYou no longer have to look at your Apple Watch during your workout and still know whether you are exercising within your personal heart rate zone. Also ideal in colder months, when your Apple Watch is hidden under a jacket or long-sleeved shirt and you can't look directly at the display while running.\n\nFor whom is PULSALARM suitable?\n- Ideal for run beginners, as they can control themselves better and protect themselves from overstraining.\n- Ideal for ambitious runners, as they can train more specifically in their intensity ranges and thus increase endurance and performance.\n- For all athletes and fitness enthusiasts who are interested in heart rate monitoring during their training with their Apple Watch.\n\nSummary:\nWith the PULSALARM app on the iPhone you can determine your 5 intensity ranges based on your maximum heart rate. You can enter your maximum heart rate directly or have it calculated. Set your personal maximum heart rate limit, which you do not want to exceed during training, and your minimum heart rate limit. When these limits are reached, your Apple Watch will alert you by vibrating and/or beeping."

Accurate analysis of your tinnitus\n2. Tinnitus masker and noiser\n3. Reprogramming your auditory cortex\n4. Stimulating your central auditory perception\nHelping you to\n5. defocus\n6. habituate\n7. relax\n8. fall asleep\n\nThis is how it works:\n‘tinnitus help’ utilizes the fact that the same brain activities that enable us to perceive auditory stimuli, i.e. real sounds, also cause the perception of the tinnitus sound. Thus ‘tinnitus help’ is able to intervene in central auditory processes. ‘tinnitus help’ forms an image of your individual tinnitus frequency (up to 20.000 Hz) and offers you the option to mix this frequency with pleasant sounds or music. This means that ‘tinnitus help’ can assist you to change the way you perceive your tinnitus sound by letting it gradually fade into the background. Regular listening to your individual ‘tinnitus help’ setting will enable you to learn how to increasingly fade out the sound in your ear and eventually ignore it. Experts call this “habituation”.\n\nStep one:\nEstablish your individual tinnitus frequency by using the slide switch. It does not matter if it is the left or the right ear that is affected or both. Are you suffering from tinnitus sounds that rise and fall? Or cricket like sounds? Or red noise? You can mix all additional sounds to your tinnitus frequency, thereby optimizing your tinnitus profile.\n\nStep two:\nChoose a pleasing sound and add it to your tinnitus profile. Using this combination, you will feel your tinnitus gradually fading into the background. What you are experiencing is the effect of defocusing. You have now created your own individual, perfect tinnitus masker, which you can call up any time anywhere. Set the time on how long you want your program to run for and use your tinnitus setting as masker to help you relax and to fall asleep.\n\nStep three:\nInfluence the activity of your auditory cortex. The area in which your tinnitus frequency is located will be especially active and, depending on how frequently and how intensely you pay attention to your tinnitus, this area will spread like an ink stain on a piece of blotting paper. However, you can restrict the growth of this area by adding one of the pieces of music on offer to your setting. The music has been especially written for tinnitus sufferers. All pieces of music are produced naturally on musical instruments; no synthesizers are used. The association “I am hearing pleasing sounds or music” will at first be stored in the hippocampus, our memory centre. If the experience is repeated by using ‘tinnitus help’, the hippocampus works like a trainer for your cerebral cortex. It will repeatedly offer the stored information to the cerebral cortex, resulting in the new input being learnt and new programs etched into the auditory cortex. Regularly recurring musical structures act like a massage on certain areas of the brain. Where tinnitus is present, this will be experienced as a negative effect. However, you can turn this to your advantage by calling up your very own personalised music in your head. Retrieve it whenever you need it, influence your perception processes and learn to set up the reprogramming of your central auditory pathway. In general the tinnitus has the same frequency as the peak in your hearing loss. So use ‘tinnitus help’  to stimulate your auditory cortex and to support your hearing."

      "label": "Die Progressive Muskelentspannung (PME) nach Edmund Jacobson ist eine wissenschaftlich anerkannte Entspannungsmethode, die über Muskelanspannung und Entspannung dazu verhilft, in einen Zustand der Tiefenentspannung zu gelangen. Die PME ist eine - wissenschaftlich erwiesen - sehr wirksame Entspannungsmethode; sie wird von Ärzten bei zahlreichen meist stressbedingten Symptomen empfohlen wie z.B.:\n\n• Verspannungen\n• Migräne oder Kopfschmerzen\n• innere Unruhe\n• Schlafstörungen\n• Rücken-/Schmerzen\n• Erregungszustände, Prüfungsangst\n• Angst- und Panikattacken\n• Bluthochdruck\n• psychosomatischen Beschwerden\n\nMit regelmäßiger Übung wird es immer besser gelingen, in noch tiefere Entspannungszustände zu geraten. Sobald man genügend Übung und Erfahrung mit der ausführlichen Form der Progressiven Muskelentspannung (GRUNDFORM: 17 Muskelgruppen / ANFÄNGER-Status) hat, kann auch zu den kürzeren Varianten (Kurzformen) mit 7 und 4 Muskelgruppen übergegangen werden und schließlich wird es leicht fallen, sich bzw. auch einzelne Körperpartien mit dem Body Scan rein mental zu entspannen. Es sollte zu Beginn bei allen Formen der Übungsstatus ANFÄNGER gewählt werden.\n\nIn dieser App werden alle 4 Formen der PME (Grund- und 2 Kurzformen sowie die Mentale Form) angeleitet und geübt.\n\nGRUNDFORM: 17 MUSKELGRUPPEN\n1. Rechte Hand und Unterarm\n2. Rechter Oberarm\n3. Linke Hand und Unterarm\n4. Linker Oberarm \n5. Stirn\n6. Obere Wangenpartie und Nase\n7. Untere Wangenpartie und Kiefer\n8. Nacken \n9. Brust, Schultern und obere Rückenpartie\n10. Bauchmuskulatur\n11. Gesäß- und Beckenboden\n12. Rechter Oberschenkel\n13. Rechter Unterschenkel \n14. Rechter Fuß\n15, 16, 17 (-> linke Seite)\n\nKURZFORM I: 7 MUSKELGRUPPEN\n1. Rechte Hand, Unterarm und Oberarm\n2. Linke Hand, Unterarm und Oberarm\n3. Stirn, Wangenpartie, Nase und Kiefer\n4. Nacken \n5. Brust, Schultern, Rücken, Bauch-, Gesäß und Beckenboden\n6. Rechter Oberschenkel, Unterschenkel und Fuß\n7. Linker Oberschenkel, Unterschenkel und Fuß\n\nKURZFORM II: 4 MUSKELGRUPPEN\n1. Beide Hände, Unterarme und Oberarme\n2. Gesichts- und Nackenmuskulatur\n3. Brust, Schultern, Rücken, Bauch-, Gesäß- und Beckenboden\n4. Beide Oberschenkel, Unterschenkel und Füße\n\nMENTALE FORM: BODY-SCAN\nGeführte Entspannung durch den ganzen Körper bis zu den Füßen, diesmal beginnend mit Gesichts, Unterkiefer und Nacken. Diese Anleitung ist die letzte Stufe der PME, bei der die Wahrnehmung auf einzelne Körperteile gelenkt wird, ohne diese anzuspannen. Die Entspannung erfolgt jetzt nur noch mental. Hilfreiche Vorstellungen (Sonne, Strand, Meer) können dabei unterstützen (wählbar).\n\nÜBUNGS-STATUS\nFür alle Formen der PME kann zudem der Übungsdauer-Status \n- ANFÄNGER\n- FORTGESCHRITTEN\n- ERFAHREN\ngewählt werden. Damit stehen insgesamt 12 vollständige Versionen der PME zu Verfügung.\n\nLIEGEND / SITZEND\nAlle Formen werden wahlweise jeweils im Sitzen oder Liegen angeleitet.\n\nMUSIK & NATUR-SOUNDS\nEs kann aus 5 Entspannungsmusiken und 18 Natur-Sounds gewählt werden, die sich jeweils untereinander und an die Lautstärke der Stimme anpassen lassen. Falls gewünscht können Musik/Sounds auch alleine (ohne Stimme) zur Entspannung bzw. zum Einschlafen genutzt werden. Es können auch 2 Natur-Sounds gleichzeitig kombiniert werden.\n\nEINSCHLAFEN - RÜCKNAHME - OHNE OUTRO\nAlle Übungen können wahlweise zum Einschlafen, zur Entspannung mit Rücknahme und ohne Outro verwendet werden. \n\nDAUER DER ANSPANNUNG\nDie Dauer der Anspannung der Muskelgruppen kann ausgewählt werden. Überwiegend wird eine Anspannung von 5 Sek. empfohlen.\n\nPAUSEN ZUM ENTSPANNEN\nDie Dauer der Pausen zwischen den Muskelgruppen kann nach eigenen Vorlieben und Übungsstand angepasst werden. Überwiegend wird eine Dauer von 20 Sek. empfohlen.\n\nTIMER\nAuf alle Übungen kann eine beliebig lange Zeit für die Entspannungsmusik & Natur-Sounds eingestellt werden, die die Entspannung vertiefen.\n\nHINWEISE\nDie App kann / sollte sogar im Flugmodus (offline) genutzt werden.\nDie App enthält keine Werbung, Abos, In-App-Käufe."

      "label": "The first app dedicated to training men how to last longer in bed, through two simple exercises you can do anywhere!\n\nStamena trains your “PC muscle,” which makes it easy to stop yourself ejaculating, delays the onset of ejaculation, and even lets you have non-ejaculatory orgasms!\n\nOther kegel apps, built for women, ignore the most important exercise for male sexual stamina: the reverse kegel! \n\nReverse kegels train your PC muscles to relax, making sure that you can slow yourself down during sex. Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

It is measured by the variation in the beat-to-beat interval. \r\nThis HRV app provides a way to analyze the HRV SDNN values recorded by the Apple Watch.\r\n\r\nHeart rate variability describes the ability of an organism to change the frequency of the heart rhythm. A healthy person constantly adapts the heart rhythm to the current requirements. The number of heart beats per minute is therefore constantly changing, which is a good sign of the organism's ability to adapt.\r\n\r\nResearchers at the University of Zaragoza in Spain have shown that the values recorded by the Apple Watch during a session with the Breath app are very accurate. Comparable with professional chest straps.\r\n\r\nTo filter your own HRV data, this app offers the possibility to display only those HRV values that are recorded during such a session.\r\n\r\nThe Apple Watch is measuring your HRV Data and writes it to Healthkit.\r\nThis app connects with Apple’s Health app to displays the recorded data on a Watch App, a complication and your Iphone. \r\n\r\nHow to Use:\r\n-\tATTENTION: This app only works if you have an Apple Watch Series 3 or later.\r\n-\tIf you want to measure a new value, use the Breath App from Apple.\r\n-\tTo get to most out of your data it is important that you measurement does always take place in the very same situation.

Similar ingredients are also found and sorted by degree of intolerance.\nIf you want to add your own ingredients that you don't tolerate, just add them to the app settings. Intol 3 will then mark them red when scanning and searching for ingredients.\n\nRequired permissions\n• Camera access to scan the ingredients list\n• Vibration to give feedback on detected incompatible ingredients\n\n\nIntol is ad-free and works without mobile data, Wi-Fi or user tracking.

      "label": "Heart Rate Variability measurements recorded by your Apple Watch can give you insight on the stress level your body is under. By using HRV Tracker to track short-term measurements and long-term trends, you can see how your workload during the day, workout sessions or sleeping etc affect your body's readiness, recovery and stress level. Simply put, the higher your HRV is, the better.\n\n***Requires an HRV capable Apple Watch with watchOS 6 or later***\nHRV Tracker for Watch integrates with the Health app and uses data stored in the Health app. To make sure your Apple Watch is capable of recording HRV measurements, please open the Health app on your iPhone to see if any HRV measurements exists. Go to > Health app > Browse > Heart > Hear Rate Variability.\n\n***Get Notified***\nHRV Tracker makes spotting changes in your HRV easy by monitoring your HRV measurements in the background and showing notifications after your HRV drops under or rises above your desired levels. HRV Tracker will monitor changes in individual measurements and also your 24 hour HRV average. You can change the default notification levels directly in your Apple Watch app. Please note that notifications can get postponed for example because of a low battery level.\n\n***Apple Watch for daily tracking***\nBrowse through last seven days of HRV measurements by using the digital crown. See how measurements compare to your seven day period and individual days. By tapping the graph you can toggle through the first values of each day. Use complications on your Apple Watch to stay informed on changes in your HRV. \n\nBesides the automatically recorded HRV measurements you can use the Breathe app on your Apple Watch to record new HRV measurements. Start a Breathe session in the Breathe app and after the session ends a new HRV measurement will be available in HRV Tracker.\n\n***Compare HRV to other key metrics***\nFind possible causes for changes in HRV by using the comparison graphs available on your Apple Watch:\n-Sleep hours: By default HRV Tracker will use sleep data provided by sleep apps that add sleep data to HealthKit. If no sleep data is available HRV Tracker will calculate estimated sleep hours per night (estimated sleep time will only be available in the Apple Watch app)\n-Activity: By default HRV Tracker will use your Active Energy (calories) as the activity metric. In the HRV Tracker Apple Watch app you can choose to use a custom activity score that emphasizes the intensity of daily activity.\n-Daily resting heart rate (RHR).\nToggle between comparison graphs by tapping the upper part of the screen.\n\n***Follow Long-term HRV trend***\nFollow your long-term HRV trend on your iPhone and compare your short term measurements to all-time data.\n-Select week from weekly graph to see daily HRV values of the selected week.\n-Browse through all daily HRV values of the selected day\n-Compare daily HRV averages to other relevant daily metrics: Activity, Sleep (if available in the Health app) and Resting Heart Rate\n\n***Widgets on iPhone***\n-Medium sized widget with chart showing all daily hrv values\n-Multiple small widgets to choose from\n\n***Privacy***\nData read from the Apple HealthKit database is only used to show information related to your Heart Rate Variability. Information read by HRV Tracker is only stored and used locally on your iPhone and Apple Watch. \n\n***How is it measured***\nHeart rate variability measurements used by HRV Tracker are calculated by measuring the variation between individual heartbeats. Your Apple Watch automatically measures your HRV in the background and stores the outcome into HealthKit. HealthKit uses SDNN heart rate variability, which is calculated using the standard deviation of the inter-beat (RR) intervals between normal heartbeats (measured in milliseconds). Besides background measurements generated automatically by your Apple Watch you can use the Breathe app on your Apple Watch to generate new measurements."

They will be automatically placed in your AM and/or PM routine as recommended.\n\n\n• ADD CUSTOM PRODUCTS\n\nYou can add custom skincare products from other brands by selecting the option in the top-right menu in the Routine section or from the Custom tab in the Products section.\n\n\n• USE YOUR ROUTINE FOR LAYERING ADVICE\n\nThe products are listed in the recommended layering order, along with advice for when and how to use each product.\n\n\n• KEEP TRACK OF USAGE TO AVOID CONFLICTS\n\nEach morning and evening, check each product off your list to keep track of which treatments you have used. This will allow the app to prevent any conflicts by showing you which products should be avoided.\n\n\n• TRACK YOUR SKIN'S PROGRESS\n\nAny time you notice your skin is looking particularly good or bad, you can make a note of it by pressing on the face icon next to the morning or evening routine. You can also add a comment to note down more details for your own record and add photos to track your progress.\n\n\n• ADD PHOTOS\n\nYou can add photos of your skin to your diary tracker and also add photos of custom products.\n\n\n• REMINDERS & TIMERS\n\nYou can set up notifications to remind you about your daily skin regimen. You can also set timers for products which require a specific wait time. Both can be found in the Settings.\n\n\n\n*** Advanced App Customization ***\n\n• RE-ORDER YOUR ROUTINE\n\nIf you don't wish to follow the recommended layering order, you can choose to re-order the products to fully customize your routine by selecting the option from the top right menu (with 3 dots) of the Routine section. You can also change the order of the layer steps, for instance DECIEM recommends oils before moisturizers but some users prefer the other way around.\n\n\n• USE CONFLICTING PRODUCTS\n\nWhen we recommend not using a product due to conflicts with other products or because you've reached the usage limit, you can choose to ignore the warning and use it anyway. You will then have the option to permanently ignore conflicts on that specific product.\n\n\n• SCHEDULE PRODUCTS\n\nYou can choose specific days of the week for a product if you wish. For instance, you may wish to make it so that the \"AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution\" only appears in your routine on Tuesdays and Fridays.\nYou can also choose dates of the month, e.g. the 1st and 15th of every month.\nAnother useful option is to schedule products for every X days, so you could choose every 2 days to alternate.\n\n\n\n*** Recommended for skin concerns... ***\n\n• Dry & Dehydrated Skin: Achieve plump, healthy-looking hydrated skin.\n• Acne-Prone Skin: Reduce inflammation to help support clear skin.\n• Blemishes & Congestion: Reduce inflammation and brighten the skin.\n• Sensitive Skin: Keep your skin moisturized with this gentle routine.\n• Mature Skin & Wrinkles: Promote youthful skin and reduce the signs of aging.\n• Pigmentation Problems: Gently exfoliate and brighten skin tone.\n• Oily Skin: Rebalance your skin for a healthy, fresh look.\n\n\nPlease note, Skincare Routine (previously known as \"Skincare Regimen Organizer\") has no connection with DECIEM, The Ordinary or any other skincare brand."

Don't depend on other apps that might lose your data—Health Data Importer is battle-tested with thousands of users and supports all versions of Apple's Health XML format. Start fresh without a backup when you get your new device and easily import your existing health data. Health Data Importer imports all Health data except Activity Summaries, Stand Hours, Exercise Time, and Nike Fuel data (these are API limitations).\n\nIf you ever have wanted to bring all of your health data onto a new phone without having to do a full iCloud restore, this is the app for you.\n\nTo see how easy it is, just watch the preview video (no sound). Note: while we use iCloud Drive in the preview video, iCloud Drive does not need to be enabled in order to perform an import. Just send your import to yourself in Apple mail and open it with Health Data Importer.\n\nHealth Data Importer integrates with the HealthKit framework and Health.app to import your Health XML exports.\n\n◆ Testimonials ◆\n\n“Health Importer is the app I wish I had when I moved from the iPhone 6 Plus to the 6s Plus last year. [...]  Health Importer worked perfectly in my tests and I'm going to use it again as soon as I switch to an iPhone 7 Plus.” - Federico Viticci, Macstories\n\n“Health Data Importer does exactly what the name suggests. Download the app, then load it up on your fresh new iPhone. It will scan your iCloud backups for any health data, then import all of it over to your new phone.” - Thorin Klosowski, Lifehacker\n\n“I believe Health Data Importer to be the best way to move your Health data between two iPhones. It is simple, quick, and very reliable” - Sébastian Page, iDownloadBlog\n\n◆ Features ◆\n\n‣ Import multiple sources (Apple Watch, iPhone, or from third-party apps).\n‣ Fast, quick, efficient, and battle-tested—import all your health data in just a few seconds.\n‣ Supports all versions of Health apps XML exports.\n\n◆ Help and Support ◆\n\nIf you run into an issue, please email our team at support@lionheartsw.com. We've helped many customers import their data successfully and will try our best to help you too.\n\n◆ Health XML Splitter ◆\n\nHealth Data Importer has trouble handling large exports, so we've written a macOS tool, called Health XML Splitter, to help you split them up into smaller pieces. Health XML Splitter is available for free on the Mac App Store.\n\nHealth Data Importer's privacy policy: https://lionheartsw.com/software/health-importer/privacy.html\n\nHealth Data Importer's terms of use: https://lionheartsw.com/software/health-importer/terms.html"

      "label": "How can fruit and vegetable juices improve our physical condition, our health and our productivity?\n\nTo answer this question, we need to widen our views a bit and consider nutrition from a broader perspective.\n\n- The three times of food\nThis concept, proposed by Eben Pagan, suggests to consider the meals we eat in 3 different times:\n\n- 1. Immediately\nThe real-time experience of food: is good or bad?\n- 2. In the short term\nThe 2-3 hours that follow: if we feel energetic and effective, or heavy and listless\n- 3. Long-term\nWhat we eat affects our health for the rest of our lives, for example, it can add or remove fat from our body, promote or weaken our immune system, encourage or discourage the occurrence of degenerative diseases etc.\n\nIn this regard, we have to evaluate each meal in these three time periods, on a scale from 1 to 10.\n\nWhen you decide what to eat, ask yourself how much its value is from 1 to 10 in terms of:\n- Taste: do I like to eat it?\n- Energy: in the next 2-3 hours, how effectively will it give me energy?\n- Health in the long term: how does it affect my immune system, how does it affect the occurrence of diseases, how does it affect the rest of my life.\nIn 10 years, will I be proud to have eaten this meal?\n\nAlmost all of us are in the constant search for a 9 or 10 in the immediate. And in order to get it we are often willing to accept a 2, 3 or 4 in the short term. If it is not too heavy on the stomach or if we do not feel too much strain in digestion, that's fine... it's enough it has a good flavor.\n\nFor the long term, we have no idea how this food is going to affect our body and our immune system. So for example when we get sick, we feel depressed, when we have little desire to do anything, when we have problems in our relationships or go through periods where we feel apathetic and listless, we never put that in relationship with what we regularly eat and with the fact that food can have an effect on our health, our emotional state and our lives in general.\n\nMost of us eat almost exclusively for pleasure, for entertainment.\n\nWhat we should want for ourselves, is a 10 for the next 2 or 3 hours in terms of energy and mental clarity, and a 10 for our health, to limit the possibility of getting sick and to have a strong and responsive immune system throughout the course of our lives. And for this, we can also be prepared to accept a 5 or 6 (or maybe a 7) in the instant gratification that food can give us. In the immediate maybe we will not have the maximum enjoyment, but within 3 hours we will have energy and lucidity to the highest levels, and we will know that this meal will help to influence our health in a positive way in the long term, and we will be proud of this decision.\n\nFruits and vegetables juices are the best you can give yourself for the short and the long term!\n\nFeatures of the current version:\n- 52 Selected recipes\n- 40 Fact sheets of food with nutritional properties\n- High Quality photos\n- Therapeutic features food\n- Recommended seasons\n- Ability to filter according to the season, food and benefits\n- Select the ingredients you have at home to find which recipes you can achieve.\n- Ability to save favorite recipes\n- Practical tips for getting the most from one's eating habits\n- \"Pantry\" mode: select the ingredients you have at home to find which recipes you can achieve!\n- Ability to share recipes with friends or on major Social Networks\n\nFor suggestions and information:\ncanali.nicola@gmail.com\n\nFacebook page:\nwww.facebook.com/centrifugoapp\n\nNote:\nAn internet connection is required to update the database of the recipes.\n\nDislcaimer:\nThis information is the result of personal research on books and websites. It has the sole purpose of entertainment and should not be considered a remedy or cure for serious illnesses.

Am in the british armed forces and wanted a reliable and accurate bleep test trainer. Tried and compared it today (uk and australian version only) against an official bleep test cd and it's exactly the same. Sweet!!!!!\" by Fishnavy\n\n5/5 - \"I'm a x-country runner and it is pretty good for your stamina and sprint finish … well done great app\" by Gaganster\n\n5/5 - \"… contains all the required tests and works really well\" by Martin Thomas\n\n\nOVERVIEW\nTeam Bleep Test allows you to run any type of Multi-Stage Fitness Test (MSFT) for any sport, record scores for teams of up to 40 players during a test, setup multiple teams/groups of players and view previous scores on a graph to track player and team fitness over the season.\n\n\nINCLUDED TESTS\n‣ Standard Bleep Test - The original bleep test/MSFT, defined by Luc Léger in 1984.\n‣ UK Police Official Test - Used as part of the Police Service recruitment process in the UK.\n‣ UK Fire Service Official Test - Used as part of the Fire Service recruitment process in the UK.\n‣ UK & Australian Bleep Test - Most popular bleep test in Australia and the UK.\n‣ Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery (IRTL) Levels 1/2.\n‣ Yo-Yo Intermittent Endurance (IETL) Levels 1/2.\n‣ Or use the powerful script feature to create your own bleep test.\n\nNOTE: We have worked hard to compare and match the bleep tests in our apps with official bleep test CDs to ensure their accuracy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n‣ Run a bleep test anywhere, without having to carry around a CD player.\n‣ Choose from a selection of bleep tests including the standard 20m Bleep Test, Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery, Yo-Yo Endurance and the official tests used by UK Police & Fire Services.\n‣ Create your own custom bleep test using the scripts tab and run any type of bleep test designed for any sport.\n‣ View test progression as a running man on screen.\n‣ Real time display of VO2 Max, total distance, total laps, current stage and stage laps during a test.\n‣ Record scores during a test for a team of up to 40 players.\n‣ Save scores for multiple teams/groups of players.\n‣ View past scores (Stage and level, VO2 Max and total distance) on a graph for the whole team or highlight a single player to show detailed score information.\n‣ Export past scores to a spreadsheet and view on a PC.\n‣ Optional voice announcement of stage number when moving to the next stage.\n‣ Optional vibrate on bleep for running with iPhone in your pocket.\n‣ Bleeps also play when device is locked and/or muted.\n‣ Bluetooth speakers supported.\n\n\nBLEEP TIMING\nAccurate timing when running the bleep test is vital to get an accurate assessment of individual player fitness.

      "label": "Mit dem ARTZT Tongenerator kannst du Töne in verschiedenen Frequenzen erzeugen und mit deinem SoundVibe für dein Neuroathletik-Training nutzen. Verbinde den SoundVibe mit deinem Smartphone und stelle den Ton stufenlos zwischen den Seiten (Balance) und die Frequenz zwischen 20 und 1.000 ein. \n\nÜBER DEN SOUNDVIBE\n\nDer SoundVibe arbeitet mit Knochenschall. Diese Kopfhörer liegen links und rechts auf der hinteren Wange unterhalb der Schläfe auf, also kurz vor deinem Ohr, statt darin. Sie halten die Ohren frei und übertragen den Schall durch Vibrationen über den Schädelknochen direkt ans Innenohr, wo sie die Flüssigkeit und Flimmerhärchen der Hörmuschel in Vibrationen versetzen. Die Auflageflächen (sog. Transducer) des Kopfhörers übertragen so die Schallschwingungen über die Knochenleitung direkt in das Innenohr. Mehr erfahren: https://www.artzt.eu/artzt-vitality-soundvibe\n\nÜBER DIE ANWENDUNG IN DER NEUROATHLETIK\n\nDieser Effekt kann in Therapie und Training genutzt werden, da Geräusche und Töne über die Knochenleitung anders wahrgenommen werden. Verschiedene Tonarten und Frequenzen können so unterschiedliche Reaktionen hervorrufen. Hierbei spielt einer unserer Hirnnerven eine wichtige Rolle, da er Positionsinformationen und Geräusche empfängt und an das Gehirn weiterleitet. Individuell ausgewählte Tonfrequenzen können diesen Nerv stimulieren. Wenn du unter Schwindel leidest oder einfach deine Balance und Koordination schulen möchtest, kann dieses Training sehr positive Effekte haben. \n\nÜBER ARTZT\n\nBewegung ist wichtig. Bewegung hält Körper und Geist fit und gesund. Wir wollen dich dazu bewegen, dich zu bewegen. Dafür stehen wir mit jedem unserer funktionellen Fitness-Tools. Bei der Auswahl unserer Produktmarken legen wir hohen Wert auf Qualität, sportwissenschaftlich belegte Effizienz sowie Spaß bei der Bewegung.

      "label": "Eating sweets has many health disadvantages. The sugar contained in sweets has a negative effect on your body and your well-being. To prevent this, we have developed this app for you.\n\nWhat happens in the body when you eat sugar? Is fructose better than classic sugar? And what is sugar exactly?\n\nSugar is unhealthy.\n\nOur body gets its energy from the three main nutrients fat, protein and carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are made up of sugar molecules. It is important to distinguish between simple carbohydrates - for example from sweets and classic table sugar - and complex carbohydrates, which you can find in whole grains and vegetables, for example.\n\nWhen people talk about “unhealthy sugar”, they usually mean classic table sugar and simple carbohydrates from confectionery and white flour. Complex carbohydrates are metabolized completely differently and are useful and healthy sources of energy. However, you should keep your hands off classic sugar. Why? For these 4 reasons.\n\nSugar makes you fat\nAll carbohydrates are first broken down by the body into their individual building blocks. What's left is glucose. Glucose is metabolized with the help of the hormone insulin. The insulin ensures that the sugar gets to the cells where it is needed in the form of energy.\nThe more sugar you eat, the more insulin is released. So too much sugar messes up and skyrockets your insulin levels. This is unfavorable in two ways: On the one hand, the hormone reduces fat burning. On the other hand, after such insulin spikes, the amount of sugar in the blood quickly drops to an absolute minimum again. The result: renewed cravings for sugar. This creates a vicious circle that causes you to constantly ingest sugar and increase your daily caloric intake.\n\nSugar is addicting\nSugar ensures that more dopamine is released in the brain's reward center. The happiness hormone evokes a good mood and feelings of happiness. Unfortunately only for a short time. As soon as the effects wear off, the brain craves for more. This creates a vicious circle that leads you to eat more and more sugar.\n\nSugar makes you sick\nThis is nothing new. Obesity, type 2 diabetes and tooth decay are the most well-known dangers associated with too much sugar. Studies also indicate that too much concentrated fructose in particular favors the formation of invisible but unhealthy fat that is deposited between and around the organs. Isolated fructose, which is used to sweeten fruit drinks and sweets, also inhibits the hormone leptin, which is responsible for feeling full.\n\nSugar makes you look old\nIf you eat too much sugar at once, your body cannot completely convert it into energy. The excess sugar molecules then combine with proteins that are responsible for the elasticity of your skin. The result: Unsightly wrinkles.\nThese compounds of sugar and protein also bind to the receptors of immune cells and thus promote inflammation and poor blood circulation in the skin. In short: the more sugar, the more unsightly the complexion.\n\nWith the help of this app you can stop eating sweets overnight and follow your positive health progress.\nThis app also gives you the opportunity to save money.\nThanks to the push notification, you will always be rewarded to stop eating sweets.\n\nHave fun living healthy."

      "label": "\"Hearing Analyzer Portrait\" is  an ear health check tool that allows you to measure very wide audible frequency ranges to your hearing.\n\nThe human ear possesses an auditory range from 20Hz to 20kHz. In addition to conventional audiometry (125Hz - 8kHz), the extended low-frequency audiometry and high-frequency audiometry including Mosquito sounds are available. You can self-diagnose the sound listening ability. \n\nBy measuring the characteristics of your current hearing, please try to consider the wellness of your ears and the way of natural sound reproduction. It is possible to measure the hearing of the audio range by finding the minimum point in the operation of the slider volume that you can hear the tesing pure tone for each frequency. The results are displayed in easy-to-read charts like the audiogram.\n\nRecommended to check your own hearing ability on a daily basis for the audiophile, music players, sound professionals and all music lovers. Try to check if you have the golden ears!\n\nFeatures:\n- Broadband hearing test in 3 frequency bands:  LF (Low Frequency) - 30Hz to 100Hz, BAS. (Basic frequency) - 125Hz to 12kHz, MOS. (Mosquito, Extended High Frequency) - 13kHz to 20kHz.\n- Test tones of LF: 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 (Hz)\n- Test tones of BAS.: 125, 250, 500, 1k, 2k, 4k, 8k, 12k (Hz)\n- Test tones of MOS.: 13k, 14k, 15k,16k, 17k, 18k, 19k, 20k (Hz)\n- Test channel: Left, Right\n- Test tone type: Intermittent signal (Tone A) / Continuous signal (Tone B)\n- Measurement result graph display (LVL/ATH/BOTH): Frequency response of hearing - Linear level without ATH compensation (LVL),  ATH (*1) compensation (ATH), Both results (BOTH)\n- Clear setting and results. (Reset)\n- Snapshot of single band result. (Snap)\n- Snapshot of full band result. (Snap-W) \n\n*1: ATH (Absolute Threshold of Hearing)\nATH is also known as the hearing threshold, and is the minimum sound pressure level of pure tone that can be detected on the hearing in noise-free environment. Human is said to be able to listen from 20Hz to 20kHz, but the sensitivity of the hearing will vary greatly depending on frequency. ATH varies with age and sex, but is a good sensitivity at mid range (1kHz - 5kHz), and needs more greater sound pressure level at a lower and higher frequency. The information in ATH graph is just for reference purposes.\n\nAttentions:\nPlease use the headphones that provided with iPhone in the hearing test.\nThis application generates a test tone signal with a high gain, so please special attention to the volume adjustment.\nBefore the diagnosis start, please set the hardware volume control to the central position of 50%. If you move the volume slider upward, the output volume will have a large gain. So as not to be excessively large gain for your ears, please adjust it carefully. \n\nRemarks:\nIn general, a high risk of hearing loss has been known if you continue to hear the sounds of a high acoustic pressure level, such as, listening of the portable audio and working with too loud noises.\nAccording to WHO, some 1.1 billion teenagers and young adults are at risk of hearing loss due to the unsafe use of personal audio devices, including smartphones, and exposure to damaging levels of sound at noisy entertainment venues such as nightclubs, bars and sporting events.\nWe hope that you keep to have an interest on a daily basis to the wellness of hearing by  this app. If you feel the need to health management of ear, it is recommended to visit the medical specialist.\n\nDisclaimer:\nThis app is not intended to be used for a medical purpose. This app is not intended to diagnose, prevent, monitor, treat, alleviate or compensate a disease, an injury, a disability or a handicap. If you think you have hearing problems, please consult with your doctor, or other qualified healthcare professional. Please use this app at your own risk.

      "label": "There are twelve energy pathways, or meridians, in the human body that connect to specific organs in the body. Chinese medicine believes that each organ has a two hour time period when the Qi is at its peak in that meridian. The Qi flows cyclically in a clockwise rotation like a wave through the meridians.\n\nWe always pay attention to symptoms that occur repeatedly at specific times because this may be an indication of the organ that is out of balance. For example, waking every night between 1 and 3 a.m. almost always is indicative of a Liver imbalance. The Organ Clock App will show you which organs correspond to which two hour period.\n\nThe Organ Clock iPhone App lists the periods in which the organs are at their peak Qi. It will display the details for the organ currently at its maximum, including whether it is a Zang or a Fu organ, Yin or Yang, which element the organ belongs to and a short description of the role of the organ according to the traditional chinese medicine and tips on how to behave during that period. \n\nYou can also browse all organs independent of whether they are at currently their maximum Qi  or not.\n\nDisclaimer:\nIf you think that you are suffering from an illness, please consult an qualified medical practitioner. Neither the organ clock nor the information about the specific organs can substitute for a qualified anamnesis and diagnosis.\nThe developer of this Application is neither physician nor healer but has compiled freely available information about the organ clock and has published them in this Application."

Es löst die Anspannungen, die der Körper bei starken inneren Gefühlen und äusseren Einflüssen aufbaut. Es bringt Sie zu innerer Ruhe und Gelassenheit zurück. Das neurogene Zittern verbessert Ihre Belastungsfähigkeit und lässt auch Schmerzen nach und nach verschwinden. Alte Heiltraditionen nutzen die Kraft des unwillkürlichen Zitterns seit Jahrtausenden.\n\nNeuroZittern bietet folgende Funktionalitäten an:\nWissen – Hintergrundinformationen über TRE.\nSo geht’s – Eine Grundanleitung zur Durchführung der Übungen.\nÜbungen – Detaillierte Beschreibung der 7 Übungen mit zusätzlich eine Videoanleitung.\nAnbieter – Eine Liste von TRE-AnbieterInnen im deutschsprachigen Raum.\n\nBevor Sie sich für oder gegen eine medizinische Behandlung in Zusammenhang mit den Übungen in dieser App entscheiden, lasses sich bitte von einer Ärztin, einem Arzt beraten."

      "label": "Die Muskel & Cardio-App beinhaltet 12 Sequenzen  (über 100 Minuten), die Kraft aufbauen und die Ausdauer und das Herz-Kreislauf-System trainieren. Das Programm wechselt täglich und wird aufbauend trainiert. Jeden zweiten Tag wird zum Ausgleich eine Faszieneinheit aus der separaten Faszien-App trainiert.\n\nUm gesund älter zu werden, benötigen wir Variation in unseren Workouts: Wir müssen Kraft aufbauen um Muskelverlust vorzubeugen, die Faszien sollen geschmeidig, die Gelenke beweglich bleiben. Auch das Herz-Kreislaufsystem muss trainiert werden, damit wir nicht bei der ersten leichten Steigung ausser Atem geraten. Der ganze Körper muss dafür möglichst täglich und mit System mobilisiert werden. \n\nDies alles berücksichtigt Mein Muskel-Faszien Training, Barbara Beckers innovatives „Better Aging“ Programm, das gemeinsam mit Sport- und Physiotherapeuten entwickelt wurde.\n\n10 bis 12 Minuten am Tag reichen um die Grundfitness und Beweglichkeit zu erhalten. Ein kleiner Aufwand mit großer Wirkung. Und ganz nebenbei formen die Übungseinheiten auch noch eine super Figur!"

If you DON'T wear your Watch to bed, then simply take your Watch off before you go to sleep. As soon as you touch your iPhone or put your Watch back on in the morning then AutoSleep will know that you have finished sleeping. \n\nAs everyone is a little bit different. AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper. \n\nAutoSleep also works with HeartWatch our premier heart & activity monitoring app and writes your Sleep information to Apple Health. \n\n*Requires Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher.\n\nAwards\n-----------------\nBest of 2018\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1438574124/\n\nBest of 2019\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1484100916/\n\nBest of 2020\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1535572713/\n\nBest of 2021\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1591083005/"

      "label": "If you love working out with Apple Watch, but you need more advanced fitness stats, HealthFit is for you.\n\nBy analyzing the workout data stored in Apple Health, HealthFit provides the kind of indispensable tracking and insights you normally only get from premium subscription services. But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times. You can even log which bike or shoes you use, to monitor usage and flag when it’s time to replace them.\n\nHealthFit finds photos you take during your workouts automatically, bringing your activity feed to life with stunning images you can share on social media.\n\nRUNNING POWER ANALYSIS\n\nHealthFit provides advanced running power analysis with the automatically estimated critical power, the weighted average power, the power distribution chart by 25W Increments and the mean maximal power chart which shows your best average power for time periods of one second up to the length of your run.\n\nMULTISPORT AND INTERVAL WORKOUTS\n\nHealthFit is the only app to export multisport workouts as multisession activities\n\nSTATISTICS: UNCOVER HIDDEN FITNESS INSIGHTS\n\nApple Watch gathers so much fitness data, it can sometimes seem overwhelming. HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling.

      "label": "AutoWake is the first haptic smart alarm for your Watch. \n\nIt can wake you up by tapping you on your wrist using your Watch's haptic engine. You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

      "label": "PULSALARM warns you via vibration or warning tone when you exceed your set upper and lower pulse limit and thus supports you in your pulse-based training. You can train as usual with your favorite fitness or running app. All you need to do is install PULSALARM on your Apple Watch.\n\nFeatures of the Apple Watch App:\n- Vibration and/or warning tone when the set pulse limits are reached\n- Vibration and/or signal tone when returning to the set pulse range\n- Pulse limits can be deactivated individually\n- Large, easy to read display of the current pulse\n- Fast adjustment of pulse limits (also possible while running)\n- Works together with all known fitness, training and running apps that can be started on the Apple Watch\n- Does not write data to Apple Health\n- You can use the app on your Apple Watch without having your iPhone with you\n\nFeatures of the iPhone App:\n- Calculation of your maximum heart rate\n- Individual calculation of the 5 intensity ranges (depending on your maximum heart rate) \n- Adoption of the pulse limits from the training zones\n- Setting the maximum and minimum pulse limit \n- Large display of the current pulse\n\nImportant note: without the use with an Apple Watch, the functional range of the app is limited, as no permanent pulse measurement can be carried out.\n\nNo advertising, no tracking, no third-party codes. Developed with passion and programmed in Germany.\n\nWhy use PULSALARM additionally? \nMany running apps include the pace as a target in their training plans. However, the same speed can mean a high intensity for one person and a low intensity for another. It is therefore helpful to consider your heart rate instead of speed to determine and maintain the right training intensity. \nPULSALARM helps you to do this. It turns your Apple Watch into a heart rate monitor. \n\nWhat is the big advantage?\nYou no longer have to look at your Apple Watch during your workout and still know whether you are exercising within your personal heart rate zone. Also ideal in colder months, when your Apple Watch is hidden under a jacket or long-sleeved shirt and you can't look directly at the display while running.\n\nFor whom is PULSALARM suitable?\n- Ideal for run beginners, as they can control themselves better and protect themselves from overstraining.\n- Ideal for ambitious runners, as they can train more specifically in their intensity ranges and thus increase endurance and performance.\n- For all athletes and fitness enthusiasts who are interested in heart rate monitoring during their training with their Apple Watch.\n\nSummary:\nWith the PULSALARM app on the iPhone you can determine your 5 intensity ranges based on your maximum heart rate. You can enter your maximum heart rate directly or have it calculated. Set your personal maximum heart rate limit, which you do not want to exceed during training, and your minimum heart rate limit. When these limits are reached, your Apple Watch will alert you by vibrating and/or beeping."

      "label": "Pado is all about geo tracking.\n\n\nRECORD TRACKS/ROUTES\n\nThis App provides several easy and powerful ways to record tracks or routes (for example of your hiking or cycling tours, of your trips with a motorcycle or car, workouts like jogging etc.), draw them on a map  and analyze them graphically using speed and altitude profiles and bar charts.\n\nYou can start and stop recording a track manually but also fully automatically in the background, without any user interaction. Just tell the App to start and stop the recording when leaving or entering certain regions, you can even limit the recording to a certain time period, and the App will do the rest automatically.\n\nThe tracks can be exported and imported as GPX and KML.\n\nEspecially for sports activity, the App can give you status updates about speed, duration and distance using Speech output.\n\n\nSTEP COUNTER\n\nPado also has a step counter (on devices with the required hardware).\n\n\nTIME TRACKING\n\nThe App provides a Time Tracking feature, which will gives you an easy way to log your whereabouts at certain regions automatically. Just define the regions you want to observe, the App is doing the rest automatically. The logged data can be presented as bar chart and exported as text or CSV file.\n\n\nLOCATION-BASED ACTIONS\n\nWhen entering or leaving certain regions the App can automatically record tracks, post notifications, play music, trigger \"external\" actions using the \"WebHook\" protocol and more.\n\n\nICLOUD SYNC\n\nTracks and regions can be synced across devices using the iCloud. This makes it easy to record tracks on an iPhone and evaluate these later on a larger iPad screen.\n\n\nAPPLE WATCH\n\nPado also supports the Apple Watch (all models) and can be used fully autonomously to record tracks or routes (which means you do not need to take the iPhone with you to use the Watch App). This does even work on Apple Watch models without GPS hardware (in which case the location services do use WLAN networks nearby to get the geo location). All tracks can be displayed directly on the Watch on a Map, and you can zoom and scroll the map with the track. Alternatively you can also use the Watch App to remote control the iPhone App.\n\n\nHARDWARE REQUIREMENTS\n\nPado supports all iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Apple Watch devices. \nUnlike many other Apps, this App does also work great on iPod Touch and iPad models without GPS hardware (but you need to be within a region with a good WLAN coverage). On devices with GPS hardware it works best. The step counter requires an iPhone 5s or newer or an Apple Watch.\n\n\nHEALTH-KIT\n\nAs an option, Pado can use the heart rate data from Health-Kit and display it together with the recorded Track speed and pace charts. When recording tracks on the Apple Watch, Pado can also measure the heart rate. Pado will never store the heart rate data anywhere (neither within Pado nor externally), and will use the HealthKit data only when explicitly enabled in the settings.\n\n\nFINAL NOTES\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

Die App kann ebenso dazu benutzt werden, auf spielerische Weise das Verhalten in einer solchen akuten Situation zu üben. Im Programmteil „Der kleine Lebensretter“ wird zusätzlich Hintergrundwissen zu den unterschiedlichsten Erste Hilfe-Themen vermittelt. \n\nDie Applikation bietet vier Funktionen: \nDer interaktive Erste Hilfe-Assistent gibt per Sprache und wahlweise Text oder Bild Anweisungen zu Erste Hilfe-Maßnahmen und kann so durch eine Notfallsituation lotsen. Per Eingabe mit „Ja“- oder „Nein“-Taste können die Fragen der Applikation entsprechend der Notfallsituation beantwortet werden. Der Benutzer wird auf Beachtung des Eigenschutzes hingewiesen und zur Bewusstseins- und Atemkontrolle angehalten. Der jeweiligen Antwort entsprechend wird er weitergeleitet zu Maßnahmen zur Wiederbelebung oder zu Maßnahmen, die bei Verbrennungen, Vergiftungen, Atemnot, Blutungen, Schlaganfall und Herzinfarkt dringend notwendig sind. Diese Maßnahmen werden detailliert, weitestgehend auch durch Abbildungen, beschrieben. \n\nDer „Notruf Assistent“ bietet Hilfe, um einen Notruf zu tätigen. Er enthält eine Anleitung für eine genaue Notfallmeldung anhand der fünf Ws, bietet die Möglichkeit einer Standortbestimmung mit Darstellung durch Google-Maps und zur automatischen Notrufbetätigung. \n„Der kleine Lebensretter“ beinhaltet wichtiges Hintergrundwissen in Text und Bild zu unterschiedlichen Erste Hilfe-Themen wie Gelenkverletzungen, Knochenbrüchen, Sonnenstich, Schock oder Stabile Seitenlage. „Der kleine Lebensretter“ kann weiterführend zum interaktiven Erste Hilfe-Assistenten oder allgemein als kleine Informationssammlung zu Ersten Hilfe-Themen benutzt werden. \nMit den „DRK Infodiensten“ lassen sich die wichtigsten DRK News online abrufen, aktuelle Blutspendetermine im Umkreis herausfinden und eine Übersicht über die unterschiedlichen Angebote zu Erste Hilfe Kursen einsehen.\n\nDie Applikation ist in deutscher Sprache."

      "label": "Die Progressive Muskelentspannung (PME) nach Edmund Jacobson ist eine wissenschaftlich anerkannte Entspannungsmethode, die über Muskelanspannung und Entspannung dazu verhilft, in einen Zustand der Tiefenentspannung zu gelangen. Die PME ist eine - wissenschaftlich erwiesen - sehr wirksame Entspannungsmethode; sie wird von Ärzten bei zahlreichen meist stressbedingten Symptomen empfohlen wie z.B.:\n\n• Verspannungen\n• Migräne oder Kopfschmerzen\n• innere Unruhe\n• Schlafstörungen\n• Rücken-/Schmerzen\n• Erregungszustände, Prüfungsangst\n• Angst- und Panikattacken\n• Bluthochdruck\n• psychosomatischen Beschwerden\n\nMit regelmäßiger Übung wird es immer besser gelingen, in noch tiefere Entspannungszustände zu geraten. Sobald man genügend Übung und Erfahrung mit der ausführlichen Form der Progressiven Muskelentspannung (GRUNDFORM: 17 Muskelgruppen / ANFÄNGER-Status) hat, kann auch zu den kürzeren Varianten (Kurzformen) mit 7 und 4 Muskelgruppen übergegangen werden und schließlich wird es leicht fallen, sich bzw. auch einzelne Körperpartien mit dem Body Scan rein mental zu entspannen. Es sollte zu Beginn bei allen Formen der Übungsstatus ANFÄNGER gewählt werden.\n\nIn dieser App werden alle 4 Formen der PME (Grund- und 2 Kurzformen sowie die Mentale Form) angeleitet und geübt.\n\nGRUNDFORM: 17 MUSKELGRUPPEN\n1. Rechte Hand und Unterarm\n2. Rechter Oberarm\n3. Linke Hand und Unterarm\n4. Linker Oberarm \n5. Stirn\n6. Obere Wangenpartie und Nase\n7. Untere Wangenpartie und Kiefer\n8. Nacken \n9. Brust, Schultern und obere Rückenpartie\n10. Bauchmuskulatur\n11. Gesäß- und Beckenboden\n12. Rechter Oberschenkel\n13. Rechter Unterschenkel \n14. Rechter Fuß\n15, 16, 17 (-> linke Seite)\n\nKURZFORM I: 7 MUSKELGRUPPEN\n1. Rechte Hand, Unterarm und Oberarm\n2. Linke Hand, Unterarm und Oberarm\n3. Stirn, Wangenpartie, Nase und Kiefer\n4. Nacken \n5. Brust, Schultern, Rücken, Bauch-, Gesäß und Beckenboden\n6. Rechter Oberschenkel, Unterschenkel und Fuß\n7. Linker Oberschenkel, Unterschenkel und Fuß\n\nKURZFORM II: 4 MUSKELGRUPPEN\n1. Beide Hände, Unterarme und Oberarme\n2. Gesichts- und Nackenmuskulatur\n3. Brust, Schultern, Rücken, Bauch-, Gesäß- und Beckenboden\n4. Beide Oberschenkel, Unterschenkel und Füße\n\nMENTALE FORM: BODY-SCAN\nGeführte Entspannung durch den ganzen Körper bis zu den Füßen, diesmal beginnend mit Gesichts, Unterkiefer und Nacken. Diese Anleitung ist die letzte Stufe der PME, bei der die Wahrnehmung auf einzelne Körperteile gelenkt wird, ohne diese anzuspannen. Die Entspannung erfolgt jetzt nur noch mental. Hilfreiche Vorstellungen (Sonne, Strand, Meer) können dabei unterstützen (wählbar).\n\nÜBUNGS-STATUS\nFür alle Formen der PME kann zudem der Übungsdauer-Status \n- ANFÄNGER\n- FORTGESCHRITTEN\n- ERFAHREN\ngewählt werden. Damit stehen insgesamt 12 vollständige Versionen der PME zu Verfügung.\n\nLIEGEND / SITZEND\nAlle Formen werden wahlweise jeweils im Sitzen oder Liegen angeleitet.\n\nMUSIK & NATUR-SOUNDS\nEs kann aus 5 Entspannungsmusiken und 18 Natur-Sounds gewählt werden, die sich jeweils untereinander und an die Lautstärke der Stimme anpassen lassen. Falls gewünscht können Musik/Sounds auch alleine (ohne Stimme) zur Entspannung bzw. zum Einschlafen genutzt werden. Es können auch 2 Natur-Sounds gleichzeitig kombiniert werden.\n\nEINSCHLAFEN - RÜCKNAHME - OHNE OUTRO\nAlle Übungen können wahlweise zum Einschlafen, zur Entspannung mit Rücknahme und ohne Outro verwendet werden. \n\nDAUER DER ANSPANNUNG\nDie Dauer der Anspannung der Muskelgruppen kann ausgewählt werden. Überwiegend wird eine Anspannung von 5 Sek. empfohlen.\n\nPAUSEN ZUM ENTSPANNEN\nDie Dauer der Pausen zwischen den Muskelgruppen kann nach eigenen Vorlieben und Übungsstand angepasst werden. Überwiegend wird eine Dauer von 20 Sek. empfohlen.\n\nTIMER\nAuf alle Übungen kann eine beliebig lange Zeit für die Entspannungsmusik & Natur-Sounds eingestellt werden, die die Entspannung vertiefen.\n\nHINWEISE\nDie App kann / sollte sogar im Flugmodus (offline) genutzt werden.\nDie App enthält keine Werbung, Abos, In-App-Käufe."

      "label": "This application is a sidekick to the beastmaker 1000 and 2000. It has been designed to assist the user into gradually getting stronger on a fingerboard. The app does this by way of prewritten workouts which are often general and aim to improve all trainable grips on the board. Some are specific (2000 series only at the moment) which aim to improve, sloper strength, pocket strength and crimp strength. \n\nThere is also a new custom workout program fully adjustable and includes the 1000,2000 and micros, so if you have your own hang regime and different timings then that is all programmable and can be saved.\n\nBoth the workouts and custom timer now record hang contraction time (time spent actually hanging off the board) We recommend most users get up to around 20:00 minutes on this clock whilst doing their workouts.\n\nOn the Workout screen after you've selected your work out it is now possible to adjust set and hang times. Users who are only finger boarding and are having a rest day prior to and after training may wish to do up to 3 sets and 7 hangs. Other users may prefer to go for 2 sets and 6 hangs, this is what we'd consider an average and more suited to people doing additional types of training.\n\nPlease note the grades for the workouts aren't actually meant to relate to anything other than themselves. E.G. 5c is easier than 6a but harder than 5b. If you find 5a hard on the 1000, use a weight removal technique such as putting one foot on a chair in front of the board or using a pulley with weights on. More advice on this and other things are available in the general advice section on the Workout Ratings page.\n\nTo record your hangs press the record button (red circle icon) whilst resting. The Workout Ratings function is much improved and should now be a really useful training aid which records gradual progress and improvement.\n\nFingerboard gains take time, remember to warm up thoroughly and move on to more difficult hangs at a slightly slower pace than you think you should to give pulleys time to catch up with muscles. For example 10% strength gains over a year is brilliant improvement. 5% is still effective training.\n\nBest of luck with the training, happy hanging and we hope this helps with the motivation."

      "label": "WHAT IS BRUXAPP?\nBruxApp is the first globally available, research-based smartphone app dedicated to the study and management of Bruxism and its health consequences.\nDesigned by top international experts in a multi-center Bruxism research project and developed in 25 Research Centres across the world. \n\nWHAT CAN IT DO?\nBruxapp is a simple tool used by dentists and patients for several purposes:\n- To help the assessment  of the presence/absence of bruxism-related activities (i.e., teeth clenching or grinding, jaw clenching) and potential consequences.\n- For rating the severity of bruxism, if present.\n- As a biofeedback-based management tool for bruxism.\n- To increase patients’ awareness of bruxism activities so they can avoid or correct negative habits.\n- To make patients aware of the possible clinical consequences of bruxism and try to prevent them.\n- To promote cutting-edge knowledge about bruxism, based on the latest scientific research.\n\nWHY is BruxApp needed? \nBruxism has been increasing in prevalence over recent years. It encompasses motor activities of the jaw muscles, such as jaw or teeth clenching, and teeth grinding, some of which may be associated with clinical signs and symptoms, like tooth wear, failed dental restorations, complications with implant-supported prosthesis, muscle fatigue and temporomandibular joint pain. A correct diagnosis is therefore fundamental to establishing early prevention and management regimens.\n\nSCIENTIFIC RESEARCH\nStudies with BruxApp have been supervised by experts, as part of an ongoing multicenter research project on bruxism epidemiology and management coordinated by Prof. Daniele Manfredini, University of Siena, Italy.\n\nDEVELOPMENT\nThe app was developed by Goran Djukic, program analyst at the Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Council of Research, University of Pisa, Italy.\nBruxApp is currently available in the following languages: English, Italian, , French, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish, Brazilian, Japanese, Hebrew, Chinese, Arabic, Greek, Polish, Lithuanian, Bosnian, Romanian, Turkish, Norwegian, and Croatian, with another 4 language versions soon to be released. \n\nIMPORTANT STATEMENT\nBruxApp is not a game or gadget.  In order for BruxApp to work correctly and be effective, please dedicate 5 minutes of your time to READING the simple instructions CAREFULLY. \n\nThe full compatibility is guaranteed by iPhone 6 and higher ones and iOS 9.3 and higher ones."

Es löst die Anspannungen, die der Körper bei starken inneren Gefühlen und äusseren Einflüssen aufbaut. Es bringt Sie zu innerer Ruhe und Gelassenheit zurück.

      "label": "Cardiogram is a modern minimalistic, reliable app that will help accurately monitor and record your heart rate in real-time to help keep track of your health and performance. Just power on your sensor and start the app - it’s that easy!\n\nCardiogram is one of the few apps that do not require you to create an account, all information is stored locally and thereby protected from any data leaks or privacy scandals. No personal data is sent to any servers, all the information is stored directly on your iPhone and Apple Health app only.\nThe app is integrated with Apple HealthKit to sync and record heart-rate data.\n\nNotable features:\n• full control over your data\n• synchronise with Apple Health\n• record your workouts (walking, running, cycling)\n• no location services are used or required\n• very low energy consumption\n• no account is required\n\nYou can monitor and record your cardiac rhythm in a range of situations:\n• During the day to detect heart rate anomalies;\n• During sleep;\n• During your preferred fitness workouts or cardio exercises;\n• As a way of measuring stress or anxiety levels by measuring resting heart rate;\n\nCardiogram is compatible with a range of modern heart rate monitors with Bluetooth 4.0 (Smart or LE) available on the market.\nThe app has been tested using multiple heart sensors, including Polar sensors (Polar OH1, H10, and H7) with excellent and consistent performance results.\nWe recommend using Cardiogram app paired with:\nGarmin HRM-Dual or Garmin HRM-Pro\nPolar OH1, H10, and H7\nXiaomi Mi Band 3\nXiaomi Mi Band 4\nCardiosport TP3\nR1 Blue Sigma Sport\nWahoo TICKR\nCooSpo heart rate monitors\n\nThe app relies on a medical algorithm to automatically calculate heart rate limits and will display a warning signal when the maximum heart rate limit is reached.\nEvery session is recorded and can be viewed later in simple and easy to understand graph charts.\nTo reduce history view cluttering the app save only the sessions longer than 2 minutes. So, if you want to check your heart rate for a few seconds, you can do that, but will not be recorded in the history database.\nColour coded visual information during the workouts:\n– Light green: Fitness Zone (50 to 60% of maximum heart rate). Workouts in this zone target the cardiovascular system, making them a particularly good choice for fitness newbies.\n– Green: Fat-Burning and Aerobic Zone (60 to 80% of maximum heart rate). If you’re in the aerobic training zone, you’ll feel like you’re working hard but could still dig a little deeper. The body fuels the workout by burning carbohydrates and fats. The cardiovascular system, the lungs, and metabolism all benefit equally.\n– Yellow: Anaerobic zone (80 to 90% of maximum heart rate). Workouts in the anaerobic zone are particularly good for building muscles (for weightlifters) and boosting performance (for endurance athletes). Interval training involves spending short periods in the anaerobic zone.\n– Red: close to maximum heart rate for the user age (over 90% from the maximum hr). A heart rate in this zone can be very dangerous! Experienced competitive athletes do short intervals of training at this energy-sapping intensity under professional supervision to refine their performance shortly before a big event.\n\nDISCLAIMER!\nIT IS NOT THE INTENT OF THE APPLICATION TO PROVIDE MEDICAL DIAGNOSES OR TREATMENTS OF ANY KIND.\nPLEASE DO NOT TAKE ANY MEDICAL DECISIONS BASED ON THE APP RECORDS BEFORE SEEKING A MEDICAL DOCTOR ADVICE."

      "label": "Fit for learning with the Trio of Brainyville!\n\nThe Brainyville app helps children to practice their working memory, attention, and concentration. These skills will support children to learn better. The better the children are able to control their attention and the more their working memory is trained the easier children learn at school. Brain researchers call these skills executive functions.\n \nThe Brainyville app consists of two games:\n \n1-2-3 BACK ist designed to improve working memory. The children see a sequence of pictures, and the task is to indicate when the current picture matches the one 1,2,3,4,5 or 6 steps earlier in the sequence. The number of steps will be adjusted for making the task more or less difficult.\n \nWith LOOK AND BE SMART children have to focus their attention on predefined features of a Brainyville figure and to ignore irrelevant stimuli. It is also known as executive attention.\n \nIn both games the aim is to collect on a beautifully designed collecting card as many Flutter points as possible.\n\nDetails:\n\nThe Trio of Brainyville, which are Flutter, the crazy chicken, Bluster, the brave dragon, and Memo, the clever rabbit, from the children's book series with the same name.\n\n1-2-3 BACK is a specific training for the working memory. With the working memory, children can maintain information over a short period of time, and work with it. This is the crucial ability on which depends the academic achievement in all subjects. When doing mental arithmetic, it is important to store numbers and tasks in the working memory while the children apply calculation rules, store and process intermediate results to get to the correct solution. When writing they need to keep sentences in working memory while spelling single words, divide words into syllables, derive and remember words, without forgetting the sentence. Every day, it is important to remember instructions of the teacher, while single task steps are to be performed in a specific order. There are numerous examples that make aware of how significant is the working memory for the learning success.\n\nLOOK AND BE SMART trains selective attention and concentration of the kids. When it comes to focus continuously on one thing, not to be distracted and purposefully to ignore disturbances, then selective attention is required. Like working memory, this ability also affects learning performance at school to a great extent and during all school years.\n\nWorking memory and selective attention can be trained. For this, 1-2-3 BACK and LOOK AND BE SMART are very suitable. With 1-2-3 BACK the object of the children is to store the pictures in working memory and to match them with pictures shown before. With LOOK AND BE SMART the children should focus their attention to the characteristics of a given Brainyville figure and hide other specific features. The goal of both games is to collect as many Flutter points as possible on a beautifully designed card."

Calculate your max safely and easily, and then track it over time, on any lift with our easy-to-use calculator!\n\nIn the simplest terms, your 1RM is the amount of weight you can lift for one rep on any given lift. In general, it’s good to know your max for key lifts like the squat, bench press, and deadlift, but your 1RM is critical even if you never plan to train that heavy.\n\nMany lifting programs are designed with a percent of your rep max in mind, and may call for something like using 65% of your 1RM for a given exercise. When you see that, you have to either test for your 1RM or estimate it. Testing your 1RM can be pretty intense, and it requires a high degree of caution to avoid injury.\n\nFortunately, you can estimate your 1RM without testing it! Exercise scientists have devised a formula that's fairly accurate for most people, which is what powers this calculator. Our calculator makes it easy to calculate and track your 1RM and multiple percentages of it for every lift in the book!\n\nFeatures:\n\n· Calculate your 1RM and percentages\n\n· Choose from a variety of lifts (deadlift, bench press, squat, etc.), or add your own\n\n· Track and chart your 1RM history for each type of lift\n\n· Add notes each time you calculate your 1RM\n\n· Improve your weight training with articles by Bodybuilding.com experts\n\n· Choose imperial or metric system\n\n· Incredibly easy to use!"

Available in English, Spanish, German, French, Italian and Portuguese. **\n\nHere at Hoffman we’ve come up with the perfect solution to keeping the Process alive in your life - the Hoffman App.\n\nThis App gives you the chance to stay connected to your Hoffman experience. You can work through the tools, express how you feel and receive ongoing Hoffman support and encouragement. Almost like having a Hoffman teacher in your pocket!\n\nIt’s quite normal that when you leave the Process you are full of commitment to practice the tools on a daily basis. But as time goes on, we sometimes hear that people have forgotten how to use the tools, or ‘don’t have time’.\n\nWe are now able to provide you with an App that gives you ‘Tools at your Fingertips’.\n\n- How are you feeling today? Try our Feeling Wheel: Type in how you’re feeling and spin the wheel and a top tool or suggestion will be given to you as if by magic.\n\n- Caught in a Vicious Cycle? Use our Vicious Cycle drawing tool to work your way out of negative behaviour. You can even share your exit strategies with your friends!\n\n- Having a Dark Side attack? Banish those unwanted messages by taking control and erasing the Dark Side from your day. Use your fingers to physically erase the image of the dark side until it has all gone. You can do this as often as you wish.\n\n- Good Morning Quad! Your App will guide you through a Quad check-in either as an audio meditation or you can follow written instructions. You can archive your experiences and track your development days later.\n\n- Need to express that pattern? Imagine the chance to hold the yellow Wiffle bat in your hand again. Well now you can with our Bashaker Tool! Grab your phone in two hands and spend some time focusing on and expressing energy associated with a negative pattern. Release the energy but don’t release the phone!\n\n- Caught in a Transference? The Hoffman Transference tool can guide you through the steps to acknowledging a transference and letting it go. The person you’re expressing a transference to doesn’t even need to know what you’re doing!\n\nOther tools include a place to write a daily Journal or add images to your Vision Board. The App gives you space to record and share thoughts and inspirations with your friends or via social media. \n\nAnd if you want a quiet moment away from the noise of the world around you the App provides you with several Audio Meditations from around the world. Listen to Recycling or a Centering Visualisation or enjoy a Light Journey or I am that I am."

      "label": "Slow Eats is an interval timer app aimed at helping you slow down and stay mindful during eating. Slow eating facilitates a healthy relationship with food and can ultimately lead to weight loss.\n\nEating slowly has many possible benefits:\n    ● Promotes weight loss by giving your brain more time to receive fullness signals\n    ● Helps you better absorb the nutrients in your food\n    ● Improves digestion\n    ● Makes you feel calmer and more in control\n    ● Increases your enjoyment of food\n\nChoose between three types of timers:\n    ● Bite Timer: Slow down how fast you eat by creating a set pause between each bite.\n    ● Meal Timer: Slow down how fast you eat by defining set eating and break windows during your meal.\n    ● Seconds Timer: Create a mindful pause before you get more. Give yourself time to feel full before deciding you need more.\n\n______________________________________\n\n~ What users are saying about the app ~\n\n\"I’ve never written an app review before, but I need to write one for this app. I got an Apple Watch and was determined to use it to lose weight. Between closing my rings and using this app, I have lost over 25 lbs. Even more important than any one accomplishment: it helped heal my unhealthy relationship with food.\"\n\n\"I eat way too fast. I get hungry and just smash my dinner every day and then often feel bad from over eating. This app is exactly what I was looking for. It’s simple, it’s easy to use, and it works. I love how I don’t have to watch a timer I just wait for the tap on my wrist. I’m already building healthier eating habits by using this app. THANK YOU!!\"\n\n\"Have been trying to slow down and be able to better listen to my fullness cues when I eat! This watch app does the trick!\"\n\n\"I tell anyone who will listen how much I love this app. I have the icon on my watch face and I use it for every meal and snack. So easy to use and it has helped me so much as I’ve been trying to slow down while eating. Another bonus is that the developers are so responsive and helpful! Hands down my favorite app!\"\n\n_______________________________________\n\nStart building a healthier relationship with food today by simply slowing down.\n\nLearn More:\n- https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/eating-slowly-and-weight-loss#thorough-chewing\n- https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/mindful-eating-guide\n\nAvailable on the Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, and Mac."

      "label": "Did you know that your heart beats faster during inhalation and slower during exhalation AND did you know that this is good for you?\n\nThe technical term is RSA (respiratory sinus arrhythmia) - a good arrhythmia controlled by your autonomic nervous system. \n\nHigh variability of the heart rate stands for a good autonomic balance and activity of the parasympathetic nervous system (rest and relaxation nerve).\n\nHeartBreath is a biofeedback tool, that addresses exactly this relationship between breathing and heart rate.\n\nThe app guides you through a simple slow-breathing exercise (with pictures and sounds), while detecting and displaying the intervals between your heartbeats. You can measure, train and evaluate your personal status. No additional hardware devices are needed. HeartBreath is able to detect heartbeats by positioning your finger on the lens of the phone’s camera.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\nIntegrated VaYou Sound Flows, which provide an exceptional sound experience on acoustic pacing.\n\nHigh quality and customizable control of the bio-feedback exercise with pictures (you can work with pictures from your photo library) and sounds. \n\nLive display of the current heart rate and variability values while recording.\n\nIn just a few breaths, HeartBreath is able to compute your resting heart rate.\n\nNo additional hardware is needed. The calculation works with a finger on the lens of the iPhone’s (or iPod’s) camera (for iPad only device models with flash). Optionally, an external heart rate monitor can be used. For compatible devices (Polar H10) display/recording/evaluation of true ECG data is supported. As a special extra, the app allows the comparison of data between the finger on the camera and the heart rate monitor.\n\nUnlike many other HRV apps, HeartBreath offers a precise visualization for every single heartbeat and, if necessary, tools for interactive correction of the beats. This is very important for the high reliability of HRV parameters, since single ectopic heartbeats or data artifacts can result in strange adulteration of HRV values.\n\nIntegrated tools to determine your optimal breathing speed. Various studies show that each person has an individual optimal RSA breathing rate in the range between 4 and 7 breaths per minute.\n\nTrend evaluations over longer periods of time.\n\nHeartBreath integrates with the Apple Health app.\n\nPrivacy is important to us! The app does not require registration and you have full control over the data of your sessions, which is only stored on your phone."

Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

      "label": "Heart Rate Variability measurements recorded by your Apple Watch can give you insight on the stress level your body is under. By using HRV Tracker to track short-term measurements and long-term trends, you can see how your workload during the day, workout sessions or sleeping etc affect your body's readiness, recovery and stress level. Simply put, the higher your HRV is, the better.\n\n***Requires an HRV capable Apple Watch with watchOS 6 or later***\nHRV Tracker for Watch integrates with the Health app and uses data stored in the Health app. To make sure your Apple Watch is capable of recording HRV measurements, please open the Health app on your iPhone to see if any HRV measurements exists. Go to > Health app > Browse > Heart > Hear Rate Variability.\n\n***Get Notified***\nHRV Tracker makes spotting changes in your HRV easy by monitoring your HRV measurements in the background and showing notifications after your HRV drops under or rises above your desired levels. HRV Tracker will monitor changes in individual measurements and also your 24 hour HRV average. You can change the default notification levels directly in your Apple Watch app. Please note that notifications can get postponed for example because of a low battery level.\n\n***Apple Watch for daily tracking***\nBrowse through last seven days of HRV measurements by using the digital crown. See how measurements compare to your seven day period and individual days. By tapping the graph you can toggle through the first values of each day. Use complications on your Apple Watch to stay informed on changes in your HRV. \n\nBesides the automatically recorded HRV measurements you can use the Breathe app on your Apple Watch to record new HRV measurements. Start a Breathe session in the Breathe app and after the session ends a new HRV measurement will be available in HRV Tracker.\n\n***Compare HRV to other key metrics***\nFind possible causes for changes in HRV by using the comparison graphs available on your Apple Watch:\n-Sleep hours: By default HRV Tracker will use sleep data provided by sleep apps that add sleep data to HealthKit. If no sleep data is available HRV Tracker will calculate estimated sleep hours per night (estimated sleep time will only be available in the Apple Watch app)\n-Activity: By default HRV Tracker will use your Active Energy (calories) as the activity metric. In the HRV Tracker Apple Watch app you can choose to use a custom activity score that emphasizes the intensity of daily activity.\n-Daily resting heart rate (RHR).\nToggle between comparison graphs by tapping the upper part of the screen.\n\n***Follow Long-term HRV trend***\nFollow your long-term HRV trend on your iPhone and compare your short term measurements to all-time data.\n-Select week from weekly graph to see daily HRV values of the selected week.\n-Browse through all daily HRV values of the selected day\n-Compare daily HRV averages to other relevant daily metrics: Activity, Sleep (if available in the Health app) and Resting Heart Rate\n\n***Widgets on iPhone***\n-Medium sized widget with chart showing all daily hrv values\n-Multiple small widgets to choose from\n\n***Privacy***\nData read from the Apple HealthKit database is only used to show information related to your Heart Rate Variability. Information read by HRV Tracker is only stored and used locally on your iPhone and Apple Watch. \n\n***How is it measured***\nHeart rate variability measurements used by HRV Tracker are calculated by measuring the variation between individual heartbeats. Your Apple Watch automatically measures your HRV in the background and stores the outcome into HealthKit. HealthKit uses SDNN heart rate variability, which is calculated using the standard deviation of the inter-beat (RR) intervals between normal heartbeats (measured in milliseconds). Besides background measurements generated automatically by your Apple Watch you can use the Breathe app on your Apple Watch to generate new measurements."

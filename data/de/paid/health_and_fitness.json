If you DON'T wear your Watch to bed, then simply take your Watch off before you go to sleep. As soon as you touch your iPhone or put your Watch back on in the morning then AutoSleep will know that you have finished sleeping. \n\nAs everyone is a little bit different. AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper. \n\nAutoSleep also works with HeartWatch our premier heart & activity monitoring app and writes your Sleep information to Apple Health. \n\n*Requires Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher.\n\nAwards\n-----------------\nBest of 2018\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1438574124/\n\nBest of 2019\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1484100916/\n\nBest of 2020\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1535572713/\n\nBest of 2021\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1591083005/"

      "label": "• The official Hormonology® app that gives boyfriends and husbands a daily forecast of their female partner's moods, libido, energy and more based on where she is in her monthly cycle\n• Get the FREE eBook \"Quickstart Guide to Forecasting a Woman's Moods, Libido & Energy\" at FemaleForecaster.com\n\n• • • • • \n\n• Created by Gabrielle Lichterman, founder of Hormonology, author of 28 Days: What Your Cycle Reveals about Your Love Life, Moods and Potential and longtime women's health journalist\n\n• Inspired by girlfriends and wives who use Gabrielle's popular Hormone Horoscope App--and asked her to create a simpler, more condensed version for their male partners\n\n• • • • • \n\nTAKE THE GUESSWORK OUT OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP\n\nGet confused by the changing moods of your girlfriend or wife? Wonder why her desire for physical intimacy is high one day, then bottomed-out the next? \n\nThere will be no more guessing when you use the Female Forecaster App. \n\nThis new app for boyfriends and husbands lets you know what your sweetheart's moods, libido, energy level and more will be every day.\n\nAnd, it all comes down to where she is in her monthly cycle. \n\n\nTHE SCIENCE\n\nAs three key hormones (estrogen, testosterone and progesterone) rise and fall throughout a woman's monthly cycle, research shows they impact her brain and body in a wide variety of ways.\n\nBecause her hormones repeat the same up and down pattern every cycle, the effects her hormones have on her also repeat the same way cycle after cycle--making her moods, libido, energy and more easy to predict.\n\nFor example...\n\n• On Day 7 of a woman's hormone cycle, she's happier, energetic and experiencing a spike in her sex drive thanks to rising estrogen--making this a day when boyfriends and husbands can do no wrong.\n\n• On Day 19, she's quieter, sluggish and her desire for physical intimacy is low due to sedating progesterone, which is a hormone that reins in sexual desire--so men shouldn't take her \"Not tonight, dear\" personally.\n\n• On Day 27, a drop in estrogen can make her irritable and blue, but she also experiences a rise in libido--which explains why she can be cross with you one minute, but want to cuddle with you the next.\n\nRead full sample forecasts from this app at MyHormonology.com/female-forecaster/sample-days\n\n\nHOW TO USE THE APP\n\nSetting it up takes seconds: Simply input two pieces of information about your girlfriend or wife to launch the app's cycle calendar:\n\n• The typical length of her menstrual cycle (input 28 days if you don't know)\n• The day she's on in her cycle right now (just ask her--her Day 1 is the first day of her most recent period and she just counts from there)\n\nYou can then read your Female Forecast for today or look at any point in the future--tomorrow, next week, next month, even next year--to find out what she'll be like then. \n\n\nAPP BONUSES\n\nThis app also allows you to...\n\n• Get alerts about key days in her cycle (for instance, when her premenstrual week is arriving)\n• Create custom alerts\n• Keep notes\n• Get date ideas and tips for getting on her good side\n\n\nWHO THIS APP IS FOR\n\nMale partners of women who have\n• Healthy menstrual cycles\n• Menstrual cycles lasting anywhere from 22 to 49 days (it's okay if her cycle length varies from month to month)\n• Natural hormones (no hormone birth control)\n\nThis app is not intended for partners of women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, menopausal, taking hormone medications or hormone birth control or have a health disorder that impacts hormones, such as PCOS.\n\nThis app is not intended to help users and their partners avoid pregnancy or become pregnant.\n\n\nFEEDBACK\n\nIf you're experiencing any problem with this app, I want to know. My team and I work quickly to fix issues and provide updates to ensure you get the most out of your experience. Send your feedback to Gabrielle@MyHormonology.com."

You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping.

Die App kann ebenso dazu benutzt werden, auf spielerische Weise das Verhalten in einer solchen akuten Situation zu üben. Im Programmteil „Der kleine Lebensretter“ wird zusätzlich Hintergrundwissen zu den unterschiedlichsten Erste Hilfe-Themen vermittelt. \n\nDie Applikation bietet vier Funktionen: \nDer interaktive Erste Hilfe-Assistent gibt per Sprache und wahlweise Text oder Bild Anweisungen zu Erste Hilfe-Maßnahmen und kann so durch eine Notfallsituation lotsen. Per Eingabe mit „Ja“- oder „Nein“-Taste können die Fragen der Applikation entsprechend der Notfallsituation beantwortet werden. Der Benutzer wird auf Beachtung des Eigenschutzes hingewiesen und zur Bewusstseins- und Atemkontrolle angehalten. Der jeweiligen Antwort entsprechend wird er weitergeleitet zu Maßnahmen zur Wiederbelebung oder zu Maßnahmen, die bei Verbrennungen, Vergiftungen, Atemnot, Blutungen, Schlaganfall und Herzinfarkt dringend notwendig sind. Diese Maßnahmen werden detailliert, weitestgehend auch durch Abbildungen, beschrieben. \n\nDer „Notruf Assistent“ bietet Hilfe, um einen Notruf zu tätigen. Er enthält eine Anleitung für eine genaue Notfallmeldung anhand der fünf Ws, bietet die Möglichkeit einer Standortbestimmung mit Darstellung durch Google-Maps und zur automatischen Notrufbetätigung. \n„Der kleine Lebensretter“ beinhaltet wichtiges Hintergrundwissen in Text und Bild zu unterschiedlichen Erste Hilfe-Themen wie Gelenkverletzungen, Knochenbrüchen, Sonnenstich, Schock oder Stabile Seitenlage. „Der kleine Lebensretter“ kann weiterführend zum interaktiven Erste Hilfe-Assistenten oder allgemein als kleine Informationssammlung zu Ersten Hilfe-Themen benutzt werden. \nMit den „DRK Infodiensten“ lassen sich die wichtigsten DRK News online abrufen, aktuelle Blutspendetermine im Umkreis herausfinden und eine Übersicht über die unterschiedlichen Angebote zu Erste Hilfe Kursen einsehen.\n\nDie Applikation ist in deutscher Sprache."

      "label": "Pado is all about geo tracking.\n\n\nRECORD TRACKS/ROUTES\n\nThis App provides several easy and powerful ways to record tracks or routes (for example of your hiking or cycling tours, of your trips with a motorcycle or car, workouts like jogging etc.), draw them on a map  and analyze them graphically using speed and altitude profiles and bar charts.\n\nYou can start and stop recording a track manually but also fully automatically in the background, without any user interaction. Just tell the App to start and stop the recording when leaving or entering certain regions, you can even limit the recording to a certain time period, and the App will do the rest automatically.\n\nThe tracks can be exported and imported as GPX and KML.\n\nEspecially for sports activity, the App can give you status updates about speed, duration and distance using Speech output.\n\n\nSTEP COUNTER\n\nPado also has a step counter (on devices with the required hardware).\n\n\nTIME TRACKING\n\nThe App provides a Time Tracking feature, which will gives you an easy way to log your whereabouts at certain regions automatically. Just define the regions you want to observe, the App is doing the rest automatically. The logged data can be presented as bar chart and exported as text or CSV file.\n\n\nLOCATION-BASED ACTIONS\n\nWhen entering or leaving certain regions the App can automatically record tracks, post notifications, play music, trigger \"external\" actions using the \"WebHook\" protocol and more.\n\n\nICLOUD SYNC\n\nTracks and regions can be synced across devices using the iCloud. This makes it easy to record tracks on an iPhone and evaluate these later on a larger iPad screen.\n\n\nAPPLE WATCH\n\nPado also supports the Apple Watch (all models) and can be used fully autonomously to record tracks or routes (which means you do not need to take the iPhone with you to use the Watch App). This does even work on Apple Watch models without GPS hardware (in which case the location services do use WLAN networks nearby to get the geo location). All tracks can be displayed directly on the Watch on a Map, and you can zoom and scroll the map with the track. Alternatively you can also use the Watch App to remote control the iPhone App.\n\n\nHARDWARE REQUIREMENTS\n\nPado supports all iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Apple Watch devices. \nUnlike many other Apps, this App does also work great on iPod Touch and iPad models without GPS hardware (but you need to be within a region with a good WLAN coverage). On devices with GPS hardware it works best. The step counter requires an iPhone 5s or newer or an Apple Watch.\n\n\nHEALTH-KIT\n\nAs an option, Pado can use the heart rate data from Health-Kit and display it together with the recorded Track speed and pace charts. When recording tracks on the Apple Watch, Pado can also measure the heart rate. Pado will never store the heart rate data anywhere (neither within Pado nor externally), and will use the HealthKit data only when explicitly enabled in the settings.\n\n\nFINAL NOTES\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "Biofeedback is the future and the future is now - for everyone. No additional body sensors are needed anymore! Just take your iPhone and start VaYou.\n\nVaYou Breath is innovative sound biofeedback. The app connects you directly with yourself by transforming your abdominal breathing into dynamically generated sounds. \n\nIt is very simple! You breathe relaxed and VaYou generates sounds from it - directly shaped by your breathing. With the help of real-time biofeedback, your breath, mind and heart increasingly flow as one.\n\nVaYou Breath integrates with Apple Health by updating your values for resting heart rate, respiratory rate, and mindful minutes.\n\nKey VaYou benefits\n\n• Biometric Integration - VaYou provides advanced real-time breath and pulse detection without the need for additional wearables or expensive medical sensors.\n• We have gone to the technical limits. VaYou converts the iOS motion/acceleration sensor data stream into high quality biosignals for breath and pulse (pulse only in lying position).\n• In order to support the relaxation process, the VaYou algorithms learn from your biosignals and derived parameters how to best design the sounds so that they are most effective for you at that moment.\n• No online connection needed while using - activate airplane mode for an undisturbed and healthy experience!\n\nNo other app or desktop software provides biofeedback like VaYou Breath.\n\nJust listening to the breath-generated sounds leads you into a very personal flow experience. Your consciousness is more and more \"absorbed\" by the process, your thoughts come to rest. The mental state can be described as relaxed and calming breath mindfulness. It is almost automatic to \"stay with the breath\", easily and effortless.  \n\nUnlike with apps where you have to understand and follow spoken instructions, with VaYou Breath you can \"switch off\" right from the start. The resulting flow experience brings body and mind into harmony and this has a regenerating effect.\n\nThe regular use of VaYou Breath can have a generally positive effect on body and mind. Some of the reported effects are\n• Calming the flow of thoughts\n• Reduction of stress levels\n• Self regulation of the heart and breathing activity\n• Increase of creativity\n• Improvement of mood\n• Improvement of sleep.\n\nIT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT:\n\nPut on good headphones and choose one of the perfected Sound~Flows. Then select the duration, press START and place the iPhone on your lower abdomen, just below the navel. (It's usually better to loosen a belt if you wear one and slide the iPhone halfway into the belt line of your trousers or skirt.) Keep breathing and listening! \n\nLIVE 1 and LIVE 2 is the app's main biofeedback mode. To be even more flexible, there is also a PACING mode, in which an adjustable breathing rhythm is played, which you simply breathe along. Without the need to look at the screen.\n\nIt is actually very easy to get into your personal \"Flow~Breathing\" and to experience and enjoy the balancing positive effect. \n\nWHAT YOU GET:\n\n▪ The VaYou biofeedback algorithm that turns your breathing movements into amazing Sound~Flows\n▪ The \"Flow Journey\" Sound~Flow, which guides you through a universe of different breath~sound experiences up to 30 minutes duration\n▪ The \"Four Fully\" Sound~Flow for very effective and recreational short breaks\n▪ All other Sound~Flows can be downloaded as in-app purchases within the app. And of course you get them for your LIFETIME, even if you change or loose your device. \n\nPRICES:\n\n• No subscription, no automatic renewal\n• No hidden costs or unnecessarily large packages\n• You only pay what you really like and want.\n\nWishes, questions and feedback are always welcome: welcome@vayou.app\nor at https://vayou.app/usergroup\n\nVaYou is Time for You.\nNOW is Time for You!"

Die PME ist eine - wissenschaftlich erwiesen - sehr wirksame Entspannungsmethode; sie wird von Ärzten bei zahlreichen meist stressbedingten Symptomen empfohlen wie z.B.:\n\n• Verspannungen\n• Migräne oder Kopfschmerzen\n• innere Unruhe\n• Schlafstörungen\n• Rücken-/Schmerzen\n• Erregungszustände, Prüfungsangst\n• Angst- und Panikattacken\n• Bluthochdruck\n• psychosomatischen Beschwerden\n\nMit regelmäßiger Übung wird es immer besser gelingen, in noch tiefere Entspannungszustände zu geraten. Sobald man genügend Übung und Erfahrung mit der ausführlichen Form der Progressiven Muskelentspannung (GRUNDFORM: 17 Muskelgruppen / ANFÄNGER-Status) hat, kann auch zu den kürzeren Varianten (Kurzformen) mit 7 und 4 Muskelgruppen übergegangen werden und schließlich wird es leicht fallen, sich bzw. auch einzelne Körperpartien mit dem Body Scan rein mental zu entspannen. Es sollte zu Beginn bei allen Formen der Übungsstatus ANFÄNGER gewählt werden.\n\nIn dieser App werden alle 4 Formen der PME (Grund- und 2 Kurzformen sowie die Mentale Form) angeleitet und geübt.\n\nGRUNDFORM: 17 MUSKELGRUPPEN\n1. Rechte Hand und Unterarm\n2. Rechter Oberarm\n3. Linke Hand und Unterarm\n4. Linker Oberarm \n5. Stirn\n6. Obere Wangenpartie und Nase\n7. Untere Wangenpartie und Kiefer\n8. Nacken \n9. Brust, Schultern und obere Rückenpartie\n10. Bauchmuskulatur\n11. Gesäß- und Beckenboden\n12. Rechter Oberschenkel\n13. Rechter Unterschenkel \n14. Rechter Fuß\n15, 16, 17 (-> linke Seite)\n\nKURZFORM I: 7 MUSKELGRUPPEN\n1. Rechte Hand, Unterarm und Oberarm\n2. Linke Hand, Unterarm und Oberarm\n3. Stirn, Wangenpartie, Nase und Kiefer\n4. Nacken \n5. Brust, Schultern, Rücken, Bauch-, Gesäß und Beckenboden\n6. Rechter Oberschenkel, Unterschenkel und Fuß\n7. Linker Oberschenkel, Unterschenkel und Fuß\n\nKURZFORM II: 4 MUSKELGRUPPEN\n1. Beide Hände, Unterarme und Oberarme\n2. Gesichts- und Nackenmuskulatur\n3. Brust, Schultern, Rücken, Bauch-, Gesäß- und Beckenboden\n4. Beide Oberschenkel, Unterschenkel und Füße\n\nMENTALE FORM: BODY-SCAN\nGeführte Entspannung durch den ganzen Körper bis zu den Füßen, diesmal beginnend mit Gesichts, Unterkiefer und Nacken. Diese Anleitung ist die letzte Stufe der PME, bei der die Wahrnehmung auf einzelne Körperteile gelenkt wird, ohne diese anzuspannen. Die Entspannung erfolgt jetzt nur noch mental. Hilfreiche Vorstellungen (Sonne, Strand, Meer) können dabei unterstützen (wählbar).\n\nÜBUNGS-STATUS\nFür alle Formen der PME kann zudem der Übungsdauer-Status \n- ANFÄNGER\n- FORTGESCHRITTEN\n- ERFAHREN\ngewählt werden. Damit stehen insgesamt 12 vollständige Versionen der PME zu Verfügung.\n\nLIEGEND / SITZEND\nAlle Formen werden wahlweise jeweils im Sitzen oder Liegen angeleitet.\n\nMUSIK & NATUR-SOUNDS\nEs kann aus 5 Entspannungsmusiken und 18 Natur-Sounds gewählt werden, die sich jeweils untereinander und an die Lautstärke der Stimme anpassen lassen. Falls gewünscht können Musik/Sounds auch alleine (ohne Stimme) zur Entspannung bzw. zum Einschlafen genutzt werden. Es können auch 2 Natur-Sounds gleichzeitig kombiniert werden.\n\nEINSCHLAFEN - RÜCKNAHME - OHNE OUTRO\nAlle Übungen können wahlweise zum Einschlafen, zur Entspannung mit Rücknahme und ohne Outro verwendet werden. \n\nDAUER DER ANSPANNUNG\nDie Dauer der Anspannung der Muskelgruppen kann ausgewählt werden. Überwiegend wird eine Anspannung von 5 Sek. empfohlen.\n\nPAUSEN ZUM ENTSPANNEN\nDie Dauer der Pausen zwischen den Muskelgruppen kann nach eigenen Vorlieben und Übungsstand angepasst werden. Überwiegend wird eine Dauer von 20 Sek. empfohlen.\n\nTIMER\nAuf alle Übungen kann eine beliebig lange Zeit für die Entspannungsmusik & Natur-Sounds eingestellt werden, die die Entspannung vertiefen.\n\nHINWEISE\nDie App kann / sollte sogar im Flugmodus (offline) genutzt werden.\nDie App enthält keine Werbung, Abos, In-App-Käufe."

      "label": "Did you know that your heart beats faster during inhalation and slower during exhalation AND did you know that this is good for you?\n\nThe technical term is RSA (respiratory sinus arrhythmia) - a good arrhythmia controlled by your autonomic nervous system. \n\nHigh variability of the heart rate stands for a good autonomic balance and activity of the parasympathetic nervous system (rest and relaxation nerve).\n\nHeartBreath is a biofeedback tool, that addresses exactly this relationship between breathing and heart rate.\n\nThe app guides you through a simple slow-breathing exercise (with pictures and sounds), while detecting and displaying the intervals between your heartbeats. You can measure, train and evaluate your personal status. No additional hardware devices are needed. HeartBreath is able to detect heartbeats by positioning your finger on the lens of the phone’s camera.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\nIntegrated VaYou Sound Flows, which provide an exceptional sound experience on acoustic pacing.\n\nHigh quality and customizable control of the bio-feedback exercise with pictures (you can work with pictures from your photo library) and sounds. \n\nLive display of the current heart rate and variability values while recording.\n\nIn just a few breaths, HeartBreath is able to compute your resting heart rate.\n\nNo additional hardware is needed. The calculation works with a finger on the lens of the iPhone’s (or iPod’s) camera (for iPad only device models with flash). Optionally, an external heart rate monitor can be used. For compatible devices (Polar H10) display/recording/evaluation of true ECG data is supported. As a special extra, the app allows the comparison of data between the finger on the camera and the heart rate monitor.\n\nUnlike many other HRV apps, HeartBreath offers a precise visualization for every single heartbeat and, if necessary, tools for interactive correction of the beats. This is very important for the high reliability of HRV parameters, since single ectopic heartbeats or data artifacts can result in strange adulteration of HRV values.\n\nIntegrated tools to determine your optimal breathing speed. Various studies show that each person has an individual optimal RSA breathing rate in the range between 4 and 7 breaths per minute.\n\nTrend evaluations over longer periods of time.\n\nHeartBreath integrates with the Apple Health app.\n\nPrivacy is important to us! The app does not require registration and you have full control over the data of your sessions, which is only stored on your phone."

      "label": "PULSALARM warns you via vibration or warning tone when you exceed your set upper and lower pulse limit and thus supports you in your pulse-based training. You can train as usual with your favorite fitness or running app. All you need to do is install PULSALARM on your Apple Watch.\n\nFeatures of the Apple Watch App:\n- Vibration and/or warning tone when the set pulse limits are reached\n- Vibration and/or signal tone when returning to the set pulse range\n- Pulse limits can be deactivated individually\n- Large, easy to read display of the current pulse\n- Fast adjustment of pulse limits (also possible while running)\n- Works together with all known fitness, training and running apps that can be started on the Apple Watch\n- Does not write data to Apple Health\n- You can use the app on your Apple Watch without having your iPhone with you\n\nFeatures of the iPhone App:\n- Calculation of your maximum heart rate\n- Individual calculation of the 5 intensity ranges (depending on your maximum heart rate) \n- Adoption of the pulse limits from the training zones\n- Setting the maximum and minimum pulse limit \n- Large display of the current pulse\n\nImportant note: without the use with an Apple Watch, the functional range of the app is limited, as no permanent pulse measurement can be carried out.\n\nNo advertising, no tracking, no third-party codes. Developed with passion and programmed in Germany.\n\nWhy use PULSALARM additionally? \nMany running apps include the pace as a target in their training plans. However, the same speed can mean a high intensity for one person and a low intensity for another. It is therefore helpful to consider your heart rate instead of speed to determine and maintain the right training intensity. \nPULSALARM helps you to do this. It turns your Apple Watch into a heart rate monitor. \n\nWhat is the big advantage?\nYou no longer have to look at your Apple Watch during your workout and still know whether you are exercising within your personal heart rate zone. Also ideal in colder months, when your Apple Watch is hidden under a jacket or long-sleeved shirt and you can't look directly at the display while running.\n\nFor whom is PULSALARM suitable?\n- Ideal for run beginners, as they can control themselves better and protect themselves from overstraining.\n- Ideal for ambitious runners, as they can train more specifically in their intensity ranges and thus increase endurance and performance.\n- For all athletes and fitness enthusiasts who are interested in heart rate monitoring during their training with their Apple Watch.\n\nSummary:\nWith the PULSALARM app on the iPhone you can determine your 5 intensity ranges based on your maximum heart rate. You can enter your maximum heart rate directly or have it calculated. Set your personal maximum heart rate limit, which you do not want to exceed during training, and your minimum heart rate limit. When these limits are reached, your Apple Watch will alert you by vibrating and/or beeping."

      "label": "\"Es gibt für den Menschen keine geräuschlosere und ungestörtere Zufluchtsstätte als seine eigene Seele. Halte recht oft solche stille Einkehr und erneuere so dich selbst.\" (Marc Aurel)\n\nDas Autogene Training (AT) wurde von J.H. Schultz in den 20er Jahren des letzten Jahrhunderts entwickelt und zählt zu den etablierten und wissenschaftlich fundierten Entspannungsmethoden. Das AT basiert auf dem Prinzip der Autosuggestion (Selbsthypnose).\n\nWirkungen und Anwendungsbereiche: Die positiven Wirkungen des Autogenen Trainings wurden in zahlreichen wissenschaftlichen Studien belegt. Anwendungsbereiche für das AT sind unter vielen anderen: Ängste, Schlafstörungen, Schmerzen, Stress, Burn-out, Versagensängste, Prüfungsangst, Süchte, Durchblutungsstörungen, Herzrhythmusstörungen, Bluthochdruck, Wechseljahrsbeschwerden, Rheuma, Hormonelle Störungen, ... Gegenanzeigen: keine. Denjenigen, die unter ausgeprägten Psychosen leiden, ist jedoch vorab eine ärztliche Rücksprache anzuraten.\n\nAufbau und Phasen des  Autogenen Trainings:\nIn dieser App werden alle Phasen (Übungen) des AT sowie das Komplett-Programm angeleitet und geübt. Die Herz-Übung wurde bewusst ausgelassen. Dies wird auch zunehmend von Therapeuten und Wissenschaftlern empfohlen, da viele Übende hiermit Schwierigkeiten bei der Entspannung haben. Das AT besteht aus 5 Phasen:\n\nPhase 1: Die Schwere-Übung\nPhase 2: Die Wärme-Übung\nPhase 3: Die Atem-Übung\nPhase 4: Die Bauch-Übung (Sonnengeflecht)\nPhase 5: Die Stirn-Übung\n\nZum Einschlafen oder mit Rücknahme:\nAlle Phasen sowie das Komplett-Programm können zum Einschlafen verwendet werden oder auch mit Rücknahme geübt werden. Bei der Phase 5 (Stirn-Übung) ist \"mit Rücknahme\" voreingestellt, da die Stirn-Übung eine belebende Wirkung haben kann daher beim Einschlafen hinderlich sein könnte.\n\nAnfänger und Fortgeschrittene:\nWenn du Anfänger bist, nimm dir für die ersten Tage nur die 1. Phase (Schwere-Übung) vor. Die Schwere-Übung ist die zentrale Übung beim AT, da sie Grundvoraussetzung für die Entspannung und damit auch für alle folgenden Phasen des AT ist; daher wird diese Phase am Anfang auch länger und intensiver angeleitet und geübt. Sobald du die Schwere fühlst, gehst du zur 2. Phase über und so weiter. Jede Phase beinhaltet auch die vorangegangenen Phasen – jedoch jetzt in kürzerer Form. Das bedeutet, dass z.B. die Phase 3 (Atem-Übung) auch die Schwere-Übung und die Wärme-Übung jeweils in Kurzform einschließt (Grundaufbau des AT).\n\nTimer-Funktion\nAuf alle Phasen zum Einschlafen kann eine beliebig lange Zeit (Voreinstellung: 60 min) für die Hintergrundmusik (Musik 1-5) mit/ohne Natur-Sounds eingestellt werden, so dass Musik & Natur-Sounds deine Entspannung noch weiter vertieft oder in den Schlaf begleitet.\n\nAudio-Qualität und App-Größe:\nUm die bestmögliche Audio-/Sound-Qualität anbieten zu können und alle Inhalte offline – also ohne Internet-Verbindung – auf mobilen Geräten verfügbar zu machen, ist die Größe der App unvermeidlich.\n\nHinweis\nDie App kann und sollte im Flugzeug-Modus (offline) genutzt werden."

      "label": "SETTINGS & FEATURES\n• This app includes all exercise forms of PMR.\n• select BEGINNER, ADVANCED or EXPERIENCED mode\n• select to practice lying down or sitting\n• adjust volume of voice, music & nature sounds\n• set duration for tension (3-10 sec)\n• set pause lengths for relaxation (10-40 sec)\n• with / without Intro / Outro\n• the total runtime is displayed after each selection\n• set timer to continue music / nature sounds\n• 5 music tracks & 17 nature sounds\n• combine 2 nature sounds simultaneously\n\nABOUT PMR & CONTENT OF THE APP\nEdward Jacobson's Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) - also called Deep Muscle Relaxation (DMR) - is a scientifically recognized relaxation method that helps to get into a state of deep relaxation through muscle tension and relaxation. PMR is a - scientifically proven - very effective relaxation method. It is recommended by doctors and therapists for many symptoms that are mostly stress-related, such as:\n\n• tensions\n• migraine or headache\n• inner unrest\n• sleep disorders\n• back pain / pain\n• states of excitement,\n• anxiety and panic attacks\n• high blood pressure\n• psychosomatic complaints\n• burnout \n• stress and much more\n\nWith regular practice it is getting easier and easier to get into deeper relaxation states. If you have enough practice with the long form of PMR (Basic Form: 17 Muscle Groups), you can switch to the Short Forms with 7 and 4 Muscle Groups and finally to the mental form: Body Scan. Then you can relax your body just mentally.\n\nALL COMMON 4 FORMS OF PMR\n• Basic Form (17 muscle groups)\n• Short Form I (7 muscle groups)\n• Short Form II (4 muscle groups)\n• Mental Form (Body Scan) \nfor BEGINNER, ADVANCED and EXPERIENCED are taught and practiced in this app. This provides a total of 12 complete versions of the PMR.\n\nBASIC FORM: 17 MUSCLE GROUPS\n1. Right hand and forearm\n2. Right upper arm\n3. Left hand and forearm\n4. Left upper arm\n5. Forehead\n6. Upper cheek part and nose\n7. Lower cheek part and jaw\n8. Neck\n9. Chest, shoulders and upper back\n10. Abdominal\n11. Buttocks and pelvic floor\n12. Right thigh\n13. Right lower leg\n14. Right foot\n15, 16, 17 (-> left side)\n\nSHORT FORM I: 7 MUSCLE GROUPS\n1. Right hand, forearm, and upper arm\n2. Left hand, forearm and upper arm\n3. Forehead, cheek part, nose and jaw\n4. Neck\n5. Chest, shoulders, back, abdominal, buttocks and pelvic floor\n6. Right thigh, lower leg and foot\n7. Left thigh, lower leg, and foot\n\nSHORT FORM II: 4 MUSCLE GROUPS\n1. Both hands, forearms and upper arms\n2. Face and neck\n3. Chest, shoulders, back, abdominal, buttocks and pelvic floor\n4. Both thighs, lower legs and feet\n\nMENTAL FORM: BODY SCAN\nGuided relaxation through the whole body, starting from the face to the feet. This guide is the last stage of the PMR, in which the perception is directed to individual parts of the body without tensing them. The relaxation is now only mental. Soothing imaginations will help you.\n\nMUSIC & NATURE SOUNDS\nYou can choose between 5 relaxing music tracks and 17 nature sounds. The volume levels can be adjusted individually. If desired, music and sounds can also be used alone (without voice) to relax or fall asleep.\n\nOUTRO: FOR SLEEPING / WITH RETURN \nAt the end of the exercises, there is an Outro for falling asleep or with return, which can also be omitted.\n\nDURATION OF TENSION & PAUSES FOR RELAXATION\nSelect your preferred duration for tension and relaxation between the muscle groups.\n\nTIMER FUNCTION\nAfter the end of the exercise an unlimited time for the music and nature sounds can be set so to deepen your relaxation.\n\nNOTE\nThis app can and should be used offline (flight mode)."

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

You can choose to jump rope anytime, anywhere.\n\nCurrently, Apple Watch allows you to track multiple workouts including  running or cycling, and swimming, but not jump rope.\n\nOften, counting your jumps during your jump rope workout is essential and is an important aspect. YaoYao utilizes Apple Watch’s motion sensors to calculate your jumps. YaoYao literally costs you no more than an ordinary jump rope.\n\n- 2022/02/20 New AirPods Mode：Count with AirPods motion sensor, no Apple Watch required（Support AirPods 3/Pro/Max/Beats Fit Pro）\n\nFeatures :\n\n- Jumps counting (includes support for double unders)\nFor every 100 jumps, the app encourages you with voice feedback of your current progress - so that you can focus on your posture and avoid glancing at the Watch to check your jump counts.\n\n- Live Count\nLive counts of your jumps are displayed along with the voice feedback.\n\n- Exercise time record\n\n- Jump speed (Speed) record/Scrolling Speed (Speed of jumps over the past minute)\n\n- Record the number of consecutive jumps\nAlong with the jump speed, the app also counts the number of jumps in one go.\n\n- Heart rate record\nMax heart rate warning tip.\n\n- Calorie burn value\n\n- HIIT mode\nTime or Jumps Interval\n\n- iPhone real time display (Live Count):\nOpen the iPhone app during exercise and display the jump data on the iPhone\n\n- Syncs with iOS Health app.\n\nYaoYao syncs and stores health data to the iOS Health app from Apple.

I love this app so glad I found it \nnauf4l: was planning to buy a 100$ jump rope which counts skips as i always do 5k skips a day. So after a month was considering this when i came across this app after installing 5 apps of the same.Glad i paid about 2$ for this as it is totally worth it. \nFrankWurst: Accurate jump counter based solely on Apple Watch. App integrates into My Health and Activity App seamlessly. Great product.\ntafty：I enjoy the skipping experience with this app. And it syncs well with Apple Watch\n\nContact me\nE-mail:89208242@qq.com\nTwitter: @haozes\nTelegram Group: t.me/yaoyaonow  \n\nDesign by Haozes\nThanks for the translation: 橙子、金小粉、孟金羽、蔡沛森、Adgar, Fabio Carrilho, Tomás Feliú Ribeiro, Francesco Tirsi, Leonard Pitt Diehl, Zhimin Yang, Massimiliano Benini,Radu Ionescu,Andrés Leon,Dikran Jessaijan, Krishna"

Mit welchem Gesundheitsrisiko muss ich rechnen? Gut, wenn wir mit dem iPhone in Supermarkt oder Restaurant gleich nachsehen können.\nGenau zu diesem Zweck hat ihanwel in Zusammenarbeit mit dem renommierten Autor Dr. Hans-Ulrich Grimm die App Dr.Watson entwickelt.\n\nALLES ÜBER LEBENSMITTELZUSATZSTOFFE - AUF IHREM IPHONE\nDr.Watson enthält eine Datenbank mit allen zugelassenen Lebensmittelzusatzstoffen, mit umfangreichen Informationen zu \"Risiken\", \"Trifft es mich?\", \"Was ist es überhaupt?\". Die Texte sind handlich und verständlich geschrieben. Zudem lassen sich alle Zusatzstoffe ausfiltern, die zu bestimmten Krankheitsbildern gehören. Die Daten stehen offline zur Verfügung, es muss also keine Internetverbindung vorhanden sein um Dr.Watson zu nutzen.\n\nGEWICHT UND GESUNDHEITSRISIKEN REDUZIEREN\nChemie im Essen kann Ihre Gesundheit gefährden: Farbstoffe, Aromen, Geschmacksverstärker werden immer häufiger zum Auslöser von Allergien, führen bei Kindern zu Verhaltensstörungen und Lernschwächen, ja werden sogar mitunter zur Gefahr fürs Gehirn. Alzheimer und Parkinson können die Folge sein. Und: Sie können auch dick machen. Dr.Watson hilft Ihnen diese Zusatzstoffe zu erkennen.\n\nJEDERZEIT UND AN JEDEM ORT VERFÜGBAR\nDie Dr.Watson zugrunde liegenden Daten werden mit der Installation der App offline auf Ihrem iPhone / iPod Touch installiert (auf schlanken 3 MB Speicherplatz), so dass Sie die Informationen jederzeit und überall auch ohne Onlineverbindung verfügbar haben.\n\nDATENBASIS VON BESTSELLERAUTOR DR. HANS-ULRICH GRIMM\nDie Dr.Watson zugrunde liegende DR.-WATSON-Datenbank der Lebensmittel-Zusatzstoffe beruht auf jahrelangen Recherchen, eigenen Untersuchungen und der Auswertung von mehreren tausend wissenschaftlichen Studien durch Dr. Hans-Ulrich Grimm (Autor des Klassikers \"Die Suppe lügt\"), Bernhard Ubbenhorst und der Ernährungswissenschaftlerin Maike Ehrlichmann. Wissenschaftliche Beratung: Professor Stephan C. Bischoff, Universität Stuttgart Hohenheim, Dr. Hermann Kruse, Universität Kiel, und Professor Brunello Wüthrich, Universität Zürich.\n\nihanwel ist Initiator und Gründungsmitglied von vieda, dem Verband der iPhone Entwickler deutschsprachiger Apps. Die Mitgliedschaft bei vieda garantiert hochwertige, professionelle Apps und einen professionellen Support bei aufkommenden Fragen oder Problemen."

      "label": "‘tinnitus help’ - eight programs in one. \nThe ultimate application for tinnitus sufferers.\nOnly naturally produced sounds of musical instruments and sounds of Mother Nature - no synthesizers!\nDeveloped by an expert software engineer in the field of frequency analysis and a leading music psychologist, music therapist and hearing therapist with more than 20 years’ experience in the treatment of tinnitus sufferers. \nUsed very successfully in the treatment of tinnitus.\n\n‘tinnitus help’ contains a broad range of functions but operating it is child’s play:\n1. Accurate analysis of your tinnitus\n2. Tinnitus masker and noiser\n3. Reprogramming your auditory cortex\n4. Stimulating your central auditory perception\nHelping you to\n5. defocus\n6. habituate\n7. relax\n8. fall asleep\n\nThis is how it works:\n‘tinnitus help’ utilizes the fact that the same brain activities that enable us to perceive auditory stimuli, i.e. real sounds, also cause the perception of the tinnitus sound. Thus ‘tinnitus help’ is able to intervene in central auditory processes. ‘tinnitus help’ forms an image of your individual tinnitus frequency (up to 20.000 Hz) and offers you the option to mix this frequency with pleasant sounds or music. This means that ‘tinnitus help’ can assist you to change the way you perceive your tinnitus sound by letting it gradually fade into the background. Regular listening to your individual ‘tinnitus help’ setting will enable you to learn how to increasingly fade out the sound in your ear and eventually ignore it. Experts call this “habituation”.\n\nStep one:\nEstablish your individual tinnitus frequency by using the slide switch. It does not matter if it is the left or the right ear that is affected or both. Are you suffering from tinnitus sounds that rise and fall? Or cricket like sounds? Or red noise? You can mix all additional sounds to your tinnitus frequency, thereby optimizing your tinnitus profile.\n\nStep two:\nChoose a pleasing sound and add it to your tinnitus profile. Using this combination, you will feel your tinnitus gradually fading into the background. What you are experiencing is the effect of defocusing. You have now created your own individual, perfect tinnitus masker, which you can call up any time anywhere. Set the time on how long you want your program to run for and use your tinnitus setting as masker to help you relax and to fall asleep.\n\nStep three:\nInfluence the activity of your auditory cortex. The area in which your tinnitus frequency is located will be especially active and, depending on how frequently and how intensely you pay attention to your tinnitus, this area will spread like an ink stain on a piece of blotting paper. However, you can restrict the growth of this area by adding one of the pieces of music on offer to your setting. The music has been especially written for tinnitus sufferers. All pieces of music are produced naturally on musical instruments; no synthesizers are used. The association “I am hearing pleasing sounds or music” will at first be stored in the hippocampus, our memory centre. If the experience is repeated by using ‘tinnitus help’, the hippocampus works like a trainer for your cerebral cortex. It will repeatedly offer the stored information to the cerebral cortex, resulting in the new input being learnt and new programs etched into the auditory cortex. Regularly recurring musical structures act like a massage on certain areas of the brain. Where tinnitus is present, this will be experienced as a negative effect. However, you can turn this to your advantage by calling up your very own personalised music in your head. Retrieve it whenever you need it, influence your perception processes and learn to set up the reprogramming of your central auditory pathway. In general the tinnitus has the same frequency as the peak in your hearing loss. So use ‘tinnitus help’  to stimulate your auditory cortex and to support your hearing."

      "label": "Anxiety Release shows you how to release anxious thoughts and feelings naturally, by harnessing the power of your brain. It does this by combining guided instructions and focused attention with bilateral brain stimulation. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a revolutionary treatment which is based on the use of sensory stimulation to alter anxiety-provoking memories and responses. Over 30 randomized controlled studies of EMDR attest to the efficacy of this process. \n\nBecause bilateral stimulation appeals to the unconscious, sensing part of the brain, there is no need for effortful thinking or struggling with feelings.  All you have to do is LISTEN and your brain will do the rest! The App consists of;\n1 x brain training session\n2 x guided anxiety management sessions\n1 x pure bilateral stimulation session (audio & visual)\n1 x safe place exercise\nProgress Log function\nPowerful Bls brain visual \nThis App is suitable for both clinicians and clients\n\nCaution: Persons suffering with complex PTSD or mental health problems, multiple psychological trauma or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without medical supervision."

      "label": "There are twelve energy pathways, or meridians, in the human body that connect to specific organs in the body. Chinese medicine believes that each organ has a two hour time period when the Qi is at its peak in that meridian. The Qi flows cyclically in a clockwise rotation like a wave through the meridians.\n\nWe always pay attention to symptoms that occur repeatedly at specific times because this may be an indication of the organ that is out of balance. For example, waking every night between 1 and 3 a.m. almost always is indicative of a Liver imbalance. The Organ Clock App will show you which organs correspond to which two hour period.\n\nThe Organ Clock iPhone App lists the periods in which the organs are at their peak Qi. It will display the details for the organ currently at its maximum, including whether it is a Zang or a Fu organ, Yin or Yang, which element the organ belongs to and a short description of the role of the organ according to the traditional chinese medicine and tips on how to behave during that period. \n\nYou can also browse all organs independent of whether they are at currently their maximum Qi  or not.\n\nDisclaimer:\nIf you think that you are suffering from an illness, please consult an qualified medical practitioner. Neither the organ clock nor the information about the specific organs can substitute for a qualified anamnesis and diagnosis.\nThe developer of this Application is neither physician nor healer but has compiled freely available information about the organ clock and has published them in this Application."

Enter Count Sheep - a simple, sleek little sheep counting app that helps anyone young or old, from toddler to senior or in between to fall asleep by using their phone to count some sheep! One by one, the sheep gracefully float over the wooden fence. It sure beats staring at the ceiling.\n\nCount Sheep was designed from the ground up to be easy on the eyes in a dark room and help you catch some z's.\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Night time-friendly graphics with smooth sheep animation\n• Soothing custom-made, seamlessly looped lullaby music\n• Adjustable sheep speed and lullaby volume\n• Your phone's silent/mute switch mutes the lullaby music\n• Won't interrupt music you're already playing\n• Sleep timer that smoothly fades to black\n• Option to disable your device's screen auto-lock\n• Seamless landscape & portrait experience\n• Optional on-screen counter\n• Resumes after interruption\n• Automatically saves your settings\n• Lightweight app size: under 3mb\n\nCount Sheep is super easy to use: start playing your own music through the Music app, select a song in Count Sheep (or turn off music all together). *Important: ensure that your device's mute switch is not on!* If your device is muted, no music will play even if you have a song selected. Then, set your sleep timer (15 minutes by default) and tap \"Start\" to get counting. When the sleep timer is up and you're sound asleep, Count Sheep will fades to a black screen, restoring your auto-lock settings and saving precious battery life.\n\nI welcome any and all feedback. If you have any comments, questions, suggestions, or complaints, please free to drop me a line.\n\nThank you and goodnight!\n\nNote: Count Sheep is intended to be used for entertainment purposes only. If you think you may be suffering from a sleep-related illness, you should consult a medical professional."

If you're someone that's training for rounds, doing circuit work, etc. this app is worth your 99 cents. With the level of customization you get, the app is competitive with the way more expensive round timer devices that can cost upwards of $10-100.\"\n- by Shawn Lord, www.mastersdivision.com\n\n\"I found a GREAT interval timer app in the iTunes store for 99 cents!!! It's called Round Timer and it works like a dream!!!\"\n- by Miss Lee, forums on thecathenation.com\n\n\"Its a really useful applications. Beats carrying around that big round timer from the old days.\"\n- by Michael Manna, T4Show.com\n\n-----------------------------------\n- Description -\n\nThe Round Timer was the first round/sparring/boxing timer available in the AppStore and, as a result, the most refined and stable. Don't be fooled by knock-offs (other developers copying our interface and layout). \n\nThe Round Timer is a convenient round/boxing/sparring timer for your iPhone/iPod touch, now compatible with iOS 8.  The Round Timer is a fully functional round/sparring timer that allows you to customize the length of the rounds, warning bell and resting period.  Each of these intervals can be configured separately up to an hour. It will run in the background even if you switch to another App. \n\nWith the sound themes, you can choose which alarm sounds to use: boxing/MMA, a relaxing Zen theme, and a few others. Don't like any of the dozens of preinstalled sounds? Don't worry! You can record your own sounds.\n\nFor large, loud environments you can plug your device into a stereo, or for small sessions put it in the corner of the mat.  The Round Timer is great for any sparring or interval training: boxing, MMA, grappling / bjj, martial arts, yoga, meditation, crossfit, exercise, workout, stretching, etc.\n\nWorking out to music is not a problem. Start your music playing in the iPod app, then start RoundTimer. The sounds will play over top of your music without interrupting it.\n\nPlease feel free to e-mail support@plainandsimplesoftware.com to suggest new sound themes!\n\nInterested in interval training (Tabata, symmetrical, etc... intervals)? Check out our \"IntervalTimer\". Want more control? Check out \"UltraTimer\". Want full programmability and randomized intervals? Look at \"UltraTrainer\"."

It is measured by the variation in the beat-to-beat interval. \r\nThis HRV app provides a way to analyze the HRV SDNN values recorded by the Apple Watch.\r\n\r\nHeart rate variability describes the ability of an organism to change the frequency of the heart rhythm. A healthy person constantly adapts the heart rhythm to the current requirements. The number of heart beats per minute is therefore constantly changing, which is a good sign of the organism's ability to adapt.\r\n\r\nResearchers at the University of Zaragoza in Spain have shown that the values recorded by the Apple Watch during a session with the Breath app are very accurate. Comparable with professional chest straps.\r\n\r\nTo filter your own HRV data, this app offers the possibility to display only those HRV values that are recorded during such a session.\r\n\r\nThe Apple Watch is measuring your HRV Data and writes it to Healthkit.\r\nThis app connects with Apple’s Health app to displays the recorded data on a Watch App, a complication and your Iphone. \r\n\r\nHow to Use:\r\n-\tATTENTION: This app only works if you have an Apple Watch Series 3 or later.\r\n-\tIf you want to measure a new value, use the Breath App from Apple.\r\n-\tTo get to most out of your data it is important that you measurement does always take place in the very same situation.

      "label": "DBT Diary Card is the only DBT iPhone app designed and created by a licensed and DBT intensively trained psychologist.\n\nHighlights of version 3.0:\n\n+ graphing data across time\n+ on device PDF viewing\n+ daily reminders\n+ Password locking to prevent others from seeing your diary cards.\n\nRead what our actual users say:\n\n\"***** Best DBT app available!!!\nSimply put, this is the most helpful DBT or CBT app available. I bought a new iPhone to be able to use it. DBT skills are priceless. I had tried every, other DBT and CBT app. This one follows the traditional DBT program exactly, and is the only Diary Card. Before I had this app, I'd seldom fill in my diary card. Now that I have it, I don't have to keep track of paper, and I rarely miss a day. I can fill in my Diary Card discreetly, from anywhere, anytime, and send it directly to my DBT coach. I no longer have to worry about someone coming across my Diary Cards. You can brush up on skills, use it for distress tolerance suggestions, tailor it to your needs, and even journal. I appreciate that I can add personal goals to my diary. Thank you for this app!\" - iTunes US Review\n\n\"***** I am in IRL-DBT and this app is the perfect complement. Oh. I love that the app is so flexible, that you can make it kind of your own, and the layout is so nice, simple, yet beautiful. For me, a true life-saver! Genius! Without a doubt the best app in my IPhone... Get it now!\" - iTunes Sweden Review\n\n\"***** Perfect! Worth the money!\" - iTunes US Review\n\nAs an educated consumer, it's important to know to whom you're listening. DBT Diary Card was created by a Ph.D. psychologist trained directly by Dr. Marsha Linehan and at the Duke University Medical Center; we are experts in DBT, providing consultation to many in our community. And now we're giving it to you!\n\nA DBT app can have 3 parts: \n\n- A reference manual\n- A behavior tracker\n- A skills coach\n\nDBT Diary Card has all 3 of these parts and utilizes the iOS platform in ways that the other apps available don't and can't.\n\n+ PDF generation\n+ Notification Pane support\n+ Password protection\n+ Advanced text editing\n+ Media playback\n\nWhat DBT Diary Card has to offer:\n\n- Skills. LOTS of them. Every DBT skill you've ever heard about in a group is in here. It can be your quick reference to your skills so that you don't have to carry around your book or binder. Every skill is described in readable language to help you understand them easily and it's all just a quick tap away.\n\n- Emotions. All the \"basic\" emotions are presented, again with descriptions and explanations a quick tap away.\n\n- Behaviors. The most troublesome are pre-loaded.\n\n- Coaching. If you know you need to use a skill but can't think of which one or can't remember how to choose, use the app. The coaching can be your virtual therapist. \n\n- Complete customizability. Are you working on something different or do you have a different understanding of a particular skill or emotion? Change it. It's that easy. You are not wedded to the way it's presented in the app. It's all completely customizable.\n\n- 911 skills.  Put your emergency skills a tap away. You can call directly from the app, listen to your distress tolerance music, remember what apps help in the moment. \n\n- Email. You can email your therapist your diary card on a weekly basis automatically, you can do it manually whenever you'd like or you can have the app remind you.\n\n* Telephony features require an iPhone and voice service."

      "label": "Cardiogram is a modern minimalistic, reliable app that will help accurately monitor and record your heart rate in real-time to help keep track of your health and performance. Just power on your sensor and start the app - it’s that easy!\n\nCardiogram is one of the few apps that do not require you to create an account, all information is stored locally and thereby protected from any data leaks or privacy scandals. No personal data is sent to any servers, all the information is stored directly on your iPhone and Apple Health app only.\nThe app is integrated with Apple HealthKit to sync and record heart-rate data.\n\nNotable features:\n• full control over your data\n• synchronise with Apple Health\n• record your workouts (walking, running, cycling)\n• no location services are used or required\n• very low energy consumption\n• no account is required\n\nYou can monitor and record your cardiac rhythm in a range of situations:\n• During the day to detect heart rate anomalies;\n• During sleep;\n• During your preferred fitness workouts or cardio exercises;\n• As a way of measuring stress or anxiety levels by measuring resting heart rate;\n\nCardiogram is compatible with a range of modern heart rate monitors with Bluetooth 4.0 (Smart or LE) available on the market.\nThe app has been tested using multiple heart sensors, including Polar sensors (Polar OH1, H10, and H7) with excellent and consistent performance results.\nWe recommend using Cardiogram app paired with:\nGarmin HRM-Dual or Garmin HRM-Pro\nPolar OH1, H10, and H7\nXiaomi Mi Band 3\nXiaomi Mi Band 4\nCardiosport TP3\nR1 Blue Sigma Sport\nWahoo TICKR\nCooSpo heart rate monitors\n\nThe app relies on a medical algorithm to automatically calculate heart rate limits and will display a warning signal when the maximum heart rate limit is reached.\nEvery session is recorded and can be viewed later in simple and easy to understand graph charts.\nTo reduce history view cluttering the app save only the sessions longer than 2 minutes. So, if you want to check your heart rate for a few seconds, you can do that, but will not be recorded in the history database.\nColour coded visual information during the workouts:\n– Light green: Fitness Zone (50 to 60% of maximum heart rate). Workouts in this zone target the cardiovascular system, making them a particularly good choice for fitness newbies.\n– Green: Fat-Burning and Aerobic Zone (60 to 80% of maximum heart rate). If you’re in the aerobic training zone, you’ll feel like you’re working hard but could still dig a little deeper. The body fuels the workout by burning carbohydrates and fats. The cardiovascular system, the lungs, and metabolism all benefit equally.\n– Yellow: Anaerobic zone (80 to 90% of maximum heart rate). Workouts in the anaerobic zone are particularly good for building muscles (for weightlifters) and boosting performance (for endurance athletes). Interval training involves spending short periods in the anaerobic zone.\n– Red: close to maximum heart rate for the user age (over 90% from the maximum hr). A heart rate in this zone can be very dangerous! Experienced competitive athletes do short intervals of training at this energy-sapping intensity under professional supervision to refine their performance shortly before a big event.\n\nDISCLAIMER!\nIT IS NOT THE INTENT OF THE APPLICATION TO PROVIDE MEDICAL DIAGNOSES OR TREATMENTS OF ANY KIND.\nPLEASE DO NOT TAKE ANY MEDICAL DECISIONS BASED ON THE APP RECORDS BEFORE SEEKING A MEDICAL DOCTOR ADVICE."

Das geht mit dieser App sehr einfach und bequem. Es kann in der App eine Webseite aufgerufen werden, von welcher die analytischen Bestandteile per Copy in ein Feld in der App geschrieben werden. Von diesem Feld aus werden die einzelnen Bestandteile auf die Felder verteilt und berechnet.\n\nDamit es einfacher und schneller geht kann auch die Ean im Supermarkt gescannt werden. Im Supermarkt oder beim Onlineshopping könnt ihr dann relativ schnell entscheiden, ob das Futter für euren Stubentiger geeignet ist. Je niedriger der Wert, umso besser passt das Futter. Nicht nur Katzen oder Hunde mit Diabetes, sondern auch gesunde Katzen sollten nicht zu viele Kohlehydrate zu sich nehmen.\n\nSortieren könnt ihr nach Marken, NFE oder eurem persönlichen Favoriten."

      "label": "Logging your mood, sleep quality, health symptoms can be a PAIN, even with Excel spreadsheets. \n\nCorrelate is a nifty health app that combines the simplicity of todo-lists and the power of data analysis to give you the health app you have always wanted.\n\n// DISCOVER WHAT IS ACTUALLY WORKING FOR YOU\n\nHow do you know if your medication, product, or habit is making you feel better?\n\nWhether they are supplements you are consuming, habits you are doing or routines that you are enforcing, this tracker helps you find out what actually works for you…and what isn't. You can now stop wasting money, time, and energy on medication, products, or habit that doesn't help you feel better.\n\nIt is a powerful app if you are dealing with:\n\n• General symptoms: fatigue, stress, bad mood, high blood pressure, pain\n\n• Sleep: snoring, low quality sleep, not enough sleep\n\n• Gut Health: bloating, indigestion, acid reflux\n\n• Allergies or intolerances: food intolerances, dust allergy, hay fever\n\n• Mood disorders: stress, anxiety, migraine, headache\n\n\n// FEATURES\n\n1. Todo-list style\nSimple and easy. Did something? Give it a check. If you didn't? Leave it blank. Think about how easy it is to log your item. No-fuss at all.\n\n2. Pretty Bar Graphs - \nWhat's the point of all the numbers when you can't visualize them. We got you covered. We show you how the remedies influence you positively or negatively through an intuitive visualization.\n\n3. Compare up to 3 Remedies/Items - \nSee which supplement, habit or routine helps you the most and which ones aren't. Put up to 3 of them side-by-side and you can easily visualize their effectiveness at a glance.\n\nEdit/Backfill Entries Feel free to create entries for previous days or edit previous entries up to 28 days past.\n\n4. Export your data - \nYour data belongs to you. Export your data as a CSV file when you want to do intense data crunching or just to save it somewhere else.\n\n5. Integration - \nHave an Oura Ring or Fitbit? Connect them to the app to pull your sleep data for analysis.\n\n6. Reminder - \nFor busy people.\n\n\n// HOW TO USE\n\nThink of things you suspect are causing problems or things that might help you become healthier or better (e.g. supplements, medications, activities...).\n\nExamples of self-experiments you can try:\n\n1. Does restricting coffee intake help me sleep better?\n\n2. Does this mood supplement actually help me with my mood disorder/mental health?\n\n3. Does taking my pre-workout help me perform better in the gym?\n\n4. What food is causing me to have bloating/indigestion?\n\n\n\n// MORE ON SLEEP\n\nSleep is underrated. Many of us are not prioritizing sleep enough. This app gives you the power to optimize your sleep. Use the sleep data from the sleep tracker of your choice and experiment with different bedtime routines. Make changes and log them to see what is helping you and what isn't. Connect your Oura Ring if you have one.\n\nWho knows? You might find that using a cheap and simple eye mask can drastically improve the quality of your sleep? This health journal is going to help you find out what truly works for you.\n\n\n// DISCLAIMER: \n\nCorrelate, a health & life journal, is just one of the many medical apps in the store. It is not a substitute for your doctor visits, and it does not provide a professional diagnosis for your symptoms. However, it can help you and your doctor track your health and better understand your symptoms based on correlation."

      "label": "AutoWake is the first haptic smart alarm for your Watch. \n\nIt can wake you up by tapping you on your wrist using your Watch's haptic engine. You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

      "label": "If you love working out with Apple Watch, but you need more advanced fitness stats, HealthFit is for you.\n\nBy analyzing the workout data stored in Apple Health, HealthFit provides the kind of indispensable tracking and insights you normally only get from premium subscription services. But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times. You can even log which bike or shoes you use, to monitor usage and flag when it’s time to replace them.\n\nHealthFit finds photos you take during your workouts automatically, bringing your activity feed to life with stunning images you can share on social media.\n\nRUNNING POWER ANALYSIS\n\nHealthFit provides advanced running power analysis with the automatically estimated critical power, the weighted average power, the power distribution chart by 25W Increments and the mean maximal power chart which shows your best average power for time periods of one second up to the length of your run.\n\nMULTISPORT AND INTERVAL WORKOUTS\n\nHealthFit is the only app to export multisport workouts as multisession activities\n\nSTATISTICS: UNCOVER HIDDEN FITNESS INSIGHTS\n\nApple Watch gathers so much fitness data, it can sometimes seem overwhelming. HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio.

Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

      "label": "PULSALARM warns you via vibration or warning tone when you exceed your set upper and lower pulse limit and thus supports you in your pulse-based training. You can train as usual with your favorite fitness or running app. All you need to do is install PULSALARM on your Apple Watch.\n\nFeatures of the Apple Watch App:\n- Vibration and/or warning tone when the set pulse limits are reached\n- Vibration and/or signal tone when returning to the set pulse range\n- Pulse limits can be deactivated individually\n- Large, easy to read display of the current pulse\n- Fast adjustment of pulse limits (also possible while running)\n- Works together with all known fitness, training and running apps that can be started on the Apple Watch\n- Does not write data to Apple Health\n- You can use the app on your Apple Watch without having your iPhone with you\n\nFeatures of the iPhone App:\n- Calculation of your maximum heart rate\n- Individual calculation of the 5 intensity ranges (depending on your maximum heart rate) \n- Adoption of the pulse limits from the training zones\n- Setting the maximum and minimum pulse limit \n- Large display of the current pulse\n\nImportant note: without the use with an Apple Watch, the functional range of the app is limited, as no permanent pulse measurement can be carried out.\n\nNo advertising, no tracking, no third-party codes. Developed with passion and programmed in Germany.\n\nWhy use PULSALARM additionally? \nMany running apps include the pace as a target in their training plans. However, the same speed can mean a high intensity for one person and a low intensity for another. It is therefore helpful to consider your heart rate instead of speed to determine and maintain the right training intensity. \nPULSALARM helps you to do this. It turns your Apple Watch into a heart rate monitor. \n\nWhat is the big advantage?\nYou no longer have to look at your Apple Watch during your workout and still know whether you are exercising within your personal heart rate zone. Also ideal in colder months, when your Apple Watch is hidden under a jacket or long-sleeved shirt and you can't look directly at the display while running.\n\nFor whom is PULSALARM suitable?\n- Ideal for run beginners, as they can control themselves better and protect themselves from overstraining.\n- Ideal for ambitious runners, as they can train more specifically in their intensity ranges and thus increase endurance and performance.\n- For all athletes and fitness enthusiasts who are interested in heart rate monitoring during their training with their Apple Watch.\n\nSummary:\nWith the PULSALARM app on the iPhone you can determine your 5 intensity ranges based on your maximum heart rate. You can enter your maximum heart rate directly or have it calculated. Set your personal maximum heart rate limit, which you do not want to exceed during training, and your minimum heart rate limit. When these limits are reached, your Apple Watch will alert you by vibrating and/or beeping."

      "label": "Biofeedback is the future and the future is now - for everyone. No additional body sensors are needed anymore! Just take your iPhone and start VaYou.\n\nVaYou Breath is innovative sound biofeedback. The app connects you directly with yourself by transforming your abdominal breathing into dynamically generated sounds. \n\nIt is very simple! You breathe relaxed and VaYou generates sounds from it - directly shaped by your breathing. With the help of real-time biofeedback, your breath, mind and heart increasingly flow as one.\n\nVaYou Breath integrates with Apple Health by updating your values for resting heart rate, respiratory rate, and mindful minutes.\n\nKey VaYou benefits\n\n• Biometric Integration - VaYou provides advanced real-time breath and pulse detection without the need for additional wearables or expensive medical sensors.\n• We have gone to the technical limits. VaYou converts the iOS motion/acceleration sensor data stream into high quality biosignals for breath and pulse (pulse only in lying position).\n• In order to support the relaxation process, the VaYou algorithms learn from your biosignals and derived parameters how to best design the sounds so that they are most effective for you at that moment.\n• No online connection needed while using - activate airplane mode for an undisturbed and healthy experience!\n\nNo other app or desktop software provides biofeedback like VaYou Breath.\n\nJust listening to the breath-generated sounds leads you into a very personal flow experience. Your consciousness is more and more \"absorbed\" by the process, your thoughts come to rest. The mental state can be described as relaxed and calming breath mindfulness. It is almost automatic to \"stay with the breath\", easily and effortless.  \n\nUnlike with apps where you have to understand and follow spoken instructions, with VaYou Breath you can \"switch off\" right from the start. The resulting flow experience brings body and mind into harmony and this has a regenerating effect.\n\nThe regular use of VaYou Breath can have a generally positive effect on body and mind. Some of the reported effects are\n• Calming the flow of thoughts\n• Reduction of stress levels\n• Self regulation of the heart and breathing activity\n• Increase of creativity\n• Improvement of mood\n• Improvement of sleep.\n\nIT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT:\n\nPut on good headphones and choose one of the perfected Sound~Flows. Then select the duration, press START and place the iPhone on your lower abdomen, just below the navel. (It's usually better to loosen a belt if you wear one and slide the iPhone halfway into the belt line of your trousers or skirt.) Keep breathing and listening! \n\nLIVE 1 and LIVE 2 is the app's main biofeedback mode. To be even more flexible, there is also a PACING mode, in which an adjustable breathing rhythm is played, which you simply breathe along. Without the need to look at the screen.\n\nIt is actually very easy to get into your personal \"Flow~Breathing\" and to experience and enjoy the balancing positive effect. \n\nWHAT YOU GET:\n\n▪ The VaYou biofeedback algorithm that turns your breathing movements into amazing Sound~Flows\n▪ The \"Flow Journey\" Sound~Flow, which guides you through a universe of different breath~sound experiences up to 30 minutes duration\n▪ The \"Four Fully\" Sound~Flow for very effective and recreational short breaks\n▪ All other Sound~Flows can be downloaded as in-app purchases within the app. And of course you get them for your LIFETIME, even if you change or loose your device. \n\nPRICES:\n\n• No subscription, no automatic renewal\n• No hidden costs or unnecessarily large packages\n• You only pay what you really like and want.\n\nWishes, questions and feedback are always welcome: welcome@vayou.app\nor at https://vayou.app/usergroup\n\nVaYou is Time for You.\nNOW is Time for You!"

      "label": "\"Es gibt für den Menschen keine geräuschlosere und ungestörtere Zufluchtsstätte als seine eigene Seele. Halte recht oft solche stille Einkehr und erneuere so dich selbst.\" (Marc Aurel)\n\nDas Autogene Training (AT) wurde von J.H. Schultz in den 20er Jahren des letzten Jahrhunderts entwickelt und zählt zu den etablierten und wissenschaftlich fundierten Entspannungsmethoden. Das AT basiert auf dem Prinzip der Autosuggestion (Selbsthypnose).\n\nWirkungen und Anwendungsbereiche: Die positiven Wirkungen des Autogenen Trainings wurden in zahlreichen wissenschaftlichen Studien belegt. Anwendungsbereiche für das AT sind unter vielen anderen: Ängste, Schlafstörungen, Schmerzen, Stress, Burn-out, Versagensängste, Prüfungsangst, Süchte, Durchblutungsstörungen, Herzrhythmusstörungen, Bluthochdruck, Wechseljahrsbeschwerden, Rheuma, Hormonelle Störungen, ... Gegenanzeigen: keine. Denjenigen, die unter ausgeprägten Psychosen leiden, ist jedoch vorab eine ärztliche Rücksprache anzuraten.\n\nAufbau und Phasen des  Autogenen Trainings:\nIn dieser App werden alle Phasen (Übungen) des AT sowie das Komplett-Programm angeleitet und geübt. Die Herz-Übung wurde bewusst ausgelassen. Dies wird auch zunehmend von Therapeuten und Wissenschaftlern empfohlen, da viele Übende hiermit Schwierigkeiten bei der Entspannung haben. Das AT besteht aus 5 Phasen:\n\nPhase 1: Die Schwere-Übung\nPhase 2: Die Wärme-Übung\nPhase 3: Die Atem-Übung\nPhase 4: Die Bauch-Übung (Sonnengeflecht)\nPhase 5: Die Stirn-Übung\n\nZum Einschlafen oder mit Rücknahme:\nAlle Phasen sowie das Komplett-Programm können zum Einschlafen verwendet werden oder auch mit Rücknahme geübt werden. Bei der Phase 5 (Stirn-Übung) ist \"mit Rücknahme\" voreingestellt, da die Stirn-Übung eine belebende Wirkung haben kann daher beim Einschlafen hinderlich sein könnte.\n\nAnfänger und Fortgeschrittene:\nWenn du Anfänger bist, nimm dir für die ersten Tage nur die 1. Phase (Schwere-Übung) vor. Die Schwere-Übung ist die zentrale Übung beim AT, da sie Grundvoraussetzung für die Entspannung und damit auch für alle folgenden Phasen des AT ist; daher wird diese Phase am Anfang auch länger und intensiver angeleitet und geübt. Sobald du die Schwere fühlst, gehst du zur 2. Phase über und so weiter. Jede Phase beinhaltet auch die vorangegangenen Phasen – jedoch jetzt in kürzerer Form. Das bedeutet, dass z.B. die Phase 3 (Atem-Übung) auch die Schwere-Übung und die Wärme-Übung jeweils in Kurzform einschließt (Grundaufbau des AT).\n\nTimer-Funktion\nAuf alle Phasen zum Einschlafen kann eine beliebig lange Zeit (Voreinstellung: 60 min) für die Hintergrundmusik (Musik 1-5) mit/ohne Natur-Sounds eingestellt werden, so dass Musik & Natur-Sounds deine Entspannung noch weiter vertieft oder in den Schlaf begleitet.\n\nAudio-Qualität und App-Größe:\nUm die bestmögliche Audio-/Sound-Qualität anbieten zu können und alle Inhalte offline – also ohne Internet-Verbindung – auf mobilen Geräten verfügbar zu machen, ist die Größe der App unvermeidlich.\n\nHinweis\nDie App kann und sollte im Flugzeug-Modus (offline) genutzt werden."

Im Programmteil „Der kleine Lebensretter“ wird zusätzlich Hintergrundwissen zu den unterschiedlichsten Erste Hilfe-Themen vermittelt. \n\nDie Applikation bietet vier Funktionen: \nDer interaktive Erste Hilfe-Assistent gibt per Sprache und wahlweise Text oder Bild Anweisungen zu Erste Hilfe-Maßnahmen und kann so durch eine Notfallsituation lotsen. Per Eingabe mit „Ja“- oder „Nein“-Taste können die Fragen der Applikation entsprechend der Notfallsituation beantwortet werden. Der Benutzer wird auf Beachtung des Eigenschutzes hingewiesen und zur Bewusstseins- und Atemkontrolle angehalten. Der jeweiligen Antwort entsprechend wird er weitergeleitet zu Maßnahmen zur Wiederbelebung oder zu Maßnahmen, die bei Verbrennungen, Vergiftungen, Atemnot, Blutungen, Schlaganfall und Herzinfarkt dringend notwendig sind. Diese Maßnahmen werden detailliert, weitestgehend auch durch Abbildungen, beschrieben. \n\nDer „Notruf Assistent“ bietet Hilfe, um einen Notruf zu tätigen. Er enthält eine Anleitung für eine genaue Notfallmeldung anhand der fünf Ws, bietet die Möglichkeit einer Standortbestimmung mit Darstellung durch Google-Maps und zur automatischen Notrufbetätigung. \n„Der kleine Lebensretter“ beinhaltet wichtiges Hintergrundwissen in Text und Bild zu unterschiedlichen Erste Hilfe-Themen wie Gelenkverletzungen, Knochenbrüchen, Sonnenstich, Schock oder Stabile Seitenlage. „Der kleine Lebensretter“ kann weiterführend zum interaktiven Erste Hilfe-Assistenten oder allgemein als kleine Informationssammlung zu Ersten Hilfe-Themen benutzt werden. \nMit den „DRK Infodiensten“ lassen sich die wichtigsten DRK News online abrufen, aktuelle Blutspendetermine im Umkreis herausfinden und eine Übersicht über die unterschiedlichen Angebote zu Erste Hilfe Kursen einsehen.\n\nDie Applikation ist in deutscher Sprache."

Some are specific (2000 series only at the moment) which aim to improve, sloper strength, pocket strength and crimp strength. \n\nThere is also a new custom workout program fully adjustable and includes the 1000,2000 and micros, so if you have your own hang regime and different timings then that is all programmable and can be saved.\n\nBoth the workouts and custom timer now record hang contraction time (time spent actually hanging off the board) We recommend most users get up to around 20:00 minutes on this clock whilst doing their workouts.\n\nOn the Workout screen after you've selected your work out it is now possible to adjust set and hang times. Users who are only finger boarding and are having a rest day prior to and after training may wish to do up to 3 sets and 7 hangs. Other users may prefer to go for 2 sets and 6 hangs, this is what we'd consider an average and more suited to people doing additional types of training.\n\nPlease note the grades for the workouts aren't actually meant to relate to anything other than themselves. E.G. 5c is easier than 6a but harder than 5b. If you find 5a hard on the 1000, use a weight removal technique such as putting one foot on a chair in front of the board or using a pulley with weights on. More advice on this and other things are available in the general advice section on the Workout Ratings page.\n\nTo record your hangs press the record button (red circle icon) whilst resting. The Workout Ratings function is much improved and should now be a really useful training aid which records gradual progress and improvement.\n\nFingerboard gains take time, remember to warm up thoroughly and move on to more difficult hangs at a slightly slower pace than you think you should to give pulleys time to catch up with muscles. For example 10% strength gains over a year is brilliant improvement. 5% is still effective training.\n\nBest of luck with the training, happy hanging and we hope this helps with the motivation."

      "label": "Heart Rate Variability measurements recorded by your Apple Watch can give you insight on the stress level your body is under. By using HRV Tracker to track short-term measurements and long-term trends, you can see how your workload during the day, workout sessions or sleeping etc affect your body's readiness, recovery and stress level. Simply put, the higher your HRV is, the better.\n\n***Requires an HRV capable Apple Watch with watchOS 6 or later***\nHRV Tracker for Watch integrates with the Health app and uses data stored in the Health app. To make sure your Apple Watch is capable of recording HRV measurements, please open the Health app on your iPhone to see if any HRV measurements exists. Go to > Health app > Browse > Heart > Hear Rate Variability.\n\n***Get Notified***\nHRV Tracker makes spotting changes in your HRV easy by monitoring your HRV measurements in the background and showing notifications after your HRV drops under or rises above your desired levels. HRV Tracker will monitor changes in individual measurements and also your 24 hour HRV average. You can change the default notification levels directly in your Apple Watch app. Please note that notifications can get postponed for example because of a low battery level.\n\n***Apple Watch for daily tracking***\nBrowse through last seven days of HRV measurements by using the digital crown. See how measurements compare to your seven day period and individual days. By tapping the graph you can toggle through the first values of each day. Use complications on your Apple Watch to stay informed on changes in your HRV. \n\nBesides the automatically recorded HRV measurements you can use the Breathe app on your Apple Watch to record new HRV measurements. Start a Breathe session in the Breathe app and after the session ends a new HRV measurement will be available in HRV Tracker.\n\n***Compare HRV to other key metrics***\nFind possible causes for changes in HRV by using the comparison graphs available on your Apple Watch:\n-Sleep hours: By default HRV Tracker will use sleep data provided by sleep apps that add sleep data to HealthKit. If no sleep data is available HRV Tracker will calculate estimated sleep hours per night (estimated sleep time will only be available in the Apple Watch app)\n-Activity: By default HRV Tracker will use your Active Energy (calories) as the activity metric. In the HRV Tracker Apple Watch app you can choose to use a custom activity score that emphasizes the intensity of daily activity.\n-Daily resting heart rate (RHR).\nToggle between comparison graphs by tapping the upper part of the screen.\n\n***Follow Long-term HRV trend***\nFollow your long-term HRV trend on your iPhone and compare your short term measurements to all-time data.\n-Select week from weekly graph to see daily HRV values of the selected week.\n-Browse through all daily HRV values of the selected day\n-Compare daily HRV averages to other relevant daily metrics: Activity, Sleep (if available in the Health app) and Resting Heart Rate\n\n***Widgets on iPhone***\n-Medium sized widget with chart showing all daily hrv values\n-Multiple small widgets to choose from\n\n***Privacy***\nData read from the Apple HealthKit database is only used to show information related to your Heart Rate Variability. Information read by HRV Tracker is only stored and used locally on your iPhone and Apple Watch. \n\n***How is it measured***\nHeart rate variability measurements used by HRV Tracker are calculated by measuring the variation between individual heartbeats. Your Apple Watch automatically measures your HRV in the background and stores the outcome into HealthKit. HealthKit uses SDNN heart rate variability, which is calculated using the standard deviation of the inter-beat (RR) intervals between normal heartbeats (measured in milliseconds). Besides background measurements generated automatically by your Apple Watch you can use the Breathe app on your Apple Watch to generate new measurements."

      "label": "WHAT IS BRUXAPP?\nBruxApp is the first globally available, research-based smartphone app dedicated to the study and management of Bruxism and its health consequences.\nDesigned by top international experts in a multi-center Bruxism research project and developed in 25 Research Centres across the world. \n\nWHAT CAN IT DO?\nBruxapp is a simple tool used by dentists and patients for several purposes:\n- To help the assessment  of the presence/absence of bruxism-related activities (i.e., teeth clenching or grinding, jaw clenching) and potential consequences.\n- For rating the severity of bruxism, if present.\n- As a biofeedback-based management tool for bruxism.\n- To increase patients’ awareness of bruxism activities so they can avoid or correct negative habits.\n- To make patients aware of the possible clinical consequences of bruxism and try to prevent them.\n- To promote cutting-edge knowledge about bruxism, based on the latest scientific research.\n\nWHY is BruxApp needed? \nBruxism has been increasing in prevalence over recent years. It encompasses motor activities of the jaw muscles, such as jaw or teeth clenching, and teeth grinding, some of which may be associated with clinical signs and symptoms, like tooth wear, failed dental restorations, complications with implant-supported prosthesis, muscle fatigue and temporomandibular joint pain. A correct diagnosis is therefore fundamental to establishing early prevention and management regimens.\n\nSCIENTIFIC RESEARCH\nStudies with BruxApp have been supervised by experts, as part of an ongoing multicenter research project on bruxism epidemiology and management coordinated by Prof. Daniele Manfredini, University of Siena, Italy.\n\nDEVELOPMENT\nThe app was developed by Goran Djukic, program analyst at the Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Council of Research, University of Pisa, Italy.\nBruxApp is currently available in the following languages: English, Italian, , French, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish, Brazilian, Japanese, Hebrew, Chinese, Arabic, Greek, Polish, Lithuanian, Bosnian, Romanian, Turkish, Norwegian, and Croatian, with another 4 language versions soon to be released. \n\nIMPORTANT STATEMENT\nBruxApp is not a game or gadget.  In order for BruxApp to work correctly and be effective, please dedicate 5 minutes of your time to READING the simple instructions CAREFULLY. \n\nThe full compatibility is guaranteed by iPhone 6 and higher ones and iOS 9.3 and higher ones."

Smolov isn't for new lifters, but if you have some experience under your belt (like with 5/3/1, starting strength, 20 squat, etc.), then this may be a great lifting protocol for you."

If the CNS Tap Test result is elevated it is suitable for a  maximum effort or a heavy lifting day. If the CNS Tap Test result is lower than average it may indicate CNS fatigue and impending sickness, injury or over-training.\n\nBoth hands should be tested on a regular basis in a consistent environment, typically every morning on waking. The procedure for testing is:\n\n - Rest hand palm down on the heel of the hand on a flat surface\n - Tapping is done with the index (pointing finger), and all other fingers remain on the flat surface\n - The timer starts with the first tap\n - When the timer expires no further taps will be accepted\n - The result can either be saved or discarded.\n\nMultiple samples can be saved per day.\n\nThe resulting data can be graphed, emailed or managed from within CNS Tap Test.\n\nUsing Swift Charts for improved accessibility and legibility."

      "label": "Eating sweets has many health disadvantages. The sugar contained in sweets has a negative effect on your body and your well-being. To prevent this, we have developed this app for you.\n\nWhat happens in the body when you eat sugar? Is fructose better than classic sugar? And what is sugar exactly?\n\nSugar is unhealthy.\n\nOur body gets its energy from the three main nutrients fat, protein and carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are made up of sugar molecules. It is important to distinguish between simple carbohydrates - for example from sweets and classic table sugar - and complex carbohydrates, which you can find in whole grains and vegetables, for example.\n\nWhen people talk about “unhealthy sugar”, they usually mean classic table sugar and simple carbohydrates from confectionery and white flour. Complex carbohydrates are metabolized completely differently and are useful and healthy sources of energy. However, you should keep your hands off classic sugar. Why? For these 4 reasons.\n\nSugar makes you fat\nAll carbohydrates are first broken down by the body into their individual building blocks. What's left is glucose. Glucose is metabolized with the help of the hormone insulin. The insulin ensures that the sugar gets to the cells where it is needed in the form of energy.\nThe more sugar you eat, the more insulin is released. So too much sugar messes up and skyrockets your insulin levels. This is unfavorable in two ways: On the one hand, the hormone reduces fat burning. On the other hand, after such insulin spikes, the amount of sugar in the blood quickly drops to an absolute minimum again. The result: renewed cravings for sugar. This creates a vicious circle that causes you to constantly ingest sugar and increase your daily caloric intake.\n\nSugar is addicting\nSugar ensures that more dopamine is released in the brain's reward center. The happiness hormone evokes a good mood and feelings of happiness. Unfortunately only for a short time. As soon as the effects wear off, the brain craves for more. This creates a vicious circle that leads you to eat more and more sugar.\n\nSugar makes you sick\nThis is nothing new. Obesity, type 2 diabetes and tooth decay are the most well-known dangers associated with too much sugar. Studies also indicate that too much concentrated fructose in particular favors the formation of invisible but unhealthy fat that is deposited between and around the organs. Isolated fructose, which is used to sweeten fruit drinks and sweets, also inhibits the hormone leptin, which is responsible for feeling full.\n\nSugar makes you look old\nIf you eat too much sugar at once, your body cannot completely convert it into energy. The excess sugar molecules then combine with proteins that are responsible for the elasticity of your skin. The result: Unsightly wrinkles.\nThese compounds of sugar and protein also bind to the receptors of immune cells and thus promote inflammation and poor blood circulation in the skin. In short: the more sugar, the more unsightly the complexion.\n\nWith the help of this app you can stop eating sweets overnight and follow your positive health progress.\nThis app also gives you the opportunity to save money.\nThanks to the push notification, you will always be rewarded to stop eating sweets.\n\nHave fun living healthy."

Neurogenes Zittern ist ein Selbstheilungsreflex unseres Körpers, eine angeborene Fähigkeit unseres Körpers, Anspannung und Stressreaktionen abzubauen und Selbstheilungskräfte zu aktivieren.\n\nDas Wort \"neurogen\" bedeutet, dass es sich dabei um eine körperliche Reaktion handelt, die man nicht bewusst herbeiführen oder steuern kann. Es löst die Anspannungen, die der Körper bei starken inneren Gefühlen und äusseren Einflüssen aufbaut. Es bringt Sie zu innerer Ruhe und Gelassenheit zurück. Das neurogene Zittern verbessert Ihre Belastungsfähigkeit und lässt auch Schmerzen nach und nach verschwinden. Alte Heiltraditionen nutzen die Kraft des unwillkürlichen Zitterns seit Jahrtausenden.\n\nNeuroZittern bietet folgende Funktionalitäten an:\nWissen – Hintergrundinformationen über TRE.\nSo geht’s – Eine Grundanleitung zur Durchführung der Übungen.\nÜbungen – Detaillierte Beschreibung der 7 Übungen mit zusätzlich eine Videoanleitung.\nAnbieter – Eine Liste von TRE-AnbieterInnen im deutschsprachigen Raum.\n\nBevor Sie sich für oder gegen eine medizinische Behandlung in Zusammenhang mit den Übungen in dieser App entscheiden, lasses sich bitte von einer Ärztin, einem Arzt beraten."

      "label": "How can fruit and vegetable juices improve our physical condition, our health and our productivity?\n\nTo answer this question, we need to widen our views a bit and consider nutrition from a broader perspective.\n\n- The three times of food\nThis concept, proposed by Eben Pagan, suggests to consider the meals we eat in 3 different times:\n\n- 1. Immediately\nThe real-time experience of food: is good or bad?\n- 2. In the short term\nThe 2-3 hours that follow: if we feel energetic and effective, or heavy and listless\n- 3. Long-term\nWhat we eat affects our health for the rest of our lives, for example, it can add or remove fat from our body, promote or weaken our immune system, encourage or discourage the occurrence of degenerative diseases etc.\n\nIn this regard, we have to evaluate each meal in these three time periods, on a scale from 1 to 10.\n\nWhen you decide what to eat, ask yourself how much its value is from 1 to 10 in terms of:\n- Taste: do I like to eat it?\n- Energy: in the next 2-3 hours, how effectively will it give me energy?\n- Health in the long term: how does it affect my immune system, how does it affect the occurrence of diseases, how does it affect the rest of my life.\nIn 10 years, will I be proud to have eaten this meal?\n\nAlmost all of us are in the constant search for a 9 or 10 in the immediate. And in order to get it we are often willing to accept a 2, 3 or 4 in the short term. If it is not too heavy on the stomach or if we do not feel too much strain in digestion, that's fine... it's enough it has a good flavor.\n\nFor the long term, we have no idea how this food is going to affect our body and our immune system. So for example when we get sick, we feel depressed, when we have little desire to do anything, when we have problems in our relationships or go through periods where we feel apathetic and listless, we never put that in relationship with what we regularly eat and with the fact that food can have an effect on our health, our emotional state and our lives in general.\n\nMost of us eat almost exclusively for pleasure, for entertainment.\n\nWhat we should want for ourselves, is a 10 for the next 2 or 3 hours in terms of energy and mental clarity, and a 10 for our health, to limit the possibility of getting sick and to have a strong and responsive immune system throughout the course of our lives. And for this, we can also be prepared to accept a 5 or 6 (or maybe a 7) in the instant gratification that food can give us. In the immediate maybe we will not have the maximum enjoyment, but within 3 hours we will have energy and lucidity to the highest levels, and we will know that this meal will help to influence our health in a positive way in the long term, and we will be proud of this decision.\n\nFruits and vegetables juices are the best you can give yourself for the short and the long term!\n\nFeatures of the current version:\n- 52 Selected recipes\n- 40 Fact sheets of food with nutritional properties\n- High Quality photos\n- Therapeutic features food\n- Recommended seasons\n- Ability to filter according to the season, food and benefits\n- Select the ingredients you have at home to find which recipes you can achieve.\n- Ability to save favorite recipes\n- Practical tips for getting the most from one's eating habits\n- \"Pantry\" mode: select the ingredients you have at home to find which recipes you can achieve!\n- Ability to share recipes with friends or on major Social Networks\n\nFor suggestions and information:\ncanali.nicola@gmail.com\n\nFacebook page:\nwww.facebook.com/centrifugoapp\n\nNote:\nAn internet connection is required to update the database of the recipes.\n\nDislcaimer:\nThis information is the result of personal research on books and websites. It has the sole purpose of entertainment and should not be considered a remedy or cure for serious illnesses. For advice on your diet always consult a medical specialist.\n\nCentrifugo is only available on iOS."

      "label": "By analyzing HRV and Stress along with additional data, SweetBeat HRV provides a deeper dive into health and provides insight into what activities you engage in that effect the health metrics you care about.\n\nIMPORTANT: SweetBeat requires external hardware:\nA tested Bluetooth Low Energy Heart Rate Monitor, Wellue DuoEK hand held heart rate monitor or a Wellue VisualBeat heart rate monitor patch.  While other manufacturers wrist worn devices work well for heart rate, their wrist worn heart rate monitors are not accurate enough for HRV and so are not supported. The iWatch is not supported.  The wrist worn devices can be used for Food Sensitivity tests.\n\n•Please visit https://www.sweetwaterhrv.com/healthsensors.shtml for a list of compatible Heart Rate Monitors devices.\n\nThe next big trend in bio-hacking is understanding the relationships between different metrics. SweetBeat HRV integrates and correlates data from popular fitness platforms like MapMyFitness, Fitbit and Withings.  SweetBeat HRV will also import your Apple Health app data (SDNN, Resting Heart Rate, Average Heart Rate) that is collected by the iWatch or other devices authorized to store metric in the Health app.  This data is for viewing purposes only and is not used in any HRV calculation or correlation.\n\nSweetBeat has four main components:\n•Monitor Stress\n•HRV for Training\n•Food Sensitivity\n•Data Correlation\n\nMonitor Stress: \nWith SweetBeatHRV, you can see your stress levels in real time, giving you the ability to take action to reduce stress. If your chosen stress threshold is reached, SweetBeat’s Relax screen prompts you with a deep breathing screen that includes calming images.\n\n•Stats: The stats screen more widely referred to as the “geek” screen, shows all the metrics being measured. If using the HealthPatch, the user can view the additional provided metrics.\n•Graph: The graph screen shows a real-time building graph of your heart rate from RR Intervals. Turning the phone 90 degrees counter-clockwise will bring up the graph in landscape. \n•Export RR Intervals: SweetBeat provides RR interval export capability. \n\nHRV For Training: \nIn competitive sports, improved performance is often affected by alternating periods of intensive training with periods of relative rest. SweetBeatHRV measures HRV, an objective measure of your body’s response to each workout and provides training recommendations based on the morning reading. \n\nFood Sensitivity Test: \nIf you are sensitive to certain foods, you may not experience symptoms, though your body reacts by elevating your heart rate after eating an offending food. Low level food sensitivities may contribute to inflammation. This inflammation tells the body to hang onto stored fat to combat whatever stress caused the hormonal release. SweetBeatHRV measures your pulse three times after eating and assigns either a “X” (sensitive) or a green checkmark (not sensitive).  \n\nCorrelation: \nThe correlation screen uses a patent pending algorithm to correlate all of the data the user has shared with SweetBeat. This data will come from the app itself and any other apps or devices the user has authorized (Fitbit, Withings, and/or MapMyFitness). \n\nThe correlation feature turns your data into useful information and provides insight into what combination of activities lead to desired HRV, stress or weight, giving you the knowledge you need to achieve your health and fitness goals.\n\nSweetBeat Features: \n•Post your session summary on Twitter to share with friends.\n•Customize your Relax screen images with your favorite pictures. \n•Track your heart rate recovery after exercising. \n•Track the foods you have eaten and your body’s response to them. \n•Save and upload sessions to your secure MySweetBeat account at www.BeatHealthy.com. \n•Email your RRs and session data for personal analysis off-line\n•View your Apple Health data with trend lines"

It will help diabetics to discover new foods, broaden choices and even enjoy eating out without nasty surprises following along.\n\nDiabetics who use bread units (a sub-system of carb counting) can learn to match their insulin dose individually to the amount of carbohydrates they eat and drink. Because bread units are single-digits, it is easy to keep track of them during the course of the day and simplify food management.\n\nThe built-in meal planner opens up the possibility to create entire meals with accurate bread unit counts as a result of each individual ingredient – and therefore shows what is necessary to prepare for proper insulin dosage.\n\n\n≡ WHY COUNT CARBS ? ≡\n\nEspecially new, unknown products and their effects on blood sugar levels are often hard to assess and so we all fall into this dull habit of eating the same things - day in, day out. \nCounting carbohydrates through bread units (BU’s) is a good solution for many people with diabetes, not just those taking insulin. The International Diabetes Association recommends \"carb counting as an [effective] meal planning technique for managing blood glucose levels\". \n\n\n≡ WHAT DOES THE APP DO? ≡\n\nThe app’s database contains carbohydrate equivalents in bread units for thousands of popular foods. Simply set your serving size with the swipe of your finger and include the additional calorie information if you struggle with the weight management part. All calculations necessary for a complete meal are automated if you combine multiple food portions and will display as one comprehensive result. \n\nThe food choices include:\n» Fresh products, fruits & vegetables\n» Popular brand-name products\n» Restaurant meal choices if you eat out\n\n\n≡ SIMPLE INSULIN MGMT. ≡\n\nSet the calues for 1 bread unit (BU) to your preferred “insulin to carbohydrate unit ratio”. Usually, these are 12 grams of carbohydrates per bread unit.\nSome countries teach carb counting with 10 grams of carbs per BU, but you are free to try which is  better suited to your lifestyle.\n\n\n≡ APP FEATURES ≡\n=> Bread units & calories for thousands of food choices\n=> Adjustable carb unit calculations (12g or 10g of carbohydrates per BU)\n=> Quick, paperless solution to search and find the right foods\n=> Simple serving size calculator for improved accuracy\n=> Save personal serving sizes for later\n=> Save regional foods & personal favorites \n=> Create & sort lists by nutrient, ascending or descending\n=> Nutrient filter to optimize your meal planning\n=> VoiceOver support if you suffer from diabetic retinopathy"

The logged data can be presented as bar chart and exported as text or CSV file.\n\n\nLOCATION-BASED ACTIONS\n\nWhen entering or leaving certain regions the App can automatically record tracks, post notifications, play music, trigger \"external\" actions using the \"WebHook\" protocol and more.\n\n\nICLOUD SYNC\n\nTracks and regions can be synced across devices using the iCloud. This makes it easy to record tracks on an iPhone and evaluate these later on a larger iPad screen.\n\n\nAPPLE WATCH\n\nPado also supports the Apple Watch (all models) and can be used fully autonomously to record tracks or routes (which means you do not need to take the iPhone with you to use the Watch App). This does even work on Apple Watch models without GPS hardware (in which case the location services do use WLAN networks nearby to get the geo location). All tracks can be displayed directly on the Watch on a Map, and you can zoom and scroll the map with the track. Alternatively you can also use the Watch App to remote control the iPhone App.\n\n\nHARDWARE REQUIREMENTS\n\nPado supports all iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Apple Watch devices. \nUnlike many other Apps, this App does also work great on iPod Touch and iPad models without GPS hardware (but you need to be within a region with a good WLAN coverage). On devices with GPS hardware it works best. The step counter requires an iPhone 5s or newer or an Apple Watch.\n\n\nHEALTH-KIT\n\nAs an option, Pado can use the heart rate data from Health-Kit and display it together with the recorded Track speed and pace charts. When recording tracks on the Apple Watch, Pado can also measure the heart rate. Pado will never store the heart rate data anywhere (neither within Pado nor externally), and will use the HealthKit data only when explicitly enabled in the settings.\n\n\nFINAL NOTES\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

Mit welchem Gesundheitsrisiko muss ich rechnen? Gut, wenn wir mit dem iPhone in Supermarkt oder Restaurant gleich nachsehen können.\nGenau zu diesem Zweck hat ihanwel in Zusammenarbeit mit dem renommierten Autor Dr. Hans-Ulrich Grimm die App Dr.Watson entwickelt.\n\nALLES ÜBER LEBENSMITTELZUSATZSTOFFE - AUF IHREM IPHONE\nDr.Watson enthält eine Datenbank mit allen zugelassenen Lebensmittelzusatzstoffen, mit umfangreichen Informationen zu \"Risiken\", \"Trifft es mich?\", \"Was ist es überhaupt?\". Die Texte sind handlich und verständlich geschrieben. Zudem lassen sich alle Zusatzstoffe ausfiltern, die zu bestimmten Krankheitsbildern gehören. Die Daten stehen offline zur Verfügung, es muss also keine Internetverbindung vorhanden sein um Dr.Watson zu nutzen.\n\nGEWICHT UND GESUNDHEITSRISIKEN REDUZIEREN\nChemie im Essen kann Ihre Gesundheit gefährden: Farbstoffe, Aromen, Geschmacksverstärker werden immer häufiger zum Auslöser von Allergien, führen bei Kindern zu Verhaltensstörungen und Lernschwächen, ja werden sogar mitunter zur Gefahr fürs Gehirn. Alzheimer und Parkinson können die Folge sein. Und: Sie können auch dick machen. Dr.Watson hilft Ihnen diese Zusatzstoffe zu erkennen.\n\nJEDERZEIT UND AN JEDEM ORT VERFÜGBAR\nDie Dr.Watson zugrunde liegenden Daten werden mit der Installation der App offline auf Ihrem iPhone / iPod Touch installiert (auf schlanken 3 MB Speicherplatz), so dass Sie die Informationen jederzeit und überall auch ohne Onlineverbindung verfügbar haben.\n\nDATENBASIS VON BESTSELLERAUTOR DR. HANS-ULRICH GRIMM\nDie Dr.Watson zugrunde liegende DR.-WATSON-Datenbank der Lebensmittel-Zusatzstoffe beruht auf jahrelangen Recherchen, eigenen Untersuchungen und der Auswertung von mehreren tausend wissenschaftlichen Studien durch Dr. Hans-Ulrich Grimm (Autor des Klassikers \"Die Suppe lügt\"), Bernhard Ubbenhorst und der Ernährungswissenschaftlerin Maike Ehrlichmann. Wissenschaftliche Beratung: Professor Stephan C.

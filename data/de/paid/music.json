      "label": "With SonoSequencr you can create individual sequences to perform recurring tasks with just one click.\n\nIf you have multiple Sonos devices and want to play a radio station on all of them, it takes some time to set this up. With SonoSequencr, all you have to do is open the app and tap your previously created sequence.\nYou can lock your iOS device or use another app while your sequence is running in the background.\nOf course, you can also start it from the widget, Apple Watch or using Flic Buttons.\n\nHere are some examples:\n- Group kitchen and dining room, set volume to 5, start a radio station and set a sleep timer to 2 hours\n- Switch your Playbar in the living room to the TV input, set the volume to 40, add dining room and set the equalizer settings for both devices to neutral\n- Disable the subwoofer and enable voice enhancement + night mode on the Playbar in the living room\n- Set the equalizer settings for all your devices to specific values\n- Disable touch on speaker and enable status light for all your devices\n- Set the volume of the kitchen and living room to the same value as in the dining room\n- Make an announcement with your individual text in the children's room\n- etc...\n\nEach of these examples, created once, requires only one tap in the widget or on your Apple Watch.\n\nSonoSequencr also includes a restricted mode. This allows you to restrict control to specific devices, among other things.\n\n\nUsing an optional in-app purchase, you can also start sequences at specific times or via external triggers like IFTTT. Of course, this requires that the iOS device is on the same network as your Sonos devices at the time. For intensive use of external triggers, it is recommended to run SonoSequencr in 'server mode'. In this mode, SonoSequencr is always running in the foreground on a dedicated iOS device. SonoSequencr still supports iOS9.\n\nThere are many more features like grid view, create dynamic alarms, HTTP requests, launch other apps, automatic battery charging in server mode, transfer sequences between devices, etc....\n\nYou can only use music (radio streams/tracks/albums) for your sequences that are stored in your Sonos Favorites (My Sonos) or in your TuneIn radio stations. You can't search your entire music library in this app. Just add your most used music to my Sonos then it can be used in your sequences.\n\nThe Timed Sequences feature is only available with an optional in-app purchase 'Premium'. With this automatically renewing subscription, up to 20 sequences can be run at freely configurable times. The function is only active as long as a valid subscription exists. The costs are billed via the iTunes account. The subscription will be renewed automatically within 24 hours before expiration (same time and costs), unless it is cancelled before in 'Settings' -> 'Manage Subscriptions' or in the iTunes settings.\n\nTo use this app you must have a working Sonos system. SonoSequencr supports Sonos software 1 and 2.\n\nFor terms and conditions and privacy policy see:\nhttps://celltekk.de/sonosequencr/help/privacy\n\nThis is not an official Sonos app."

      "label": "\"This really is the synth that keeps on giving! Inspiration and intuition truly blend together in this musical instrument.\"  Alan Parsons\nSunrizer Synth is a virtual analog synthesizer that takes the definition of iOS synthesizer to the next level. \nThanks to carefully designed architecture and heavy usage of coprocessor it blurs the boundaries between iOS and hardware synthesizers. \nSunrizer was built to perform and works perfectly with any MIDI keyboard or sequencer. A lot of research has been done in order to achieve unheard warmth and clarity. \n\nHIGHLIGHTS \n· True SuperSaw sound emulation, first found in the legendary Roland JP-8000 synthesizer. SuperSaw is a layered waveform consisting of multiple saw waves which are detuned to create an extremely full and epic sound. \n· Two filters per voice with configurable routing. 15 filter types available, including less common like Comb, Formant or Frequency shifter. \n· The Morph Group function lets you continuously morph of up to 30 parameters in a sound (including effects), using only the modulation wheel. \n· Full support for CoreMidi, MIDI mapping, Virtual Midi Ports and background audio.\n· Multi mode lets you multiply oscillators to get unbelievably fat and full sound. \n· Support for microtuning - load scl and tun files. Create fascinating microtonal music which uses intervals not found in the Western system of 12 equal intervals to the octave.\n\nOSCILLATORS \n· 2 warm-sounding analog modelled oscillators, 2 sub-oscillators (except SuperSaw). Available waveforms: Saw, PWM pulse,Triangle, SuperSaw, FM (frequency of phase modulation). 6 oscillators per voice in multi-sono mode. \n· Oscillator 2 hard-sync and configurable routing \n· FM (true frequency modulation) and PM mode \n· Osc-mix, ring modulator \n· White noise oscillator \n\nFLEXIBLE MULTI FILTERS \n· Two independent filters per voice with configurable routing. Filter types: LPF, HPF, BPF, Analog LPF, Notch, Comb, All pass, Power LPF, Power BPF, Wave shaper, Resonator, Resampler, LPF+Resampler, Frequency shifter. \n· Configurable routing: serial or parallel with bypass option. \n· ADSR envelope, keyboard tracking and full LFO control. \n\nMODULATION \n· Two LFOs per voice.

Anyone can jump in and play with over 160 included presets or lay fingers to the controls and begin exploring vast magical realms of creative potential for iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch and Mac. \n\nThe Minimoog Model D App incorporates a number of inspiring sound creation tools and capabilities not present on its analog antecedent. New functions include the ability to play chords with up to four-note polyphony, an easy-to-use arpeggiator for rhythmic pattern creation, a real time looping recorder with unlimited overdubbing capacity, a tempo-synchronizable stereo ping pong delay module, and the Bender -- a wide-range stereo time modulation effect module. \n\nThe Minimoog Model D App also supports AUv3 Audio Unit extensions, which allows multiple instances of this powerful instrument to be used simultaneously within compatible iOS apps supporting AUv3.\n\nA BRIEF HISTORY \nIntroduced by Moog in 1970, the Minimoog Model D served as the archetype for all electronic keyboards that followed. It gave users the ability to design their own sounds, translating imagination into reality. The Minimoog’s portability, affordability and accessibility made it the go-to instrument for musicians looking to expand beyond the traditional sounds of the time. Bernie Worrell used the Minimoog Model D to establish Parliament Funkadelic’s futuristic funk sound. Kraftwerk employed the Minimoog Model D on the successful concept album Autobahn, sparking an entirely new genre. Gary Numan replaced his live band’s guitars with Minimoog Model Ds, creating the prototype for industrial music. The classic sound of the Minimoog Model D can be heard on Bob Marley’s Catch A Fire, Michael Jackson’s Thriller and Dr. Dre’s The Chronic; Detailed in the mini-doc series “A Brief History Of The Minimoog”. \n\nFEATURES \n• Ships with over 160 presets (hundreds more available in the Minimoog Model D App Store) \n• Up to 4-notes of polyphony \n• Easily share presets and audio recordings with friends \n• Arpeggiator module with note-hold and chord latch capability \n• Stereo ping-pong delay effect \n• Bender time modulation effect \n• Real-time looping recorder with overdub and immediate sharing \n• Selectable envelope shapes and triggering behavior \n• Effortless MIDI CC mapping \n• Seamlessly backup presets to iCloud \n• Play mode for easier panel and keyboard interaction \n• A new take on the classic feedback/overload path \n\nSUPPORTS\n• All 64-bit iOS devices\n• AUv3 Audio Unit Extensions (Including GarageBand)\n• MPE Controller Support \n• Ableton Link \n• Inter-App Audio and Audiobus\n• 7 and 14-Bit MIDI \n• MIDI Program Change Support \n• Bluetooth LE MIDI controllers \n• Share over AirDrop, Mail, or other iOS applications"

      "label": "AudioLayer satisfies the most sought after gap for contemporary music production on iOS devices. AudioLayer is a full featured open standard audio multi-sampler pushing the boundaries beyond what has been available even in the desktop music production worlds. And all this integrated in all relevant iOS production environments especially the emerging AUv3 AudioUnit standard.\n\n- SSE - Streaming Sample Engine -\nThe ultra efficient Streaming Sample Engine SSE is capable of playing hundreds of voices of big multi-sampled instruments even in strictly resource limited applications like using multiple instances of AudioLayer in AudioUnit host environments. Innovative features like Sub Sample Looping for perfect loops even in the audible range extend the range of applications even further.\n\n- Multiple storage options -\nThe consequent usage of the open file structure of the Files app makes organising even large sample libraries a breeze. Sample recordings and Instrument designs made with AudioLayer are seamlessly available across all your devices and desktop using either iCloud storage or external SSD. The iCloud option opens up new forms of collaborations with musicians all around the world to share your creations and work together.\n\n- Multi Scope Editing -\nTo support the creation of complex multi-sampled instruments AudioLayer allows you to use a hierarchical structure of Layers and Zones each with it’s own sound manipulation parameters. A unique element of AudioLayer is the possibility to decide for each Zone at which Scope level your editing apply: For the all Zones in the Instrument, for the Layer only or individually for this Zone only. This opens a whole new world of creative options for sound mangling. For sound manipulation you can use a full set of Filters, Envelopes and LFOs to shape the pitch, timbre and level of the sound of each Zone.\n\nSIS - Seamless Instrument Switching\nThe unique architecture of the Streaming Sample Engine allows for instant loading of even complex instruments and makes this switching from one Instrument to the next without cutting off the sound! And this includes of course also different effect setting\n\n- Easy Design Workflow -\nThe built in audio sample recorder let you create Instruments on the fly in seconds. The Music Effect AudioUnit / Audiobus effect plugin of AudioLayer let you record multi-samples semi automatically directly inside your preferred host and instantly create an Instrument with the help of several Auto mapping options available. This includes file name based mapping of key ranges and velocities and automatic pitch detection. For the creatives we’ve also integrated a special “Single Cycle Waveform” detector making the use of this special files a breeze.\n\n- Auto Sampler feature for easy creation of Sample Instruments from hardware synthesiser.\n\n- Versilian Studio Sample Library ( VCSL/VSCO ) for free download\n\nIntegration\n\n• Stand-alone App\n• Sample import for EXS24 and SFZ Format\n• AUv3 AudioUnit Instrument and Music Effect\n• Inter App Audio\n• Audiobus 3 Input/Effect with state saving support.\n• Audio recorder with share function.\n• Ableton Link compatible."

As seen on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\n\nhttps://loopyapp.com\n\n-- “This is the best loop station on the iPhone” -- Dub FX (dubfx.net) \n-- “I pretty much own every mobile looper out there and Loopy is HANDS DOWN the best. Super simple interface with powerful features.” -- J. Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support.

The enormously popular ELECTRIBE-R instantly became a must-have item for track-makers around the world, and now it’s been reborn as an app for iPhone.\n\nWith this app, we’ve effectively “put the original hardware chassis into your iPhone,” by faithfully reproducing the sound engine and design of the ELECTRIBE-R. We’ve also included the latest preset patterns and many new functions that are currently featured on the “iELECTRIBE for iPad”, released in 2010. , taking a further evolutionary step in technology. Taking advantage of the ease of use that you expect on iPhone, we have maximized the intuitive nature of the ELECTRIBE to make this new product worthy of its name: the iELECTRIBE mkII.\n\nIt won’t take long for you to enjoy the ultimate experience of the Electribe series. This apps intuitive nature and familiar interface make it easy to create beats with an analog feel that’s like nothing else.\n\n● Amazing rhythm machine that generates powerful grooves\nWe’ve perfectly replicated the thick-sounding synth engine of the ELECTRIBE-R and its intuitive step sequencer. Now you can instantly obtain extreme tonal changes and powerful rhythms with just one touch\nNot only can iELECTRIBE for iPhone be easily enjoyed by anyone, but it also allows detailed beat-making that transcends iPhone specs. In addition to playing back the provided audio data, you can also freely synthesize sounds from a single waveform and combine those sounds into your own original beats. This allows for the true experience of music production that connects all musicians.\n\n● Three hundred built-in rhythm patterns that only this app can produce\nWith 64 of the latest preset patterns, 192 from the first-generation ELECTRIBE-R, and 32 template patterns for various genres, this app successfully draws out the full potential of the thick sounding analog beats. There are approximately 300 inimitable rhythm patterns that you’ll hear only from iELECTRIBE for iPhone. Electro, house, techno, drum'n'bass, dubstep, hip hop, techno pop, and IDM are some of the wide range of electronic music genres that are provided.\n\n● An ELECTRIBE that you can put in your pocket and take anywhere\nWhether you’re on the train or bus while commuting to school or to work, at a coffee shop, or in your bedroom, you can enjoy beat-making anywhere and anytime you like. Your completed beats can be transferred to your DAW software via the audio export function. You can also use the WIST function to play wirelessly with a friend using two devices simultaneously.\n\n● Powerful functions that bring infinite possibilities to your grooves\nWe’ve packed maximum potential into this machine with eight types of powerful master effects featured on the upper-level models of the ELECTRIBE. This includes the ring modulation function of the ELECTRIBE-R and the cross-modulation function of the ELECTRIBE-R mkII. This app allows you to switch back and forth to choose between the two. It also includes the BEAT FLUTTER function that uses a proprietary randomizer to create fresh rhythms and the motion sequence function that remembers your knob movements. In addition, you can use an external USB-MIDI device such as the nanoPAD or nanoKONTROL for performance and control. There’s also support for the latest iOS technologies such as Inter-App Audio, Audiobus, Virtual MIDI, and iCloud.\n\nMore info at korg.com"

It's not a standalone player, but an extension that turns your existing audio player into a Sonos-like multiroom solution.\nAudio is captured by the server and routed to the connected clients. Several players can feed audio to the server in parallel and clients can be grouped to play the same audio stream.\nOne of the most generic ways to use Snapcast is in conjunction with the music player daemon (MPD) or Mopidy."

      "label": "Benny Greb, well known for his contributions to the drumming education community, shared the approach that he has taken personally to develop his sense of groove and improve his own timing on his instrument in his course “The Art and Science of Groove”. Now with the Gap Click app, everyone can practice his method easily with a simple-to-use app! \n\nUnlike standard metronomes which simply state the time, Gap Click helps you improve your sense of time. Gap Click is more than a metronome with a focus on improving your ability to keep tempo, become more aware and comfortable with off beat clicks and by that, become bullet proof and accurate with all notes of the subdivision.\n\nGAP CLICK\nBy scrolling through the numbers of bars and patterns you can quickly configure a “gap” of time in which the metronome drops out. When the “one” comes back around, will your playing still be in time? How long of a gap can you play through and still maintain solid tempo?\n\nMOVING CLICK\nNext you can experiment with all kinds of off-beat patterns in the Gap Bar which moves the click from the downbeat position to a different location. Can you still play your instrument and maintain the downbeat internally even when you hear the click sound on an off-beat?\n\nBoth the “click” and the “gap” portion supports a variety of different syncopated patterns allowing you the ability to practice in binary or ternary rhythms - with more or less safety net depending on your settings.\n\nFeatures\n• Ability to choose from a variety of different syncopated patterns and # of measures for both the standard \"click\" as well as the \"gap\"\n• Use the nostalgic click wheel to find the right tempo or tap to set your desired tempo from 10 to 300bpm\n• Standard quarter-note time signatures: 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4\n\nPersonalize\n• See visual feedback for each note or rest that is played\n• Accent beat 1 of each measure or turn accents off for a greater challenge\n• Flash the screen for a visual indication when switching from the \"click\" to the \"gap\"\n• Find your favorite sound from a variety of click samples hand-picked by Benny\n\nBuy Once, Use Forever\n• There are no In-App Purchases - a one time purchase includes all current and future features. \n\nTESTIMONIALS\nWhat professionals are saying about GAP CLICK:\n• \"The skills you can sharpen by using this app are integral for what it takes to be a professional drummer in any genre.\" - Matt Halpern\n• \"When I first opened the app, it made (simple) sense, without a tutorial.\" - Chris Coleman\n• \"This app helps you lock in the pocket on a whole different level.\" - Luke Holland\n• \"The Gap Click app is something that every drummer should have in their toolbox.\" - Jared Falk, Drumeo\n\nWhat our users are saying about GAP CLICK: \n• \"If you think you have good timing, this will really put you in your place.\"\n• \"Gone are the days of programming gap clicks!\"\n• \"I’ve never had so much fun being destroyed in my practice session.\"\n• \"This is by far the best money I’ve ever spent on a practice tool.\"\n\nABOUT BENNY GREB\nBenny Greb is one of the most respected drummers in the world today. Not only has he headlined nearly every major drum festival and toured with his clinics and drum camps worldwide, but he is also recognized as a composer and bandleader in his own band Moving Parts, which won him the renowned “ECHO Jazz” award - the German equivalent to The Grammys in jazz.\n\nBenny Greb published two of the most successful and critically acclaimed educational products, “The Language of Drumming” and “The Art and Science of Groove” and he has helped create many signature products available to drummers today.\n\nFind him online at https://www.bennygreb.de as well as on social media."

Minimise the friction for endless bouncing motion, as an innovative substitute for traditional LFOs and modulation. There was never a better reason for using a touchscreen for music.\n\nShimmer Feedback effect\nLike a shimmer reverb, except it feeds the processed audio back into the grain engine. This lets you create an endless loop of pitch-shifting spaciousness, turning even the simplest of sounds into massive woolly mammoths. \n\n- 3 Voice grain engine, each with an independent playhead\n- Filter inspired by the Oberheim Xpander, including its resonant Phase filter\n- Kinetic sliders and pads for playful interaction with the sound\n- Universal design (iPhone and iPad; iPad Air 2 or higher recommended)\n- Custom scales, unquantised mode and even Scala-import for microtonal experiments\n- Use WAVs, record audio or load the app as a live-processing audio effect\n- Real world tested as an instrument in numerous live performances by Hainbach"

      "label": "Visualize the fretboard, master scales and play through changes like a pro with intervallic functions! \n\n\n‣ Solo is a revolutionary practice tool designed by world renowned fusion guitarists Tom Quayle and David Beebee.\n\n‣ One of the biggest barriers to improvising on guitar is finding and mapping out the relevant chord tones and scales all over on the fretboard in real time.\n\n\nSolo is a highly focussed app for developing your note finding and visualization ability on the guitar. There is no time-based pressure and Solo reduces the cognitive load of having to choose which ‘notes/intervals’ to play. As you get quicker at finding these ‘notes’ you will conversely get better at choosing them whilst improvising. Players of all ability levels will reap huge benefits from practicing with Solo.\n\n\n‣ Using common progressions, Solo presents you with one chord symbol or scale at a time and asks you to find and play a series of notes based on their intervallic function.\n\n‣ Solo listens to the notes you play, analyzes them in real time, and doesn’t move on until you’ve correctly found each note by its intervallic function in the specified order.\n\n‣ This process builds strong fretboard visualization for the most powerful, efficient and malleable way to KNOW your way around the fretboard no matter how difficult the chord changes are. \n\n\nAs a unique and powerful ear training tool, Solo also develops your ability to not only visualize what you’re playing, but hear it in real time too.\n\nIf you know your note names but struggle to learn new scales, play through chord changes or find yourself stuck in pattern based playing, practicing diligently with Solo will be transformational for your knowledge of the fretboard and subsequently your ability to outline harmony when you improvise. \n\n\n‣ CHANGES PLAYING TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions over a series of chord changes based on common and popular chord progressions. Solo is programmed with all the knowledge behind the scenes to understand jazz and popular music harmony and will always pick appropriate intervallic functions based on the harmony of the progression. \n \n‣ SCALE TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions within scales on the fretboard. Solo includes all the modes of the Major, Melodic Minor, Harmonic Minor and Harmonic Major scales, plus pentatonic and symmetrical scales. Seeing and finding scale tones as intervallic functions will transform your ability to manipulate and improvise with scales in real time.    \n\n‣ TUTORIALS\nSolo also includes video tutorials to get you started with intervallic functions, how to find them on the fretboard, using Solo for ear training and how to get the most from your practice time with the app.\n\n\nNo registration or account required."

      "label": "The next evolution in music software. Powerful wavetable sound. \nThe next generation ELECTRIBE produces state-of-the-art dance music.\n\nThe ELECTRIBE series first appeared in 1999. Since then each generation has inherited the iconic, intuitive operability of the original while incorporating the most up-to-date sounds and styles.\n\nThe ease of use, accessibility, sound and musicality of the ELECTRIBE reach new heights in this latest software version which features a powerful wavetable sound source, a “Quick Input” sequencer and a convenient chord pad that allows you to play a chord with one finger. Even if you aren't a musical virtuoso, with ELECTRIBE Wave you can create state-of-the-art dance music like EDM, Future Bass, and Trap.\n\n• Powerful wavetable sound suitable for the latest in EDM\nELECTRIBE Wave has a sound wavetable featuring sounds widely used in the latest music creation. Unlike a PCM synth, the wavetable allows you to repeatedly play fragments of short waveforms, and change the waveform position during playback. By combining the wavetable (which features a rich variety of presets) with a powerful filter and two modulation units, you can create an infinite number of innovative and sharp sounds that cannot be produced using standard PCM synths. Even without a deep knowledge of synthesis techniques, the carefully selected parameters make it easy to craft your sound.\n\n• Improved user interface for quick composition\nThe familiar 16-step pad in the ELECTRIBE series enables speedy rhythm production. The ELECTRIBE Wave also features a new keyboard to play chords and scales. Even without musical knowledge, you can have fun making tracks without worrying about wrong notes. The sequencer features Groove, which can be used to breathe life into rhythm parts, as well as a special keyboard to enable smooth step input for synth parts on the graphical user interface.\n\n• Convenient chord pad that allows you to play a chord with one finger\nELECTRIBE Wave features a chord pad that allows you to play  chords with one finger. If you use the \"Fetch\" function, it will automatically extract the chords from the song that you are in in the middle of creating and assign those chords to the pad for fast and easy song creation. You can also easily assign and save your favorite chords. In addition you can use the arpeggiator to create new phrases!\n\n• Motion Sequence records and plays temporal changes in sounds and effects\nThe ELECTRIBE series introduced a powerful motion sequence function that remembers and reproduces the movements of the knobs. ELECTRIBE Wave now offers this function for the synthesizer/drum parts so you can create a flow of sound overflowing with originality. If you use the built in KAOSS PAD you can change the sound to drastically with a single fingertip, easily storing and reproducing  temporal changes. Remember the wave table POSITION to make real time minute changes to the sound performance.\n\n• Song mode can combine patterns into finished songs\nUse song mode to create a new track by simply arranging the order of existing patterns. Using only the ELECTRIBE Wave, you can take a song all the way from inspiration to completion. With audio file export, you can send a complete song or individual patterns to your favorite DAW, or upload to services like SoundCloud.\n\nMore info at korg.com"

      "label": "ChannelStrip is, as its name implies, a channel strip app and AUv3 plugin. With a gate, equalizer, and compressor, ChannelStrip can provide a solid and easy-to-use channel control for your iOS mixing needs. \n\nGATE: The gate is of our own design, and very smooth. With envelope that vary from nearly instantaneous to ludicrously long, you can use it for both basic noise control and more extreme tonal shaping. \n\nEQUALIZER: Modeled on the PEV, a famous German \"cartridge\" equalizer, the EQ in ChannelStrip is super useful for basic tone shaping. A very smooth and forgiving general-purpose EQ.\n\nCOMPRESSOR: The compressor in ChannelStrip is, at its heart, our Rough Rider model. We removed all the filtering from Rough Rider to make it cleaner, and changed the times to be more appropriate to general mixing duties. \n\nI/O: ChannelStrip has positive gain on both the input and output, to get your levels right. It also has a bit of a personality on the output stage if you drive it hard (with either or both the input and output gains). Nominally very clean, it picks up a bit of dirt with high levels just like a hardware console. Along with that, both mute (which mutes the input entirely) and bypass (which sends the inputs right to the outputs without passing the DSP stages) are available as automatable parameters. \n\nIn short, ChannelStrip is a general utility mixing tool, with a bit of character and a lot of usefulness. \n\n*** Requires iOS 9.3 ***\nWe _strongly_ recommend you use the AUv3 version. The standalone and IAA are provided as a courtesy, but ChannelStrip is designed as an AUv3 plugin, and prefers to be hosted in a DAW or modular host like GarageBand, AUM, Cubasis, nanoStudio, etc."

Even still supporting iPod Touch 5th Gen and iPhone 4S! \n\nWatch on YouTube (http://youtu.be/rvp4QinakL0) or \nread below about\n \n- a new intuitive and concise user interface\n- less taps for common tasks\n- home automation integration\n- and current limitions (don't skip them ;) )\n\nor come over to my homepage www.sonophone.net with much more information and screenshots available.\n\nThis application is not endorsed by or associated with Sonos, Inc. (which is why it is not free)\n\n◆◆◆ a new intuitiv and concise user interface ◆◆◆\nSonoPhone is designed to leverage the latest iOS design principles:\n- Tap or drag the player on the top and you'll find the players view to select a new player and with volume controls for all players. From here you can also enter Zone Management, where you can group and ungroup players with drag and drop.\n- Tap or drag the Track infos on the bottom and you'll be at the big covers screen\n- Drag the main menu from any place to the left or right to have instant access to playlist or shortcuts\n- volume + progress popups: when changing volume or progress of a song, you get popups telling you the actual values. Stop guessing your desired values today!\n\n◆◆◆ less taps for common tasks ◆◆◆\nSonoPad tries to optimize most often used tasks to have the least taps needed. In the end you are able to navigate and control your players much more fluently.\n\n- Touch To Play: are you sick of always beeing asked what to do when you tap a track or album? SonoPhone defaults to just starting an album or song. A long press still gives you access to all options - you can also change the tap default in the settings menu. Want to build a playlist fast? Just set the default to 'always add to end' and off you go ...\n- tap an album cover image and the whole album starts to play immediately \n- aggregated search: search results are collapsed into one view, so you see immediately in what category you have the best results, without switching back and forth\n- shortcuts to most used functions: drag the main menu to the right to get shortcut buttons for artist, albums, radio and musicservices.\n- you can control the volume of every player directly from the player selection screen. No need to switch players anymore.\n\n◆◆◆ home automation integration ◆◆◆\n- you can start SonoPhone with the 'sonophone://' URL from other remote Apps. Its also possible to hand over a return URL, then a new icon is displayed to return to the automation App.\nFurther option include to select a default player or default menu, you can read more about all option on my homepage sonophone.net\n\n◆◆◆ Limitations ◆◆◆\n\n- all music services except Google Music are supported\n- no playing of music stored on iPhone yet\n- no options to set alarms or sleep settings\n- no support for discontinued WD100 dock\n\n◆◆◆ Other stuff ◆◆◆\n- Sonos is registered trademark of Sonos, Inc."

      "label": "This metronome app is created by a musician for musicians. Almost all metronome apps boast about their accuracy, but users with sensitive hearing notice inaccurate beats all the time. It used to be impossible to create a perfectly accurate metronome on a mobile device. Despite the failure of other apps, perfect time is possible for TrueMetronome: its unique engine creates perfect beats with ABSOLUTE ZERO error. For this reason, TrueMetronome is the most accurate metronome app on any mobile platform.\n\nSound quality is the second issue for software metronomes. Serious musicians prefer a natural sound filled with overtones, but all metronome apps play short synthetic samples (so that the first sound stops completely before the next begins). Thus, you hear an artificial, dead sound. Moreover, the identical samples playing at the same frequency can drive any man crazy! TrueMetronome solves this problem thoroughly: all sounds are recorded from real metronomes, a beat does not affect the gradual decay of its predecessors, and each beat's sound is a little different from the others. All this contributes to the natural sound which is easier on your ears.\n\nFinally, an aesthetic, thoughtful interface is an important aspect of any application, and TrueMetronome pays particular attention to it. Creating an electronic metronome interface is simple, but TrueMetronome does not cut corners: it recreates the look and feel of a real mechanical metronome; every mark on the scale is labeled with a tempo mark, the deviation angle of the pendulum depends on the tempo, and the tempo is selected by dragging the weight.\n\nYou can adjust the tempo in 2 BPM (beats per minute) increments by dragging the digital weight. This restriction prevents a change of tempo from accidental touches, and when you need greater precision in the selection of the tempo, there are \"+\" and \"-\" buttons as well. On the lower part of the metronome, you can turn the bell on and off and select the number of beats per measure.\n\nTo start or to stop the beats, simply tap anywhere.\n\n-------------------------------------\nKey features\n-------------------------------------\n- Perfect beats with ZERO error (unparalleled!)\n- Natural sound without duplicate samples (unique to TrueMetronome!)\n- Realistic look and feel with particular attention to comfortable usability\n- Optional bell on the first beat of the measure\n- Selection from all known meters: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13\n- Tap tempo function\n- Skins"

      "label": "SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps. Studio Six Digital is dedicated to making the iPhone and Touch a professional audio and acoustics test device.\n\nCheck out our full line of professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the professional digital iPhone sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real-time analyzer,  FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the energy-time curve function, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time measurement, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for more great acoustical and audio test apps, have a look at AudioTools, our premier app for audio professionals."

It can even stream to a PC running Windows Media Player.\n\nIf you've heard all the hype about AirPlay and are missing out because you don't have an AppleTV, this app is for you!\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ HOW TO USE ◆◆◆◆◆\n\n√ Connect your iPod, iPhone or iPad to the same local network as your Xbox, PS3, PS4 or PC.\n\n√ Start AirMusic.\n\n√ For Xbox 360, navigate to the Xbox System Music Player and select your device from the list.\n\n√ For Xbox One, navigate to the Xbox One Media Player under Apps and select your device in the list.\n\n√ For PS3, navigate to the PS3 Music Menu and select your device in the list. If it shows nothing underneath, it probably means you selected the Movie or Photo menu instead.\n\n√ For PS4, locate the Media Player in the Store.\n\n√ When AirMusic detects a Chromecast device, an icon will appear in the AirMusic navigation bar. Tap on it to connect then select the music you want to stream.\n\n√ For a PC running Windows, start Windows Media Player, your iPhone Music will show under 'Other Libraries'.\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ IMPORTANT ◆◆◆◆◆\n\n• AirMusic is not compatible with Apple Music.\n\n• AirMusic is compatible with iCloud as long as songs have been downloaded onto your phone.

How bright is your sound? Is your timbre close to that of John Coltrane? (are you sure?)\n• Rate your sound according to a range of characteristics. This way you can also compare mouthpieces.\n• Work on your embouchure and see how it changes your sound. See how a very subtle change in your jaw placement changes your tone qualities.\n• Play a game! Try to emulate the sound of the best players in history. Select your hero, blow the requested note and try to get the best score.\n• Is there a tuner? Of course there is! You can even visualize your tuning stability from the beginning to the end of a long tone.\n• To help you in your daily routines, you'll also find a metronome, a recorder and drone.\n\nWho can use Sax-O-Meter?\n\n• Any saxophone player who wants to improve their sound and tone (and who doesn't?). From beginners struggling to set their tone foundation to professionals working on very specific aspects of their sound.\n• You can use it with any of the four main saxophones: Baritone, Tenor, Alto and Soprano.\n\nWhat Sax-O-Meter is NOT:\n\n• It will not replace your ears. Your ears will always be your best coach.\n• It will not do the work for you. If you want a magical shortcut to get the sound of Dexter Gordon without any work, then Sax-O-Meter cannot do anything for you!\n\nRefer to saxometer.com for more information and links to tone exercises!"

While a chord is played, related chords are highlighted so you can easily find chord sequences that progress smoothly. Once you found a nice chord sequence, you can drag and drop chords into your song to build your composition upon it.\nIf you want to start your song with a melody and find a suitable chord progression, you can do that just as well: select notes and tap the search icon to show chords that match your melody fragment. It's real fun to experiment, seeing how different harmonic contexts affect the perception of the same melodic fragment.\n\n\nCreate Beautiful Melodies and Flowing Chord Progressions\n\nIn the piano roll, notes that are in harmony as well as the chords' root notes are highlighted. This makes it super easy to create leads, arpeggios and basslines and to experiment with different chord voicings to let your chord progressions flowing nicely. \n\n\nIntuitive Editing\n\nA simple, yet feature rich and context-aware user interface helps you build up your ideas into whole songs:\nGroup sections into song parts and arrange them via drag and drop. \nDuplicate, copy and paste, playback selected notes.\n\n\nFile Export\n\nExport and share your creations with audio file export.\nEdit your song in other Apps with MIDI-file export.\n\n\nUse your Favorite Instrument Apps\n\nIt's just more fun to explore and create with those awesome Instrument Apps that are available in the App Store: Klimper supports Inter-App-Audio Instruments like Animoog and Model 15 as well as Audio Unit Instruments like Ripplemaker and Mersenne.\n\n\nVideo Tutorials\n\nThe included tutorial will help you getting started.

It features a unique \"fixed\" note wheel, which helps you to find the position of detected pitch easily. You can also use it as an electronic pitch pipe to tune by ear, matching the generated tones. \n\nIt is suitable for tuning acoustic or electric guitar and bass, ukulele, mandolin, banjo, bouzouki, bowed strings, woodwinds, brass, timpani and more. In fact, almost any instrument that sustains a tone can be tuned using insTuner. It supports Built-in Microphone as well as Line-in and other audio interface such as Apogee One.

Definitely 5 stars out of 5! GIGANTASTIVISSIMO…..R…A…Z !!!!!” – Patrick Moraz\n\n“That’s just nuts. You’re [Jordan] the best-guitarist-without-a-guitar of all time” – Joe Satriani\n\n“GeoShred is a breakthrough [musical instrument] for the iPad. Some might think it’s the best evidence yet that there has indeed been reverse engineering of alien technology, but if that’s the case, then aliens play guitar…and worship Jimi Hendrix.” – Craig Anderton Harmony Central\n\n---\n\nWe are dedicated to offering the highest level of musical instrument experience for our customers worldwide.

      "label": "NanoStudio 2 is a powerful music production environment for synthesis, sampling, arranging, editing and mixing. It’s the successor to the original NanoStudio, an app held in high regard by musicians for many years for its usability, quality and productivity.  \n\nNanoStudio 2 builds upon the same design principles as its predecessor and introduces a huge range of extra features.  An all-new audio engine delivers truly professional sound quality, highly optimized to handle complex projects with large numbers of instruments and effects.\n\nNanoStudio 2 hosts external Audio Unit (AUv3) instruments and audio/MIDI effects.  A library of all your AU instruments and presets is maintained so they’re tagged, searchable and just as accessible as NanoStudio’s own internal instruments.\n\nObsidian is NanoStudio’s built-in synth.  It has 3 oscillators with 32 note polyphony and 7 different synthesis methods including analogue, wavetable, FM, multi-saw and phase distortion.  It also supports samples and multisamples which may be split by note or velocity. Obsidian has 18 different filter types, including resonant analogue, super clean digital, formant, comb and waveshaping. Nearly every parameter can be modulated via the synth’s 5 envelopes, 5 LFOs and 10 configurable macro controllers, and modulation connections can be assigned with just a few taps.  300 factory patches are supplied with macros set up and ready to go.  It’s easy to create your own patches and there are many more professionally produced patches available as IAP.\n\nSlate is NanoStudio’s second built-in instrument, a sample/synthesis-based performance pad which makes it easy to tap out drum beats.  Slate comes with 500 quality factory samples ranging from multisampled acoustic drums with natural variations through to cutting-edge electronic percussion and effects. 50 factory kits are include, and it’s easy to construct your own drum kits using the factory samples or your own. Slate can also be used with samples of just about anything: vocals, guitar riffs, synth pads – you name it.\n\nThere are powerful editors for song arrangement, MIDI, automation and samples.  All share a consistent user interface so you’ll be up to speed with them and making music in no time.\n\nA fully-featured sequencer supports tempo and time signature tracks (including tempo ramps) and Ableton Link.\n\nEverything’s brought together by a mixer with unlimited tracks, track grouping and audio/MIDI sends.  Tracks may have an unlimited number of insert effects with 11 built-in effects to choose from including reverb, sidechain compressor/expander, EQ with spectrum analysis, look-ahead limiter, delay, exciter, chorus, flanger and phaser.  You can add AU audio/MIDI effects to the chain and use them just like an internal effect.\n\nThere are many mixdown options available with quality settings up to 32 bit/96kHz and support for file formats including wav, aiff, ogg and M4A.  You can mixdown track stems in a single operation or select just a region of the song - great for resampling.\n\nNanoStudio supports Audiobus and has many options for file sharing via the iOS Files app, Dropbox, AudioShare, iTunes File Sharing, AirDrop, email, WebDAV and importing music from your iTunes library.\n\nDevelop your initial musical ideas through to a final master with an intuitive workflow designed to get things done."

      "label": "*** PLEASE READ **** \nEnso is an AudioUnit V3 plugin; it requires an AUv3 host like Cubasis, Garageband, AUM, etc. THERE IS NO STANDALONE APP; it is only a container for the AUv3.\n\nAn architecturally unique and sonically characterful looping toolkit for producers and live performers, inspired by both modern looper pedals and vintage tape-based setups, Enso combines elegant and intuitive UI design with a deep but accessible feature set and stellar sound quality.\n\nEnso’s operation will be immediately familiar to users of hardware looper pedals or plugins such as Ableton Live’s bundled Looper. Start playback of the host DAW, hit Enso’s record button and capture your instrumental performance into a loop of whatever length you like, up to ten minutes (five minutes on iOS). Then, without stopping playback, overdub further passes to create layered grooves, complex harmonic textures, or dense, evolving soundscapes.\n\nBeyond those basics, though, Enso takes software looping into new territory. Two Overdub modes configure the plugin for conventional looper pedal behaviour or Frippertronics-style ‘dual tape deck’ manoeuvres, affecting the handling of the Feedback parameter for an endless range of layering possibilities; and up to four Sectors can be effortlessly defined, each with its own start and end points, for on-the-fly rearrangement of the loop.\n\nWith Enso, time and motion become truly fluid, as speed and direction are handled completely independently for playback and recording, the ‘through-zero’ bipolar Speed controls smoothly transitioning from forwards to backwards, and vice versa, in real time. Want to record forwards at half speed, while simultaneously playing the buffered loop in reverse at 1.25x? Of course you do…\n\nOnboard tape-style saturation, filtering and chorus effects bring dirt, frequency-shaping and stereo thickening to the party; and a comprehensive MIDI assignment system makes it a snap to set your MIDI pedal or button controller up for operation of all Enso’s buttons and switches. With its animated play and record heads, meanwhile, the looping waveform display provides a clean, clear visual representation of the potentially mind-bending temporal acrobatics taking place, letting you get a handle on exactly what’s happening at a glance.\n\nGiving you everything you need for limitlessly creative looping, on stage and in the studio, Enso is one of Audio Damage’s most beautifully realized plugins yet, and an empowering addition to any musician’s arsenal of effects"

If you're looking for that George Michael/\"Careless Whispers\" sound... look no further!\n\nThis is your digital solution to sax saturation. Bring your sax levels to 11... Try Sensual Sax today!\n\nFEATURES:\n- MIDI input / output\n- IAA\n- Audio Unit 3\n- Audiobus\n- True legato sampling for realistic note transitions\n- Three sets of articulations\n\nControls include REVERB (with controllable AMOUNT and ROOM SIZE settings); VIBRATO (with dedicated DEPTH slider); DELAY (with control over AMOUNT and TIME); and switchable LEGATO, SUSTAIN, and STACCATO playing styles using the onscreen lockable keyboard (switchable to DOUBLE KEYBOARD for further flexibility). It goes without saying that it is compatible with all major iOS-based DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations), working with Apple’s Audio Unit Extensions technology — that brings the Audio Units system-level full plug-in architecture model (that was previously only available to third-party developers like Embertone in OS X) to iOS — as well as Inter-App Audio and Audiobus for full communication with the outside musical world.\n\n==========\nFounded by composer/orchestrator Alex Davis and composer/sound designer Jonathan Churchill, Embertone has been producing next-level virtual instruments since 2012. Its mission is simple: sample lots of great instruments, and bring them to market to inspire awesome new music! The co-founders seriously love what they do, admiring the likes of Tonehammer, Sample Modeling, and Sonic Couture — companies that have led the way to this new age of deeply-sampled virtual instruments, and aim to move that tradition forward by finding new ways to capture the essence of an instrument and program it in an intuitive and responsive package... and, of course, offer it to the composing community at an atttractive price! As the go-to company for musicians looking for realistic and fun virtual instruments since releasing the free Intimate Strings LITE for Native Instruments’ industry-standard KONTAKT (4.2.4+), the full-blown Friedlander Violin subsequently became the flagship solo product for the KONTAKT PLAYER platform while setting the production standard for future realistic-sounding releases."

Pumphouse to the rescue! \n\nPumphouse is a simple and excellent compressor (taken straight from our RoughRider 2 codebase) coupled with a step sequencer driving an envelope generator. In this manner, you can sidechain-compress your pads or bassline against a 1-measure pattern, no other inputs required. \n\nWith an easy-to-understand interface, Pumphouse is a quick method for getting That Sound. \n\nPumphouse requires transport information to work. Please note that some iOS AUv3 hosts do not have a transport. (At this time, Auria Pro that we're aware of.) There is an Inter-App Audio version supplied, but it also requires transport info. \n\nWe have tested and approve the AUv3 with AudioBus 3, Cubasis, GarageBand, AUM, ModStep, Zmors Modular, and Beatmaker 3."

      "label": "Innovative Practice Tools brings you Dr. Drone, a simple, affordable and powerful practice tool. Dr. Drone gives you the freedom to create your own bass lines, chord sequences and drone tracks and set them to a metronome. It opens whole new avenues of practicing for professionals, pedagogues, ensembles and students. It will become your favorite tool for developing great intonation and stability. \n\n- Want to prep for a specific piece? Enter a bass line to your favorite tune, or enter a melody using either note names, scale degrees or solfege syllables in an intuitive entry pad. \n- Need more time to lock in each pitch? Vary the tempo between 40 and 500 BPM (because why not?), set each drone from 1 to 60 seconds, or select \"Tap to Advance\" Mode to tune along at your own pace. Heads up: \"Tap to Advance\" is compatible with your favorite Bluetooth pedal, or anything that can send arrow or enter key signals to your device!\n- Trying to expand your range and stability? Dr. Drone will repeat sequences and can transpose them in a number of patterns (transpose the sequence around the Circle of 4ths, move up chromatically, etc.)\n- Want to practice tuning within a chord? Add a Perfect 5th, Major 3rd or Minor 3rd to your drone (using just intonation) to practice fitting your sound right into the harmony.\n- Want to tune to custom chords? Create your own voicings with up to 10 pitches in \"Chord Entry\" mode.\n- Toggle between Just Temperament and Equal Temperament.\n- Got some 'go-to' exercises or warm-ups? Save and organize your tunes along with their settings for repeated use. \n- Need to practice for your next orchestra gig that requires A443, or your next baroque service that calls for A420? Easily adjust your Concert Pitch A to be ready for any intonation situation.\n- And if you really want a challenge, Dr. Drone includes a feature that allows you to randomly silence beats for the ultimate test of time and pitch independence.\n\nFrom classical to jazz and from pop to gospel, this app is perfect for serious musicians and music educators who want to have a steady and flexible reference drone. Its sleek design, friendly features, and video tutorials will have you using it like a pro in no time. Welcome to the 21st century of intonation practice with Dr. Drone!"

      "label": "MelodyBud is an AUv3 MIDI sequencer with great generative sequencing capabilities. Instead of a traditional sequencer, you can randomise your notes, velocity, octave, and gate length of your steps, add ratchets and glide to make it more interesting!\n\nOne of the most powerful feature of MelodyBud is \"parameter-locking\". With parameter-locks, you can set a step's randomisation values individually. That lets you create richer melodies. For entering the parameter-locking mode, you can simply tap a step's number on the top of the sequencer. The step and the control knobs turn orange when you enter the parameter-locking mode. If you edit a control when you are in the parameter-lock mode, the sequencer will execute that configuration for that step instead of the global configuration. You can tap the step's number again for exiting the parameter-lock mode.\n\nYou can work in more than 40 scales, you can even change them while the sequencer is running. With the AUv3 plugin, you can change them with the AU parameters and even modulate/automate them along with other parameters.\n\nThe standalone version supports Ableton Link which lets you in-sync with other Ableton Link enabled apps. \n\nMelodyBud is a MIDI app and it does not produce any audio or sound on its own. You need to route its MIDI out to another audio app in order to sequence it and getting sound off of it."

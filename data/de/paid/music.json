Get your ideas out or play until inspiration hits using a selection of Ableton Live’s drum kits, synths and melodic instruments. Or create your own sound palette by recording the sounds around you into Note’s sampler instruments using your phone’s microphone. \n\nIf you want to take your ideas further, use Ableton Cloud to send your projects to Live (version 11.2.5 or later) without leaving the app. Open your project from Live’s browser, then keep working – you can edit all your MIDI notes, and all your samples and sounds from Note are exactly the same.\n\n\nBegin with a beat: \n• Choose from 56 Drum Sampler kits\n• Tap out a beat using the 16-pad grid\n• Quantize your beat to fix any loose timing\n• Nudge notes to correct mistakes\n• Add more layers of rhythm\n• Create beat repetitions with Note Repeat\n• Change parameters to shape your sound\n• Experiment with effects \n\nStart with a melody:\n• Choose from 261 synth sounds and 36 Melodic Sampler instruments\n• Play your melody or chord progression with either the 25-pad grid or the piano roll\n• Set a key and scale to get instantly harmonic results, or leave your options open\n• Overdub more layers of harmony\n• Change parameters to shape your sound\n• Add effects to experiment with sound design\n\nSample your environment:\n• Create your own kits by recording percussive sounds into Note’s Drum Sampler \n• Record tonal sounds to create your own Melodic Sampler instruments\n• Manipulate your samples by cutting, filtering or repitching them\n• Shape or transform your sounds with effects\n\nCapture improvisations:\n• Play something, then tap the Capture button to keep it\n• Play at the tempo that feels comfortable and Note will detect it\n• Note will recognize the length of the phrase\n• A loop is created automatically\n• Quantize it, add to it, or change the sound\n\nCreate variations:\n• Note features a grid-based Session View layout\n• Double your loops to create variation within clips\n• Duplicate your clips and create different versions of your ideas\n• Create eight tracks with up to eight clips on eight scenes\n• Try different layer combinations and song structures \n• Export your work in Session View as an audio file to listen and share"

Minimise the friction for endless bouncing motion, as an innovative substitute for traditional LFOs and modulation. There was never a better reason for using a touchscreen for music.\n\nShimmer Feedback effect\nLike a shimmer reverb, except it feeds the processed audio back into the grain engine. This lets you create an endless loop of pitch-shifting spaciousness, turning even the simplest of sounds into massive woolly mammoths. \n\n- 3 Voice grain engine, each with an independent playhead\n- Filter inspired by the Oberheim Xpander, including its resonant Phase filter\n- Kinetic sliders and pads for playful interaction with the sound\n- Universal design (iPhone and iPad; iPad Air 2 or higher recommended)\n- Custom scales, unquantised mode and even Scala-import for microtonal experiments\n- Use WAVs (or other audio files), record audio or load the app as a live-processing audio effect\n- Real world tested as an instrument in numerous live performances by Hainbach\n- Offers light mode and dark mode UI"

      "label": "Benny Greb, well known for his contributions to the drumming education community, shared the approach that he has taken personally to develop his sense of groove and improve his own timing on his instrument in his course “The Art and Science of Groove”. Now with the Gap Click app, everyone can practice his method easily with a simple-to-use app! \n\nUnlike standard metronomes which simply state the time, Gap Click helps you improve your sense of time. Gap Click is more than a metronome with a focus on improving your ability to keep tempo, become more aware and comfortable with off beat clicks and by that, become bullet proof and accurate with all notes of the subdivision.\n\nGAP CLICK\nBy scrolling through the numbers of bars and patterns you can quickly configure a “gap” of time in which the metronome drops out. When the “one” comes back around, will your playing still be in time? How long of a gap can you play through and still maintain solid tempo?\n\nMOVING CLICK\nNext you can experiment with all kinds of off-beat patterns in the Gap Bar which moves the click from the downbeat position to a different location.

      "label": "Alle Texte aus dem Gesangbuch der Neuapostolischen Kirche.\n\nDie Gesangbuch-App bietet allen Musikinteressierten, Dirigenten und Dienstleitern die Möglichkeit, die Texte aus dem Gesangbuch schnell und einfach nachzuschlagen. \n\nDie als 64-Bit-Anwendung programmierte Version 3 greift Bewährtes aus den Vorversionen auf und kombiniert dieses mit intuitiver Bedienung und neuen Funktionen. Dabei wurden gewohntes Nutzerverhalten und aktuelle Displaygrößen berücksichtigt. Und – das Beste zum Schluss – die App kann optional mit zusätzlichen Features ausgestattet werden.\n\nGrundfunktionen:\n\nDie Startseite zeigt nun neben dem Feld für die Nummerneingabe die ersten Textzeilen des gesuchten Liedes. Alternativ lassen sich Lieder über die Rubrikensuche oder über die Volltextsuche auffinden. Standardmäßig findet die Suche auch Wortteile und berücksichtigt bei mehreren Wörtern die Reihenfolge nicht. Die exakte Suche in Anführungszeichen, z. B. \"Der Herr ist\" liefert dagegen nur Fundstellen mit der genau übereinstimmenden Buchstabenfolge innerhalb der Anführungszeichen. Suchergebnislisten können nach Relevanz oder numerisch sortiert werden.\n\nAuf Smartphones wird das gefundene Lied angetippt, der vollständige Liedtext öffnet sich in einem neuen Fenster. Die gezeigte Schriftgröße kann geräteunabhängig in jedem Liedtext vergrößert/verkleinert werden (25-stufig). Zudem lässt sich der Liedtext auf Wunsch negativ darstellen. Die gewählte Einstellung wird beibehalten, bis Sie eine andere Schriftgröße/-darstellung auswählen. Wird das Smartphone bei kleinem Schriftgrad quer gehalten, erscheint der Liedtext im Vollbildmodus und die Schriftgröße wechselt automatisch in einen etwas größeren Schriftgrad. \nDas ohnehin größere Display von Tablets zeigt alle Informationen zu einem Lied mitsamt der Nummern-/Rubrikensuche komfortabel auf nur einer Seite. Bei Antippen öffnet sich der Liedtext im Vollbildmodus.\n\nPremium-Paket mit zusätzlichen Funktionen:\n\nZu einem besonderen Gottesdienst sollen bestimmte Lieder einstudiert werden? Sie möchten dem Dienstleiter eine Liste der Lieder zuschicken, die Sie selbst als Orgelspieler oder der Chor sicher beherrschen? Oder möchten Sie einen misslungenen Liedvortrag in einer der nächsten Proben aufgreifen? Ihnen gefällt das im Gottesdienst vorgetragene Lied und Sie möchten sich unbedingt die Nummer merken?\n\nDas Premium-Paket bietet Dirigenten, Organisten, Dienstleitern und natürlich auch allen anderen Interessierten nützliche Funktionen, um Lieder zu markieren und Liedlisten bei Bedarf mit anderen zu teilen:\n\n- Suchergebnisse nach diversen Kriterien filtern und sortieren\n- Individuelle Notizen zu Liedern erfassen\n- Termine von Chorproben & Gottesdiensten eintragen, in denen das Lied gesungen wurde (oder werden soll)\n- Persönliche Bewertungen von Liedern erfassen (3-stufig)\n- Lieder als Favorit kennzeichnen\n- Premium-Einträge zu Liedern per E-Mail versenden\n\nDas Premium-Paket wird innerhalb der App per In-App-Kauf angeboten.\n\nSonstige Hinweise:\n\nHörbeispiele oder Musiknoten können aus rechtlichen Gründen nicht in die App eingebunden werden.\n\nIcons: www.icons8.com"

      "label": "Thick basses, buttery leads, feathery pads — Trooper is a total synth explosion that crams it all and more in a neat little package. It sounds HUGE, yet tweaks easy. It’s coated in analog “fat,” yet bursts with tonal surprises nestled across its controls. Get ready for an all-out sonic assault, because Trooper is here and it's our meanest, beastliest, user-friendliest synth yet!\n\nMany of Trooper’s parameters are meant to interact and meld together in novel ways. For example, the oscillator volumes —beyond just acting as mere blend knobs— vary the characteristics of the basic signal depending on how far they are “pushed\". The emphasis is on providing warm and round basic tones with lots of variable harmonic content.\n\nThe primary oscillators are backed by an audible LFO that is both a sound source and a wide frequency range modulator. This lets FM-based sounds to combine with traditional waveforms. A pink/white noise generator helps out pads and percussions, and insidiously changes tonality when added in small amounts.\n\nA new filter implementation complements the pugnacity of the signal generators. In its middish settings, the resonance can be characterized as “throaty.” The filter is capable of self-oscillating, and can be controlled via the keyboard. The mated ADSR envelope is shaped to provide tonal ‘immediacy’ and smooth frequency shifts. The amount knob has a wide range that changes the feel and shape of the envelope, especially when pushed above the mid-level.\n\nThe output stage features a virtual VCA that imparts tones colloquially termed as “fat”. Extra modulation is provided by a non-audible LFO and a dedicated envelope. The LFO offers numerous wave shapes, BPM syncing, and key tracking. Its output is controllable via the mod wheel, velocity, or aftertouch. \n\nThe Esprit parameter helps deploy some of the Trooper “special sauce.” Highly interactive with the stages preceding it, Esprit is known to be handy in tightening up bass tones, and in adding the \"je nais se quois” to presets at large. The Get6 parameter is a one-touch ticket to big, mix-filling synth sounds. So whenever you’re lost in an empty mix…it’s got your six.  \n\nThe arpeggiator inspires rhythms with five algorithms, variable note value, octave range, and gate. The “Texturizer\" purveys a wide range of modulation effects that include chorus, flanging, variable comb, resonant delay, and stereo imaging. The BPM-syncable two-tap delay has time and feedback controls per channel, and is tuned a little darker than our usual offerings. Trooper can run in monophonic or polyphonic mode, the latter providing up to 12 voices. Legato is available in either mode. \n\nThe robust MIDI implementation also includes MPE support, and the synth is able to I/O MIDI performance data. The “MagTouch” virtual controller lets you to play and record (in AUv3 hosts so enabled) over the MPE protocol. MIDI learn is made easy via a visual interface, and users can save, patch-link, and share MIDI CC maps. Bluetooth MIDI input is also supported.\n\nThe AUv3 implementation lets you to run multiple instances of Trooper in DAWs. Trooper’s fluid UI accommodates a wide variety of screen sizes and view configurations. Feature navigation is designed to be nonintrusive so that parameters can be accessed easily. The iPad implementation supports portrait layout, so that pretty much all is on one screen.\n\nIncluded are over 250 presets that range from deep basses to weird so-and-so's, stopping by many other sounds along the way. The powerful YPAT2 system helps you save, catalog, and share presets with ease.\n\nThe standalone app provides a “Tapedeck” to record, save, and share your ideas on the quick. It features a built-in looper, and a metronome with configurable time signature. The standalone also features tap tempo, and MIDI clock syncing. DSP is in high resolution 64-bit, with native processing at up to 96kHz."

      "label": "AltiSpace is a convolution reverb app with advanced controls that provides realistic sounding natural acoustic space or vintage reverb devices for any track or mix.\n\nA convolution reverb takes a captured sample (called an impulse response) from a real-world space or real hardware and uses this to digitally simulate the reverberation of that space or device down to the last detail and nuance. Because it is sampled, not synthesized, convolution reverb is known for its stunning realism, and it is widely considered to be the best type of reverb. However, unlike the more common algorithmic reverbs, convolution reverbs usually does not have much control over the reverberation process.\n\nBut AltiSpace, in addition to the ability to load your own impulse response files and a built-in library of the most interesting vintage reverb device presets, has advanced settings such as EQ, gate, ducking, modulation and more. You can change the original impulse response parameters to something completely new and then save it as a new preset.\n\nThis app has an easy-to-use user interface, where all the main controls are located on the single screen, and it is ready to use right out of the box, even without additional settings. And at the same time, you can easily change the parameters of the impulse responses from the built-in library to create your own sound.\n\nApp features:\n\n- Ability to import your own impulse response files.\n- A large built-in library of presets from the most interesting hardware reverbs.\n- Convenient preset manager with the ability to group and search presets.\n- Presets can be marked as favorites for display in the favorites group.\n- Supports MIDI controllers (also Bluetooth) with learn or manually assign mode.\n- Reverb can work with a stereo or mono input and convert it to stereo.\n- Add dynamic noise before reverb for a more natural sound.\n- The gate allows you to turn on the reverb when the threshold is exceeded.\n- The ducking allows you to turn off the reverb when the threshold is exceeded.\n- Sets the minimum reverb level for Gate and Ducking modes.\n- Equalizer with high and low cut filters in chain before or after reverb.\n- Changing the time (length) of the current impulse response.\n- Possibility to set a fade out point for a smooth end of the impulse response.\n- Sets the pre-delay time of the signal before reverb.\n- Experimental feature to change the pitch of the impulse response.\n- Amplifying early or late reflections.\n- Adjusts the stereo image before the reverb.\n- Haas effect for adding stereo space to a mono signal.\n- Sets the depth and frequency of modulation the signal before reverb.\n- Mixing dry / wet signal and adjusting the output level.\n- Input and output level meters.\n- Indicators of possible input clipping for standalone.\n- Prevents any output clipping for standalone.\n- Built-in full description of all controls.\n\nDemo:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBHxgjkGCoU\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLNi9wHaGew\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3RPopor9gI\n\nAltiSpace is a universal application for iOS and macOS. It can work on iPhone and iPad as well as Mac / MacBook with M1 chip (and later). AltiSpace works on iPhone and iPad standalone, as an Audio Unit or Inter-App Audio module, and supports Audiobus and Ableton Link. On macOS, AltiSpace can works both as a standalone application and as an Audio unit (AUv3) with DAWs and audio unit hosts like Ableton Live, Logic Pro, GarageBand, MainStage, Cockos Reaper, Plogue Bidule, and other hosts that support AUv3 plugins. All application features are available on iOS and macOS, including MIDI support (with a midi learn option) and audio unit parameters. AltiSpace has a built-in detailed description of all parameters also available as PDF file on application site.\n\nYou can find more information on AltiSpace and other experimental and audio processing apps at:\n\nhttps://motion-soundscape.blogspot.com"

      "label": "Metronome Touch. Style of pendulum.\n\nMetronome Touch is created with one objective: to design a classic metronome with a unique style, so we combined a precise pendulum, perfected accuracy, and realistic interaction. Made of aluminum and glass, Metronome Touch proves a huge statement: It is as exclusive as your device. Launching Metronome Touch, your device will become a metronome.\n\nAnyone can try to make a metronome app, but success only comes when listening to customers. That's why Metronome Touch centers around functions that musicians are looking for: The ability to tap a beat, use customizable presets to save your favorite sets (bpm, time signature and accentuation), and multiple useful ways of adjusting the bpm. Metronome Touch even goes far beyond that: Neither analog nor digital metronomes can synchronize pendulums. But Metronome Touch can. This opens completely new ways when practicing, performing on stage or doing studio recordings.\n\nShould you be teaching students, they can follow your lesson more accurately while concentrating on their own devices synchronized with Metronome Touch. You will gain your student's attention when using this outstanding technology. If you have ever been on stage with bad acoustics, you will love Metronome Touch: It will provide every single band member with a perfect steady and synchronized rhythm on stage. Even when recording a song in separate soundproofed rooms, Metronome Touch keeps you in perfect sync.\n\nEasily adjust Metronome Touch to your likes and needs with the light or dark design - relying on absolute clear vector-based display graphics  - and many well chosen professional metronome sounds.\n\nMetronome Touch is constantly being developed further to ensure the highest customer satisfaction.\n\nFEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY\n\n• Precise engine \nA completely new developed engine makes this app one of the most precise pendulum metronomes available on the App Store. Highest accuracy is supported on all iOS devices.\n\n• Ableton Link synchronization technology\n Metronome Touch was the first metronome worldwide offering pendulum synchronization on iOS devices. You can keep band members‘ metronomes or a whole orchestra in sync.\nAbleton Link provides new ways of practicing together or in a group. \n\n • Memory function\n There is an infinite number of customizable presets to save your favorite sets of bpm, time signature and accentuation.\n\n • Numerical entry\nUsing bpm display let you directly enter tempo values from 20 up to 999 bpm.\n\n• Tap2bpm \nUse the tap field that will interpret your finger taps as bpm.\n\n• Beat count and accentuation\n Choose a beat count from 1 up to 12 beats and free customizable accentuation.\n\n• Styles and sounds\n Customize Metronome Touch to your likes and needs. Choose between dark and light design as well as chosen professional metronome sounds.\n\n• Retina display\n Metronome Touch comes with a complete set of vector graphics for all display sizes and looks simply perfect on your device.\n\nFor more informations, app videos, faq's and pictures go to » www.cu4uc.com"

      "label": "Sharpen your sense of time! liveBPM is the tempo monitoring tool for drummers, bands and DJs. It detects music and beats via the microphone and continuously displays the current tempo in beats per minute (BPM). It is easy to use and delivers high-quality results while being energy efficient.\n\n\n=== What users said about liveBPM ===\n\n\nJohn Walden, freelance musician and music technology journalist at musicappblog.com:\n\"There are three obvious applications for the app. First, it would make a brilliant practice tool for a drummer, allowing them to monitor just how good they are at keeping a steady tempo without the aid of a click track to guide them. Second, sat beside your kit during a performance, it would allow you to judge just how well you are hitting the ideal tempo for each song in your set. It’s not just drummers that can benefit for liveBPM as the third use is in mapping the tempo – and any tempo changes – in commercial recordings. While this is useful for drummers, it is instructional for almost any musician.\" \n\n\nJonLong:\n\"I used this at my last band practice and wasn't expecting it to work. I couldn't believe how quickly and accurately it started tracking the bpm, even despite the very loud volume of our music.\"\n\n\nPocketDrummer82:\n\"I am a professional drummer and I have been looking for something like this for years! Unless your playing with backing tracks or recording, Playing with a Click is too Mechanical. This app allows the tempo to breathe, and its like a little angel on your shoulder telling you the band is speeding up or slowing down. It is totally worth the money.\"\n\n\nChris Walther:\n\"I have used this about five gigs now and have quit using my previous tempo meter. I used both for a few gigs to test the accuracy. Dead on. Thanks! Every drummer should use this.\"\n\n\nmagrec:\n\"This has been very helpful for recording. thanks!\"\n\n\n\n\n=== Detailed Description ===\n\n\nThis is a tool designed for professional use:\n- Well-tested beat detection engine guarantees trustworthiness\n- Can handle most genres\n- Produces results accurate to within 0.1 BPM under the following conditions:\n-- The tempo is constant or almost constant\n-- Strong impulses are defining the beat (drums, accentuated rhythm instruments like bass/guitar, etc.)\n\n\nFurther features:\n- Tempo curve shows the development of tempo over time \n- Multiple zoom modes to show last 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20 or 30 minutes\n- Advanced audio spectrum analysis via FFT\n- More accessible and usually more accurate than BPM counters that function through tapping\n- Low battery drain thanks to high performance code and efficient algorithms\n\n\nUsing it as a musician:\n- Use it as an objective tempo reference like a metronome\n- It actually has several advantages over a metronome:\n-- You are not tied to a click, giving you more flexibility\n-- Helps you use tempo changes to enhance your musical expression\n-- With blind tests, it can massively improve your timing confidence, which is especially important if you are in a tempo leading role (e.g. drummer)\n- Discover how/whether your favorite artists use tempo changes\n- Measure and improve your time-keeping skills\n- Identify slowdowns and speedups while practicing your instrument\n- Always be in control of the tempo during your live gigs and rehearsals\n\n\nControls:\n- Power Button: For freezing the tempo curve and minimizing battery drain\n- Clear Button: Clears the tempo curve\n- Slider: Adjusts the target tempo range (i.e. 80-160 BPM)\n- Zoom Buttons: Switch between zoom modes for the tempo curve. (2-30 minutes)\n\n\nNote: \n- You can check and improve the detection by clapping loud to the beat. Also, results can be improved by plugging in a suitable external microphone.\n- You can support my work by rating it on the App Store.

      "label": "Visualize the fretboard, master scales and play through changes like a pro with intervallic functions! \n\n\n‣ Solo is a revolutionary practice tool designed by world renowned fusion guitarists Tom Quayle and David Beebee.\n\n‣ One of the biggest barriers to improvising on guitar is finding and mapping out the relevant chord tones and scales all over on the fretboard in real time.\n\n\nSolo is a highly focussed app for developing your note finding and visualization ability on the guitar. There is no time-based pressure and Solo reduces the cognitive load of having to choose which ‘notes/intervals’ to play. As you get quicker at finding these ‘notes’ you will conversely get better at choosing them whilst improvising. Players of all ability levels will reap huge benefits from practicing with Solo.\n\n\n‣ Using common progressions, Solo presents you with one chord symbol or scale at a time and asks you to find and play a series of notes based on their intervallic function.\n\n‣ Solo listens to the notes you play, analyzes them in real time, and doesn’t move on until you’ve correctly found each note by its intervallic function in the specified order.\n\n‣ This process builds strong fretboard visualization for the most powerful, efficient and malleable way to KNOW your way around the fretboard no matter how difficult the chord changes are. \n\n\nAs a unique and powerful ear training tool, Solo also develops your ability to not only visualize what you’re playing, but hear it in real time too.\n\nIf you know your note names but struggle to learn new scales, play through chord changes or find yourself stuck in pattern based playing, practicing diligently with Solo will be transformational for your knowledge of the fretboard and subsequently your ability to outline harmony when you improvise. \n\n\n‣ CHANGES PLAYING TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions over a series of chord changes based on common and popular chord progressions. Solo is programmed with all the knowledge behind the scenes to understand jazz and popular music harmony and will always pick appropriate intervallic functions based on the harmony of the progression. \n \n‣ SCALE TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions within scales on the fretboard. Solo includes all the modes of the Major, Melodic Minor, Harmonic Minor and Harmonic Major scales, plus pentatonic and symmetrical scales. Seeing and finding scale tones as intervallic functions will transform your ability to manipulate and improvise with scales in real time.    \n\n‣ TUTORIALS\nSolo also includes video tutorials to get you started with intervallic functions, how to find them on the fretboard, using Solo for ear training and how to get the most from your practice time with the app.\n\n\nNo registration or account required."

      "label": "With SonoSequencr you can create individual sequences to perform recurring tasks with just one click.\n\nIf you have multiple Sonos devices and want to play a radio station on all of them, it takes some time to set this up. With SonoSequencr, all you have to do is open the app and tap your previously created sequence.\nYou can lock your iOS device or use another app while your sequence is running in the background.\nOf course, you can also start it from the widget, Apple Watch or using Flic Buttons.\n\nHere are some examples:\n- Group kitchen and dining room, set volume to 5, start a radio station and set a sleep timer to 2 hours\n- Switch your Playbar in the living room to the TV input, set the volume to 40, add dining room and set the equalizer settings for both devices to neutral\n- Disable the subwoofer and enable voice enhancement + night mode on the Playbar in the living room\n- Set the equalizer settings for all your devices to specific values\n- Disable touch on speaker and enable status light for all your devices\n- Set the volume of the kitchen and living room to the same value as in the dining room\n- Make an announcement with your individual text in the children's room\n- etc...\n\nEach of these examples, created once, requires only one tap in the widget or on your Apple Watch.\n\nSonoSequencr also includes a restricted mode. This allows you to restrict control to specific devices, among other things.\n\n\nUsing an optional in-app purchase, you can also start sequences at specific times or via external triggers like IFTTT. Of course, this requires that the iOS device is on the same network as your Sonos devices at the time. For intensive use of external triggers, it is recommended to run SonoSequencr in 'server mode'. In this mode, SonoSequencr is always running in the foreground on a dedicated iOS device. SonoSequencr still supports iOS9.\n\nThere are many more features like grid view, create dynamic alarms, HTTP requests, launch other apps, automatic battery charging in server mode, transfer sequences between devices, etc....\n\nYou can only use music (radio streams/tracks/albums) for your sequences that are stored in your Sonos Favorites (My Sonos) or in your TuneIn radio stations. You can't search your entire music library in this app. Just add your most used music to my Sonos then it can be used in your sequences.\n\nThe Timed Sequences feature is only available with an optional in-app purchase 'Premium'. With this automatically renewing subscription, up to 20 sequences can be run at freely configurable times. The function is only active as long as a valid subscription exists. The costs are billed via the iTunes account. The subscription will be renewed automatically within 24 hours before expiration (same time and costs), unless it is cancelled before in 'Settings' -> 'Manage Subscriptions' or in the iTunes settings.\n\nTo use this app you must have a working Sonos system. SonoSequencr supports Sonos software 1 and 2.\n\nFor terms and conditions and privacy policy see:\nhttps://celltekk.de/sonosequencr/help/privacy\n\nThis is not an official Sonos app."

      "label": "Finally there is an improved controller App for Sonos available on your iPhone or iPod Touch! Even still supporting iPod Touch 5th Gen and iPhone 4S! \n\nWatch on YouTube (http://youtu.be/rvp4QinakL0) or \nread below about\n \n- a new intuitive and concise user interface\n- less taps for common tasks\n- home automation integration\n- and current limitions (don't skip them ;) )\n\nor come over to my homepage www.sonophone.net with much more information and screenshots available.\n\nThis application is not endorsed by or associated with Sonos, Inc. (which is why it is not free)\n\n◆◆◆ a new intuitiv and concise user interface ◆◆◆\nSonoPhone is designed to leverage the latest iOS design principles:\n- Tap or drag the player on the top and you'll find the players view to select a new player and with volume controls for all players. From here you can also enter Zone Management, where you can group and ungroup players with drag and drop.\n- Tap or drag the Track infos on the bottom and you'll be at the big covers screen\n- Drag the main menu from any place to the left or right to have instant access to playlist or shortcuts\n- volume + progress popups: when changing volume or progress of a song, you get popups telling you the actual values. Stop guessing your desired values today!\n\n◆◆◆ less taps for common tasks ◆◆◆\nSonoPad tries to optimize most often used tasks to have the least taps needed. In the end you are able to navigate and control your players much more fluently.\n\n- Touch To Play: are you sick of always beeing asked what to do when you tap a track or album? SonoPhone defaults to just starting an album or song. A long press still gives you access to all options - you can also change the tap default in the settings menu. Want to build a playlist fast? Just set the default to 'always add to end' and off you go ...\n- tap an album cover image and the whole album starts to play immediately \n- aggregated search: search results are collapsed into one view, so you see immediately in what category you have the best results, without switching back and forth\n- shortcuts to most used functions: drag the main menu to the right to get shortcut buttons for artist, albums, radio and musicservices.\n- you can control the volume of every player directly from the player selection screen. No need to switch players anymore.\n\n◆◆◆ home automation integration ◆◆◆\n- you can start SonoPhone with the 'sonophone://' URL from other remote Apps. Its also possible to hand over a return URL, then a new icon is displayed to return to the automation App.\nFurther option include to select a default player or default menu, you can read more about all option on my homepage sonophone.net\n\n◆◆◆ Limitations ◆◆◆\n\n- all music services except Google Music are supported\n- no playing of music stored on iPhone yet\n- no options to set alarms or sleep settings\n- no support for discontinued WD100 dock\n\n◆◆◆ Other stuff ◆◆◆\n- Sonos is registered trademark of Sonos, Inc."

      "label": "The new way to practice jazz!\nGenius Jamtracks, the play-along app for jazz musicians that thinks and plays like an actual trio.\nWith an impressively realistic sound and feel, it helps you build your repertoire, your jazz vocabulary and master polyrhythms.\n\n>>> Brand New Features\n- Create your own songs with Genius Jamtracks using an easy and intuitive interface. Get creative and listen to how your compositions swing with the Genius Jamtracks trio.\n- Edit the charts for your favourite jazz standards however you like.\n\n\n“Genius Jamtracks is easily the best play along app out there! Particularly the piano voicings are more logical and realistic than other play-along apps. The bass and drums are not just a simple repetitive pattern, but actually use some jazz language. And it’s nice that you can make the band busy in unpredictable ways. As much like playing with a real group as you can get from an algorithm. Highly recommended!“\nPaul Bollenback  \n\n“It’s like a jazz musician wrote it. The drums and piano are just like how a jazz drummer and pianist would play. Couldn’t be an easy task to create that!”\nSteve Beskrone\n\n\n\n- Easy to read charts! \nCustom fonts make for beautiful, easy to read chord charts.\n\n- Rhythmic Complexity slider \nStart with simple comping and work your way up to mastering superhuman polyrhythms!\n\n- Harmonic Complexity slider\nStart with triads and work your way up to advanced substitutions and reharmonisation of the song.\n\n- The one and only polyrhythmic play-along!\nIn the Jam Session mode, the app decides on its own what to play and when to play it, based on the style of the song and the tempo. Experiment with how the app transforms the rhythm and the harmony according to the slider levels.\n\n- Master your polyrhythms!\nFocus on a specific grouping, polyrhythm or rhythmic displacement. Ask the trio – or an individual instrument – to include only what you’ve requested when they introduce polyrhythmic phrasing.\nAs you won’t know when or how it will be used though, this feature also helps sharpen your ability to improvise as well as mastering that rhythm!\n\n- Why it sounds great.\nIt’s all in the dynamics, note durations, space and feel. The Genius Jamtracks trio pays close attention to each of these elements to make the Genius Jam Session experience as close to the real thing as possible.\n\n- A real swing feel!\nForget the robotic triplets of other play-alongs. When changing the tempo, the app doesn’t simply play faster or slower, the swing feel changes as well. The app learned how to swing by internalising the jazz vocabulary and playing based on real transcriptions from the masters.\n\n- Actual voice leading!\nNo matter what your settings are, just press play and you’ll always have the same attention to voice leading from the pianist and the same effort in creating beautiful lines from the bassist to accompany you.\n\nReady to take your skills to the next level?"

It also features a Tone Generator just like a pitch pipe with four different wave forms. \n\nWith advanced DSP (Digital Signal Processing) algorithm, it is highly accurate (±1/1000 semitone or ±0.1 cent precision). Rather than providing only one mode like other tuners, insTuner supports different tuning modes applicable to different situations, such as Instant Tuning Mode for quick tune and play, Fine and Strobe Modes for accurate tuning, FFT Mode for sound analysis etc. What's more, many advanced features are provided such as Concert A calibration, historical temperaments and transpositions, which make it more powerful than other tuners. \n\ninsTuner is well-designed and easy to use. It features a unique \"fixed\" note wheel, which helps you to find the position of detected pitch easily. You can also use it as an electronic pitch pipe to tune by ear, matching the generated tones. \n\nIt is suitable for tuning acoustic or electric guitar and bass, ukulele, mandolin, banjo, bouzouki, bowed strings, woodwinds, brass, timpani and more. In fact, almost any instrument that sustains a tone can be tuned using insTuner. It supports Built-in Microphone as well as Line-in and other audio interface such as Apogee One. Clip Microphone is supported too. \n\n\n=== FEATURES === \n* Universal App, purchase once, available on all of your iOS devices: iPhone/iPhone5/iPod/iPad. \n* Supported both Landscape and Portrait mode \n* Precise to ±1/1000 semitone (±0.1 cent) \n* Tuning Range from C0 to B8, covering the range of almost all of musical instruments \n* Instant Tuning Mode\n* Strobe Tuning Mode \n* Fine Tuning Mode with a highly responsive tuning meter for perfect tuning \n* Historical Curve Mode that shows tuning results over time\n* FFT Tuning Mode for frequency analysis with Log, Linear or Note Display options \n* Real-time Spectrogram Mode with Log, Linear, Note and Median Frequency Display options for real-time audio analysis \n* Well-designed \"Fixed\" note wheel display \n* Adjustable A4 (Concert A) calibration in 0.1 Hz increments \n* >30 historical temperaments \n* Customizable temperaments\n* 12 notations \n* Needle damping\n* Customizable transposition options for transposing instruments \n* Tone generator with four wave forms\n* Line-in and Built-in Microphone Modes\n* Customizable Input Channels\n* Supported Apogee One\n* Supported Inter-App Audio\n* Supported Audio Bus\n* Optimized for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus\n\n===About EUMLab=== \nWe make the best music Apps for you!

I'm a professional clarinetist, and I've told all of my musician friends to use this app.\" \n\n\"I highly recommend this app and who can beat the price.

The drone can be fairly static or undergo slow modulation and harmonic change. It now plays in the background under iOS 4.0 like many other music apps!\n\nPop over to http://www.jhhl.net/iPhone/SrutiBox/ and listen to some examples!\n\n\"I wanted you to know that I have made my debut in Vienna a couple of weeks ago as an iPHONEist. \nI played two simultaneously - one with sruti box and the other with a variety of apps.\nI am enjoying sruti box immensely! Thank you!\"\n— Dr. Pauline Oliveros\n\nI also have another Droning app, Droneo, which has a similar interface, but more droning options!\n\nSrutiBox uses 12 \"reeds\" which can be tuned to a great number of scales, randomly detuned, and chorused and modulated. The pitch interval and  volume of each \"reed\" can be set individually, making for a wide variety of drones. The reeds can be set to various timbres suitable for drones, including vocal-like timbres and low frequency-friendly chirps. \n\nA special iPhone feature of SrutiBox is that you can wave the phone in an imitation of pumping the bellows, adding a touch of realism to the simulation. \n\nSrutiBox can also be used as a pitch source for instrument tuning purposes, or as an aid for learning the difference between Just and Equal Tempered intervals. \n\nAs with other iPhone/iPod touch audio applications, it'll sound better through headphones, although in a quiet room, it's quite effective! Make sure to use the volume controls on the side of the phone to set  the volume level you like.\n\nSee the SrutiBox web pages for more information, hints, and possibly tales of YOUR performances and discoveries:\nhttp://www.jhhl.net/iPhone/SrutiBox\n\nIt's also the place to ask for support and advice, or email tutti-srutti at jhhl.net\n\nalso: visit my iPhone App Facebook group for starting discussions etc!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=150360054839 \n\nThank You!\n\nCheck out  my other apps: Droneo, Tondo, the iPhone Wind Chimes, Lake Piano and Enumero!"

Three independent learning modules in one app. Set aside five minutes a day for this app, and you will be reading sheet music like a professional musician in no time.\nThe app uses an ingenious approach to memorizing information through repetition and visual patterns with a focus on hard-to-remember pieces of information.\n\nThe simple, elegant, and intuitive interface allows you to switch between the different note-naming systems used in major countries around the world:\n• CDEFGAB (major + minor, 大调 + 小调, 大調 + 小調)\n• CDEFGAH (dur + moll)\n• Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Si (mayor + menor, maior + menor, majeur + mineur, maggiore + minore)\n• Дo Рe Ми Фа Coль Ля Си (мажор + минор)\n• ハ ニ ホ ヘ ト イ ロ (長調 + 短調)\n• 도 레 미 파 솔 라 시 (장조 + 단조) \n\nKey Signatures module: Learn key signatures – this module will help you memorize a circle of fifths – a must for every musician. You will learn to recognize keys based on the number of sharps or flats in a key signature at the beginning of a staff.\nChoose from three learning modes using the buttons at the top of the module home screen:\n• Learn key signatures for major keys only – left button\n• Learn key signatures for minor keys only – middle button\n• Learn key signatures for both major and minor keys – right button\n\nNotes module: Learn music notes – this module will teach you to quickly recognize notes without thinking – you’ll look at it, and you’ll simply know it.\nChoose from three learning modes using the buttons at the top of the module home screen:\n• Learn notes from the treble clef only – left button\n• Learn notes from the bass clef only – middle button\n• Learn notes from both treble and bass clef – right button\n\nIntervals module: Learn intervals – this module is especially helpful for pianists. Skilled pianists don't need to identify every note in a sheet. They recognize patterns based on the distance between notes (intervals) and automatically stretch their fingers accordingly.\nChoose from three learning modes using the buttons at the top of the module home screen:\n• Learn harmonic intervals only – left button\n• Learn melodic intervals only – middle button\n• Learn both harmonic and melodic intervals – right button"

      "label": "Learn to play 'In The Pocket' with Drummer ITP: The World's only intelligent metronome and rudiment training tool! *Worldwide Number 1 iPhone Music App in over 70 countries!*\n\nDrummer ITP can help you to learn exceptionally accurate timing with your drum performances and become a true 'In The Pocket' player. The app is designed for practicing rudiment patterns with a drum practice pad - incorporating an intelligent listening feature, which allows your performance against a metronome click to be measured and given as feedback scores. You can therefore track your progress and identify what rudiment patterns and tempos cause you most trouble with staying in time. \n\n*Please note: as with all professional audio and recording systems, Drummer ITP requires you to use wired headphones to enable zero latency analysis and measurements. Bluetooth headphones do not allow zero latency data exchange.\n\nDrummer ITP helps to identify the key tempos where your technique changes from wrist-action stick hits to faster speeds which require you to control the bounce of the drumsticks. Finding your breaking points with different stick pad rudiments and practice exercises will enable you to focus on the most challenging aspects of your personal stick technique and will underpin your development in all areas of drumming.\n\nThe main display shows both the rolling click waveform and the microphone readings from your performance on the practice pad, so you can easily see if you are playing ahead or behind the beat. There is also a unique accuracy indicator which shows how far ahead or behind the beat each of your hits is. Whilst performing rudiments and exercises on a practice pad, the app records an ongoing measurement of accuracy and consistency of the performance, so you can practice to keep the timing indicator right in the middle of the screen and achieve the highest possible scores. When playing an accented pattern, or an exercise with rests incorporated, the intelligent algorithm checks that the correct type of hits are performed at the right time. If you want to check how accurate the app is, just turn up the loudspeaker volume and you'll see it measure its own sounds to 100% accuracy - so you can see how close your own performance scores are to that of an electronic drum machine!\n\nDrummer ITP can be used in Manual Mode or Rudiment Mode. In Manual Mode the metronome runs freely, as a standard metronome whilst also keeping a measurement of the recent performance scores. With a rudiment pattern active (i.e. using the app's Rudiment Mode), a count in starts a 30, 60, 120 or 300 second rudiment test, the results of which become a benchmark for evaluating your performance progress over time, with all your best high scores being recorded. The app can also be used purely as a standalone high-precision metronome with advanced settings allowing you to choose different pitches, volumes and intervals for the click.\n\nIncludes a total of 68 practice patterns and rudiment exercises for combinations of:\n- standard timing exercises (quarters, eighths, sixteenths)\n- triplet timing exercises\n- single, double and triple paradiddles (including inverted, reverse and offset)\n- single and double paradiddle-diddle patterns\n- rudimental drum rolls\n- accented patterns\n\nAdditional features:\n- notation of all included rudiments and exercise patterns \n- real-time left/right hand pattern indicator \n- accent indicator and moving notation counter \n- tempo adjustment from 30-240 bpm\n- beat time intervals 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n- optional beat one accent for practicing specific time signatures\n- click designer with settings for pitch, tonality, click duration and volume\n- separate click design for the main beat and interval sounds\n- stick pad performance player, to hear what you are attempting to play\n- high scores chart for completed rudiments and exercises\n- preset click sounds\n- microphone sensitivity adjustment\n- intelligent 'learn latency' feature to ensure 100% accurate analysis"

Touch a button and reveal the note on the piano. \n  Play a concert pitch on the piano, and have that pitch's fingering displayed. Touch a button and reveal the transposed note written on the staff. \n\nWritten and concert pitches are the same for all but the double bass, which transposes, sounding an octave below what is written.\n\n• Use the ‘Play' button to repeatedly hear the note or interval being displayed.\n\nSelecting a Pitch:\n  Using the Staff (transposed for the current instrument): Simply touch and slide up and down on the staff to select the note, slide to the right or left of the note for sharps and flats.\n  Using the Piano (concert pitch): drag in the area below the keyboard to move the keyboard, touch to play notes, touch & slide to change the pitch. When you glissando up the keyboard, notes will be notated as a raised value (sharps), when you glissando down, notes will be notated as lowered values (flats).\n  Use the up and down arrows to move chromatically up and down without touching the music staff or piano keyboard."

      "label": "Understanding harmony is an essential skill for any musician.  Harmony is the springboard that elevates melodies to their full emotional potential.  \n\nHarmony Cloud™ is a revolutionary step forward in the world of ear training created by world renowned jazz vibraphonist and music educator Stefon Harris, and software entrepreneur and jazz trombonist Clif Swiggett.  It is designed to help all musicians, from beginner to professional, expand their ears, deepen their understanding of harmony, and fearlessly explore the world of improvisation.  Its underlying (patent-pending) algorithm stitches together chords you select into an unending source of unpredictable, yet musical, chord progressions.\n\n\"Listen and Play\" lets you immerse yourself in chord progressions and play along with your instrument (or voice).  Use it to deepen your intuitive sense of harmony, to practice improvisation, to play by ear, and to improve aspects of your performance including intonation and emotional expressiveness.\n\n\"Bass Note Practice\" teaches you to identify the pitch of the bass note and recognize bass line movements.  Bass lines are the foundation of every chord progression and the more accurately and quickly you can hear the bass note, the better.\n\n\"Chord Quality Practice\" deepens your emotional and physical connection to chord qualities including major, minor, diminished, augmented, and sus4.  You will learn to recognize these qualities intuitively and reflexively.\n\n\"Inversions Practice\" teaches you to hear the difference between root, first, and second inversions.  Inversions are chord voicings that put the tonic, the third, or the fifth of the chord in the bass note.  Each inversion is very distinct, beautiful, and has different harmonic tendencies.\n\n\"Full Chord Practice\" lets you combine three essential skills (recognizing bass note, chord quality, and inversion) to fully identify chords quickly, accurately, and completely by ear.\n\n\"Play Chord Pitches\" develops your ability to identify each of the distinct notes in a chord.  When a new chord plays, use the keyboard to identify each of its pitches.\n\n\"Take the Challenge\" to test your skill level, go for high scores, and track your progress.  Each of the challenges tests one of the essential skills that you've practiced.  When you start a challenge, like a musical performance, there’s no stopping, pausing, or restarting midway through.  Every challenge is scored.  Your scores, as well as other performance stats, are saved so that you can see your progress over time.\n\nHarmony Cloud can be tailored to any musician's or teacher’s needs.  Chord progressions can range from very simple I, IV, V progressions to progressions that include hundreds of chords.  This makes it easy to learn and grow at your own pace.  You have control of all aspects of the music including tempo, volume, sounds, key signature, and much more.\n\nWe invite all musicians to install Harmony Cloud.  And be sure to visit the Harmony Cloud YouTube channel for instruction and inspiration."

If you're looking for that George Michael/\"Careless Whispers\" sound... look no further!\n\nThis is your digital solution to sax saturation. Bring your sax levels to 11... Try Sensual Sax today!\n\nFEATURES:\n- MIDI input / output\n- IAA\n- Audio Unit 3\n- Audiobus\n- True legato sampling for realistic note transitions\n- Three sets of articulations\n\nControls include REVERB (with controllable AMOUNT and ROOM SIZE settings); VIBRATO (with dedicated DEPTH slider); DELAY (with control over AMOUNT and TIME); and switchable LEGATO, SUSTAIN, and STACCATO playing styles using the onscreen lockable keyboard (switchable to DOUBLE KEYBOARD for further flexibility). It goes without saying that it is compatible with all major iOS-based DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations), working with Apple’s Audio Unit Extensions technology — that brings the Audio Units system-level full plug-in architecture model (that was previously only available to third-party developers like Embertone in OS X) to iOS — as well as Inter-App Audio and Audiobus for full communication with the outside musical world.\n\n==========\nFounded by composer/orchestrator Alex Davis and composer/sound designer Jonathan Churchill, Embertone has been producing next-level virtual instruments since 2012. Its mission is simple: sample lots of great instruments, and bring them to market to inspire awesome new music! The co-founders seriously love what they do, admiring the likes of Tonehammer, Sample Modeling, and Sonic Couture — companies that have led the way to this new age of deeply-sampled virtual instruments, and aim to move that tradition forward by finding new ways to capture the essence of an instrument and program it in an intuitive and responsive package... and, of course, offer it to the composing community at an atttractive price! As the go-to company for musicians looking for realistic and fun virtual instruments since releasing the free Intimate Strings LITE for Native Instruments’ industry-standard KONTAKT (4.2.4+), the full-blown Friedlander Violin subsequently became the flagship solo product for the KONTAKT PLAYER platform while setting the production standard for future realistic-sounding releases."

      "label": "Ship Finder shows live moving ships on a worldwide map. The intuitive design combined with incredible performance puts you in control. Watch in full screen, view in AR, search, add filters and so much more!\n\nShip Finder has been top rated and top ranking since 2009 and covers most of the world, tracking 20,000+ ships simultaneously.\n\nOur incredible app performance means that you can see all tracked vessels at once - no clustering here!\nSimply tap a ship to see its name, type, photos, speed, dimensions and much more.\nPowerful features such as filters, search and the ability to save favourite ships are included. (You can choose Apple or Google maps too!).\n\nAdd and browse bookmarks to saved locations around the globe to quickly navigate to areas or ports of interest.\n\nYou can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. \n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

      "label": "What is WikiFarms Australia?\n\nWikiFarms Australia is the essential application for backpackers looking for a farm job in Australia. Whether you are looking for a casual job during your trip or aiming to complete your 88 days of farm work to get your Second Year Visa, WikiFarms Australia will be your guide!\nThe application will help you to be in direct contact with farmers by making available a map with thousands of farms around Australia!\nThe database is always growing and constantly being updated by our team: companies are added weekly, contacts are regularly verified, making it the largest database for fruit picking jobs in Australia! With more than 2000 companies listed in the app you’ll have all the information you need to find a farm job quickly.\n\n \nSo do not wait to get the best farm job tool available in Australia!\n\n \nWhat can I do with the app?\n\nWikiFarms Australia makes it easy to find a farm. Simply use the map screen to see exactly where are located the farms. Then tap a site to bring up its description. It will show you the name of the company, type of crops, phone number, and, for some of them, website and email. You can then call the farmers directly from the app and ask them if they need workers. If you are ready to go, you can also start an itinerary from your current location and ask them in person!\n\nThe app also allows you to use filters. If you are looking to work in a specific area or to pick a specific type of fruit during a specific time, you can do that!\n\nThe app lists also tons of working hostels, tourism offices, working agencies that can give you more information or help to find a job in a specific area.\n\nWith the app you can also calculate your 88 days of farm work easily and see if you’re ready to apply for the Second (or Third soon!) Year Visa.\n\n \nWho made WikiFarms Australia?\n\nFellow backpackers like you created WikiFarms Australia! When we were looking for farm work to get our Second Year Visa, we really struggled knowing where to look for farms! There was some information here and there but nothing really consistent. This is when we started to think about a tool that will have all the farmers at once and WikiFarms Australia started just like that J\n\n \nWhy is the app not free?\n\nWe are a very small team working on this project for more than 2 years! As a result, the profit of the app really helps us to make it better day after day. In addition, it also contributes to our travelling passion (which we are sure that if you are here you can relate!)\n\nIn addition, you certainly think that most apps are free, but are they really? Most of the time, free apps are full of unwanted and annoying ads and you often have to pay more to have the full use of it.\n\nWe made the choice to offer a complete, advertising-free experience for as low of a price as we could make it. Consider that half the price you pay for it goes to taxes and Google share.\n\nThe application helps you get what you need the most, find a farm job, and when you will get it, its price will be covered in less than half an hour of work!\n\nThanks for your purchase and we hope that you’ll have a good experience with our app!\n\n \nFeel free to join us on our Facebook page or to visit our website:\nhttps://wikifarmsaustralia.com/\n\n \nAre you a farmer looking for workers? You can contact us at: info.wikifarms@gmail.com\nWe will answer you within 24h."

It also allows to record routes (of your travels, hikes etc) so you can follow them later again, or to find your way back more easily.\n\nThe App shows a big compass which includes arrows showing the direction to all of the places you have stored within the App. You can also get coordinates and distances to these locations. \n\nThere are two modes available for the compass: A more traditional mode where the center of the compass shows current the direction as cardinal points and in degrees in big letters, the second mode shows a map in the background which can display or record a route, which helps to follow the route or find your way back on that route. Just keep the path in the center while following the route.\n\nThe App supports Live Activities (iOS 16.1 and later on the iPhone), so the compass and all the directions and distances to the saved places are always visible within the dynamic island (iPhone 14 Pro) and on the lock screen.\n\nThe App supports Voice Over on the iPhone for blind and visually impaired users.\n\nThe Watch App also shows the compass and all directions and distances to all saved places, just like the iPhone App.\n\nThe App respects your privacy. There's no tracking, no ads, no hidden costs, no subscription. It's just doing what you expect: showing the direction to north and other places, help to find your way."

      "label": "Theodolite was one of the earliest augmented reality (AR) apps for iOS when it debuted in 2009 -- in fact Theodolite was pioneering AR technology before \"AR\" was even a buzzword! In the time since, Theodolite has been used by millions of consumers and professionals in their outdoor adventures and on the job. Now, we've taken the Theodolite concept to Apple Watch by combining a compass, inclinometer, GPS, and maps into one indispensable app that sits on your wrist. We're excited to keep evolving this centuries-old instrument as hardware and software technologies allow the concept to come to new device formats.\n\nOn iPhone and iPad, Theodolite uses a viewfinder format, uniting the device sensors (GPS, magnetometer, gyro, accelerometer) and camera.  On Apple Watch, Theodolite combines data from these sensors into an AHRS (attitude and heading reference system) layout similar to what you'd see in the glass cockpit of a modern aircraft. This layout allows Theodolite to efficiently display compass bearing (yaw angle), pitch angle, and roll angle in a compact format that works extremely well on a small screen.  This information is augmented by latitude, longitude, and altitude from GPS, as well as sun and moon position.\n\nNew in Theodolite for Watch version 2 is a map screen and waypoint manager.  You can add waypoints on the map or at your current location, and view waypoints on the compass ring to visualize their bearing from your current location.\n\nTheodolite has settings for compass mode (true or magnetic), distance/altitude units (feet or meters), and position format (decimal degrees, degrees-minutes-seconds, MGRS, USNG, UTM, UTM-B, and Maidenhead Locator System).  Users can choose to display an artificial horizon in the center of the app display (tied to pitch and roll) and can set the app's level reference to flat or vertical orientations of the Watch.  The app has six color schemes, including two night vision modes - midnight red and luminescent green.\n\nTheodolite for Watch is recommended for Apple Watch Series 5 and later (including Ultra).  Apple Watch Series 4 and older do not have a compass sensor and will not show compass data.  On older devices, the app uses the device's gyro sensor to measure rotation.  You can twist the watch's digital crown to adjust and calibrate the gyro to the sun position, moon position, or a known bearing.  Using these references, the \"gyro compass\" is able to give bearing.  The calibration can be repeated as often as desired to give accurate results.\n\nTheodolite reports accuracy from the magnetometer sensor in your Watch.  To improve results, operate Theodolite away from magnets, electronics, or sources of electro-magnetic interference, including car dashboards, aircraft cockpits, metal structures, and other devices.\n\nLike all our apps, we plan to continually improve and evolve Theodolite for Watch.  Please contact us with feature requests, suggestions, and general feedback.  We'd love to hear what you're doing with the app!  And if you don't already have Theodolite for your iPhone or iPad, check it out!"

      "label": "This app puts the Mayan Dreamspell Calendar in your pocket! \"13:20:Sync makes it so much easier to understand and integrate the calendar into every day life. Highly recommend it.\" \n\nThe Mayan People have described, in breathtaking precision, the cycles of both the universe and nature around us. They created a harmonic calendar that is synchronized to all those cycles. Following these cycles can help you get a stronger connection with nature around you and become conscious of your essence.\n\nThis app provides a simple way to sync along those cycles, to raise our frequency and give us a new lens to view both our day-to-day and planetary events.\n\n- Did you ever realize that our (Gregorian) calendar is not a harmonic calendar? \n- Did you know that the moon has 13 (not 12!) orbits around the earth in 1 year? \n- Why do we live with this irregular calendar?\n- Are you interested in Astrology?\n\n-> All this, and more, is explained carefully in this app. (over 15.000 words on 37 pages) Please note that these text are in English language only.\n\nIn the New Time, synchronicity is the norm.\n\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n5 star rating across the world! \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\"Entertaining as well as enlightening\" \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\nMORE INFO: \nwww.1320sync.com \n\n\nFor the beginner this app is a learning tool because it contains an extensive explanation about Tones and Seals and the synchronizing order of the Mayan Astrology. You may think it's difficult at first but soon you will feel how it all connects. \n\n\"This app is great, and allows easy manipulation of dates. I spent years in books doing in hours what I can now do in seconds.\"\n\nFor the ones who are already familiar with the Mayan Calendar this app is a handy tool to navigate the cycles, and calculate the Combined Kin for any given combination.

      "label": "BlindSquare is pioneering accessible navigation both indoors and outdoors. Know where you are, know where you're going, travel with confidence.\n\nBlindSquare is a new solution that combines the latest technology to help the blind with their daily lives. It has been developed in collaboration with blind people and carefully field tested. You need either an iPhone or an iPad to get started. It also supports some additional accessories to enhance the experience. \n\nHow does it work? \n\nBlindSquare uses GPS and the compass to locate you. It then gathers information about the surrounding environment from FourSquare. BlindSquare has some unique algorithms to decide what information is the most relevant and then speaks it to you with high quality speech synthesis. \n“What's the most popular café within 200 meters radius? Where is the post office or the library?” \n\nYou can control BlindSquare also through voice commands. The Voice Command feature is a premium service requiring purchase of credits for continuous use.  Voice Command Credits are available as an in-app purchase on the App Store.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a GPS solution:\n\nWhen you start the app, it will start telling you the interesting places and street crossings around you. By changing the radius, you can limit the area you are interested in. You can also search by search term or by category. You can select an interesting place from the search results and perform the following tasks:\n\n1) Get contact info (address, phone number) \n2) Open twitter feed or restaurant menu (if provided)\n3) Make a phone call\n4) Start tracking the place (BlindSquare will assist you by repeating the distance and the clock face direction)\n5) Start your favourite navigator for turn-by-turn instructions (TomTom, Navigon or Apple Maps)\n\nBlindSquare is aware of when you travel by car, bus or train and starts to report interesting places in front of you (for example, the next stops) and street crossings when you are passing them.\n\nYou can also save your own private places to iCloud so they will be found with your every device.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a Foursquare client:\n\nIf you like to play Foursquare, you can do the following with BlindSquare:\n \n1) Get a list of nearby FourSquare venues\n2) When you are in a place, you can check in by shaking your device\n3) Do a check in with commenting and twitter/facebook sharing\n4) Correct the location of the place\n\nBlindSquare supports the following languages: English, Arabic, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean (South Korea), Norwegian, Polish, Portugues, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\nVoiceOver usage is supported but it also includes higher quality additional speech synthesis by Acapela Text-To-Speech from Acapela Group.\n \nInstructions in English: https://www.blindsquare.com/user-guide/ and https://www.blindsquare.com/faq/\n\nPlease note: This app retrieves data in real time from Foursquare and Open Street Map. Use of a flat rate data plan is highly recommended.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nHaving only been released in May 2012, BlindSquare has already received several prizes and awards:\n\n - GSMA: Global Mobile Awards 2013, Best Mobile Health Product or Service\n - Apps4Finland 2012\n - OpenCities App Challenge 2012\n - The Finnish Information Processing Association: Best Product 2012\n\nPlease note: To use BlindSquare, your iCloud account has to be active so BlindSquare can access it to save your settings and places.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "This app provides complete offline topographic map coverage of the South Island of New Zealand from the LINZ Topo50 1:50k scale map series.  The maps are all contained in the installation so there is no additional need for downloads, no need for phone or wifi signal, no slow server issues, no account signups, no missing tiles, and no additional map fees. Just install for seamless off-line zooming and panning across the whole island down to 1:50,000 scale. The app also includes 1:50k resolution satellite images for the island and elevation data.\n\nOther integrated data includes DOC open and restricted hunting permit boundaries, DOC huts, campgrounds, and tracks, Fish and Game access points, and Te Araroa trails. Other datasets can be imported.\n\nThe app has a full suite of navigation functions including GPS location, compass orientation, distance to map locations, track recording and graphing, route creation and following, import/export of gpx and kml files, search functions for named places and user data. Add and edit your own locations and routes and plot elevation profiles. Uses an intuitive simple interface, with one-touch access to all functions.\n\nLINZ TOPO250 series maps are used at lower zoom levels for easier navigation.\n\nPerfect for outback use out of cell phone range. GPS and maps function fully without phone coverage. No need to cache files in advance either as they are all fully installed with the app. Popular with trampers, hikers, runners, bikers, search and rescue (SAR), hunters, boaters, as well as survey applications.\n\nNote that continuous use of GPS will run down the battery faster than when not using the GPS. The NZTopo50 app gives you full control over when GPS is used. The map can be used without GPS, intermittently with GPS for spot checking of location, continuously for logging while the app is open, or for continuous background logging when the phone is off. \n\nCheck our website for links to user guides and useful tips and tricks.\n\nFeel free to get in touch with any suggestions."

Just take a photo at key points in your journey and RouteMyPhotos will plot on a map the location of those photos and create a path with distance traveled between those photos.  You can then view a slideshow of the photos in your route by tapping the photo attached to a location.\n\nSimply choose any photo album or moment, and all the photos in that selected album or moment will be plotted on a map in the order you took those photos.  Then tap on the routing button to create a path connecting those photos with the distances between the photos being automatically calculated.\n\nFeatures:\n\n▪ Plot all the photos (with geolocation data) in a photo album or moment on a map.\n▪ Plot a path between these photos and calculate the distance traveled without using the internet.\n▪ Lookup the address of a photo (this requires internet connection).\n▪ Show the location of a photo in Apple or Google (if installed) maps. Use this feature to generate directions to the location of a photo.\n▪ View a slideshow of any album or photo album.\n▪ Export a KML file containing the photo locations than can be imported into Google Earth or Google Maps."

Checklists \nApp comes with a ready Light Airplane Template and a ready checklist set for the Cirrus SR22-G3 and G3 models. \nYou can easily add items or even checklists to the checklist set. \nOther Checklist sets as in-app purchases: Cessna 172, 182, Piper Warrior and Archer.\nAll checklist sets from the store can be downloaded as often as required, edited and saved. \nAll checklist sets can be shared by eMail if the recipient owns the basic checklist of that airplane. \nSend checklist sets to yourself to save them on your computer or in a cloud service. Or install them on a second iPad. \nMake your own checklists for the categories Normal, Abnormal and Emergency and save them in the right category (Ground, Taxi…) of the checklist set for your airplane \nAll checklists you create can be read to you \n\nII. Checklist Usage and Setting\nChecklists can be displayed as text only or shown as text and be read to the pilot/crew at the same time. \nChecklist items (text or audio) can also be completed manually one at a time by simply tapping the screen.\nIf the whole checklist is read automatically then the reading can always be stopped and resumed by one tap on the screen.\nSome Checklist groups (Ground, Taxi, Takeoff…) can be forwarded automatically by GPS. \nMove and sort the icons on the screen according to your needs.\nYour edited checklists will be preserved with each new version of smartCHECK (we still recommend saving them). \n\nIII. Automatic Altitude Callouts on Take-off (especially important for pilots of airplanes with BRS or CAPS system) \nHeight AGL* above the Take-off runway can be announced („five hundred“). \nPilot can either set one Height AGL* to be announced or a range between 100 and 1000 feet.\nElevation above Take-off runway can be displayed in large numbers at the same time. \nCirrus Aircraft Checklists contain a special CAPS checklist.\nAfter Take-off Checklists can be activated and read automatically and hands off.  \n\nIV. Integrated Document Browser: Access all your Documents, Tables or Manuals with one tap \nDocument Browser. Create green icons, give them a name and import any PDF or JPEG document. you might want to access with one tap. \nImport PDF documents like Avionics Manuals or Performance tables. \nEvery document is accessible with tapping its icon.\nUse the camera of your iPad to create a document on the spot. \nNotepad feature.\n\nV. Other Tools and Settings\nOil Log: Enter the Oil status of your engine, how much oil you added and the app calculates the oil consumption per flight hour.\nFuel Switch Timer: Select an interval and get an onscreen and audio reminder to switch your tanks.\nControl brightness of screen in the app or use the red Night Mode. \nSwitch the audio feature on/off.\nSwitch on/off automatic forwarding of flight phases. Or swipe groups manually.\nAuto voice on/off. Auto voice means: The app reads the complete checklist and goes back to the main menu when checklist is completed.\nWhen using checklists without auto voice each tap on the screen will read one item (manual audio mode).\nIf used without audio each tap will only mark each item/line green (manual text mode). \nMove checklist icons to other place on the screen by sliding them to a new position.\nFilter which checklist types you want to have displayed with a simple toggle switch. This way you can reduce the number of icons on the screen. \n\nMore information: www.airwork.biz \nHardware Requirements: smartCHECK will work on every iPad and iPad mini."

      "label": "The app enables navigation with the sun and is comparable to satellite navigation on a chart plotter. A sextant is needed because, unlike satellites, the sun does not emit radio signals. The distance to an observer must therefore be measured manually with a sextant from the earth. For a position determination only the times and the sextant readings of two observations to be entered. The position is immediately displayed as a ship symbol on an electronic map. A track of the journey is displayed based on the positions determined and the data from an integrated dead reckoning module. \nSo, the app can be used by anyone without any knowledge of celestial navigation. The sun cannot be confused with any other star and is available all day. Navigating with stars requires specialist knowledge so that stars can be reliably identified. At night the height of stars cannot be measured because the horizon is not visible. \n\nWith this app it is now possible to have a real second independent navigation system on board that anyone can use immediately, even in stressful situations and without prior instruction. Celestial navigation is a demonstrably a valid and safe navigation method. Sailors should always be able to master and use classic celestial navigation.\n \nA failure of satellite navigation is difficult to imagine, but not impossible.  A lot of money is spent each year on buying and maintaining yacht safety equipment in case of rare incidents that normally do not happen, but very little is done or available in the event of satellite navigation failure.\n\nThis app makes it very easy to meet the requirements for navigational safety of the ship and crew. It is professional system and makes it possible to check the functionality of the on board satellite navigation electronics with a totally independent system. For some sailors, classic celestial navigation is even a passion, finding the way only with the help of the heavens. After all, sailing itself is a historical form of travel.\n\nThe app based on the ideas of the renowned German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1809. His solution was way ahead of its time. A position is calculated from the heights of two celestial bodies, or the sun at two different times and entered on a nautical chart. Satellite navigation works similar way. \n\nSince there were no computers at that time sailors invented graphical approximation methods and only these methods are in use to this day. They are extremely complex and time-consuming and require a high level of knowledge of mathematics. In our modern times this greatly reduces the general appeal of celestial navigation as a backup system for safety at sea. \n\nCompared to the commonly known graphical Marcq St. Hilaire method this app offers considerable advantages:\n\n1.\t\t1.There are no errors when measuring heights above 70 degrees.\n2.\t\t2.The time between two observations of the sun can be much shorter.\n3.\t\t3.To calculate a position, no DR-Position is necessary.\n4.\t\t4.The calculation algorithm is precise and is not an approximation.\n\nThe app includes the following functions:\n\n1.\t\t1.Automatically altitude corrections of sextant readings.\n2.\t\t2.An additional use of the noon latitude is possible.\n3.\t\t3.Module for dead reckoning with track recording.\n4.\t\t4.Map-download-function.\n5.\t\t5.Zoom function from the whole Earth down to the yacht harbor.\n6.\t\t6.Distance measurement from the ship's position to a destination.\n7.\t\t7.Representation of circles of position on the globe.\n8.\t\t8.Navigation simulator beside to an ongoing navigation.\n9.\t\t9.Sun almanac until 31. December 2040 in a data base.\n10.\t\t10.Detailed description in a help file.\n\nNever before has it been so easy to navigate with the sun. No mathematics, no drawing and no searching in complicated tables. With this app celestial navigation becomes fun instead of arduous. Even if the accuracy of astronavigation takes getting used to at first, with this app and a cheap plastic sextant you are safer on the sea."

The app offers conversions for the Swissgrid coordinate system in Switzerland and for various WGS84 formats. Furthermore, the typed coordinates or the current location can be displayed on the map. The map needs an internet connection. In addition, the app offers various tools such as ASCII, numbers to letters, text to numbers, rotation, bearing and distance between two coordinates, prime numbers checker, waypoint projection with current position, Roman numerals, temperature units, number systems, Wherigo Reverse solver, tool for Multi-Cache with calculator.\nSwissGEO Tools was in 2012 the first app which had interactive code tables. The big collection of interactive code tables continues to be an important part of CacheToolBox. Outdoors, you can decode the encrypted messages smartly with the \"symbol keyboards\" which were displayed in plain text without any Internet connection. CacheToolBox now also offers the opposite way: simple encryption of plain text by keyboard in symbolic characters!\nThere are currently 108 code tables available.\nIn future, more tables and tools will follow in free updates! \n\nSummary of all functions of CacheToolBox:\n\ncurrent location\n\n- coordinates WGS84 DD.DDD°\n- coordinates WGS84 DD° MM.MMM°\n- coordinates swissgrid CH1903+\n- Indication of altitude\n- GPS accuracy\n- show location on map\n- copy coordinates from current location and insert within the app\n\ndiff. maps: Swiss Map® and OSM (automatic switching)\n\n- Swiss: Swiss Map@ scaling 1:25’000 with the option to show hiking trails\n- other countries: OSM\n- resolution of map: low – normal - high\n\ncoordinates conversion\n\n- convert WGS84 DD.DDD°\n- convert WGS84 DD° MM.MMM’\n- convert WGS84 DD° MM’ SS.SSS\"\n- convert swissgrid CH1903+\n- coordinates switching N-S and E-W\n- show location on map\n- copy/paste coordinates and insert within the app\n- share current position by mail, message, WhatsApp\n\ncode-tables\n\n- 108 interactive code-tables for decoding symbol characters\n- symbol keyboards decodes encrypted messages directly to letters\n- simple encryption of plain text by keyboard in symbolic characters\n- no internet connection needed\n- more code-tables will follow in free updates!\n\ntools\n\n- ASCII\n- morse code\n- numbers to letters: 0=A, 1=A, 26=A\n- letter to numbers: sum, digit sum, alternated, product\n- rotation: rot5, rot13, rot18, rot47 and shift by hand (caesar)\n- distance and bearing between two coordinates\n- prime numbers: check prime numbers, prime factorization, search prime number\n- waypoint projection: WGS84 with degree or artillery per milles, distance in meter or feet (english)\n- Roman numerals: convert Roman to arabic or vice versa\n- temperature units: celsius – kelvin – fahrenheit – rankine - réamur \n- number systems: binary – decimal – octal – hexadecimal and more\n- Wherigo Reverse solver\n- Tool for Multi-Cache with calculator\n\nInfo\n\n- settings\n- conversion unit length: meter – feet (english)\n- rate app\n- legal notice\n- link to support website\n\nlanguages\n\n- English\n- German\n- French"

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer, GPS tracker and trip cost monitor for iPhones and cellular iPads. \n∙∙ When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! \n∙∙ The cost monitor shows you the current cost of the journey as you drive and tells you each passengers share. \n∙∙ GPS tracker records your trips so they can be analyzed, viewed and shared at any moment.\n\n‣‣ COST MONITOR. What's the cost of my driving?\nBased on gas price for a gallon or litre, MPG (U.S. or UK) or liters per 100 km the app will tell you what the cost is as you drive. You can add an extra cost per kilometer or mile! Useful for all cost aware drivers and for splitting the cost between passengers.\n\n‣‣ GPS TRACKING. Where I've been? How long did it take to get from A to B? \nSpeedometer records your trip statistics even when GPS tracker is switched off. When you need point by point data to see on the map later or export (Google Earth and GPX), speedometer gives you the first class GPS tracker.\n\n‣‣ INFOTAINMENT. \nWhen switched on, infotainment shows trip stats or weather/wind forecast  when you wait. Way better than just showing you a 0 speed!\n\n‣‣ Easy to set speed limits and SPEED LIMIT MEMORY option\nSet speed limits with 4 or 8 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! With SPEED LIMIT MEMORY you just apply the speed limit once and the app applies it for you automatically the next time!\n\n‣‣ MODES\nUse MENU>MODES to turn the app into a Rally computer, G-Force monitor, Camera alerter or taximeter! Currently there are 12 modes available and we are constantly adding new ones.\n\n‣‣ WAYPOINTS.\nSpeedometer gives you the unique way to leave a note with location and even optional photo or audio note attached! As easy as double tap on the big speed digits! You'll find more in a documentation section (star button).\n\n‣‣ RED LIGHT & SPEED CAMERAS\nImport camera data into speedometer in Garmin or iGO csv formats from poi-factory.com, scdb.info or poi-plaza and let speedo alert you on a camera approach and set speed limit automatically before you pass the speed camera!\n\n‣‣ SUNSET/SUNRISE\nWith the sunset and sunrise information that our speedometer provides, you'll be able to avoid driving in the dusk.\n\n‣‣ BARO VSI. Barometric Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI, IVSI) in both scale and graph forms.\n\n‣‣ VOICE COACH. When enabled and configured, voice coach will be telling you active track distance and duration as well as current speed and altitude.\n\n‣‣ MAPS. Google's native, Apple map, Blank map and Offline maps.\n\n‣‣ Siri shortcuts: New Track, Stop Track, Speed limits.\n\n+ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and cellular iPads. All in retina graphics.\n\n+ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KM/H AND KNOTS. Maximum/TOP, average speed, distance traveled.\n\n+ BACKGROUND MODE! Speedometer will work in background if told so and will still warn you with audio alert when exceed a preset speed limit. You can use other apps while speedometer does its job in the background!\n\n+ PRIVACY. Speedometer never shares your location data with 3rd parties or ad agencies. Location data is used solely for tracking your speed and recording the GPS tracks and never leave the app unless you decide to share by means of a track export. It always let you know when background mode is on and never runs in background unless it is explicitly told to do so.\n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone as well as on any cellular iPad. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS (external GPS module is required). \n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nDrive safely, keep the log and notes and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal companion no matter what journey you are going on!"

More than directions from points A to B, PlanARoute gives you directions from points A to Z.\n\nUse it to plan or record a tour or any other multi-stop journey.\n\nInterested in knowing where you have been but do not want to waste battery power running your device’s GPS?  Just take a photo at key points in your journey and PlanARoute will plot on a map those photos and generate a route with addresses, distances and directions from those photos. \n\nIncluded are two example tour routes (New York and Central Park) which demonstrate the features of PlanARoute. No need to learn complex software. View and play with these example tours to learn how to use this app and use them as a model on how to create your own routes. \n\nFeatures:\n\n▪ Create walking, cycling or driving routes of up to 26 locations while connected to the internet.\n▪ Create point-to-point routes with an unlimited number of locations even when your device is not connected to the internet.\n▪ Preserves your privacy by storing your data on your device, not on a website, you have to log into to use.  (Data is stored on your device not in iCloud, so try to backup your device periodically).\n▪ Sync routes among your devices and the devices of your friends and associates by emailing the route to them.\n▪ An unlimited number of routes can be saved and viewed even when your device is not connected to the internet.\n▪ Emailed routes have a image of your route, a text description of your route, and both GPX and KML attachments that can be loaded into Google Maps and Earth or GPS devices.\n▪ Add locations to a route by touching the map, selecting an address from your Contacts or Favorites library or by typing an address in the search area.\n▪ Locations can also be added based upon the location of photos on your device or in iCloud.\n▪ View a slideshow from any photos in your route.\n▪ Locations can have their order, address and distance displayed on the map.\n▪ Locations can be displayed on your map while not being included in your route's path.\n▪ Locations can have a photo and note description attached to them and saved into a Favorites library. \n▪ Location address information can be added to your Contacts Address book.\n▪ The order of locations can be modified or reversed.\n▪ Both visual and written directions with distance and time estimates are created for a route.\n▪ Distances are measured in miles or kilometers.\n▪ The distance to a pin location from your current location can be displayed.\n▪ A scale of miles/kilometers is displayed at the top of your map.\n▪ A compass and your directional heading can be displayed (iPhone and iPad only).  \n▪ Standard, satellite, and hybrid maps can be displayed.\n▪ Individual Locations can be passed to and opened in Apple Maps or Google Maps (if installed). \n▪ If desired, an elevation chart can be created for a route."

Damit entfällt das Warten auf die Monatsübersicht und Sie können die Gebühr direkt bei Ihrem Kunden abrechnen. (Wichtig: Außerhalb Deutschlands kann Mautomat nicht verwendet werden.)\n\nDie Verwendung ist einfach. Öffnen Sie die App, stellen Sie die Anzahl der Achsen, die Emmissionsklasse und die Gewichtsklasse Ihres LKW ein und drücken Sie auf Start. Damit wird anhand Ihres Positionsverlaufes ermittelt, welche Strecke Sie fahren und welche Gebühr dafür anfällt. Am Ende der Fahrt erhalten Sie eine kurze Übersicht über die gefahrene Distanz und die anfallende Gebühr. Auf Wunsch können Sie Ihre Fahrten in einem Fahrtenbuch speichern lassen. Während der Fahrt wird auf einer Kartenansicht die gefahrene Strecke hervorgehoben. Mautomat lässt sich aber auch bequem und akkuschonend im Hintergrund und bei ausgeschaltetem Display betreiben.\n\nDie ermittelten Positionsdaten werden nicht über die Dauer einer Fahrt hinaus gespeichert, nicht zu Bewegungsprofilen zusammengefasst und nicht an Dritte gesendet oder verkauft. Sobald eine Fahrt in der App beendet wird, werden die ermittelten Positionsdaten gelöscht. Für die Kartendarstellung werden Karten von Apple Maps verwendet, entsprechende Datenschutzbestimmungen finden Sie auf den Webseiten von Apple oder in der App durch Antippen des Buttons 'Legal' in der Kartenansicht (unten links).\n\nProbieren Sie auch meine anderen Apps: \n- Shoptimizer.

      "label": "This app provides complete offline topographic map coverage of the North Island of New Zealand from the LINZ Topo50 1:50k scale map series.  The maps are all contained in the installation so there is no additional need for downloads, no need for phone or wifi signal, no slow server issues, no account signups, no missing tiles, and no additional map fees. Just install for seamless off-line zooming and panning across the whole island down to 1:50k scale. The app also includes 1:50k resolution satellite images for the island, and elevation data.\n\nOther integrated data includes DOC open and restricted hunting permit boundaries, DOC huts, campgrounds, and tracks, Fish and Game access points, and Te Araroa trails. Other datasets can be imported.\n\nThe app has a full suite of navigation functions including GPS location, compass orientation, distance to map locations, track recording and graphing, route creation and following, import/export of gpx and kml files, search functions for named places and user data. Add and edit your own locations and routes and plot elevation profiles. Uses an intuitive simple interface, with one-touch access to all functions.\n\nLINZ TOPO250 series maps are used at lower zoom levels for easier navigation.\n\nPerfect for outback use out of cell phone range. GPS and maps function fully without phone coverage. No need to cache files in advance either as they are all fully installed with the app. Popular with trampers, hikers, runners, bikers, search and rescue (SAR), hunters, boaters, as well as survey applications.\n\nNote that continuous use of GPS will run down the battery faster than when not using the GPS. The NZTopo50 app gives you full control over when GPS is used. The map can be used without GPS, intermittently with GPS for spot checking of location, continuously for logging while the app is open, or for continuous background logging when the phone is off. \n\nCheck our website for links to user guides and useful tips and tricks.\n\nFeel free to get in touch with any suggestions."

      "label": "***  Hot Air has been featured in the Ballooning Journal  twice!  ***  \n\nHot Air is a flight logging and tracking application made especially for hot air balloon pilots! It's like having a log book and data recorder in your pocket! Hot air is loaded with lots of different features; many based on pilot feedback from around the world.\n\n---------------------------\nMajor Features:\n---------------------------\n\n- Real-time tracking! Great for improving situationally awareness, see your current location on a map or satellite imagery\n\n- Waypoints to show your distance, bearing, and ETE to a target location\n\n- Offline maps available\n\n- Record your entire flight path (you can even turn your screen off during recording)! Then you can export your flight to your computer and view it in 3D using Google Earth\n\n- KML/KMZ overlays! Add custom overlay data to the real-time flight maps (can be used to map out electric lines, friendly or unfriendly places to land, denoting special airspaces, include information such as radio frequencies or phone numbers, etc.).\n\n- Wind data tracking - records wind speed and direction at the various altitudes as you fly\n\n- Integration of the Glympse location sharing service to allow ground crew, family, or others to track your flight in real-time. They can track you using almost any device with a data connection. \n\n- Flight Log- the log makes it easy to track information common to all pilots such as crew members, passengers, maximum envelope temperature, and propane used. The log also makes saving takeoff and landing locations convenient, thanks to the iPhone’s GPS or triangulation capabilities; plus, it has a \"favorites\" list for takeoff locations. The log can also aid in flight planning and separates future flights from past flights using a simple color-coding scheme. \n\n- Flight Data Summary: this tab quickly tallies flights and hours flown. The summary includes a total of all flights or just the ones made within the past 90 days. Plus a summary of the crew used for past flights.\n\n- Summary Map: on the map tab, the logged flights that have a saved takeoff and landing location can be plotted and compared on an interactive map \n\n- Data export: export your flight log in HTML, KML (for viewing in Google Earth), and GPX (GPS Exchange)\n\n- Data backup and restore - to be certain your data is safe!\n\n- Comprehensive payload calculator\n\n- Measure Tool\n\n- View weather conditions and forecasts from within the app\n\n- Universal app - works on iPad (landscape and portrait) as well as the iPhone and iPod touch! \n\n- Facebook integration - it is easy to post a quick summary of your latest flight to Facebook and even includes a link to a map! \n\n- Real-time tracking heading projection-line option\n\n---------------------------\nThis app includes translations in English, French, Czech, and Slovak!\n---------------------------\n\nNote: During real-time flight mode the GPS is continuously running in the background which can significantly decrease battery life."

And now, in version 2.0 you also get an intuitive graph that shows sunrise, sunset, moonrise, moonset, and moon phase at a glance. Save recent locations, find locations using GPS location, and save graphs for later.\n\nTides have a great influence on the lives of boaters, fishermen, surfers, coastal communities, marine life, and vacationers just to name a few. Directly or indirectly, the great flow of our massive ocean bodies of water impact the daily lives of everyone on this planet.\n\nThe cyclical movement of the Earth's tides are caused by a combination of the gravitational forces of the sun and moon as well as the shape of the costal region. Unlike simple tide clocks that you can buy in novelty stores, more accurate tide predictions use special data gathered by instruments located at each tide station. The data from these measurements are used to determine the harmonic components which then feed into the mathematical algorithms which predict tides for the future. The end results are tested for accuracy and adjustments are made as necessary.\n\nTide Graph has US owned Tide Stations Only. An internet connection is required to get the latest tide graph. - See TideGraph.com for a complete list of stations."

      "label": "NMEA Monitor is a powerful, easy-to-use tool to record and display a wealth of real-time information directly from NMEA or AIS WiFi devices such as the Vesper Marine XB8000. Information is sourced in real-time directly from the connected AIS device and data is logged to a file on your device which you can view directly on your mobile device, or email to yourself for later data analyses and archiving. Information is also displayed and updated in real-time on the screen of your mobile device during the logging process.\n\nView, display and log a wide range of real-time measurements, including:\n\nGPS position\nSatellites in View\nPosition error estimates\nGPS DOP and active satellites\nTrack-made-good and ground speed\nRecommended minimum GPS data\nReceived AIS data\nReceived Wind data\nAnd many others\nWith NMEA Monitor you can view, access and log all the NMEA sentences being broadcast from your AIS device. Use this data log to answer a wealth of questions including: \n\nexactly how fast is my ship?\nexactly where did my ship go?\nwhat is the average and maximum speed of my ship?\nhow fast was the wind? maximum wind speed? direction?\nwhat are the polars for my boat?\nNMEA Monitor is very easy to use: Simply start and view your measurements with one touch of a button. NMEA Monitor does require that your iPhone or iPad be connected to the same wifi internet connection as your NMEA/AIS device. You do not need to know the exact IP address of your NMEA device as this app has AUTOSCAN capabilities. However you should know the default port number (or accept the default settings on the app for your AIS. The default for Vesper Marine XB8000 is 39150).\n\nNMEA Monitor communicates wirelessly with your AIS device. To use NMEA Monitor you need to own or have access to an NMEA device such as the Vesper Marine XB8000. All your NMEA data is stored strictly on your device only and never transmitted elsewhere. You own your data and you only have access to it.\n\nTo get started, launch the app, select its Settings tab, and enter IP address of your AIS device (if known), and port number. If unknown, be sure to enable AUTOSCAN (on by default). You may disable the AUTOSCAN feature here if you know for certain the IP address of your NMEA device and are certain you do not need AUTOSCAN. In that case be sure to enter the correct IP address.\nEnsure your mobile device is connected to the same WiFi network as your NMEA device. Then from the \"DISPLAY\" module of the app, tap on the \"CONNECT\" button at the top right corner of the screen.\nOnce you have selected CONNECT, the app will try to establish a connection with your NMEA device through the WiFi network. If AUTOSCAN is enabled, the app will methodically scan the network searching for an active NMEA device, and will connect to the first one it finds. If AUTOSCAN is disabled, the app will try only the IP address saved in the SETTINGS module, and give-up if no NMEA device is found there. It is recommended that you enable AUTOSCAN if you are unsure of the IP address of your NMEA device.\nWith AUTOSCAN enabled, the first scan may take a few minutes. When the app scans and finds an NMEA device, it remembers its IP address, such that the next time you try to use the app it should connect much faster - almost instantaneously.\nThe primary dash displays of the app will show all the transmitted NMEA sentences in real time, as well as stream the live raw data in the lower portion of the screen.\nAll runs will automatically be logged and the raw log files will be available under the \"Log Files\" module of this app.\nYou can view raw data from current and past log files from the \"Log Files\" module of this app. You can email these log files to yourself, or export them to your other apps. The log files are text-based comma-delimitted files (CSV), which you should be able to view with a wide variety of common apps or text editors.\n\nNdili Technologies, Inc. has no affiliation to, and is not associated or sponsored by any AIS / NMEA company."

      "label": "“Awesome!!! The best speed app on iphone” 5 Stars by kurtonic\n\nSpeed Box is a Speedometer and GPS app for both your iPhone and iPad. It displays your current speed, distance, direction and altitude along with your top speed and average speed. The app also keeps a record of the speed and altitude for the last few hours.\n\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n========================\n\n* MPH, KM/H and KNOTS\n* Show decimal speed (e.g. \"45.7 mph\")\n* One app for both the iPhone and iPad\n* \"Speak speed\" - Tap screen to have the speed spoken to you\n* 11 Analog and digital speedometers\n* Map view\n* Maximum and average speed\n* Altitude \n* Digital compass \n* HUD display to see speed in windshield \n* Odometer to measure distance traveled \n* Chart of the traveled speed and altitude \n* Warning signal when driving too fast \n* Export last 3 hours of data \n* Change maximum displayed speed on speedometer \n* Swipe finger over chart to display historic data \n* Display GPS accuracy by tapping the indicator in the top left corner \n\n\nUSER REVIEWS\n========================\n\n5 Stars by Darekakuta \n\"Just what I needed. My '58 chev's speedo doesn't work. This did the trick.\" \n\n5 Stars by Rawd \n\"Great My 79 Firebird speedo only goes to 140 kmh. ;). This worked perfectly.\" \n\n5 Stars \n\"Within 1 mile per hour +/- Great Job!\" \n\nSpeedBox was one of the very early Speedometer Apps for the iPhone. Take advantage of my experience and the refined algorithms that can get a much greater accuracy from the iPhone then a lot of other apps. I regularly update my application to make it even more accurate and usable. \n\nUsers have already used our application to verify the accuracy of their car's speedometer or they tried measuring the speed they achieved while skiing. Can you come up with more ideas? How about measuring the speed of the airplane you travel with? \n\nUSAGE NOTES\n========================\nThe \"GPS strength\" indicator in the top left corner should display a green dot. You can tap this indicator to display the current GPS accuracy.\n\nPlease allow the application up to a minute to find enough satellites to work correctly. \n\nIf you get a message to enable GSP, please go to ”Settings > General > Location Services“ on your iPhone and check if the little switch is set to \"On\" for Speed Box as well as for \"Location Services\" in general. \n\nATTENTION iPod touch users! Unfortunately this app doesn't work very well on the iPod touch and the iPad WiFI (without 3G) since these devices are missing a GPS!\n\n\nFEEDBACK\n========================\nIf you've got any wishes or suggestions for new features, please let me know with the contact form on this application's website (see link below).\n\nI am already working on the next update!"

      "label": "Theodolite is a multi-function viewfinder that combines a compass, two-axis inclinometer, rangefinder, GPS, map, nav calculator, and geo-overlay photo/movie camera into one indispensable app. Theodolite was one of the very first augmented reality (AR) apps when it was released in 2009, and it’s been downloaded and used by millions of customers since then. Uses are endless, and the app is great for land measurements, outdoor sports, sightseeing, navigation, and finding your way around. Theodolite is a pro grade app and is used extensively by surveyors, geologists, architects, engineers, competitive sportsmen, first responders, military personnel, and search and rescue workers around the world. \n\nTheodolite lets you take data-overlay photos and movies with 2X-8X zoom. Overlay geographical data, angle markings, date/time, author/company info, and project notes directly on photos and movies for later reference. The same data is written into the metadata record of images, making image files self-contained data records. Third-party apps can tap into Theodolite's advanced camera functions with a camera sharing feature.\n\nView current position on the built-in map with optional offline Outdoors maps that include topo contours, roads, trails, landmarks, campgrounds, ski lifts, and more. Live map markers continually update distance/heading relative to the current location and also show wayfinding info in the main viewfinder. Draw polygons on the map to mark things like property boundaries and trails, and import/export polygon data via KML.\n\nShare map markers and nav calculator points with other users of Theodolite via text messages or e-mail. This powerful capability opens up a wide range of collaborative uses including team land surveying, accident investigations, spotting wild fires, triangulation of landmarks, and advanced tactical observation and targeting. With an optional in-app purchase to enable team tracking, you can share location with up to 20 people on Theodolite's map.\n\nTheodolite includes features for serious users like a reference angle mode, nav calculator, map marker import/export, manual and automatic data logging with CSV and KML export, clipboard integration, %grade display, mil compass readout, optical rangefinders (including a mil-based reticle, sniper-style stadiametric graphs, and a variable 4X-24X scope), and night filters to improve use in dark conditions.\n\nTheodolite can provide location in military grid reference system (MGRS) coordinates, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, British/Irish National Grids, US National Grid, Maidenhead locator system, Map Grid of Australia, and six latitude/longitude formats. Optional US State Plane coordinates include SPCS27 and SPCS83 zones covering all US States. The optional Datum Pack adds over 230 geodetic datums to the app to improve position computation from GPS data, covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.\n\nAR Layers include navigational aids like the sun, moon, planets, and Polaris (North star), and the optional US Mountain Summits layer that shows over 70,000 US mountain summits in the viewfinder.\n\nTheodolite has been shown in Apple Keynotes, featured on the App Store, and has been a #1 selling Navigation app in App Stores around the world. Since its introduction in 2009, Theodolite has defined augmented reality navigation. The app continually introduces new technologies, pushing the limits of iOS app development and taking advantage of new hardware capabilities.\n\nFind out why Apple named Theodolite one of the most amazing apps available and showed it being used to explore the Great Wall of China. Where will you take it on your next adventure?\n\nNote: Theodolite is an iPhone app -- see “Theodolite HD” for use on an iPad. And be sure to check out the all-new \"Theodolite for Watch\" and put Theodolite on your wrist!"

      "label": "More infos at gps-tracker-tool.de (support url).\n\nWHAT IT'S NOT\n- You can NOT track other phones with this app! This is a \"remote control\" for one of the dedicated hardware GPS trackers from the list of compatible models.\n- You cannot send SMS from iPod/iPad devices. However, you can still use the LIVE tracking features.\n\nMAJOR FEATURES\n- app will draft SMS commands for you - no need to carry around the tracker's manual\n- built-in compass for off-road navigation to tracker location\n- offers cell triangulation as fallback\n- reverse geocoding\n- administration of multiple trackers\n- visual set-up of geo-fence\n- configurable unit system (mi, km/h – m, ft)\n- quick commands = easy accessible custom commands\n- in-app purchases to enable the LIVE tracking features for some models: Trip history, trip start & end alerts, speed alert, geo fences, KML export\n\nINCOMING SMS\nYou just copy the whole incoming SMS and switch to the app. It will then try to match it against known formats. All data can then usually be visualized on the map. Please understand that iOS DOES NOT ALLOW to intercept incoming SMS automatically! Some tracker models can be monitored via the internet.\n \nSUPPORTED TRACKER MODELS\nAnywhere (TK 108),\nAsta (EV07S*),\nELRO (GPS1),\nConcox (GT02, GT011, GT 100),\nIncutex (TK 5000*, TK 104, TK 105*, TK 106, TK 116),\nmeitrack (VT 310 v6, VT 310 v7),\nPAJ* (Allround, Easy, Gold, Motorcycle, Mini, Personal, Power, Professional),\nSimvalley (GT 60, GT 170, GT 280),\nTKstar* (Bike, 720, 816 OBD, 901, 905, 909, 915),\nToplovo (TL 202),\nWonde Proud (SPT 10, VT 10),\nXexun* (TK 101, TK 102, TK 102-2, TK 102v6, TK 103, TK 103-2, TK 104, TK 106, TK 201, TK 201-2, TK 202, TK 203, TK 206, XT 009)\n* InApp live tracking via Internet for these models possible. After you made the tracker connect to the server, the feature can be activated with an InApp purchase.\nModel names might not always be unique amongst manufacturers, so if your tracker came with a manual, you can check for compatibility here: https://gps-tracker-tool.de/compatibility/ (see also support-url)\n\nKNOWN PROBLEMS\n- Please note that while you can send iMessages, you cannot send SMS from an iPad or iPod and therefore you would have very limited functionality on these devices. Still, an iPad would be a good choice for the LIVE tracking part.\n- Since iOS 10, short messages which contain links will be broken up into two. This makes copying a whole message impossible. You might have to miss out on the app's ability to visualize an incoming message from certain trackers.\n\n(If you experience any problem or have a feature request, please send us an e-mail. You find the address in the app's help section.)"

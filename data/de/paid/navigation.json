      "label": "This app provides complete offline topographic map coverage of the South Island of New Zealand from the LINZ Topo50 1:50k scale map series.  The maps are all contained in the installation so there is no additional need for downloads, no need for phone or wifi signal, no slow server issues, no account signups, no missing tiles, and no additional map fees. Just install for seamless off-line zooming and panning across the whole island down to 1:50,000 scale. The app also includes 1:50k resolution satellite images for the island and elevation data.\n\nOther integrated data includes DOC open and restricted hunting permit boundaries, DOC huts, campgrounds, and tracks, Fish and Game access points, and Te Araroa trails. Other datasets can be imported.\n\nThe app has a full suite of navigation functions including GPS location, compass orientation, distance to map locations, track recording and graphing, route creation and following, import/export of gpx and kml files, search functions for named places and user data. Add and edit your own locations and routes and plot elevation profiles. Uses an intuitive simple interface, with one-touch access to all functions.\n\nLINZ TOPO250 series maps are used at lower zoom levels for easier navigation.\n\nPerfect for outback use out of cell phone range. GPS and maps function fully without phone coverage. No need to cache files in advance either as they are all fully installed with the app. Popular with trampers, hikers, runners, bikers, search and rescue (SAR), hunters, boaters, as well as survey applications.\n\nNote that continuous use of GPS will run down the battery faster than when not using the GPS. The NZTopo50 app gives you full control over when GPS is used. The map can be used without GPS, intermittently with GPS for spot checking of location, continuously for logging while the app is open, or for continuous background logging when the phone is off. \n\nCheck our website for links to user guides and useful tips and tricks.\n\nFeel free to get in touch with any suggestions."

      "label": "What is WikiFarms Australia?\n\nWikiFarms Australia is the essential application for backpackers looking for a farm job in Australia. Whether you are looking for a casual job during your trip or aiming to complete your 88 days of farm work to get your Second Year Visa, WikiFarms Australia will be your guide!\nThe application will help you to be in direct contact with farmers by making available a map with thousands of farms around Australia!\nThe database is always growing and constantly being updated by our team: companies are added weekly, contacts are regularly verified, making it the largest database for fruit picking jobs in Australia! With more than 2000 companies listed in the app you’ll have all the information you need to find a farm job quickly.\n\n \nSo do not wait to get the best farm job tool available in Australia!\n\n \nWhat can I do with the app?\n\nWikiFarms Australia makes it easy to find a farm. Simply use the map screen to see exactly where are located the farms. Then tap a site to bring up its description. It will show you the name of the company, type of crops, phone number, and, for some of them, website and email. You can then call the farmers directly from the app and ask them if they need workers. If you are ready to go, you can also start an itinerary from your current location and ask them in person!\n\nThe app also allows you to use filters. If you are looking to work in a specific area or to pick a specific type of fruit during a specific time, you can do that!\n\nThe app lists also tons of working hostels, tourism offices, working agencies that can give you more information or help to find a job in a specific area.\n\nWith the app you can also calculate your 88 days of farm work easily and see if you’re ready to apply for the Second (or Third soon!) Year Visa.\n\n \nWho made WikiFarms Australia?\n\nFellow backpackers like you created WikiFarms Australia! When we were looking for farm work to get our Second Year Visa, we really struggled knowing where to look for farms! There was some information here and there but nothing really consistent. This is when we started to think about a tool that will have all the farmers at once and WikiFarms Australia started just like that J\n\n \nWhy is the app not free?\n\nWe are a very small team working on this project for more than 2 years! As a result, the profit of the app really helps us to make it better day after day. In addition, it also contributes to our travelling passion (which we are sure that if you are here you can relate!)\n\nIn addition, you certainly think that most apps are free, but are they really? Most of the time, free apps are full of unwanted and annoying ads and you often have to pay more to have the full use of it.\n\nWe made the choice to offer a complete, advertising-free experience for as low of a price as we could make it. Consider that half the price you pay for it goes to taxes and Google share.\n\nThe application helps you get what you need the most, find a farm job, and when you will get it, its price will be covered in less than half an hour of work!\n\nThanks for your purchase and we hope that you’ll have a good experience with our app!\n\n \nFeel free to join us on our Facebook page or to visit our website:\nhttps://wikifarmsaustralia.com/\n\n \nAre you a farmer looking for workers? You can contact us at: info.wikifarms@gmail.com\nWe will answer you within 24h."

The app offers conversions for the Swissgrid coordinate system in Switzerland and for various WGS84 formats. Furthermore, the typed coordinates or the current location can be displayed on the map. The map needs an internet connection. In addition, the app offers various tools such as ASCII, numbers to letters, text to numbers, rotation, bearing and distance between two coordinates, prime numbers checker, waypoint projection with current position, Roman numerals, temperature units, number systems, Wherigo Reverse solver, tool for Multi-Cache with calculator.\nSwissGEO Tools was in 2012 the first app which had interactive code tables. The big collection of interactive code tables continues to be an important part of CacheToolBox. Outdoors, you can decode the encrypted messages smartly with the \"symbol keyboards\" which were displayed in plain text without any Internet connection. CacheToolBox now also offers the opposite way: simple encryption of plain text by keyboard in symbolic characters!\nThere are currently 108 code tables available.\nIn future, more tables and tools will follow in free updates! \n\nSummary of all functions of CacheToolBox:\n\ncurrent location\n\n- coordinates WGS84 DD.DDD°\n- coordinates WGS84 DD° MM.MMM°\n- coordinates swissgrid CH1903+\n- Indication of altitude\n- GPS accuracy\n- show location on map\n- copy coordinates from current location and insert within the app\n\ndiff. maps: Swiss Map® and OSM (automatic switching)\n\n- Swiss: Swiss Map@ scaling 1:25’000 with the option to show hiking trails\n- other countries: OSM\n- resolution of map: low – normal - high\n\ncoordinates conversion\n\n- convert WGS84 DD.DDD°\n- convert WGS84 DD° MM.MMM’\n- convert WGS84 DD° MM’ SS.SSS\"\n- convert swissgrid CH1903+\n- coordinates switching N-S and E-W\n- show location on map\n- copy/paste coordinates and insert within the app\n- share current position by mail, message, WhatsApp\n\ncode-tables\n\n- 108 interactive code-tables for decoding symbol characters\n- symbol keyboards decodes encrypted messages directly to letters\n- simple encryption of plain text by keyboard in symbolic characters\n- no internet connection needed\n- more code-tables will follow in free updates!\n\ntools\n\n- ASCII\n- morse code\n- numbers to letters: 0=A, 1=A, 26=A\n- letter to numbers: sum, digit sum, alternated, product\n- rotation: rot5, rot13, rot18, rot47 and shift by hand (caesar)\n- distance and bearing between two coordinates\n- prime numbers: check prime numbers, prime factorization, search prime number\n- waypoint projection: WGS84 with degree or artillery per milles, distance in meter or feet (english)\n- Roman numerals: convert Roman to arabic or vice versa\n- temperature units: celsius – kelvin – fahrenheit – rankine - réamur \n- number systems: binary – decimal – octal – hexadecimal and more\n- Wherigo Reverse solver\n- Tool for Multi-Cache with calculator\n\nInfo\n\n- settings\n- conversion unit length: meter – feet (english)\n- rate app\n- legal notice\n- link to support website\n\nlanguages\n\n- English\n- German\n- French"

Using the GPS features of this app can significantly affect battery life. Only leave GPS enabled when you need to use it. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Pocket Earth only uses GPS in the background for route navigation and gps track recording features. \n   2. This app uses data from the amazing community driven open mapping project called openstreetmap.org!  Coverage detail may vary by region, please visit our website to check the map detail for your regions of interest.\n   3. Does not currently support all asian texts on the map (Chinese, Japanese, etc)."

      "label": "Theodolite was one of the earliest augmented reality (AR) apps for iOS when it debuted in 2009 -- in fact Theodolite was pioneering AR technology before \"AR\" was even a buzzword! In the time since, Theodolite has been used by millions of consumers and professionals in their outdoor adventures and on the job. Now, we've taken the Theodolite concept to Apple Watch by combining a compass, inclinometer, GPS, and maps into one indispensable app that sits on your wrist. We're excited to keep evolving this centuries-old instrument as hardware and software technologies allow the concept to come to new device formats.\n\nOn iPhone and iPad, Theodolite uses a viewfinder format, uniting the device sensors (GPS, magnetometer, gyro, accelerometer) and camera.  On Apple Watch, Theodolite combines data from these sensors into an AHRS (attitude and heading reference system) layout similar to what you'd see in the glass cockpit of a modern aircraft. This layout allows Theodolite to efficiently display compass bearing (yaw angle), pitch angle, and roll angle in a compact format that works extremely well on a small screen.  This information is augmented by latitude, longitude, and altitude from GPS, as well as sun and moon position.\n\nNew in Theodolite for Watch version 2 is a map screen and waypoint manager.  You can add waypoints on the map or at your current location, and view waypoints on the compass ring to visualize their bearing from your current location.\n\nTheodolite has settings for compass mode (true or magnetic), distance/altitude units (feet or meters), and position format (decimal degrees, degrees-minutes-seconds, MGRS, USNG, UTM, UTM-B, and Maidenhead Locator System).  Users can choose to display an artificial horizon in the center of the app display (tied to pitch and roll) and can set the app's level reference to flat or vertical orientations of the Watch.  The app has six color schemes, including two night vision modes - midnight red and luminescent green.\n\nTheodolite for Watch is recommended for Apple Watch Series 5 and later (including Ultra).  Apple Watch Series 4 and older do not have a compass sensor and will not show compass data.  On older devices, the app uses the device's gyro sensor to measure rotation.  You can twist the watch's digital crown to adjust and calibrate the gyro to the sun position, moon position, or a known bearing.  Using these references, the \"gyro compass\" is able to give bearing.  The calibration can be repeated as often as desired to give accurate results.\n\nTheodolite reports accuracy from the magnetometer sensor in your Watch.  To improve results, operate Theodolite away from magnets, electronics, or sources of electro-magnetic interference, including car dashboards, aircraft cockpits, metal structures, and other devices.\n\nLike all our apps, we plan to continually improve and evolve Theodolite for Watch.  Please contact us with feature requests, suggestions, and general feedback.  We'd love to hear what you're doing with the app!  And if you don't already have Theodolite for your iPhone or iPad, check it out!"

Sie sind z.B. Handelsvertreter, Außendienstler etc. - perfekt wir haben die Lösung! In unseren \"RouteOptimizer\" geben Sie einfach in beliebiger Reihenfolge Ihre Ziele ein - oder wählen sie direkt im Adressbuch aus. Als Ergebnis erhalten Sie die optimale Tourenplanung! Im besten Fall haben Sie Ihre Investition in die App nach der ersten Fahrt bereits an Kraftstoff eingespart.\n\nRouteOptimizer ersetzt also kein Navigationssystem sondern ermittelt die optimale Reihenfolge inkl. Wegbeschreibung der \"anzufahrenden\" Ziele, also eine Funktion über die kaum ein \"Navigationsystem\" am Markt verfügt - Sie können dann natürlich so, Ihre optimal ermittelte \"Zwischenziel\" Reihenfolge in Ihr Navigationssystem eingeben. Für jede einzelne \"Tourenplanung\" sind aufgrund der komplexen Berechnung bis zu 8 Ziele im Kauf enthalten. Dies lässt sich per InApp Kauf auf 16 oder max. 24 Zwischenziele erweitern, es handelt sich um einen InApp Kauf der nur einmalig ausgeführt werden muss kein Abo keine versteckten Kosten.\n\nWir wünschen Ihnen viele \"eingesparte\" Kilometer - egal ob Sie viele Ziele in einer Stadt anfahren müssen oder überregional unterwegs sind!\n\n(Das  berechnen der optimalen Route benötigt eine Datenverbindung).\n\n- RouteOptimizer Tourenplanung iPhone | iPad\n- Streckenübergabe direkt an Navigations App\n- Streckenbeschreibung"

Intuitive and easy navigation through all informations and details. No overloading menus or endless cascading dialogs. \nColored Metar informations and graphical TAF timeline gives you a easy understanding of the weather situation. \n\nVFRInfo is not a replacement of a regular flight planning or an EFIS glas cockpit. VFRInfo is a intuitive supplement, which is convincing by its simplicity.

      "label": "The legendary iOS compass app is now available for Apple Watch!  Pro Compass replicates the look and feel of classic pocket compass hardware in use since the 1800s.  The app uses advanced graphics technologies (normally reserved for games) to render 3D floating compass hardware for realistic operation.\n\nPro Compass offers true and magnetic compass modes using a damped rosette-style compass ring.  Local sun and moon position are shown on the compass ring and continually updated.  Pro Compass also displays location and altitude, with decimal and degree-minute-second formats.  The app contains a built-in two-axis inclinometer that drives two independent bubble levels and a bullseye level. \n\nNew in Pro Compass for Watch version 2 is a map screen and waypoint manager.  You can add waypoints on the map or at your current location, and view waypoints on the compass ring to visualize their bearing from your current location.\n\nPro Compass has settings for compass mode (true or magnetic), distance/altitude units (feet or meters), and position format (decimal degrees, degrees-minutes-seconds, MGRS, USNG, UTM, UTM-B, and Maidenhead Locator System).  The app has six color schemes, including two night vision modes - midnight red and luminescent green.\n\nPro Compass for Watch is recommended for Apple Watch Series 5 and later (including Ultra).  Apple Watch Series 4 and older do not have a compass sensor and will not show compass data.  On older devices, the app uses the device's gyro sensor to measure rotation.  You can twist the watch's digital crown to adjust and calibrate the gyro to the sun position, moon position, or a known bearing.  Using these references, the \"gyro compass\" is able to give bearing.  The calibration can be repeated as often as desired to give accurate results.\n\nAccuracy note: Pro Compass reports accuracy from the magnetometer sensor in your watch.  To improve results, operate Pro Compass away from magnets, electronics, or sources of electro-magnetic interference, including car dashboards, aircraft cockpits, metal structures, and other devices.\n\nDeveloper note: like all our apps, we plan to continually improve and evolve Pro Compass for Watch.  Please contact us with feature requests, suggestions, and general feedback.  We'd love to hear what you're doing with the app!"

Checklists \nApp comes with a ready Light Airplane Template and a ready checklist set for the Cirrus SR22-G3 and G3 models. \nYou can easily add items or even checklists to the checklist set. \nOther Checklist sets as in-app purchases: Cessna 172, 182, Piper Warrior and Archer.\nAll checklist sets from the store can be downloaded as often as required, edited and saved. \nAll checklist sets can be shared by eMail if the recipient owns the basic checklist of that airplane. \nSend checklist sets to yourself to save them on your computer or in a cloud service. Or install them on a second iPad. \nMake your own checklists for the categories Normal, Abnormal and Emergency and save them in the right category (Ground, Taxi…) of the checklist set for your airplane \nAll checklists you create can be read to you \n\nII. Checklist Usage and Setting\nChecklists can be displayed as text only or shown as text and be read to the pilot/crew at the same time. \nChecklist items (text or audio) can also be completed manually one at a time by simply tapping the screen.\nIf the whole checklist is read automatically then the reading can always be stopped and resumed by one tap on the screen.\nSome Checklist groups (Ground, Taxi, Takeoff…) can be forwarded automatically by GPS. \nMove and sort the icons on the screen according to your needs.\nYour edited checklists will be preserved with each new version of smartCHECK (we still recommend saving them). \n\nIII. Automatic Altitude Callouts on Take-off (especially important for pilots of airplanes with BRS or CAPS system) \nHeight AGL* above the Take-off runway can be announced („five hundred“). \nPilot can either set one Height AGL* to be announced or a range between 100 and 1000 feet.\nElevation above Take-off runway can be displayed in large numbers at the same time. \nCirrus Aircraft Checklists contain a special CAPS checklist.\nAfter Take-off Checklists can be activated and read automatically and hands off.  \n\nIV. Integrated Document Browser: Access all your Documents, Tables or Manuals with one tap \nDocument Browser. Create green icons, give them a name and import any PDF or JPEG document. you might want to access with one tap. \nImport PDF documents like Avionics Manuals or Performance tables. \nEvery document is accessible with tapping its icon.\nUse the camera of your iPad to create a document on the spot. \nNotepad feature.\n\nV. Other Tools and Settings\nOil Log: Enter the Oil status of your engine, how much oil you added and the app calculates the oil consumption per flight hour.\nFuel Switch Timer: Select an interval and get an onscreen and audio reminder to switch your tanks.\nControl brightness of screen in the app or use the red Night Mode. \nSwitch the audio feature on/off.\nSwitch on/off automatic forwarding of flight phases. Or swipe groups manually.\nAuto voice on/off. Auto voice means: The app reads the complete checklist and goes back to the main menu when checklist is completed.\nWhen using checklists without auto voice each tap on the screen will read one item (manual audio mode).\nIf used without audio each tap will only mark each item/line green (manual text mode). \nMove checklist icons to other place on the screen by sliding them to a new position.\nFilter which checklist types you want to have displayed with a simple toggle switch. This way you can reduce the number of icons on the screen. \n\nMore information: www.airwork.biz \nHardware Requirements: smartCHECK will work on every iPad and iPad mini."

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer, GPS tracker and trip cost monitor for iPhones and cellular iPads. \n∙∙ When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! \n∙∙ The cost monitor shows you the current cost of the journey as you drive and tells you each passengers share. \n∙∙ GPS tracker records your trips so they can be analyzed, viewed and shared at any moment.\n\n‣‣ COST MONITOR. What's the cost of my driving?\nBased on gas price for a gallon or litre, MPG (U.S. or UK) or liters per 100 km the app will tell you what the cost is as you drive. You can add an extra cost per kilometer or mile! Useful for all cost aware drivers and for splitting the cost between passengers.\n\n‣‣ GPS TRACKING. Where I've been? How long did it take to get from A to B? \nSpeedometer records your trip statistics even when GPS tracker is switched off. When you need point by point data to see on the map later or export (Google Earth and GPX), speedometer gives you the first class GPS tracker.\n\n‣‣ INFOTAINMENT. \nWhen switched on, infotainment shows trip stats or weather/wind forecast  when you wait. Way better than just showing you a 0 speed!\n\n‣‣ Easy to set speed limits and SPEED LIMIT MEMORY option\nSet speed limits with 4 or 8 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! With SPEED LIMIT MEMORY you just apply the speed limit once and the app applies it for you automatically the next time!\n\n‣‣ MODES\nUse MENU>MODES to turn the app into a Rally computer, G-Force monitor, Camera alerter or taximeter! Currently there are 12 modes available and we are constantly adding new ones.\n\n‣‣ WAYPOINTS.\nSpeedometer gives you the unique way to leave a note with location and even optional photo or audio note attached! As easy as double tap on the big speed digits! You'll find more in a documentation section (star button).\n\n‣‣ RED LIGHT & SPEED CAMERAS\nImport camera data into speedometer in Garmin or iGO csv formats from poi-factory.com, scdb.info or poi-plaza and let speedo alert you on a camera approach and set speed limit automatically before you pass the speed camera!\n\n‣‣ SUNSET/SUNRISE\nWith the sunset and sunrise information that our speedometer provides, you'll be able to avoid driving in the dusk.\n\n‣‣ BARO VSI. Barometric Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI, IVSI) in both scale and graph forms.\n\n‣‣ VOICE COACH. When enabled and configured, voice coach will be telling you active track distance and duration as well as current speed and altitude.\n\n‣‣ MAPS. Google's native, Apple map, Blank map and Offline maps.\n\n‣‣ Siri shortcuts: New Track, Stop Track, Speed limits.\n\n+ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and cellular iPads. All in retina graphics.\n\n+ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KM/H AND KNOTS. Maximum/TOP, average speed, distance traveled.\n\n+ BACKGROUND MODE! Speedometer will work in background if told so and will still warn you with audio alert when exceed a preset speed limit. You can use other apps while speedometer does its job in the background!\n\n+ PRIVACY. Speedometer never shares your location data with 3rd parties or ad agencies. Location data is used solely for tracking your speed and recording the GPS tracks and never leave the app unless you decide to share by means of a track export. It always let you know when background mode is on and never runs in background unless it is explicitly told to do so.\n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone as well as on any cellular iPad. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS (external GPS module is required). \n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nDrive safely, keep the log and notes and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal companion no matter what journey you are going on!"

      "label": "More infos at gps-tracker-tool.de (support url).\n\nWHAT IT'S NOT\n- You can NOT track other phones with this app! This is a \"remote control\" for one of the dedicated hardware GPS trackers from the list of compatible models.\n- You cannot send SMS from iPod/iPad devices. However, you can still use the LIVE tracking features.\n\nMAJOR FEATURES\n- app will draft SMS commands for you - no need to carry around the tracker's manual\n- built-in compass for off-road navigation to tracker location\n- offers cell triangulation as fallback\n- reverse geocoding\n- administration of multiple trackers\n- visual set-up of geo-fence\n- configurable unit system (mi, km/h – m, ft)\n- quick commands = easy accessible custom commands\n- in-app purchases to enable the LIVE tracking features for some models: Trip history, trip start & end alerts, speed alert, geo fences, KML export\n\nINCOMING SMS\nYou just copy the whole incoming SMS and switch to the app. It will then try to match it against known formats. All data can then usually be visualized on the map. Please understand that iOS DOES NOT ALLOW to intercept incoming SMS automatically! Some tracker models can be monitored via the internet.\n \nSUPPORTED TRACKER MODELS\nAnywhere (TK 108),\nAsta (EV07S*),\nELRO (GPS1),\nConcox (GT02, GT011, GT 100),\nIncutex (TK 5000*, TK 104, TK 105*, TK 106, TK 116),\nmeitrack (VT 310 v6, VT 310 v7),\nPAJ* (Allround, Easy, Gold, Motorcycle, Mini, Personal, Power, Professional),\nSimvalley (GT 60, GT 170, GT 280),\nTKstar* (Bike, 720, 816 OBD, 901, 905, 909, 915),\nToplovo (TL 202),\nWonde Proud (SPT 10, VT 10),\nXexun* (TK 101, TK 102, TK 102-2, TK 102v6, TK 103, TK 103-2, TK 104, TK 106, TK 201, TK 201-2, TK 202, TK 203, TK 206, XT 009)\n* InApp live tracking via Internet for these models possible. After you made the tracker connect to the server, the feature can be activated with an InApp purchase.\nModel names might not always be unique amongst manufacturers, so if your tracker came with a manual, you can check for compatibility here: https://gps-tracker-tool.de/compatibility/ (see also support-url)\n\nKNOWN PROBLEMS\n- Please note that while you can send iMessages, you cannot send SMS from an iPad or iPod and therefore you would have very limited functionality on these devices. Still, an iPad would be a good choice for the LIVE tracking part.\n- Since iOS 10, short messages which contain links will be broken up into two. This makes copying a whole message impossible. You might have to miss out on the app's ability to visualize an incoming message from certain trackers.\n\n(If you experience any problem or have a feature request, please send us an e-mail. You find the address in the app's help section.)"

Just keep the path in the center while following the route.\n\nThe App supports Live Activities (iOS 16.1 and later on the iPhone), so the compass and all the directions and distances to the saved places are always visible within the dynamic island (iPhone 14 Pro) and on the lock screen.\n\nThe App supports Voice Over on the iPhone for blind and visually impaired users.\n\nThe Watch App also shows the compass and all directions and distances to all saved places, just like the iPhone App.\n\nThe App respects your privacy. There's no tracking, no ads, no hidden costs, no subscription. It's just doing what you expect: showing the direction to north and other places, help to find your way."

Highly recommend it.\" \n\nThe Mayan People have described, in breathtaking precision, the cycles of both the universe and nature around us. They created a harmonic calendar that is synchronized to all those cycles. Following these cycles can help you get a stronger connection with nature around you and become conscious of your essence.\n\nThis app provides a simple way to sync along those cycles, to raise our frequency and give us a new lens to view both our day-to-day and planetary events.\n\n- Did you ever realize that our (Gregorian) calendar is not a harmonic calendar? \n- Did you know that the moon has 13 (not 12!) orbits around the earth in 1 year? \n- Why do we live with this irregular calendar?\n- Are you interested in Astrology?\n\n-> All this, and more, is explained carefully in this app. (over 15.000 words on 37 pages) Please note that these text are in English language only.\n\nIn the New Time, synchronicity is the norm.\n\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n5 star rating across the world! \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\"Entertaining as well as enlightening\" \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\nMORE INFO: \nwww.1320sync.com \n\n\nFor the beginner this app is a learning tool because it contains an extensive explanation about Tones and Seals and the synchronizing order of the Mayan Astrology. You may think it's difficult at first but soon you will feel how it all connects. \n\n\"This app is great, and allows easy manipulation of dates. I spent years in books doing in hours what I can now do in seconds.\"\n\nFor the ones who are already familiar with the Mayan Calendar this app is a handy tool to navigate the cycles, and calculate the Combined Kin for any given combination.

Download the app now and save on the fines today!\nYou no longer need a stationary video recorder to reduce the risk of misconduct from other drivers or the traffic police. You don't need the radar detector too. With Smart Driver, you already have all this in your smartphone or tablet.\nSmart Driver works in the background mode - you can use it with navigation apps. While you are driving, the app notifies you about road hazards by voice and visual tips, records video with sound in a background mode without stopping other apps.\n\nCurrently the app database includes road hazards for the following countries:\n- Russia\n- Germany\n- Ukraine\n- Belarus\n- Kazakhstan\n- Uzbekistan\n- Turkmenistan\n- Azerbaijan\n- Armenia\n- Georgia\n- Austria\n- Netherlands\n- Spain\n- Belgium\n- Switzerland\n- United States\n- Brazil\n- France\n- Italy\n- Finland\n- Bulgaria\n- Denmark\n- Estonia\n- Poland\n- Romania\n\nThe application available in Russian, English and German languages.\n\nFollow us on VK social network: http://vk.com/public59336195\nOfficial page on Facebook: www.facebook.com/201419256701196?fref=ts\n\nIf you have any comments, ideas, information about missing cameras, or other, please write it here.\n\nPlease note!\nWhen you use the app in the background mode, it can reduce battery life. Don't forget to stop the app, when you don't need it.\nSmart Driver is your assistant, but it can't guarantee the absence of fines, because new cameras and hazards can not immediately be added to the database. Please follow the traffic rules.\n\nKey app features:\n- Alerting about speed cameras and traffic police posts\n- Running in the background with a navigator\n- Support notifications about pair cameras that measure average speed on a road section\n- Video recording\n\nTerms of Service\nhttp://ru-pdd.ru/terms\n\nPrivacy Policy\nhttp://ru-pdd.ru/privacy.php \n\nContact us with any questions:\nsmartdriverhelp@gmail.com"

Great without cellular connection as well, which makes it all the more useful in the backcountry and far away from ASOS/AWOS stations.\n\n* Location Search: Find atmospheric data (Density Altitude, etc.) at any point on Earth, from anywhere!\n\nData Sensed and Calculated (all calculated with humidity):\n\n* Density Altitude \n* GPS Altitude\n* Temperature\n* Altimeter Setting\n* Absolute Pressure\n* Dew Point\n* Relative Humidity\n* Specific Humidity (grains/pound)\n* Air Density\n* Relative Air Density (RAD)\n* Dyno Correction\n\nThe quickest way to get your Density Altitude! On the iPhone 6/6+ and newer iPads, it will use the built-in barometer and GPS. If you're in cell range, you don't need to supply any data. If you're out of cell range, all you need to supply is the outside air temperature. Designed not to need an internet connection, so it will work anytime and anywhere you need it.\n\nGreat tool for pilots, drag racers, engine tuners, golfers, or anyone who needs to conveniently find their Density Altitude, Altimeter Setting, Relative Aid Density (RAD), Specific Humidity or Absolute Pressure.\n\nNo ads or in-app purchases.\n\nWe love feedback!

Watch in full screen, view in AR, search, add filters and so much more!\n\nShip Finder has been top rated and top ranking since 2009 and covers most of the world, tracking 20,000+ ships simultaneously.\n\nOur incredible app performance means that you can see all tracked vessels at once - no clustering here!\nSimply tap a ship to see its name, type, photos, speed, dimensions and much more.\nPowerful features such as filters, search and the ability to save favourite ships are included. (You can choose Apple or Google maps too!).\n\nAdd and browse bookmarks to saved locations around the globe to quickly navigate to areas or ports of interest.\n\nYou can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. \n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

This app is your guide to discovering the unspeakable beauty and recreational potential that is contained within these fabled domains!\n\nWhether you are a seasoned forest wanderer or are just wanting to learn a little more about the amazing places surrounding your home turf, this app is for you! The data is up to date as of Summer, 2022, and contains over 53,000 recreational points and other features on BLM land. These points are symbolized with several color-coded icons that differentiate between the . Categories include Access Points, Boating, Campgrounds, POIs, Vistas, Bathrooms, Parking Lots, Recreational Areas, and much more! The app even distinguishes property boundaries and includes some hiking trails and roads.\n\nNew in this release! We listened to your requests and have added several improvements and new features including a custom My Points tool! Now you can save your own points of interest and give them a unique color and icon. Mark where you park the car, where you saw a neat feature, or an epic campsite. You can even export these points for use with other devices!\n\nOnce using the app, there are five screens. The Guide screen will provide data legends as well as helpful tips for optimizing your navigational experience. On the Info screen, you will find a number of spatial links to the different BLM properties. This is a great way to quickly locate specific places and discover new places to explore! The About screen provides links to all of the open-source resources used in the app and gives a little information about the developer GeoPOI. The Map Settings screen is where you can change between one of four different basemaps, download offline imagery, turn on geolocation, and toggle specific point categories. Finally, the Map screen is where it all comes together!\n\nOn the Map screen, there are a series of circle clusters at distant zooms that indicate how many points are within a given cluster. As you tap the clusters to zoom in, individual points and icons become visible, along with trails, roads, and boundaries. These features can be clicked on to reveal the name, location, and other useful information. The map screen also has two search tools - the left one can be used to look up addresses and towns, while the right one will allow you to query the names of the features in the database.\n\nThere is such a wealth of beauty out there waiting to be discovered. Never before has it been this easy to navigate our public lands as you travel, no matter where in the United States you are or what kinds of places you are interested in visiting. It's time to experience the rich natural and cultural tapestry of our nation and pay homage to the places that make our country the great land that it is. Come navigate the US BLM lands with GeoPOI today!"

      "label": "“Awesome!!! The best speed app on iphone” 5 Stars by kurtonic\n\nSpeed Box is a Speedometer and GPS app for both your iPhone and iPad. It displays your current speed, distance, direction and altitude along with your top speed and average speed. The app also keeps a record of the speed and altitude for the last few hours.\n\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n========================\n\n* MPH, KM/H and KNOTS\n* Show decimal speed (e.g. \"45.7 mph\")\n* One app for both the iPhone and iPad\n* \"Speak speed\" - Tap screen to have the speed spoken to you\n* 11 Analog and digital speedometers\n* Map view\n* Maximum and average speed\n* Altitude \n* Digital compass \n* HUD display to see speed in windshield \n* Odometer to measure distance traveled \n* Chart of the traveled speed and altitude \n* Warning signal when driving too fast \n* Export last 3 hours of data \n* Change maximum displayed speed on speedometer \n* Swipe finger over chart to display historic data \n* Display GPS accuracy by tapping the indicator in the top left corner \n\n\nUSER REVIEWS\n========================\n\n5 Stars by Darekakuta \n\"Just what I needed. My '58 chev's speedo doesn't work. This did the trick.\" \n\n5 Stars by Rawd \n\"Great My 79 Firebird speedo only goes to 140 kmh. ;). This worked perfectly.\" \n\n5 Stars \n\"Within 1 mile per hour +/- Great Job!\" \n\nSpeedBox was one of the very early Speedometer Apps for the iPhone. Take advantage of my experience and the refined algorithms that can get a much greater accuracy from the iPhone then a lot of other apps. I regularly update my application to make it even more accurate and usable. \n\nUsers have already used our application to verify the accuracy of their car's speedometer or they tried measuring the speed they achieved while skiing. Can you come up with more ideas? How about measuring the speed of the airplane you travel with? \n\nUSAGE NOTES\n========================\nThe \"GPS strength\" indicator in the top left corner should display a green dot. You can tap this indicator to display the current GPS accuracy.\n\nPlease allow the application up to a minute to find enough satellites to work correctly. \n\nIf you get a message to enable GSP, please go to ”Settings > General > Location Services“ on your iPhone and check if the little switch is set to \"On\" for Speed Box as well as for \"Location Services\" in general. \n\nATTENTION iPod touch users! Unfortunately this app doesn't work very well on the iPod touch and the iPad WiFI (without 3G) since these devices are missing a GPS!\n\n\nFEEDBACK\n========================\nIf you've got any wishes or suggestions for new features, please let me know with the contact form on this application's website (see link below).\n\nI am already working on the next update!"

      "label": "Theodolite is a multi-function viewfinder that combines a compass, two-axis inclinometer, rangefinder, GPS, map, nav calculator, and geo-overlay photo/movie camera into one indispensable app. Theodolite was one of the very first augmented reality (AR) apps when it was released in 2009, and it’s been downloaded and used by millions of customers since then. Uses are endless, and the app is great for land measurements, outdoor sports, sightseeing, navigation, and finding your way around. Theodolite is a pro grade app and is used extensively by surveyors, geologists, architects, engineers, competitive sportsmen, first responders, military personnel, and search and rescue workers around the world. \n\nTheodolite lets you take data-overlay photos and movies with 2X-8X zoom. Overlay geographical data, angle markings, date/time, author/company info, and project notes directly on photos and movies for later reference. The same data is written into the metadata record of images, making image files self-contained data records. Third-party apps can tap into Theodolite's advanced camera functions with a camera sharing feature.\n\nView current position on the built-in map with optional offline Outdoors maps that include topo contours, roads, trails, landmarks, campgrounds, ski lifts, and more. Live map markers continually update distance/heading relative to the current location and also show wayfinding info in the main viewfinder. Draw polygons on the map to mark things like property boundaries and trails, and import/export polygon data via KML.\n\nShare map markers and nav calculator points with other users of Theodolite via text messages or e-mail. This powerful capability opens up a wide range of collaborative uses including team land surveying, accident investigations, spotting wild fires, triangulation of landmarks, and advanced tactical observation and targeting. With an optional in-app purchase to enable team tracking, you can share location with up to 20 people on Theodolite's map.\n\nTheodolite includes features for serious users like a reference angle mode, nav calculator, map marker import/export, manual and automatic data logging with CSV and KML export, clipboard integration, %grade display, mil compass readout, optical rangefinders (including a mil-based reticle, sniper-style stadiametric graphs, and a variable 4X-24X scope), and night filters to improve use in dark conditions.\n\nTheodolite can provide location in military grid reference system (MGRS) coordinates, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, British/Irish National Grids, US National Grid, Maidenhead locator system, Map Grid of Australia, and six latitude/longitude formats. Optional US State Plane coordinates include SPCS27 and SPCS83 zones covering all US States. The optional Datum Pack adds over 230 geodetic datums to the app to improve position computation from GPS data, covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.\n\nAR Layers include navigational aids like the sun, moon, planets, and Polaris (North star), and the optional US Mountain Summits layer that shows over 70,000 US mountain summits in the viewfinder.\n\nTheodolite has been shown in Apple Keynotes, featured on the App Store, and has been a #1 selling Navigation app in App Stores around the world. Since its introduction in 2009, Theodolite has defined augmented reality navigation. The app continually introduces new technologies, pushing the limits of iOS app development and taking advantage of new hardware capabilities.\n\nFind out why Apple named Theodolite one of the most amazing apps available and showed it being used to explore the Great Wall of China. Where will you take it on your next adventure?\n\nNote: Theodolite is an iPhone app -- see “Theodolite HD” for use on an iPad. And be sure to check out the all-new \"Theodolite for Watch\" and put Theodolite on your wrist!"

      "label": "BlindSquare is pioneering accessible navigation both indoors and outdoors. Know where you are, know where you're going, travel with confidence.\n\nBlindSquare is a new solution that combines the latest technology to help the blind with their daily lives. It has been developed in collaboration with blind people and carefully field tested. You need either an iPhone or an iPad to get started. It also supports some additional accessories to enhance the experience. \n\nHow does it work? \n\nBlindSquare uses GPS and the compass to locate you. It then gathers information about the surrounding environment from FourSquare. BlindSquare has some unique algorithms to decide what information is the most relevant and then speaks it to you with high quality speech synthesis. \n“What's the most popular café within 200 meters radius? Where is the post office or the library?” \n\nYou can control BlindSquare also through voice commands. The Voice Command feature is a premium service requiring purchase of credits for continuous use.  Voice Command Credits are available as an in-app purchase on the App Store.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a GPS solution:\n\nWhen you start the app, it will start telling you the interesting places and street crossings around you. By changing the radius, you can limit the area you are interested in. You can also search by search term or by category. You can select an interesting place from the search results and perform the following tasks:\n\n1) Get contact info (address, phone number) \n2) Open twitter feed or restaurant menu (if provided)\n3) Make a phone call\n4) Start tracking the place (BlindSquare will assist you by repeating the distance and the clock face direction)\n5) Start your favourite navigator for turn-by-turn instructions (TomTom, Navigon or Apple Maps)\n\nBlindSquare is aware of when you travel by car, bus or train and starts to report interesting places in front of you (for example, the next stops) and street crossings when you are passing them.\n\nYou can also save your own private places to iCloud so they will be found with your every device.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a Foursquare client:\n\nIf you like to play Foursquare, you can do the following with BlindSquare:\n \n1) Get a list of nearby FourSquare venues\n2) When you are in a place, you can check in by shaking your device\n3) Do a check in with commenting and twitter/facebook sharing\n4) Correct the location of the place\n\nBlindSquare supports the following languages: English, Arabic, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean (South Korea), Norwegian, Polish, Portugues, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\nVoiceOver usage is supported but it also includes higher quality additional speech synthesis by Acapela Text-To-Speech from Acapela Group.\n \nInstructions in English: https://www.blindsquare.com/user-guide/ and https://www.blindsquare.com/faq/\n\nPlease note: This app retrieves data in real time from Foursquare and Open Street Map. Use of a flat rate data plan is highly recommended.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nHaving only been released in May 2012, BlindSquare has already received several prizes and awards:\n\n - GSMA: Global Mobile Awards 2013, Best Mobile Health Product or Service\n - Apps4Finland 2012\n - OpenCities App Challenge 2012\n - The Finnish Information Processing Association: Best Product 2012\n\nPlease note: To use BlindSquare, your iCloud account has to be active so BlindSquare can access it to save your settings and places.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

The program is especially adapted for the usage by glider, hangglider and paraglider pilots.  SkyLogger obtains the geodetic positions of the pilot during the flight and stores the data. Furthermore, the pilot is able to see during the flight the elapsed time, the distance to the take-off as well as the current ground speed and climb rate. A compass rose is indicating the current flight direction. \nFor competitions the pilot's and the aircraft's name, the aircraft's ID and the to be flown route can be entered.  During the flight the direction and distance to the next waypoint are shown on the display.\n\nAfter finishing the flight the stored geodetic data together with the data for the competition can be converted into the common IGC file format. Additionally, also other popular formats like GPX and KML are supported. The created files are stored on the iPhone or can be sent to servers or other computers.\n\nSkyLogger supports besides others the following features:\n\n - control by Apple Watch;\n - main data visualization on Apple Watch;\n - cockpit / instrument view;\n - 2D & 3D flight data visualization;\n - downloadable map data;\n - large and individually adaptable instruments on a moving map allow best viewing comfort;\n - north or in flight direction orientation of moving map;\n - live tracking support for Leonardo or Vgps servers\n - visualization of previously flown flights as track traces on moving map;\n - visualization of airspaces with user defined colors;\n - instrument showing the distance and direction to the closest airspace;\n - 3 axis acceleration measurements;\n - tracked flights are stored in highly efficient internal database;\n - default flight parameters can be stored and retrieved to make flight information entering for competitions easier;\n - SkyLoggerXXL supports common file formats like IGC, CSV, GPX and KML;\n - IGC files created by SkyLoggerXXL are OLC conform and can directly be sent to Leonardo, XCCup, XContest and XC globe based OLC servers;\n - calculation of XC points for FAI triangle, triangle and free distance over 5 points;\n - XC analysis (determination of FAI triangle areas);\n - printing of flightbooks, flight information and statistics\n - all diagrams, maps or charts can either be e-mailed or copied for incorporation into other apps;\n - integration of SkyView database for exchanging waypoints;\n - support of FlyNet accessories;\n - support of SensBox;\n - weather data history of selected weather stations for the last 48 hours;\n - online wind speed and direction visualization on maps for selected weather stations;\n - visualization of hotspots;\n - visualization of regions with thermals;\n - visualization of climb rate traces;\n - and much much more!\n\nWarning: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "There are hundreds of gps apps. Do we really need one more?\n\nAriadne GPS is more than a simple gps app.\n\nBesides offering you the possibility to know your position and to get information about the street, the number, etc. it also lets you explore the map of what's around you.\n\nWhat do we mean by saying \"explore\"? You'll deal with a talking map. If you have VoiceOver activated on your device, you will be able to know the street names and numbers that are around you by touching them.\nJust put your finger on the screen of your device, when showing the map and moving it you will be told the info's about the street you're touching.\nYour position is on the center of the screen. What's in front of you is on the top half of the screen and things behind you are on the bottom half of the screen.\n\nYou can also explore a different region than the one around you by telling the app the street and the city.\n\nYou can ask for information about your position at any time, also activating a function, called monitor, that will give you this info periodically (Please read the note below).\nThis app has also got some other useful features that might help when walking or traveling by bus, train etc.\nIf you add your favourite points to the app database, you can be alerted when you get closer than a certain distance to one of them.\n\nThis app is completely accessible using VoiceOver and gives you access to information that are normally unavailable to people using the speech synthesizer and can be therefore especially useful to blind and partially sighted people. \n\nNote: The features of Ariadne GPS are based on the location services and on the Maps server for what concerns the information about the position. This information may not be accurate, due to the location accuracy, which is generally below fifteen metres but in some cases can be few tens of metres and to the Maps service, which might be unresponsive at certain times (Ariadne GPS will tell you if this is the case). The aim of Ariadne GPS is to give you an idea of your position and what is around you. Please do not completely rely on it.\n\nPlease note that the use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nFor more info and suggestions please visit http://www.ariadnegps.eu"

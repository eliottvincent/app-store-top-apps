The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!\n\nHighlights:\n\n•  Unlimited Shutter Speed and manual ISO\n•  Option to resume capture \n•  Real time live preview - See the result in real time\n•  Innovative 'Freeze'  and ‘Blur Strength’ controls\n•  Tap to adjust focus/exposure\n•  Time-lapse Intervalometer\n•  Apple Watch support and handy Self-Timer \n•  Full resolution support on every devices\n\nWith Slow Shutter Cam on your iPhone or iPod touch you get the features of a DSLR camera with the convenience of a device that you can drop in your pocket and take with you wherever you go.

      "label": "Your pocket app for removing unwanted stuff from photos on the go. It gives your photos a clean look while saving you valuable time.\n\nAn accidental object, even though it may look tiny and harmless, can completely ruin the entire composition of a photo and make it worthless. However, it’s not a pain if you have your favorite TouchRetouch at hand.\n\nHere at ADVA Soft, we never stop creating. We are constantly developing new technologies and features to improve TouchRetouch both functionally and visually. The most recent additions, such as the mesh removal feature, new algorithm for edge-aware object removal, and a few more great new things, reflect the needs expressed by you and reveal our appreciation of your loyalty.\n\nBelow you'll find more details on what features TouchRetouch has to offer.\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\n• No subscriptions, ads, and in-app purchases\n• No personal information requests\n• No quality and EXIF data loss\n• Professional photo edits with ease\n\nNOTE\n\nThe automatic object removal algorithm works best on uniform backgrounds.\n\nWhat magic can you do with TouchRetouch?\n\n• Remove wires, power lines, and other linear objects\n• Eliminate objects like street signs, trash cans, stop lights\n• Get rid of meshes in the foreground\n• Remove background people\n• Erase pimples, skin blemishes, and wrinkles in the most natural way\n• Clean up travel photos\n• Remove text from Instagram and Snapchat posts\n• Restore old photos\n\nHow will you create magic in your photos?\n\nSINGLE-TOUCH RETOUCH\n\nThe app works great for quick retouches.\nMake minor imperfections disappear just by marking them. It takes seconds for the app to remove small details that ruin your photos.\n\nIf the task is to erase a line from your pic, mark only a section of the line or just tap it to remove it completely; no need to be precise — the app will find the line! In the manual retouch mode, all lines have control points, thus giving you more control and flexibility over adjusting curved segments.\n\nOBJECT REMOVAL LIKE MAGIC\n\nThe app declutters your images in a matter of seconds. That could either be people or other background details you may need to erase. Use automatic content removal with the Brush tool or, when the result is not that perfect, manual retouching with the Clone Stamp tool to repair a photo. \n\nAUTOMATIC MESH DETECTION AND REMOVAL\n\nIf you think that \"getting past the mesh netting\" is quite a challenging task, you probably haven’t tried using TouchRetouch yet. The app offers a way to deal with the problem in two simple steps. Select the tool from the main menu and tap the Go button to have the mesh removed just like magic. The whole detection and selection work between these two steps is done by the algorithm; no action is required on your part.\n\nHELPFUL TUTORIALS\n\nCheck out the in-app tutorials and play around a bit with the app to learn how to get the most out of it.\nLittle effort and experience are needed to become a pro in using TouchRetouch. The interface and layout are clear and intuitive enough to make you feel comfortable the very first time you use it.\n\nDownload TouchRetouch now to harness photo magic from your pocket.\n\nTouchRetouch is brought to you by ADVA Soft — a team of like-minded professionals and enthusiastic innovators committed to designing intelligent yet simple apps that create magic in your photos and save you time. Visit our website at www.adva-soft.com to learn more about the company and the apps it develops.\n\nFor any assistance with TouchRetouch, contact ADVA Soft Support at touchretouch@adva-soft.com.

Shutter comes with a full-featured Apple Watch app.\n\nADVANCED SELF-TIMER (INTERVALOMETER)\n\nShutter's timer allows you to specify an initial delay and intervals between photos. You can control waiting sound during the countdown, and photo capture sound when the self-timer triggers.\n\nYou can remotely control exposure settings. Included histogram ensures you don't clip highlights or lose shadow details.\n\nRAW TIME-LAPSE WITH INCREDIBLE CONTROL\n\nWith the help of intervalometer, you can get rid of a dedicated cable release.

Recover all shadow and highlight details in post-production.\n\nASTROPHOTOGRAPHY\n\nBy combining (\"stacking\") multiple photos with the same composition, you can drastically reduce camera noise in post-production. Use Shutter to catch multiple exposures of the night sky. This will allow you to produce stunningly clear images of the Milky Way and Northern Lights (aurora borealis).\n\nLIFESTYLE PHOTOGRAPHY FOR INSTAGRAM AND SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nNo one better understands your Instagram business than yourself.

It gives us the features of a DSLR but in a fast, easy to use camera app.\n\nFor Filmmakers - the features you need, not the ones you don’t. Color profiles, bitrates, dual-channel audio meters, real-time waveforms, and fast access to frame rates.\n\nFor Photographers - easier than shooting on your DSLR. Shoot in RAW (even in BURST), split focus / exposure, and manually control everything (exposure, iso, shutter speed, white balance and focus).\n\nFor Everyone Else - inspired by the pro’s we made the interface simple, fast, and easy to use. We provide getting started tips, video tutorials, and full time customer service to get you setup.\n\nWe love hearing from you.

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Amazon or any other trademark mentioned here.

      "label": "\"Spectre is a new iOS camera app that uses AI to create stunning long exposures” — the Verge\n\nIntroducing Spectre, from the makers of Halide, one of the top camera apps in the App Store.\n\nSpectre uses AI to help you make amazing long exposure photographs. Spectre can remove crowds, turn city streets into rivers of light, make waterfalls look like paintings, and much more. Until now, it was difficult to take long exposures: from keeping the camera steady to guessing the amount of light you need. Spectre takes care of all of that!\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n\n• MAKE CROWDS DISAPPEAR: Spectre helps take photos of crowded, touristy places. Simply set a medium or long duration and take a shot to erase the crowd from a location. Capture the those special moments like you remember them.\n\n• RIVERS OF LIGHT: At night, AI scene detection automatically switches modes to draw beautiful light trails, for stunning nighttime city photography or light painting.\n\n• GORGEOUS WATER: Capture waterfalls, ocean waves, fountains and more with beautiful ghostly water. \n\nLIVE PHOTOS AND VIDEO\n\nSpectre’s intelligent computational shutter takes hundreds of shots over the span of a few seconds, and saves them in an accompanying live photo. That means you can pick a different frame as your photo, apply live-photo effects, and even use the long exposure as a live-wallpaper!\n\nENDLESS SMARTS\n\nSpectre is a packed with powerful technology from by the team that brought you Halide.\n\nFrom machine learning-based scene detection to computer vision aided image stabilization, Spectre is jammed full of impressive technologies to get the best possible image.\n\nDESIGNED FOR HUMANS\n\nSpectre is meticulously designed. Its dark UI is gentle on the eyes when you shoot at night. Gorgeous glowing highlights infuse it with a unique style. Custom typefaces and iconography combined with unique, smooth controls make it as tactile and delightful as an actual physical camera. Like its sister app Halide, the app is easily usable with one hand, even on the largest iPhones.\n\nHIGH-TECH SHOWCASE \n\nBuild with the latest tech, Spectre isn't just a long exposure camera — it’s the cutting edge technology showcase of one of the App Store’s foremost camera apps, Halide. Here’s just a few of the latest technologies that we use in Spectre:\n\n- DCI-P3 Wide Color Pipeline\n- Live Photos\n- Metal Graphics Acceleration\n- Tripod Detection\n- Siri & Shortcuts\n- AI Stabilization\n- Machine Learning & CoreML\n- Computer Vision\n\nCOMPATIBILITY:\n\nSpectre’s smart Automatic Scene Detection requires iOS 12. AI-based stabilization features are available on iPhone 6S and later.* For the best experience, we recommend iPhone 8 or later.\n\nOn iPhone 6, Spectre captures in lower resolution. \n\n* (Full compatibility device list: iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max)\n\nABOUT US \n\nWe’re Ben and Sebastiaan, two friends living in the San Francisco Bay Area that love building fantastic apps for photography. \n\nWe hope you love Spectre! We’d love your feedback to make it even better or any reports of bugs you run into. You can always contact us directly via email: support@halide.cam, on our Twitter: @halidecamera or Instagram: @halideapp\n\nDon’t forget to share your amazing results by tagging them with #SpectreShot so we can share them on our growing social media accounts!"

It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a specific video is not working, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: Use the Playbar for advanced video control while browsing, including video scrubbing, forward, rewind, play, pause, stop.

Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with LG Electronics or any other trademark mentioned here."

      "label": "Obscura 3 is a camera app packed full of features to help you take incredible photos. Obscura pairs a stunning design with intuitive controls that make taking photos a delight.\n—\n\nObscura 2 has been featured numerous times by Apple around the world, including as Editor’s Choice and App of the Day. And Obscura 3 is even better.\n—\n\nDesign\n\nObscura squeezes a bunch of powerful features into simple controls anyone can master. The interface balances aesthetics, ergonomics, and intuitiveness. You won’t want to use anything else. All the camera controls can be reached with one thumb, and gestures and haptics combine to create a tactile experience that lets you stay focused on your subject.\n—\n\nAppearance\nThemes, manual light and dark modes, custom app icons. All gorgeous. \n—\n\n\nCamera Features\n—\n\nModes\nObscura 3 has been designed around 5 distinct camera modes: \nPhoto - simple, fast performance\nPro Photo - maximum control \nDepth - portraits & depth data\nLive Photo - for.. Live Photos\nVideo - video capture with pro controls\n\nExposure\nTo adjust exposure, just touch your thumb to the Exposure Button and move it in a circle, like turning a dial. Couldn’t be simpler and it feels great. And you can just tap the button to instantly reset the exposure bias.\n\nFocus\nJust like exposure, drag your thumb around the Focus Button to focus manually. And you’ll get both a focus loupe and focus peaking to help you get your subject perfectly crisp. ^1\n\nISO & Shutter Speed\nTK\n\nWhite Balance\nAWB, White Point, Scene Presets, and manual Temp + Tint.\n\nPhoto Formats\nProRAW ^2, RAW, HEIC, and JPEG photos, Live Photos and Depth Data ^3. \n\nVideo Formats\n1080p or 4K at 24,30 or 60fps ^4\n\nFilters\nLots of new filters, some old favorites. You can now disable filters and set favorites for quick access. All included.\n\nAspect Ratio\nCapture photos in 4:3, 1:1, 16:9, and 2:1 aspect ratios.\n\nHistogram\nSmall or large, luminance or color.\n\nGrid\nLines, crosshairs, or none.\n\nSpirit Level\nFor perfectly level horizons that would make Wes Anderson proud.\n\nFlash\nYep.\n\nTimer\nI hear tick tock is really popular with the youths.\n\nPresets\nCustomise Obscura to your heart’s content, and save those customisations into presets to quickly access at any time.\n—\n \nLibrary\n\nNot only has the camera interface been redesigned, but the library has been reconsidered from the ground up to give you quick access to your most important photos, without sacrificing performance.\n—\n\nView Options\nObscura lets you configure exactly what’s displayed in the library views, so you can hide screenshots and memes to help you focus on your photos.\n\nYou can also adjust the size of thumbnails to suit your preference. And keep hidden photos hidden. Naturally.\n—\n\nImage View & Editing\nBrowse, share, fav, rate, edit. Whether you want to dig into metadata, triage through your vacation photos, or apply some cool filters, you’ll find it here.\n—\n\n\nSettings & More\nObscura’s Settings has a bunch of options, allowing you to manage filters, tweak camera behaviours, change the theme, read the walkthrough and more.\n—\n\nApple Watch Support\nUse your Apple Watch as a camera remote. You can change capture mode, set exposure and more!\n—\n\nGame Controller Support (Beta)\nIt’s a little rough, but yes, you can use a game controller to control your camera.\n———\n\n\n1. Manual Focus only available in single camera modes, not while using a Virtual Dual or Triple camera. Yes, this sucks but the virtual cameras are weird and full of quirks\n2. ProRAW only available on iPhone 12 Pro and 13 Pro\n3. Depth Data only available on Dual, Triple, or TrueDepth Camera systems\n4. Video formats vary by device\n\nThanks for checking out Obscura. If you decide to buy, we hope you’ll consider rating it, or sharing with someone you think might like it. \n\nAll the best,\nBen & Adam"

It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a specific video is not working, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: Use the Playbar for advanced video control while browsing, including video scrubbing, forward, rewind, play, pause, stop. The playbar works on all Samsung Smart TVs and Blu-ray Players.

Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Samsung or any other trademark mentioned here."

Yet, it provides a wide range of tools suitable even for advanced users, to create complex compositions.\n\nBlend/mix/combine/cut/copy and paste one photo on another. Creating double exposure photo is as easy as loading two photos and then choosing opacity and blending modes.\n\nWith advanced masking tools, you can manually or semi-automatically erase portions from one image and then blend that with another photo. From magic lasso, that cuts out an image from a roughly painted boundary to a simple brush masking tool, you can use wide range of masking tools to create all sorts of masking, using this app.\n\nThe app has tons of masking tools like brush, smart brush, magic wand, magic lasso, lasso, polygon, rectangle, ellipse, linear and radial gradient and color range. Text masking tool and you can even create a mask from an image.\n\nAnd how do you cut out hair or fur of your pet? You can create fine mask of hair, using hair masking tool even to cut out hair!\n\nTo keep the flow simple, Superimpose works with two photos at a time. But you can keep merging and keep adding more and more layers of photos to create complex compositions.\n\nTo blend two photos even better, the app supports a set of adjustment tools like exposure, saturation, hue, color balance, curve etc.\n\nApart from blending, advanced masking and filters, Superimpose comes equipped with assorted set of editing tools like perspective correction, adding text with extensive text settings and tools like motion blur, zoom blur etc.\n\nCreating a natural shadow of objects that you blend with a photo is easier than ever. A dedicated tool just to create a shadow.\n\nStore all your cut outs, stickers or masks in a built-in mask library. For example, you can take photo of your products, mask them and then save them in the mask library. You can later add those cut outs on a background you want to add it to.\n\nCreate a fun photo by adding one part of the photo as a foreground and another photo as a background.\n\nSave images in high resolution either in JPEG, PNG or HEIC format."

Which also blocks maximum aperture.\n\n• Memory for 5 lenses with maximum aperture, focal length and film/sensor size for calculating hyperfocal distance and aperture.\n\n• Hyperfocal distance also for infrared light.

Enjoy the show on your big screen.\n\nWith Video & TV Cast you can browse through the web and stream any online video on your Google Cast enabled device (movies, tv shows, sports, music and more). Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your TV or gaming console. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Google Cast enabled device immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n* The app only works with devices with Google Cast or Chromecast built-in, like Vizio TV, Toshiba TV, Sony TV, Philips TV, Sharp TV, Chromecast 1+2+Ultra, Nexus Player, Nvidia Shield gaming console\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. \n\n* If a specific video does not cast, please check our FAQ. If that does not help, please give us a chance to help you by dropping a mail to info@video-tv-cast.com instead of leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for your video as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Chromecast. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings.\n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Subtitles: Display subtitles & closed captions on TV.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nWe want to say thank you for all your great support and kindly invite you to honestly rate our app. This helps us to keep up our app development and support for you. Please do not trust other apps that ask you for 5-star ratings in exchange for premium upgrades. This is against good developer ethics and also against Apple guidelines.\n\nIf you have any feedback, feature requests or other request, please notify us at info@video-tv-cast.com\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google, Sony, Philips, Vizio, Sharp, Asus, Nvidia or one of their products and trademarks."

Fill the empty spaces on your sheet and use less paper.\n\nSAVE INK\nChoose the most economical print mode (photo or general quality, color or grayscale).\nCrop to print only what you need and waste no ink.\n\nIntuitive and quick to use with familiar touch gestures:\n• Select your paper size\n• Add images\n• Size and crop them to exact dimensions anywhere inside the page\n• Align, rotate, flip and duplicate\n• Choose your mode (photo or general quality, color or grayscale) then print.\n\nRequires an AirPrint compatible printer. If you don't have one, you can still use this app to create a PDF or JPEG file that you can then print via other methods.\n\nPerfect for all kinds of home printing projects:\n• Picture frames\n• Greeting cards\n• Door signs\n• Labels\n• Badges\n\nPrinter manufacturers have ink and photo paper to sell, so their apps aren’t designed to help avoid waste. This app is different. It is designed to let you get it right the first time.\n\nDOWNLOAD NOW and make the best use of your ink and paper!"

Instead of spending all that time setting up your big camera, just choose your desired film/sensor size and focal length in the app and point the iPhone camera at what you want to photo to verify framing. If you are happy with the framing then you can get the big camera out. The app has a large database of camera sensors details and film formats but if the format you desire isn’t there you can add your own custom format. The app is targeted at stills photographers or film makers working in either film or digital. If you don’t have your big camera with you, Viewfinder Preview is still great for photo sketching, location scouting or story boarding.\n\nThe app includes\n\n- Customisable menus so you can include the film/sensor formats and focal lengths you care about.\n- A fully configurable light meter.\n- You can take photos with it, so you have a record of shots you were framing.\n- Photos taken with the app include additional data that describe the film format, focal length and lighting meter settings at the time the shot was taken\n- Add notes to your photos\n- A photo gallery for viewing photos taken with the app which also displays the additional data\n- Share images in emails, messages\n- Create albums of photos from the same project, trip etc\n- Create PDF documents of albums\n- Film stock emulation\n- Wide angle lens adapter support"

      "label": "Watch webvideos, online movies, live tv streams and your personal photos, videos & music on your Amazon Fire TV. Enjoy the show on your big screen.\n\nWith Video & TV Cast you can browse through the web and stream any video you want on your Amazon Fire TV (movies, tv shows, sports, music and more). Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your Amazon Fire TV. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Amazon Fire TV immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n\n>>> Important Notes\n\n* The app only works with a Amazon Fire TV or Fire TV Stick.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a video is not working at all, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible. \n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Fire TV. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nCountless websites have been reported to us and we already support more than 90% of all videos on the internet. But still we know that things can get even better. Your feedback and priorities will drive our work ahead, and you’ll see new features and more supported websites in our next app updates.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Amazon or any other trademark mentioned here.

Our newest app has been rebuilt from the ground app to support the next 10 years (or 20, who knows?) of mobile photography. Check it out at http://camera.plus \n\nOver 10 million sold!\n\n“The Clarity filter is iPhone photography’s secret sauce—it adds pro-camera crispness to almost any shot.”\n— Kevin Sintumuang, The Wall Street Journal\n\n“If the iPhone’s standard camera is like a digital point-and-shoot, the Camera+ app is like a high-quality SLR lens.”\n— TIME: 50 Best iPhone Apps 2011\n\n“improves on almost every aspect of the built-in camera app”\n— Charlie Sorrel, Wired\n\nWinner: Best Visual Design, Best Photography App\n— Best App Ever Awards\n\n\nIt’s all about one thing... great photos!\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned photographer or someone who’s barely touched a camera, Camera+ will make you love taking photos.\n\nTouch Exposure & Focus\nSet exposure separately from focus. You can now easily control how light or dark your shots come out.\n\nShooting Modes\nUse the Stabilizer to steady your iPhone and get the sharpest photos you can. There are countless uses for the Timer including taking the highest-quailty self-portraits. Capture all the action by using Burst to take rapid streams of shots.\n\nDigital Zoom\nUp to 6× zoom with advanced digital processing provides you with quality that simply blows away the competition.\n\nFront Flash\nHow many times have you wanted to take a pic of yourself in a dark room but couldn’t. Well, now you can!\n\nHorizon Level\nUse the Horizon Level to eliminate taking crooked shots.\n\nClarity\nClarity is one of the biggest breakthroughs to happen to image processing in a long time. Clarity analyzes your photos and makes several intelligent adjustments that magically bring out details and breathe life into dull photos. With Clarity, you’ll stop throwing out bad photos… you’ll be amazed to see what it can do to photos that you’d typically consider unusable, like shots that came out too dark.\n\nScene Modes\nMost modern digital cameras all have scene modes to help you get the best photos for your particular situation. With Camera+, you get to choose from several scene modes including Food, Sunset, Night, Portrait, Beach, and many more.\n\nEffects\nProfessional photographer, Lisa Bettany created a slew of stunningly beautiful effects. Make your photos shimmer with “HDR”… get down and dirty with “Grunge”… fill your pics with emotion and despair with “So Emo”. And this is just the tip of the iceberg… there are dozens of 1-touch effects for you to experiment with.\n\nLightbox\nAll the pics you take in Camera+ go in the innovative Lightbox where you can quickly and easily skim through them and get rid of bad shots. You save only the photos you’re satisfied with so that your camera roll stays neat and clean.\n\nSharing\nWhether you want to show your results to your friends and family or the whole world, Camera+ has got you covered. Proudly share your photos on Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr. Or go the more personal route and email or message them from right within the app.\n\niCloud Lightbox sync\nAutomatically sync your Camera+ photos between all of your devices. Shoot all day on your iPhone… and then edit at night on your iPad. \n\nCrops\nIf you didn’t line-up your shot perfectly when you took it, you can easily fix that with Camera+. And when you want to get a bit creative, we setup a bunch of popular crop sizes for you. With a single tap, you can make your pics square, 4×6, 8×10, and more.\n\nBorders\nWith Camera+ you get several great border designs, from simple black and white borders to more gritty designs, you’ll be able to add wonderful finishing touches.\n\nCaptions\nHave some fun with your photos by putting captions on them. It’s a great way to really personalize your favorite shots."

Use your finger as a brush to \"paint\" sections of your image black and white, or to bring back the original color.  Zooming in and out using the two-finger pinching gesture allows you to work on details with pixel-accuracy.\n\nFeatures:\n- Short tutorial videos explain the use of all features and will have you editing your images in minutes.\n- Choose photos to edit from your iPhone photo library or from Dropbox or Flickr.\n- Share your edited images on Twitter or Flickr. Email them, or save them to your Dropbox.\n- Save multiple sessions to resume your work later.\n- Undo any number of accidental brush strokes.\n- An alternative view mode highlights the regions that will remain in color with a red tint. This makes it easier to see and adjust the boundaries between color and black & white regions.\n- Choose from 4 different brushes (hard or soft edged, opaque or transparent) and adjust the brush size.\n- Hide the toolbars in full screen mode."

With quick data entry, intuitive visualizations, and advanced features like precision modes, FocusFinder is the best tool to improve your photography or videos. Almost every camera available is already included, and we will add yours within 48h if it's missing.\n\nFocusFinder calculates at which distances objects will be in focus (i.e., perfectly sharp), and shows you how blurry they will be beyond that. It also shows the hyperfocal distance, to help you get distanced objects perfectly in focus. All this is presented in an intuitive chart, so you can focus on your shot, not your device. You enter the values quickly with the sliders, or manually, for even more precision. To see how different camera settings affect your shot, you can quickly adjust them and view the changes live!\n\nOn top, FocusFinder helps you to quickly choose lenses by simulating the focal length with your device’s camera, and it calculates the angle of view for your focal lengths. You‘ll see what effect your focal length and the camera body has on the final frame.\n\nFocusFinder for Apple Watch (included) brings depth-of-field calculations to your wrist. You enter settings with the Digital Crown and instantly see the effects on your depth-of-field. Visualizations were designed specifically for Apple Watch, to make maximal use of the available space. Cameras are synchronized to your main device.\n\nFocusFinder includes almost every camera, and we‘ll add your camera within 48h if it‘s missing. Just drop us a hint from inside the app!\n\nGet FocusFinder now, and take your photography to the next level!\n\n\nFocusFinder adapts to your setup:\n- Add all your camera(s) from the included database and quickly choose between all of them with the quick-switch.\n- Use presets for those settings you always use. Or for your prime lenses!\n- Choose between different precision modes for different situations, like high-res stills or video.\n- If you prefer metric or imperial units, FocusFinder let‘s you choose.\n- Hyperfocal mode allows you to directly focus to the hyperfocal distance.\n- Try background pictures (only on iPhone) to visualize the current distance range, or remove them for a minimalistic interface.\n- Visualize different aspect ratios in the focal length simulator.\n\nFocusFinder calculates every number you need! This includes:\n- length of your depth-of-field\n- near and far ends of the sharp area\n- hyperfocal distance\n- angle and width of your field of view (in FoV-mode)"

Painted for you in real time! Participate or spectate it's up to you, Oilist will delight! All saved at canvas-worthy 4k resolution.\n​\nOilist comes with 48 infinitely customizable styles; from photo-realist to impressionist, to abstract. Every style except for our photo-realist style offers three different levels of abstraction.\n\nOilist is not a photo filter. Unlike most filter apps, Oilist will never generate the same results twice, and in fact, each brush stroke is unique. Instead of applying a fixed formula to an image as photo filters typically do, Oilist analyzes the supplied image using computer vision technology, then paints simulated paint particles that are applied using various brush strokes and techniques.\n\nAt any time​ during the painting process, 4k resolution images may be captured as often as desired. \n\nWhen Oilist is painting, styles can be infinitely customized with 17 different presets (these were called Styles in previous versions of Oilist), 13 different painting moods, 15 different brushes, setting brush options such as the size and spacing, and by splashing paint with our exciting Chaos tool. Control paint gravity by tilting your device and brush angles by yawing (rotating) the device. \n\nObtain new and exciting results by alternating settings with new settings painted on top of the previous settings. For instance, first, paint a layer using the Warm mood followed by a layer using the Cool mood. The use of large brushes tend to create more abstract artwork, and smaller brushes work best for high definition detail.\n\nOilist will automatically provide smaller brush strokes and greater photo-realism to detected faces. \n\nCheck out #oilist and follow us @3dtopo on Instagram and Twitter!"

Is under active development.\n\nReal customer testimonials:\n\n\"Finally - This program is exactly what I was looking for. Easy to use but very effective and comprehensive. And the best: Pay once and good! Thanks to the developer!\"\n\n\"Just good! - Comprehensive and zero effort to use. For me the best app to edit the EXIF data of my photos. The presets are great and finally no in-app purchases! Keep it up!\"\n\n\"IPad version - it is here - Many thanks to the developer. Now I can add location information to photos on iPad. The developer also responds very quickly to requests and suggestions for improvement.\"\n\n\"For a long time I was missing a possibility on the iPhone / iPad to store the location data of photos, because I still shoot a lot with \"old\" DSLRs and they do not have GPS. With this, this also works from Apple's photo app. \nWithout complications. That's how it should be!\"\n\nThe app works with:\n- All photos in your iPhone or iPad photo library, except ProRAW images.\n- Photos in iCloud (Files app)\n- Photos in photo stream\n\nDo you have questions or need help? Write to support@imagexif.de, we're happy to help!\n\nWhat the app doesn't do:\n- Changing the filename: EXIF isn't about filenames. Also iOS does not allow the renaming of photos in the Photos Library.\n- Changing the order of photos in the Photos Library. Apple decided that the only sorting criteria in iOS Photos Library is the date the photo has been added to the library.\n\nQuestion: What is EXIF data?\nEXIF stands for \"Exchangeable Image File Format.\"\nWhen you take or receive a photo with a digital camera, it contains invisible metadata. This is information attached to the photo that describes, for example, certain properties and settings of the camera or even the place where the picture was taken. Services that can read this data are able to collect the circumstances and contexts of the photos and match them with certain other events (e.g. calendar entries, motion profiles, etc.).\n\nQuestion: Why doesn't the app handle PNG?\nUnfortunately, the Photos API does not allow modification of PNG files, but saves them as JPG. Therefore, to avoid confusion, imagExif cannot edit PNGs."

      "label": "Sunny16 is a fun, easy to use exposure calculator that implements the Sunny 16 exposure rule and then some. This app is ideal for anyone with a film or digital camera with an M (manual) mode who wants a quick tool to help set up the perfect exposure or anyone who wants to understand the relationships between the elements that create a properly exposed image.\n\nSunny 16 is a basic photographic exposure rule that works like this: If it’s sunny set your aperture to f/16 and your shutter speed to the reciprocal of your film speed. Huh? Exactly! That's why we created Sunny16. To put it another way, if your film speed (ISO) is 200 set your shutter speed to 1/200 and your aperture to f/16. But what if you want to shoot at f/8? What if it's not quite sunny? What about heavy overcast? What if you want to shoot at 1/1000? Sunny16 answers all of those questions with just a tap.\n\nSunny16 features:\n• Equivalent Exposures: see the full range of equivalent exposures (also known as reciprocal exposures) for any film speed under natural lighting conditions.\n• Exposure Compensation: easily compensate +/- up to 5 stops for backlight or other common lighting conditions.\n• Implicit Priority Modes: if you set the shutter speed and then change the ISO, the lighting condition, or the exposure compensation, the shutter speed will remain the same and the f/stop will change (shutter priority). And vice versa for aperture priority. \n• Limits: if a particular shutter speed or f/stop is not available for the conditions you specify you won't be able to select it (you can try but the picker will politely roll back to a correct exposure). \n• Stop Increment: full, 1/2, or 1/3 stops.\n• Lighting: naturally occurring lighting conditions expressed in EV 100. Don't worry if you don't know or care what EV is, just use the descriptions. \n• ISO: film speed from 6 to 102400.\n• Shutter Speeds: from 1/16000 to 30\"\n• f/stops: from 1 to 32"

      "label": "iPCamera lets you use your iOS device as a wireless network camera! You can use every web browser as live monitor!\n\n\nWith iPCamera you can use any iOS device as ip network camera. The app creates a web server which you can connect to with every web browser on a computer on the same local network as the iOS device. The network address which you enter in your web browser on your computer is displayed on the bottom of the screen. After you connected to the web server you see in your web browser a live view of the camera and a control interface to alter camera parameters, i.e. torch-control, resolution, frame-rate, quality, camera-selection, orientation, mirroring, etc.\n\niPCamera delivers market-leading ultra low-delay, super fluid and crystal clear video.\n\nPossible applications of this app are surveillance applications or using your iOS device as a FPV device (first person view) for robots or rc cars.\n\nYou can protect the access to the app by http-authentication. The username and password for this can be set up in the app-preferences (in the settings-app)."

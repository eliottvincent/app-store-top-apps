Featured in Apple's \"Amazing Apps\" TV commercial.\n## Staying focused with the cutest gamified timer. \n## Over 1,500,000 real trees were planted on Earth by our users.  \n\n\"Forest works well, and if your goal is to be more in the moment, ignore your phone and actually talk to your friends when you are with them, this is the app for you.\"— The New York Times \n\n\"In order to establish new, better habits, it's helpful to engage with tools that make it easier to reinforce them. For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused, Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n• Create personalized Allow Lists for different situations. Non-allowed apps will be blocked.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 90 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

You can also see the current weather and an overview of the current month at a glance.\n\nIntuitive Controls \nIntuitively navigate through your calendars and quickly, easily add events and tasks thanks to predefined settings and simple controls. Standard settings like repeating events and reminders/alarms are just a tap away. And powerful special settings are also available, without sacrificing comfort or control. Swipe through views and open events or days with just a tap.\n\nmiCal Understands You\nQuickly create events with the new natural language input feature. Natural language input allows you to create events just by describing them. And if you have Siri enabled on your device, you can even dictate your event details instead of typing.\n\nThe Total Package\nmiCal provides complete, well-organized day, week and month views and displays the calendar week in all the important views.\n\nRelax\nYou don’t need to contort yourself with miCal. miCal supports portrait as well as landscape formats in nearly every view.  Use each view however it’s most comfortable for you.\n\nTasks/Reminders\nmiCal now supports iOS reminders. Create reminders for all the important tasks in your private and professional life right in the app.\n\nBirthday Manager\nNever again miss an important birthday. Get reminders at preset times featuring the music of your choice.\n\nNice Weather\nFive-day weather forecasts plus the sunrise/sunset times, humidity and wind speed for the current day. The dashboard even features a quick summary of the current weather as well as a brief forecast of the coming days.\n\nComprehensive\nmiCal offers a unique range of features. Copy, move or send your events. Export your events in the date range of your choice as CSV (for Excel, etc.) or ICS (the calendar format). Set colors for your calendars and individual appointments or automatically add colors based on keywords in event titles.\n\nUp to Date and Secure\nmiCal communicates with your device’s integrated calendar. miCal works with  all the calendar services that your device currently supports (iCloud, Google Calendar, Outlook, Exchange, Facebook Events, subscriptions) without requiring additional configuration. That way, you can store your data locally or via the services you know and trust—it’s up to you. miCal itself does not transmit any data to external services or other servers. That allows us to ensure 100% data security.\n\nAward-Winning\n- 3rd place in the \"Best German iPhone App\" competition at the 2010 iPhone Developer conference.\n- Featured as App of the Week in 13 countries.\n- Recommendation from iPhoneWelt and a 5-star rating from iPhone&Co, two of the leading iPhone magazines\n- Honored at the 2010 App Developer Conference"

      "label": "BimmerLink is the direct link to your BMW or MINI. Using one of the supported OBD adapters you can read trouble codes or display sensor values in realtime, check the current state of the DPF in your car or register a new battery after replacement. BimmerLink even allows you to remotely control the exhaust flap or mute the Active Sound Design in your car.\n\nREAD AND CLEAR TROUBLE CODES\nDiagnose your car as would otherwise be possible only by your Service Partner. In contrast to generic OBD apps that read emission related errors only, BimmerLink allows you to read and clear trouble codes from ALL control units in your car.\n\nDISPLAY REALTIME SENSOR VALUES\nBimmerLink provides a big selection of values like oil temperature or boost pressure.

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nGet Started\n• Interactive tutorial project\n• Keep each manuscript and supporting materials in a self-contained project\n• Import Word, RTF, Final Draft and plain text files\n• Easily split imported text into separate sections\n\nGet Writing\n• Write your manuscript in sections of any size\n• View all sections as a single text using the “Draft Navigator” (iPad only)\n• Quickly navigate sections using the “binder” sidebar\n• Format with fonts and presets\n• Comments, footnotes, links and highlights\n• Simple bullets and lists\n• Insert images\n• Pinch-zoom to resize text\n• Full-screen mode (iPad only)\n• Typewriter scrolling mode keeps typed text center-screen (iPad only)\n• Write a screenplay using scriptwriting mode\n• Live word and character counts\n• Set word and character count targets\n• Find and replace\n• Customizable keyboard row provides quick-access buttons for formatting, navigation and punctuation\n• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for external keyboard users\n• Dark mode\n\nFind Your Structure\n• Write in any order and reorganize later\n• Write a synopsis for any text section and see it in the outline\n• Expand, collapse and drill down into sections of your project\n• Rearrange sections as index cards on the corkboard (iPad only)\n• Project-wide search\n• Track ideas using labels and status\n• Apply custom icons to your sections\n\nRefer to Research\n• Import research material such as image, PDF and media files\n• View research files or other sections right alongside your writing (iPad only)\n• Every section has its own notes area for jotting down ideas\n• Supports multi-tasking split screen mode (supported devices only)\n\nShare Your Work\n• Compile to a single document for sharing or printing\n• Use different formatting in your exported or printed document\n• Export to Word, RTF, Final Draft, PDF or plain text\n• Convert rich text to Markdown for sharing with Markdown apps\n• Create and email zipped backups of your projects\n\nWork Anywhere\n• Use Dropbox to sync between devices and with the macOS and Windows versions of Scrivener*\n• Copy projects between devices via iTunes\n\n* Requires a Dropbox account (not compatible with iCloud).\n\nSUPPORT\nYou can contact us at ios.support@literatureandlatte.com, visit our forums at http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum, or find us @scrivenerapp on Twitter."

      "label": "\"Oblique Strategies\" is a concept developed by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt to help artists overcome creative blocks through lateral thinking. It consists of a deck of cards, each one containing a vague or ambiguous phrase that can be used to solve a problem intuitively, by breaking conventional thinking patterns and interpreting it from a new perspective.\n\nThis app aims to translate the essence of the original cards deck into a digital experience, making it accessible to a wider audience. It contains the original edition, as well as the newer decks, presenting them in a sleek minimalist style inspired by the original design of the cards. The user interface is simple and straightforward, built to encourage creative or design thinking without distracting from the process. The home screen widget on iOS 14 allows reading a new quote every day without opening the application. The Apple Watch version can run independently without needing the app installed on your iPhone.\n\nWith VoiceOver, anyone with a visual impairment can have the Oblique Strategies phrase read to them. Long tap the screen to have the last sentence read to you again. Also, you can shake the iPhone for a new sentence."

      "label": "Continuous is a fast and powerful .NET C# and F# IDE that runs directly on the iPad and iPhone (no network needed!). With it, you can write apps and games using your favorite languages on your favorite devices.\n\nContinuous is always building and running your code so you can see changes as you type. Writing interactive apps in Continuous is a pleasure compared to the traditional code-build-run cycle. It frees you to make lots of small changes and see their effects immediately - no more waiting for builds or deployments and no more clicking around trying to get to the screen you're trying to code.\n\nContinuous looks and works in many of the same ways as traditional .NET IDEs so you'll feel right at home, but it also strives to advance the state of the art in IDEs with these features:\n\n>>> Full C# 8 and F# 4.7 compilers so you can use the latest tech\n>>> Xamarin.Forms Live XAML Editing\n>>> Automatic compiling and running so you can focus on the code and the results\n>>> Fancy text editor with tabs, semantic highlighting, inline error bubbles, and inline values that are updated as you type\n>>> Watch window enables you to view graphical objects in your app (UI and images), inspect live objects as your app runs, create instances of new objects, and call methods\n>>> Code completion with inline type info and documentation makes learning new APIs fun\n>>> Uses standard .NET file and project formats so you can share code with other IDEs\n>>> Includes Xamarin.Forms and UIKit to build apps and SpriteKit and SceneKit to build games. You can access many iOS APIs including CoreMotion, the Social framework, and HealthKit to read data.\n>>> Split screen support so you can keep documentation by your side\n>>> Execution powered by a new IL interpreter\n\nIf you're new to .NET or iOS coding, you will love the code completion with integrated documentation and the fun examples that come with the app.\n\nIf you're a .NET pro, then you will love the support for projects and the ability to inspect objects as you code them - whether they're in a script or just a normal project file.\n\nIf you're new to programming, C# is an great language to learn: it's powerful yet friendly language, example code is all over the internet, and there are plenty of jobs out there waiting for you.\n\nIf you enjoy thinking a little differently, then you will love that F# is included and fully supported. This amazing programming language will teach you to write better code and will arm you to solve problems that you thought were too big or hard to solve - like writing an IDE."

      "label": "Notebooks is a writing app, a text and markdown editor, your personal Wiki and Zettelkasten, a file organizer, task manager, PDF and eBook creator and more. This may sound like a lot, but consider you have a few text fragments, randomly created, which you want to combine into a chapter of a book and saved as PDF or eBook; or a quick note sparks off an idea, generates a couple of tasks, each of which requires you to organize further research material; or you have business related documents which need to be separated from private diaries, records and files. – With Notebooks you handle these jobs easily without switching apps, and while remaining focussed and creative.\n\n• Notebooks stores all your documents as regular files in standard formats. You are always in control of your documents, never need to worry about how to export them, and they remain compatible across devices and over time.\n\n• Create formatted documents with styles, attachments, tables or checklists, and add a table of contents if you like. Choose between a variation of ready made document styles, or create your own, if you want.\n\n• Write your documents in plain text and allow Notebooks to automatically handle lists, highlight and center the current line on screen, automatically insert closing characters for  (, {, [, \" and more. - Plain text is a universal format which can be used on any device without any specific software.\n\n• Use Markdown to create formatted documents from plain text. Notebooks supports *MultiMarkdown* and its own flavor of *Discount*.  – Click any word in a formatted Markdown text and start writing at that position. You can even create checklists (- [ ]) and tick them off in formatted view. Syntax highlighting and a set of dedicated extra keyboard keys make Markdown editing easy.\n  \n• Use your Apple Pencil to sketch ideas or annotate images and PDF documents.\n\n• Use Notebooks' advanced editing capabilities to work on documents which are stored in other apps.\n\n• Compile selected documents or the contents of whole books into a single document, an eBook or a PDF document.\n\n• Link between documents in Notebooks. In Markdown you can even use Wiki style links ([[ ]]). When clicking a link to a document which does not yet exist, Notebooks suggests to create it. And when you move or rename documents, Notebooks makes sure the links remain intact.\n\n• Create as many books as you need to structure your projects and details. Nest books as deep as you like, there is no limit in Notebooks. If you ever loose track, Notebooks' full text search helps you quickly turn up even the most hidden document.\n\n• Turn books into task lists to display document as tasks which can be ticked off. Assign due dates and alerts, and divide projects into nested sub projects, which makes them easier to handle. \n\n• For simple lists you can use checklists in formatted documents and Markdown.\n\n• Assign Context tags to books and documents to create shortcuts that are accessible for a smart book at Notebooks' top level. – Notebooks can even extract context tags from the contents of documents as you create them.\n\n• Import all documents and files you want to keep close at hand, no matter whether PDF, email, web pages, MS Office or iWorks, photos, videos, music and more.\n\n• Scan documents and extract text using OCR (iOS 13)\n\n• Sync files between iPads, iPhones, Mac or PC. \n\nWith all that, Notebooks may quickly become your one and only app for everything you want to keep close at hand.\n\nUser Comments: \n\n“Notebooks is a wonderful App, which is so much better than the dozen other note apps I tried. It is sophisticated, in an unassuming way, so that you find yourself greatly rewarded and being productive without sacrificing time/effort to the App. I cannot tell you how much productivity I have gained.  I am having a huge amount of fun, I use it constantly, more than the phone on my iPhone in fact.\" \n\n“You are GTD in every way that makes it efficient and makes me efficient.”"

      "label": "First released in 2009, GoodReader® is truly a veteran of the App Store.\n\nIn the modern app business, it's not easy to stay relevant that long. We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase."

      "label": "CalenGoo gives you a fast and easy way to access and modify your Google Calendar with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. It can also be used when you have no Internet connection, using the cached data. Changes are saved and uploaded the next time you are connected.\n\nThe calendar view is similar to the web view of Google Calendar. Events are displayed using the same calendar colors that you use in your Google Calendar, even Google's event colors are supported (please see http://www.calengoo.com/cc ). It also recognizes which calendars are visible and which are hidden. So the view should match the view of your Google Calendar as much as possible. \n\nCalenGoo also has a month view similar to that of Google Calendar. It can be zoomed and panned to quickly get an overview over the events of a month. Zooming the month is done by using the two-finger-zoom gesture that you know from Safari and the photo application. A double tap opens the tapped day.\n\nIt also supports the same kinds of recurrence rules as Google Calendar and displays recurring events correctly even when you are offline or scroll far into the future.\n\nYou can also use Google Calendar's feature to invite people to events and see their status (accepted, declined, maybe, no answer). They will get an invitation email with links to e.g. accept or decline the invitation.\n\nGoogle Calendar has an integrated task list, called Google Tasks. Tasks with a due date are displayed on the corresponding days of the calendar. CalenGoo can do the same, it can sync this list, display your tasks in the calendar views and in a list view and it even makes your tasks available offline. You can edit and add tasks and the changes will be synced with Google Tasks.\n\nYou either need a (free) Google Calendar account to use this app or you can use it with your iOS calendars. However using it with Google Calendar has a few advantages.\n\nTo get more information, screenshots and a tutorial, please go to http://www.calengoo.com\n\nIf you have any problems or suggestions, please send an email to calengoo@dgunia.de or take a look at CalenGoo's support website to get help.\n\nIf you think the font is too small and hard to read, you can increase the font size of all calendar views in the settings under \"Settings\", \"Display and Use\".\n\nFeatures ( http://www.calengoo.com ):\n\n- Drag&drop to quickly copy and move events\n- Templates to quickly create similar events again. They can even be combined, e.g. one template for the location of an event and another for the attendees\n- Print/PDF function to print the day, week, month or agenda view via AirPrint or to email it as a PDF file\n- Supports the same recurrence rules as Google Calendar\n- Supports Google Calendar's event colors when syncing via OAuth2\n- Icons can be assigned to Google Calendar events\n- Date/time can be entered using the iOS wheels or by using a keypad\n- Fast search function\n- Show/edit iOS calendars in addition to Google calendars (or instead of Google calendars)\n- Sync with Google Tasks and iOS Reminders\n- Reminders can be snoozed and they can be (optionally) repeated every minute\n- Birthdays and anniversaries of your contacts can be displayed\n- Zoomable month view, which can be configured to scroll horizontally (month by month) or vertically (week by week)\n- Events can be linked to contacts\n- Floating events and completable events\n- Photos and PDF files can be created and attached to events (via Google Drive)\n- Calendar selection bar to quickly show and hide single calendars\n- The location of an event can be opened with Apple Maps, Google Maps, Navigon, TomTom, Skobbler, Sygic, iGo or Waze\n- View/edit calendars that are shared with others via Google Calendar\n- Many configuration options to change the way the app looks and works"

      "label": "TimeStamps makes it easier to have a look at your working hours and overtime. No more guessing when you come to work or when you have gone on a business trip - from now on, your personal time sheet is always with you.\n\n+++ Staff Pick July/August 2011 and January/February 2012 in the German App Store +++\n\nONE-BUTTON OPERATION\nIn the frontend you always set a time stamp with the same big button. It remembers which time stamp you have used recently and suggests the next stamp type. That's why the next time stamp will be working time when you've had a break before.\n                                               \nKEEP YOUR WORKING TIMES ALWAYS IN SIGHT\nThe frontend display allows you to display different states: current time, working time, break time, etc. You can change the display type with a single tap. Also, the expected end of work is displayed and updated on the fly.\n\nFLEXTIME ACCOUNT\nTimeStamps offers a flextime account for overtimes. Including starting balance, correction factor for each week and Days of in Lieu to get rid of overtime. And in case you don't need a flextime account, it can be switched off in the settings.\n\nAUTOMATIC BREAK\nSpecified in TimeStamps' settings of the default work week, the default break can be automatically deducted as the minimum break at the end of a day. If the break time is exceeded, of course, the larger value is taken. Whether the automatic pause is applied is shown by a symbol within TimeStamps.\n\nEXTENSIVE BACKEND\nIn the backend all time stamps are listed in different views. New time stamps can be added, deleted or existing ones can be altered.\n\nTAGS\nEach time stamp can be assigned a tag from a self-created list. Each tag can of course be changed later, hidden, modified in order or deleted. Coming soon is also a new type of export, who has the ability to choose specific tags.\n\nWORK-FREE DAYS\nUsing the backend, you can set work-free days - holidays, leave days, days of in lieu and sick days are an integral part of TimeStamps. On these days, you do not have to work, so there will be no default work and break time. However, TimeStamps does not prevent that you still record times. So you can still work on holidays or leave days and keep track of it with TimeStamps.\n\nSTATISTICS\nIn the weekly and daily time stamp view, TimeStamps provides small statistics for a better overview. \"How much overtime I've done this week?\", \"How long have I been on a business trip?\" - The statistics provide the kind of information you want.\n\nREPORTS\nVarious reports can be created of all time stamps. You can specify any time period and send reports as HTML or CSV to one or more e-mail addresses. These report configurations can be reused later.\n\nSETTINGS\nNot everyone is working from nine to five, five days a week. So the work and break time for each day of a default work week is definable to the minute. Also working without a break is possible with a single click. The setting of default times can later be changed individually for each day.\n\n\nTHANKS FOR THE SUPPORT\nIf you like TimeStamps, please tell your colleagues, friends and relatives! And we are always thankful for a a positive rating in the App Store.\n\nQuestions, comments and suggestions are always welcome, too. Please use our support e-mail address: support@timestampsapp.com"

      "label": "This is your all-in-one tool for flightduty- and resttime calculations under the new EASA Flight Time Limitations rules, (Commission regulation (EU) 83/2014), coming applicable from February 18, 2016. \n\nAs a sequel to the wide spread successful apps  „EU-OPS vs MTV“, and „EU-OPS“,  this app brings the new EASA FTLs to your iPad and iPhone. As before it also compares the results to company agreements of supported airlines, as well as EU-OPS. \n\nBut also, if your airline is not supported, this app is for you as you won’t pay for the airline part (see details below) !!\n\nSupported airlines:\n•  Austrian Group (Cockpit & Cabin)\n•  Eurowings (Cockpit & Cabin)\n•  Germanwings (Cockpit)\n•  Lufthansa (Cockpit & Cabin)\n•  Lufthansa Cargo\n•  SunExpress Germany\n•  TUIfly (Cockpit & Cabin)\n\n\nCompare EASA to EU-OPS, EASA to Airline, or EU-OPS to airline. Experience the differences to the new regulations side by side.\n\nAs before, calculate max possible flight duty periods, duty periods, latest on-blocks, resttimes, earliest checkin and much more.\n\nThis app has been rewritten from scratch and brings major imrovements:\n\n• universal app for iPhone and iPad, for the first time featuring a very practical  split-view iPad layout\n\n- no more thinking about timezones. Just tell the app the departure and destination airports (three-letter-codes). The app comes with a massive airport database of more than 9000 world airports under the hood, and knows all their timezones including DST changes, always up to date. The database has been „borrowed“ from my other app „Airports Plus“ (Purchase NOT necessary to use database features in this app)\n\n- import your flights directly from your device’s calendar, if written by any roster app (Roster Buster, Offblock, Dutysheet Wx/HD, Boldi etc.)  Most calendar entry formats recognized, including the possibility to teach your custom calendar format, should it not be recognized.\n\n- look-behind import. The app also imports all preceding duty days of your rotation, in order to calculate your correct state of acclimatization\n\n- EASA vs Airline now also calculates:\n• split duty\n• in-flight rest\n• commander’s discretion\n• delayed reporting\n• standby \n\n- Why do I have to pay again, if I already own one of the EU-OPS apps?\nThis app is all new, containing many useful features that the other apps didn’t implement. It has been developed by a professional pilot  over a period of three years, beta-tested by pilots and flight attendants from 5 different European countries. \nSelling to only European aircrews with iOs devices, the market is very limited. At the price of a few Euros, your next hotel bar beer would probably cost you more. Thank you!\n\n- Why is there an in-app purchase?\n\nFor the EU-OPS apps, there have been two different apps at two different prices. If you wanted airline agreement support  (MTV) , you chose the larger „EU-OPS vs MTV“ app. If your airline was not supported, all you needed was the smaller „EU-OPS“ app.\n\nNow „EASA vs Airline FTLs“ follows the same model. You only pay the price for EASA FTLs  at first, including switching to EU-OPS and all the great import and world airport database features described above. \nShould your airline be supported, you can later add that feature by purchasing the „Pro“ features within the app. \n\nDisclaimer:\nAll efforts are made to keep this app up to date and to eliminate any errors. This can not be guaranteed though.\nThis app is intended to help understanding and calculating Flight- and Resttime limitations. It is NOT intended to replace your personal calculations. You are always in charge of making sure the results you are using for actual flight operations are correct. Do not rely on this app only. Make sure you know and understand all regulations applicable to your flight operations. \nThe developer can not be made responsible for any consequences your decisions may have."

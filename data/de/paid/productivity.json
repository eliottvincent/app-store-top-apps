Featured in Apple's \"Amazing Apps\" TV commercial.\n## Staying focused with the cutest gamified timer. \n## Over 800,000 real trees were planted on Earth by our users.  \n\n\"Forest works well, and if your goal is to be more in the moment, ignore your phone and actually talk to your friends when you are with them, this is the app for you.\"— The New York Times \n\n\"In order to establish new, better habits, it's helpful to engage with tools that make it easier to reinforce them. For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

I always wanted to build the habit tracker of my liking and this is it — and I hope you'll enjoy using it too!\n\n### Unlimited Habits\nIf you're just starting out with one or two habits or already have a long list of things you want to keep track of — HabitBoard imposes no limitations on the number of habits you can track.\n\n### Historic Data\nIt provides a detailed calendar-like view of your historic data which grows over time. In addition, you get habit-specific statistics like current and longest streaks, completion rate, and count by week, month, and year.\n\n### Statistics\nHabitBoard makes provides meaningful and beautiful stats that give an overview over all your tracked habits. You can inspect your overall weekly and monthly completions, get an overall completion rate, and keep track of your daily completions.\n\n### Weekly Goals and Skipped Days\nSome habits are not planned daily and HabitBoard makes it easy to configure automatically skipped days and weekly goals per habit. If you set a weekly goal, you'll see an additional label for the current progress in the habit list.\n\n### Customizable Colors\nEach habit can use colors according to your personal taste or for visual grouping of habits. You can customize both the colors for done and missed habit states.\n\n### Widgets\nHabitBoard offers new Lock Screen widgets and small, medium, and a large calendar-like widgets so that you can glance on your habits even if you're not using the app.\n\n### Shortcuts\nWith the \"Mark habit as done\" Shortcuts action, you can combine different tasks to automatically keep your HabitBoard up-to-date.\n\n### Archived Habits\nSome things also come to an end (or are paused), so HabitBoard offers a dedicated place for archived habits. Habits that live there are still fully interactive, so it can also be used as a more private area for certain habits.\n\n### Configuration of List Labels\nIn my own practice of habit tracking, I've noticed that the current streak is not always the most meaningful metric — personally, I focus more on monthly completions. With HabitBoard, you can decide whether you want to display the current streak, weekly, monthly, and yearly completions in addition to the names in the habit list.\n\n### Daily Reminder\nWhen you're starting out, a daily reminder can be useful. If you want, the app notifies you when it's time to review your HabitBoard for the day.\n\n### Automatic Backup and Sync\nHabitBoard securely and privately backups and syncs your habits via iCloud. If you're using a second device, your data is already there.\n\n---\n\nIf you have feedback, a bug report, or want to be a beta tester, feel free to reach out via any of the links under *Settings → About*.\n\nThanks for using HabitBoard!"

      "label": "Entertainment lighting equipment uses a control system called DMX512. DMXCalc is a simple and elegant calculator which does address arithmetic for DMX equipment. \n\nYou can enter a DMX universe number and a device address to have DMXCalc calculate the absolute address. Or enter an absolute address to see the universe and device address. \n\nThe + and - buttons can be set to increment or decrement the address by any block size. Handy for addressing a sequence of moving lights. When there is not enough space in the current universe for another fixture, the Address and + values turn red.\n\nSome DMX equipment utilizes dip switches to configure the address. The dip switch page has switches which show the settings for the current address value, or you can set the switches to match those on a light and discover what its address is. The sound button \"plays\" dipswitch settings so you can set switches without looking at the display.\n\nThe Block page can be loaded with a range of blocks, based on the block size and starting at the current address. Tapping any block on the list loads that address into the calculator and dip switches, and tapping the arrow shows a list of all locations in the block, with both local and absolute addresses. This feature is particularly useful for addressing a series of moving lights, dimmer packs, or LED fixtures.\n\nA fourth page has a quick reference list showing all DMX level values from 0 to 255, with corresponding percentage, hexadecimal, and MIDI values.\n\nAltogether indispensable for the entertainment lighting technician."

      "label": "This is your all-in-one tool for flightduty- and resttime calculations under the new EASA Flight Time Limitations rules, (Commission regulation (EU) 83/2014), coming applicable from February 18, 2016. \n\nAs a sequel to the wide spread successful apps  „EU-OPS vs MTV“, and „EU-OPS“,  this app brings the new EASA FTLs to your iPad and iPhone. As before it also compares the results to company agreements of supported airlines, as well as EU-OPS. \n\nBut also, if your airline is not supported, this app is for you as you won’t pay for the airline part (see details below) !!\n\nSupported airlines:\n•  Austrian Group (Cockpit & Cabin)\n•  Eurowings (Cockpit & Cabin)\n•  Germanwings (Cockpit)\n•  Lufthansa (Cockpit & Cabin)\n•  Lufthansa Cargo\n•  SunExpress Germany\n•  TUIfly (Cockpit & Cabin)\n\n\nCompare EASA to EU-OPS, EASA to Airline, or EU-OPS to airline. Experience the differences to the new regulations side by side.\n\nAs before, calculate max possible flight duty periods, duty periods, latest on-blocks, resttimes, earliest checkin and much more.\n\nThis app has been rewritten from scratch and brings major imrovements:\n\n• universal app for iPhone and iPad, for the first time featuring a very practical  split-view iPad layout\n\n- no more thinking about timezones. Just tell the app the departure and destination airports (three-letter-codes). The app comes with a massive airport database of more than 9000 world airports under the hood, and knows all their timezones including DST changes, always up to date. The database has been „borrowed“ from my other app „Airports Plus“ (Purchase NOT necessary to use database features in this app)\n\n- import your flights directly from your device’s calendar, if written by any roster app (Roster Buster, Offblock, Dutysheet Wx/HD, Boldi etc.)  Most calendar entry formats recognized, including the possibility to teach your custom calendar format, should it not be recognized.\n\n- look-behind import. The app also imports all preceding duty days of your rotation, in order to calculate your correct state of acclimatization\n\n- EASA vs Airline now also calculates:\n• split duty\n• in-flight rest\n• commander’s discretion\n• delayed reporting\n• standby \n\n- Why do I have to pay again, if I already own one of the EU-OPS apps?\nThis app is all new, containing many useful features that the other apps didn’t implement. It has been developed by a professional pilot  over a period of three years, beta-tested by pilots and flight attendants from 5 different European countries. \nSelling to only European aircrews with iOs devices, the market is very limited. At the price of a few Euros, your next hotel bar beer would probably cost you more. Thank you!\n\n- Why is there an in-app purchase?\n\nFor the EU-OPS apps, there have been two different apps at two different prices. If you wanted airline agreement support  (MTV) , you chose the larger „EU-OPS vs MTV“ app. If your airline was not supported, all you needed was the smaller „EU-OPS“ app.\n\nNow „EASA vs Airline FTLs“ follows the same model. You only pay the price for EASA FTLs  at first, including switching to EU-OPS and all the great import and world airport database features described above. \nShould your airline be supported, you can later add that feature by purchasing the „Pro“ features within the app. \n\nDisclaimer:\nAll efforts are made to keep this app up to date and to eliminate any errors. This can not be guaranteed though.\nThis app is intended to help understanding and calculating Flight- and Resttime limitations. It is NOT intended to replace your personal calculations. You are always in charge of making sure the results you are using for actual flight operations are correct. Do not rely on this app only. Make sure you know and understand all regulations applicable to your flight operations. \nThe developer can not be made responsible for any consequences your decisions may have."

      "label": "iMobileSitter protects passwords, PINs and TAN lists using an innovative technique that offers higher security than conventional password managers. At the same time, iMobileSitter is as easy to use as conventional products. Hackers get nuts due to iMobileSitter's resistance against typical attacks (e.g., dictionary and brute-force attacks). Such attacks use trial and error to find the correct master password. Technologies like cloud computing allow to tremendously speed-up these attacks. Hackers do not even have expert knowledge to run the attacks. Many of these supposed secure password managers are actually easy prey for hackers, even if they use strong encryption algorithms such as AES, since important security assumptions for using these algorithms have been neglected by conventional products. iMobileSitter is different. Here, strong cryptographic algorithms are applied in such way that hackers do not get any usable feedback. Thus, when using iMobileSitter the stored passwords are secure. \n\nBesides a higher security level, iMobileSitter provides additional features such as secure random password generation and a backup and restore function to provide additional reliability of the stored secrets in case of defect, loss, or theft. iMobileSitter combines higher security with convenience functions and easy to use interface.\n\niMobileSitter was developed by the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology SIT in Germany. \n\n\nSECURITY\n\niMobileSitter provides resistance against dictionary and brute force attacks. Nowadays, hackers usually test huge amounts of possible master passwords in order to get to the stored secrets. When using conventional password managers to encrypt data, a hacker can detect if the attempted attack was successful even without the necessity of testing the decryption result as a password at the respective service. \n\niMobileSitter is different. Here, an attacker cannot decide if the attempt was successful when looking at the decryption results. iMobileSitter accepts all master passwords. It decrypts the stored information on the basis of the given master password, irrespective of whether or not it is correct. However, the software misguides attackers by displaying wrong passwords.\n\nEvery decryption result looks as if it could be correct. For example, if a hacker decrypts a PIN assigned to a debit card using a master password, the decryption result that is returned will always be a four-digit number combination. From an attacker’s point of view - no matter whether hacker or hacking software - it is indistinguishable if the correct master password is found or not. For hacker or hacking software every decryption attempt seems to be successful.\n\nTo determine whether a decryption result is correct, the hacker has no choice but try to login with result at the respective service. There, however, additional security mechanisms of the service take effect after a defined amount of failed logins, e.g., three in the case of a debit card. \n\nFurther information can be found on http://www.imobilesitter.com\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Use of established cryptographic standards: AES, PBKDF2, ISO/IEC9797-1\n- Group your secrets into folders\n- Alphabetic and user defined sorting\n- Search function\n- Easy data backup (Email, iTunes)\n- Encrypted backups\n- Auto Log-Off\n- Easy master password change\n- Easy device replacement\n\nIf you like iMobileSitter, we would be happy if you write a review. Your feedback is always welcome. Please contact us to report any questions, comments or suggestions. Within the iMobileSitter app use \"Options\" > \"Send email\" for contact."

      "label": "CalenGoo gives you a fast and easy way to access and modify your Google Calendar with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. It can also be used when you have no Internet connection, using the cached data. Changes are saved and uploaded the next time you are connected.\n\nThe calendar view is similar to the web view of Google Calendar. Events are displayed using the same calendar colors that you use in your Google Calendar, even Google's event colors are supported (please see http://www.calengoo.com/cc ). It also recognizes which calendars are visible and which are hidden. So the view should match the view of your Google Calendar as much as possible. \n\nCalenGoo also has a month view similar to that of Google Calendar. It can be zoomed and panned to quickly get an overview over the events of a month. Zooming the month is done by using the two-finger-zoom gesture that you know from Safari and the photo application. A double tap opens the tapped day.\n\nIt also supports the same kinds of recurrence rules as Google Calendar and displays recurring events correctly even when you are offline or scroll far into the future.\n\nYou can also use Google Calendar's feature to invite people to events and see their status (accepted, declined, maybe, no answer). They will get an invitation email with links to e.g. accept or decline the invitation.\n\nGoogle Calendar has an integrated task list, called Google Tasks. Tasks with a due date are displayed on the corresponding days of the calendar. CalenGoo can do the same, it can sync this list, display your tasks in the calendar views and in a list view and it even makes your tasks available offline. You can edit and add tasks and the changes will be synced with Google Tasks.\n\nYou either need a (free) Google Calendar account to use this app or you can use it with your iOS calendars. However using it with Google Calendar has a few advantages.\n\nTo get more information, screenshots and a tutorial, please go to http://www.calengoo.com\n\nIf you have any problems or suggestions, please send an email to calengoo@dgunia.de or take a look at CalenGoo's support website to get help.\n\nIf you think the font is too small and hard to read, you can increase the font size of all calendar views in the settings under \"Settings\", \"Display and Use\".\n\nFeatures ( http://www.calengoo.com ):\n\n- Drag&drop to quickly copy and move events\n- Templates to quickly create similar events again. They can even be combined, e.g. one template for the location of an event and another for the attendees\n- Print/PDF function to print the day, week, month or agenda view via AirPrint or to email it as a PDF file\n- Supports the same recurrence rules as Google Calendar\n- Supports Google Calendar's event colors when syncing via OAuth2\n- Icons can be assigned to Google Calendar events\n- Date/time can be entered using the iOS wheels or by using a keypad\n- Fast search function\n- Show/edit iOS calendars in addition to Google calendars (or instead of Google calendars)\n- Sync with Google Tasks and iOS Reminders\n- Reminders can be snoozed and they can be (optionally) repeated every minute\n- Birthdays and anniversaries of your contacts can be displayed\n- Zoomable month view, which can be configured to scroll horizontally (month by month) or vertically (week by week)\n- Events can be linked to contacts\n- Floating events and completable events\n- Photos and PDF files can be created and attached to events (via Google Drive)\n- Calendar selection bar to quickly show and hide single calendars\n- The location of an event can be opened with Apple Maps, Google Maps, Navigon, TomTom, Skobbler, Sygic, iGo or Waze\n- View/edit calendars that are shared with others via Google Calendar\n- Many configuration options to change the way the app looks and works"

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nGet Started\n• Interactive tutorial project\n• Keep each manuscript and supporting materials in a self-contained project\n• Import Word, RTF, Final Draft and plain text files\n• Easily split imported text into separate sections\n\nGet Writing\n• Write your manuscript in sections of any size\n• View all sections as a single text using the “Draft Navigator” (iPad only)\n• Quickly navigate sections using the “binder” sidebar\n• Format with fonts and presets\n• Comments, footnotes, links and highlights\n• Simple bullets and lists\n• Insert images\n• Pinch-zoom to resize text\n• Full-screen mode (iPad only)\n• Typewriter scrolling mode keeps typed text center-screen (iPad only)\n• Write a screenplay using scriptwriting mode\n• Live word and character counts\n• Set word and character count targets\n• Find and replace\n• Customizable keyboard row provides quick-access buttons for formatting, navigation and punctuation\n• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for external keyboard users\n• Dark mode\n\nFind Your Structure\n• Write in any order and reorganize later\n• Write a synopsis for any text section and see it in the outline\n• Expand, collapse and drill down into sections of your project\n• Rearrange sections as index cards on the corkboard (iPad only)\n• Project-wide search\n• Track ideas using labels and status\n• Apply custom icons to your sections\n\nRefer to Research\n• Import research material such as image, PDF and media files\n• View research files or other sections right alongside your writing (iPad only)\n• Every section has its own notes area for jotting down ideas\n• Supports multi-tasking split screen mode (supported devices only)\n\nShare Your Work\n• Compile to a single document for sharing or printing\n• Use different formatting in your exported or printed document\n• Export to Word, RTF, Final Draft, PDF or plain text\n• Convert rich text to Markdown for sharing with Markdown apps\n• Create and email zipped backups of your projects\n\nWork Anywhere\n• Use Dropbox to sync between devices and with the macOS and Windows versions of Scrivener*\n• Copy projects between devices via iTunes\n\n* Requires a Dropbox account (not compatible with iCloud).\n\nSUPPORT\nYou can contact us at ios.support@literatureandlatte.com, visit our forums at http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum, or find us @scrivenerapp on Twitter."

E.g. if you would like to share your work calendar with your family, you can do it this way. And if you (or your employer) doesn't want the events' details to be uploaded to Google Calendar, you can only upload empty events instead, so that your family knows at least the times of your events.\n\nJust install SyncCal, enter your Google Calendar account, select which calendars should be synced and tap \"Start\". Afterward it will copy the selected calendars into new calendars in Google Calendar. It will also automatically keep them up-to-date by using background refresh and push notifications.\n\nIt can also be configured to automatically sync when you leave your workplace. Just turn \"Sync when leaving this place\" on when you are at work. SyncCal will save the location and afterward it will automatically sync every time you leave your workplace.\n\niOS' birthday calendar can also be synced into a Google calendar this way.\n\nYou can find further information on http://synccal.calengoo.com .

      "label": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

Such cuts are mainly being used in roof, wood and metal construction. \nSaving of time: Thanks to Schifter, you no longer need to painstakingly sketch the sawing angle onto each workpiece. Schifter aims at a quicker completion with a consistently precise sawing result and the workpieces’ better accurancy to fit. Precision: The icosahedron and the tented roof screenshots are meant to demonstrate Schifter’s precision.\n\nThe required cutting angles were calculated by Schifter and then cut with a commercially available sliding compound mitre saw.\n\nThe consistently precise angles of the sawn parts are a basic prerequisite for the success of a platonic solid. Among other features, a free update of the Schifter App to be released later will contain instructions on how to build an icosahedron, a dodecahedron, an octahedron, a hexahedron and a tetrahedron."

As compared to competing VNC viewers, Remote Ripple offers:\n\n- Clean and simple user interface\n- Fast operation even on slow connections\n- Smooth desktop scaling\n- Low memory footprint\n\nIt works via Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G/LTE networks and connects straightly to your remote machines. It does not use intermediate servers and does not route your data to third-party services. While direct connections via Internet may require some configuration, they guarantee best performance and independence from online services.\n\n\nHOW IT CAN HELP YOU\n\nFrom time to time, many of us need to access our “big computers” and use some “big software” installed on it. Remote Ripple allows you to do your work remotely. Also, you can:\n\n- Monitor what's happening on your computers while you're away (use View-only mode to prevent from interfering with the desktop).\n- Provide remote support to your friends and family. Assist in installing software, fix problems and demonstrate how to set up things.\n- Administer servers, workstations and virtual machines remotely.\n- Control your home computers while laying in a lounge chair. For example, you can use Remote Ripple as a remote control for your music or video player running on a PC.\n- Copy a file forgotten on a remote host (while Remote Ripple does not support direct file transfers, it can help in transferring files with other services like Dropbox or Google Drive).\n\nInstall Remote Ripple, and find your own use cases!\n\n\nGETTING STARTED\n\nTo connect with Remote Ripple, make sure your target computer runs a sort of VNC server.\n\n- If the target PC runs Windows, install a VNC server on it. We strongly recommend TightVNC as it provides best performance and compatibility with Remote Ripple. You can download your free copy of TightVNC on its Web site — http://www.tightvnc.com/\n\n- Mac OS X systems already have a VNC server included. It's a part of Apple Remote Desktop service. To enable it, go to System Preferences, choose Sharing, enable Remote Management, press Computer Settings, check “VNC viewers may control screen with password” and enter the password you will use when connecting.\n\n- Most Linux distributions include a number of VNC servers as well. Just install a VNC server from your package collection, and type something like vncserver or tightvncserver (or whatever command starts that particular VNC server). Typically, it will offer you to enter new VNC password and will start sharing your desktop (or create new virtual desktop for you).\n\n- Virtualization systems (such as VMware and QEMU) often include built-in VNC servers, although they may not be enabled by default.\n\n\nGET NEWS AND SUPPORT\n\n- App page at Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RemoteRipple (press Like to see updates in your news feed)\n- Remote Ripple on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RemoteRipple (press Follow to get updates)\n\n\nLIKE REMOTE RIPPLE? RATE AND REVIEW IT ON THE APP STORE!\n\nAlso, we will appreciate if you review Remote Ripple in your blog, social networks, other Web sites or forums. Send us links to your reviews!\n\nThank you!"

Urgent tasks demand an immediate and fast reaction and are usually associated with dealing with someone else's deadlines. Important tasks are achieving our long-term goals are often not urgent. To put us in the position to grow our business and careers, we should spend most of our time working on important and not urgent tasks and delegate all that is urgent but not important. To focus on growing yourself, delegate more if you can.\n\n\"What is important is seldom urgent, and what is urgent is seldom important.\" Dwight \"Ike\" Eisenhower, 34th President of the United States.\n\nKey Features:\n- Create a task and put each into one of the Priority Matrix categories\n- Create a list, add an icon, and improve your productivity\n- Sort created lists using the native drag and drop behaviour\n- Add a due date for each task\n- Use \"Due Date\" categories to check your schedule for today or tomorrow\n- Set a reminder and receive push notifications\n- Use the \"Dwight View\" and swipe fast between different categories\n- Switch between dark and light mode or use the system settings.\n- Change the priority matrix view\n- Use iCloud sync and manage your tasks on other devices\n- Plan a time to work on tasks with the \"Add to calendar\" feature\n- Upload images\n- Create tasks with Siri Shortcuts\n- Change priority with 3D Touch\n- Due date calendar\n- Atlassian cloud integration\n- 2-way communication for Confluence action points\n- Jira issues with advanced attachment management\n- Special lists, daily routine and shopping list"

Time is Your most prescious resource, time to Arise!\n\n“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.\"\n― Sun Tzu, The Art of War\n\nHere is how Arise gets you from the dark playground of procrastination into productivity-land in 4 simple steps:\n\n1.If you are ready to rock it gives an initial dopamine shot with a crazy animated timer\n\n2.If something blocks your doer self, Arise guides you to identify your current demon\n\n3.It coaches you to kick the blocker demon's arse\n\n4.Comes the pomodoro rocket booster to get you into motion!\n\n\nDominating procrastination is a huge deal: it gives you back the control over your own life.\n----\n\nThe first step was to specify the enemies with surgical precision. Yes, plural, because there is not one demon but many - and every one of them requires a special treatment! Mr. Adrenaline-junkie, Mr. Intimidator, Mr. Stigmatizer and 6 other bastards.\n\nThe second insight was understanding their true nature. We realized that they are so strong, we must use their own weapon against themselves to lure them into our evil-genius trap.\n\nThe last step? To eliminate the blind spot from the system which generates the problem: your own mind. Curious how? Outsourcing the solution to an un-biased medium. Now there is an app for that. (There are countless productivity apps, but no one truly effective dedicated to anti-procrastination)\n\nAre you curious how deep the rabbit hole is?\n\nWe are on a mission. We believe, procrastination is a modern epidemic which steals your free time, your money through suboptimal productivity and yes, health (!) and as such it should be cured. We declared war on procrastination and want to turn procrastination into PREcrastination. \n\nAre you ready to destroy your demons and multiply your productive time with the help of this simple but brutally effective app? Hit download and you'll never look back...\n\nFeel free to contact us if you have any feedback: vocabjunkie@gmail.com\n\nLove this new version? Please review it to help us make it better! :)"

      "label": "First released in 2009, GoodReader® is truly a veteran of the App Store.\n\nIn the modern app business, it's not easy to stay relevant that long. We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase."

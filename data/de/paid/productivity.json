For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n• Create personalized Allow Lists for different situations. Non-allowed apps will be blocked.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

      "label": "BimmerLink is the direct link to your BMW or MINI. Using one of the supported OBD adapters you can read trouble codes or display sensor values in realtime, check the current state of the DPF in your car or register a new battery after replacement. BimmerLink even allows you to remotely control the exhaust flap or mute the Active Sound Design in your car.\n\nREAD AND CLEAR TROUBLE CODES\nDiagnose your car as would otherwise be possible only by your Service Partner. In contrast to generic OBD apps that read emission related errors only, BimmerLink allows you to read and clear trouble codes from ALL control units in your car.\n\nDISPLAY REALTIME SENSOR VALUES\nBimmerLink provides a big selection of values like oil temperature or boost pressure. Keep an eye on all the important parameters of your car with a personalized dashboard.\n\nEXHAUST FLAP REMOTE CONTROL*\nTake control over the exhaust flap in your car and decide yourself, whether it should be closed or open.\n\nACTIVE SOUND DESIGN**\nIf you do not like the artificial engine sound generated in your car, just mute the Active Sound Design with BimmerLink.\n\nSOUND TUNING***\nThe “Sound Tuning” option allows you to disable the “exhaust burble“ in cars equipped with the S55 engine (M2 Competition, M3, M4).\n\nDPF REGENERATION****\nBimmerLink allows you to check the current state of the diesel particulate filter in your car. Find out when the last regeneration took place or how much ash has accumulated in the filter and start a regeneration with the touch of a button.\n\nBATTERY REGISTRATION\nIf you want to replace the battery in your car, this has to be registered in the engine control unit and BimmerLink allows you to do this yourself now.\n\nPARKING BRAKE SERVICE MODE\nBimmerLink allows you to activate the service mode for the electromechanical parking brake.\n\nSERVICE RESET\nReset the service display in your car after carrying out maintenance work like a brake pad replacement or an engine oil change.\n\nREQUIRED ACCESSORIES\nTo use the app one of the supported Bluetooth or WiFi OBD adapters or cables is required.

You can also see the current weather and an overview of the current month at a glance.\n\nIntuitive Controls \nIntuitively navigate through your calendars and quickly, easily add events and tasks thanks to predefined settings and simple controls. Standard settings like repeating events and reminders/alarms are just a tap away. And powerful special settings are also available, without sacrificing comfort or control. Swipe through views and open events or days with just a tap.\n\nmiCal Understands You\nQuickly create events with the new natural language input feature. Natural language input allows you to create events just by describing them. And if you have Siri enabled on your device, you can even dictate your event details instead of typing.\n\nThe Total Package\nmiCal provides complete, well-organized day, week and month views and displays the calendar week in all the important views.\n\nRelax\nYou don’t need to contort yourself with miCal. miCal supports portrait as well as landscape formats in nearly every view.  Use each view however it’s most comfortable for you.\n\nTasks/Reminders\nmiCal now supports iOS reminders. Create reminders for all the important tasks in your private and professional life right in the app.\n\nBirthday Manager\nNever again miss an important birthday. Get reminders at preset times featuring the music of your choice.\n\nNice Weather\nFive-day weather forecasts plus the sunrise/sunset times, humidity and wind speed for the current day. The dashboard even features a quick summary of the current weather as well as a brief forecast of the coming days.\n\nComprehensive\nmiCal offers a unique range of features. Copy, move or send your events. Export your events in the date range of your choice as CSV (for Excel, etc.) or ICS (the calendar format). Set colors for your calendars and individual appointments or automatically add colors based on keywords in event titles.\n\nUp to Date and Secure\nmiCal communicates with your device’s integrated calendar. miCal works with  all the calendar services that your device currently supports (iCloud, Google Calendar, Outlook, Exchange, Facebook Events, subscriptions) without requiring additional configuration. That way, you can store your data locally or via the services you know and trust—it’s up to you. miCal itself does not transmit any data to external services or other servers. That allows us to ensure 100% data security.\n\nAward-Winning\n- 3rd place in the \"Best German iPhone App\" competition at the 2010 iPhone Developer conference.\n- Featured as App of the Week in 13 countries.\n- Recommendation from iPhoneWelt and a 5-star rating from iPhone&Co, two of the leading iPhone magazines\n- Honored at the 2010 App Developer Conference"

      "label": "CalenGoo gives you a fast and easy way to access and modify your Google Calendar with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. It can also be used when you have no Internet connection, using the cached data. Changes are saved and uploaded the next time you are connected.\n\nThe calendar view is similar to the web view of Google Calendar. Events are displayed using the same calendar colors that you use in your Google Calendar, even Google's event colors are supported (please see http://www.calengoo.com/cc ). It also recognizes which calendars are visible and which are hidden. So the view should match the view of your Google Calendar as much as possible. \n\nCalenGoo also has a month view similar to that of Google Calendar. It can be zoomed and panned to quickly get an overview over the events of a month. Zooming the month is done by using the two-finger-zoom gesture that you know from Safari and the photo application. A double tap opens the tapped day.\n\nIt also supports the same kinds of recurrence rules as Google Calendar and displays recurring events correctly even when you are offline or scroll far into the future.\n\nYou can also use Google Calendar's feature to invite people to events and see their status (accepted, declined, maybe, no answer). They will get an invitation email with links to e.g. accept or decline the invitation.\n\nGoogle Calendar has an integrated task list, called Google Tasks. Tasks with a due date are displayed on the corresponding days of the calendar. CalenGoo can do the same, it can sync this list, display your tasks in the calendar views and in a list view and it even makes your tasks available offline.

      "label": "iMobileSitter protects passwords, PINs and TAN lists using an innovative technique that offers higher security than conventional password managers. At the same time, iMobileSitter is as easy to use as conventional products. Hackers get nuts due to iMobileSitter's resistance against typical attacks (e.g., dictionary and brute-force attacks). Such attacks use trial and error to find the correct master password. Technologies like cloud computing allow to tremendously speed-up these attacks. Hackers do not even have expert knowledge to run the attacks. Many of these supposed secure password managers are actually easy prey for hackers, even if they use strong encryption algorithms such as AES, since important security assumptions for using these algorithms have been neglected by conventional products. iMobileSitter is different. Here, strong cryptographic algorithms are applied in such way that hackers do not get any usable feedback. Thus, when using iMobileSitter the stored passwords are secure. \n\nBesides a higher security level, iMobileSitter provides additional features such as secure random password generation and a backup and restore function to provide additional reliability of the stored secrets in case of defect, loss, or theft. iMobileSitter combines higher security with convenience functions and easy to use interface.\n\niMobileSitter was developed by the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology SIT in Germany. \n\n\nSECURITY\n\niMobileSitter provides resistance against dictionary and brute force attacks. Nowadays, hackers usually test huge amounts of possible master passwords in order to get to the stored secrets. When using conventional password managers to encrypt data, a hacker can detect if the attempted attack was successful even without the necessity of testing the decryption result as a password at the respective service. \n\niMobileSitter is different. Here, an attacker cannot decide if the attempt was successful when looking at the decryption results. iMobileSitter accepts all master passwords. It decrypts the stored information on the basis of the given master password, irrespective of whether or not it is correct. However, the software misguides attackers by displaying wrong passwords.\n\nEvery decryption result looks as if it could be correct. For example, if a hacker decrypts a PIN assigned to a debit card using a master password, the decryption result that is returned will always be a four-digit number combination. From an attacker’s point of view - no matter whether hacker or hacking software - it is indistinguishable if the correct master password is found or not. For hacker or hacking software every decryption attempt seems to be successful.\n\nTo determine whether a decryption result is correct, the hacker has no choice but try to login with result at the respective service. There, however, additional security mechanisms of the service take effect after a defined amount of failed logins, e.g., three in the case of a debit card. \n\nFurther information can be found on http://www.imobilesitter.com\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Use of established cryptographic standards: AES, PBKDF2, ISO/IEC9797-1\n- Group your secrets into folders\n- Alphabetic and user defined sorting\n- Search function\n- Easy data backup (Email, iTunes)\n- Encrypted backups\n- Auto Log-Off\n- Easy master password change\n- Easy device replacement\n\nIf you like iMobileSitter, we would be happy if you write a review.

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nGet Started\n• Interactive tutorial project\n• Keep each manuscript and supporting materials in a self-contained project\n• Import Word, RTF, Final Draft and plain text files\n• Easily split imported text into separate sections\n\nGet Writing\n• Write your manuscript in sections of any size\n• View all sections as a single text using the “Draft Navigator” (iPad only)\n• Quickly navigate sections using the “binder” sidebar\n• Format with fonts and presets\n• Comments, footnotes, links and highlights\n• Simple bullets and lists\n• Insert images\n• Pinch-zoom to resize text\n• Full-screen mode (iPad only)\n• Typewriter scrolling mode keeps typed text center-screen (iPad only)\n• Write a screenplay using scriptwriting mode\n• Live word and character counts\n• Set word and character count targets\n• Find and replace\n• Customizable keyboard row provides quick-access buttons for formatting, navigation and punctuation\n• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for external keyboard users\n• Dark mode\n\nFind Your Structure\n• Write in any order and reorganize later\n• Write a synopsis for any text section and see it in the outline\n• Expand, collapse and drill down into sections of your project\n• Rearrange sections as index cards on the corkboard (iPad only)\n• Project-wide search\n• Track ideas using labels and status\n• Apply custom icons to your sections\n\nRefer to Research\n• Import research material such as image, PDF and media files\n• View research files or other sections right alongside your writing (iPad only)\n• Every section has its own notes area for jotting down ideas\n• Supports multi-tasking split screen mode (supported devices only)\n\nShare Your Work\n• Compile to a single document for sharing or printing\n• Use different formatting in your exported or printed document\n• Export to Word, RTF, Final Draft, PDF or plain text\n• Convert rich text to Markdown for sharing with Markdown apps\n• Create and email zipped backups of your projects\n\nWork Anywhere\n• Use Dropbox to sync between devices and with the macOS and Windows versions of Scrivener*\n• Copy projects between devices via iTunes\n\n* Requires a Dropbox account (not compatible with iCloud).\n\nSUPPORT\nYou can contact us at ios.support@literatureandlatte.com, visit our forums at http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum, or find us @scrivenerapp on Twitter."

      "label": "\"Oblique Strategies\" is a concept developed by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt to help artists overcome creative blocks through lateral thinking. It consists of a deck of cards, each one containing a vague or ambiguous phrase that can be used to solve a problem intuitively, by breaking conventional thinking patterns and interpreting it from a new perspective.\n\nThis app aims to translate the essence of the original cards deck into a digital experience, making it accessible to a wider audience. It contains the original edition, as well as the newer decks, presenting them in a sleek minimalist style inspired by the original design of the cards. The user interface is simple and straightforward, built to encourage creative or design thinking without distracting from the process. The home screen widget on iOS 14 allows reading a new quote every day without opening the application. The Apple Watch version can run independently without needing the app installed on your iPhone.\n\nWith VoiceOver, anyone with a visual impairment can have the Oblique Strategies phrase read to them. Long tap the screen to have the last sentence read to you again. Also, you can shake the iPhone for a new sentence."

      "label": "This is your all-in-one tool for flightduty- and resttime calculations under the new EASA Flight Time Limitations rules, (Commission regulation (EU) 83/2014), coming applicable from February 18, 2016. \n\nAs a sequel to the wide spread successful apps  „EU-OPS vs MTV“, and „EU-OPS“,  this app brings the new EASA FTLs to your iPad and iPhone. As before it also compares the results to company agreements of supported airlines, as well as EU-OPS. \n\nBut also, if your airline is not supported, this app is for you as you won’t pay for the airline part (see details below) !!\n\nSupported airlines:\n•  Austrian Group (Cockpit & Cabin)\n•  Eurowings (Cockpit & Cabin)\n•  Germanwings (Cockpit)\n•  Lufthansa (Cockpit & Cabin)\n•  Lufthansa Cargo\n•  SunExpress Germany\n•  TUIfly (Cockpit & Cabin)\n\n\nCompare EASA to EU-OPS, EASA to Airline, or EU-OPS to airline. Experience the differences to the new regulations side by side.\n\nAs before, calculate max possible flight duty periods, duty periods, latest on-blocks, resttimes, earliest checkin and much more.\n\nThis app has been rewritten from scratch and brings major imrovements:\n\n• universal app for iPhone and iPad, for the first time featuring a very practical  split-view iPad layout\n\n- no more thinking about timezones. Just tell the app the departure and destination airports (three-letter-codes). The app comes with a massive airport database of more than 9000 world airports under the hood, and knows all their timezones including DST changes, always up to date. The database has been „borrowed“ from my other app „Airports Plus“ (Purchase NOT necessary to use database features in this app)\n\n- import your flights directly from your device’s calendar, if written by any roster app (Roster Buster, Offblock, Dutysheet Wx/HD, Boldi etc.)  Most calendar entry formats recognized, including the possibility to teach your custom calendar format, should it not be recognized.\n\n- look-behind import. The app also imports all preceding duty days of your rotation, in order to calculate your correct state of acclimatization\n\n- EASA vs Airline now also calculates:\n• split duty\n• in-flight rest\n• commander’s discretion\n• delayed reporting\n• standby \n\n- Why do I have to pay again, if I already own one of the EU-OPS apps?\nThis app is all new, containing many useful features that the other apps didn’t implement. It has been developed by a professional pilot  over a period of three years, beta-tested by pilots and flight attendants from 5 different European countries. \nSelling to only European aircrews with iOs devices, the market is very limited. At the price of a few Euros, your next hotel bar beer would probably cost you more. Thank you!\n\n- Why is there an in-app purchase?\n\nFor the EU-OPS apps, there have been two different apps at two different prices. If you wanted airline agreement support  (MTV) , you chose the larger „EU-OPS vs MTV“ app. If your airline was not supported, all you needed was the smaller „EU-OPS“ app.\n\nNow „EASA vs Airline FTLs“ follows the same model. You only pay the price for EASA FTLs  at first, including switching to EU-OPS and all the great import and world airport database features described above. \nShould your airline be supported, you can later add that feature by purchasing the „Pro“ features within the app. \n\nDisclaimer:\nAll efforts are made to keep this app up to date and to eliminate any errors. This can not be guaranteed though.\nThis app is intended to help understanding and calculating Flight- and Resttime limitations. It is NOT intended to replace your personal calculations. You are always in charge of making sure the results you are using for actual flight operations are correct. Do not rely on this app only. Make sure you know and understand all regulations applicable to your flight operations. \nThe developer can not be made responsible for any consequences your decisions may have."

      "label": "Notebooks is a writing app, a text and markdown editor, your personal Wiki and Zettelkasten, a file organizer, task manager, PDF and eBook creator and more. This may sound like a lot, but consider you have a few text fragments, randomly created, which you want to combine into a chapter of a book and saved as PDF or eBook; or a quick note sparks off an idea, generates a couple of tasks, each of which requires you to organize further research material; or you have business related documents which need to be separated from private diaries, records and files. – With Notebooks you handle these jobs easily without switching apps, and while remaining focussed and creative.\n\n• Notebooks stores all your documents as regular files in standard formats. You are always in control of your documents, never need to worry about how to export them, and they remain compatible across devices and over time.\n\n• Create formatted documents with styles, attachments, tables or checklists, and add a table of contents if you like. Choose between a variation of ready made document styles, or create your own, if you want.\n\n• Write your documents in plain text and allow Notebooks to automatically handle lists, highlight and center the current line on screen, automatically insert closing characters for  (, {, [, \" and more. - Plain text is a universal format which can be used on any device without any specific software.\n\n• Use Markdown to create formatted documents from plain text. Notebooks supports *MultiMarkdown* and its own flavor of *Discount*.  – Click any word in a formatted Markdown text and start writing at that position. You can even create checklists (- [ ]) and tick them off in formatted view. Syntax highlighting and a set of dedicated extra keyboard keys make Markdown editing easy.\n  \n• Use your Apple Pencil to sketch ideas or annotate images and PDF documents.\n\n• Use Notebooks' advanced editing capabilities to work on documents which are stored in other apps.\n\n• Compile selected documents or the contents of whole books into a single document, an eBook or a PDF document.\n\n• Link between documents in Notebooks. In Markdown you can even use Wiki style links ([[ ]]). When clicking a link to a document which does not yet exist, Notebooks suggests to create it. And when you move or rename documents, Notebooks makes sure the links remain intact.\n\n• Create as many books as you need to structure your projects and details. Nest books as deep as you like, there is no limit in Notebooks. If you ever loose track, Notebooks' full text search helps you quickly turn up even the most hidden document.\n\n• Turn books into task lists to display document as tasks which can be ticked off. Assign due dates and alerts, and divide projects into nested sub projects, which makes them easier to handle. \n\n• For simple lists you can use checklists in formatted documents and Markdown.\n\n• Assign Context tags to books and documents to create shortcuts that are accessible for a smart book at Notebooks' top level. – Notebooks can even extract context tags from the contents of documents as you create them.\n\n• Import all documents and files you want to keep close at hand, no matter whether PDF, email, web pages, MS Office or iWorks, photos, videos, music and more.\n\n• Scan documents and extract text using OCR (iOS 13)\n\n• Sync files between iPads, iPhones, Mac or PC. \n\nWith all that, Notebooks may quickly become your one and only app for everything you want to keep close at hand.\n\nUser Comments: \n\n“Notebooks is a wonderful App, which is so much better than the dozen other note apps I tried. It is sophisticated, in an unassuming way, so that you find yourself greatly rewarded and being productive without sacrificing time/effort to the App. I cannot tell you how much productivity I have gained.  I am having a huge amount of fun, I use it constantly, more than the phone on my iPhone in fact.\" \n\n“You are GTD in every way that makes it efficient and makes me efficient.”"

      "label": "MODTest Pro is a fast and simple utility for testing MODBUS devices over WiFi or Bluetooth. It supports a wide range of MODBUS functionality, including the ability to operate as a client or server (master or slave). It supports both TCP and UDP connections when using WiFi and it supports serial communication via HM-10 BLE modules.\n\nTap the Setup button for the communication setup page to enter the appropriate parameters for your device. Return to the main display to send your poll and view the data (when in client mode) or accept and respond to data requests from a master device (when in server mode).\n\nThe Comm Setup view allows a number of addressing, timing, and communication mode parameters to be configured. Besides a comprehensive user guide, the app also has extensive  built-in help. Tap on any yellow label or info button for a description of that parameter.\n\nThe app supports MODBUS-TCP, MODBUS-RTU, and MODBUS-ASCII protocols, and they can all be transmitted via TCP, UDP, or Bluetooth. It also supports the GSI protocol which was developed in 1985 and was the first tank gauging protocol to use standard RS232 and RS485 serial data communication media. The app also features a User Data Mode that allows you to enter a complete poll string independent of any particular protocol. This allows transmission of special ASCII data polls or any MODBUS command that is not natively supported by the app.\n\nThe following MODBUS function codes are supported:\n1 – Read Coils\n2 – Read Discrete Inputs\n3 – Read Holding Registers\n4 – Read Input Registers\n5 – Write Single Coil\n6 – Write Single Register\n7 – Read Exception Status \n15 – Write Multiple Coils\n16 – Write Multiple Registers\n17 – Report Server ID\n\nAddresses must be entered in standard MODBUS format (0-65535). If you are accustomed to specifying register addresses in \"Modicon format\", simply subtract 1 from the Modicon Address and delete the prefix number. For example, Modicon Holding Register 40101 is equivalent to MODBUS address 100.\n\nThe app supports a wide range of data representations including:\nUnsigned Integer: 16 bit, 32 bit, and 64 bit\nSigned Integer: 16 bit, 32 bit, and 64 bit\nFloating Point: 32-bit, and 64-bit using IEEE-754 specifications\nHex Data Strings: 16-bit, 32 bit, and 64-bit\nBit and Byte Representations for Coils & Discrete Inputs\n\nThe app also supports the following \"reverse modes\" of floating point data storage:\nAtomic 8-bit Little Endian\nAtomic 16-bit Little Endian\nPDP Endian\nBit Reversal\n\nWhen you exit the Comm Setup page, WiFi connections will be established automatically; however, a manual scan must be initiated to find and select a BLE module within range in order to establish a Bluetooth connection. After a successful Wifi or BLE connection, simply tap the Start Poll button to send your poll command (when in client mode). If you turn the Continuous Poll switch on, the Start Poll button will change to a Stop Poll button while the poll is in progress. When in server mode, the app will wait for and respond to poll requests from a master device once a WiFi or BLE connection is made.\n\nA communication status window will show the raw byte strings that are sent to and received from a remote device. Received data will also be shown in tabular form when in client mode and communication events will be shown when in server mode. The app also tracks a number of communication statistics. \n\nWhen using WiFi your device must be on the network as the device that you want to test. Be sure to use the Settings app to configure your network settings before using the app or you will surely get socket connection errors.\n\nThe app contains no ads or in-app purchases and we will never nag you for reviews, although we do appreciate them. We appreciate your feedback and the app includes a convenient email form to send us comments or suggestions. If you have any issues with the app, please send us a message before posting a negative review and give us a chance to address your concerns."

Die App prüft den Jugendschutz- und Sperrabgleich und stellt das Ergebnis anschaulich anhand einer Ampel dar. Im Idealfall wird dann direkt die PIN-Code Generierung für eines der gekoppelten Geld-SPIEL-Geräte angestoßen, und der PIN-Code an den Spielgast übergeben.

      "label": "First released in 2009, GoodReader® is truly a veteran of the App Store.\n\nIn the modern app business, it's not easy to stay relevant that long. We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase."

      "label": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

Open a LaTeX root file, and Texifier will scan it, open any referenced files, extract the document structure for display in the outline view, and configure the typesetter according to the packages and tools used by your document.\n\nTexifier's editor comes with a choice of themes, syntax highlighting, autocomplete of commands, including those defined in your document, and autofill for \\cite commands, \\ref commands and others.   The powerful sidebar can show you a summary of your document structure allowing you to navigate through large multi-file projects with ease.  Additionally Texifier's outline lists all labels, figures, tables, todos and it contains a powerful search function that can search and replace across your entire project using either normal text searches or regular expression searches.\n\nTexpadTeX - Texifier's internal, no internet connection required, typesetter comes with PGF drivers, Native Fonts extensions, a Unicode and more, allow it to support almost any LaTeX package available.  TexpadTeX also integrates a BibteX tool and a Makeindex compatible indexer for documents that require those tools.  The integrated bundle manager takes care of downloading, installing and updating LaTeX packages for you, giving you access to almost the entire LaTeX ecosystem without using any more space on your device than needed.\n\nTexpadTeX can run in Live mode, updating the output as you type, so you never need wait for a typeset to finish again.\n\nFor the rare cases of documents that are not compatible with TexpadTeX, you can use our free cloud typesetters.  This is fully integrated into Texifier so press typeset, and Texifier will run the typeset in the Cloud, presenting the results just as if they were typeset on your device.\n\nAfter all typesets, any errors in your document are organised in a table of issues. Tap on an issue to jump directly to the offending line of LaTeX source, or the line in the original log if you wish to read the original output.\n\nTexifier works well with Files App, allowing you to store and work on your documents wherever you wish.  On top of that Texifier Connect is directly integrated into Texifier for working across devices and collaborators.\n\nTexifier supports Markdown on an equal footing with LaTeX.  Edit your document in Texifier's syntax highlighting editor, browse the document by outline, then when you press Typeset, the document will be transparently converted and typeset by LaTeX, giving you the informal ease of Markdown with LaTeX's ability to create beautiful and high quality PDFs.  Likewise Plain TeX users can edit and typeset their documents in Texifier.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Universal binary for iPhone and iPad, optimised for the latest generation of devices.\n- Typeset LaTeX to PDF on your iPad and iPhone without need for an internet connection\n- Support for LaTeX, Plain Tex and Markdown\n- Navigate easily through even the largest projects using the Outline view\n- Search all files by string or regex with the global search view\n- Browse the typeset errors and warnings either as a raw log, or with the errors and warnings table view.\n- Texifier's editor autocompletes commands, and autofills commands such as \\ref{...} or \\cite{...}\n- Use iOS Files app to edit documents in any storage that supports file or folder access\n- Instant Live typeset using Texifier's built in TexpadTeX typesetter\n- The onboard typesetter supports virtually any LaTeX package or font, including, but not limited to: Beamer, Tikz, Fontspec, Koma Script, e-TeX, graphicx, pgfplots, AMS, RevTeX, Babel, Bibtex and Indices.\n- Free typesetting through our secure cloud servers gives you access to all packages in the latest TeXLive distribution."

With this app, these parental worries are over.\n\nThis child-friendly and playful sleep trainer lets your child know when they can stay in bed and when it's time to get up. Your child can tell by a quick glance if it's still nighttime or already morning.\nLovingly designed motifs are used, for example a shining sun during the day and a moon with stars at night. You can choose from several motifs, depending on the child's preferences.\n\nParents set a night and day time in the settings. In addition, a calming sleep music can be played, which automatically ends after 60 minutes.\n\nAlong the way, the discreetly lit display can also be used as a night light.\n\nWhen purchasing the app, two beautiful designs are included.\n\nFeatures in the quick overview\n- Sleep trainer for younger children without understanding time\n- Lovingly designed motifs that provide quick information about day and night\n- Adjustable day/night times\n- Quick switching between day/night mode\n- Sleep music can be activated, silenced after 60 minutes\n- Two motifs included\n\nPlease think any disturbing noises from the device, i.e. alarm clocks, notifications or calls.

For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n• Create personalized Allow Lists for different situations. Non-allowed apps will be blocked.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

      "label": "miCal is THE calendar that you’ve always wished your iPhone or iPad had! miCal makes scheduling easier, clearer—and better looking—than ever before.\n\nQuick Overview\nThe dashboard displays your current appointments and events, tasks and birthdays. You can also see the current weather and an overview of the current month at a glance.\n\nIntuitive Controls \nIntuitively navigate through your calendars and quickly, easily add events and tasks thanks to predefined settings and simple controls. Standard settings like repeating events and reminders/alarms are just a tap away. And powerful special settings are also available, without sacrificing comfort or control. Swipe through views and open events or days with just a tap.\n\nmiCal Understands You\nQuickly create events with the new natural language input feature. Natural language input allows you to create events just by describing them. And if you have Siri enabled on your device, you can even dictate your event details instead of typing.\n\nThe Total Package\nmiCal provides complete, well-organized day, week and month views and displays the calendar week in all the important views.\n\nRelax\nYou don’t need to contort yourself with miCal. miCal supports portrait as well as landscape formats in nearly every view.  Use each view however it’s most comfortable for you.\n\nTasks/Reminders\nmiCal now supports iOS reminders. Create reminders for all the important tasks in your private and professional life right in the app.\n\nBirthday Manager\nNever again miss an important birthday. Get reminders at preset times featuring the music of your choice.\n\nNice Weather\nFive-day weather forecasts plus the sunrise/sunset times, humidity and wind speed for the current day. The dashboard even features a quick summary of the current weather as well as a brief forecast of the coming days.\n\nComprehensive\nmiCal offers a unique range of features. Copy, move or send your events. Export your events in the date range of your choice as CSV (for Excel, etc.) or ICS (the calendar format). Set colors for your calendars and individual appointments or automatically add colors based on keywords in event titles.\n\nUp to Date and Secure\nmiCal communicates with your device’s integrated calendar. miCal works with  all the calendar services that your device currently supports (iCloud, Google Calendar, Outlook, Exchange, Facebook Events, subscriptions) without requiring additional configuration. That way, you can store your data locally or via the services you know and trust—it’s up to you. miCal itself does not transmit any data to external services or other servers. That allows us to ensure 100% data security.\n\nAward-Winning\n- 3rd place in the \"Best German iPhone App\" competition at the 2010 iPhone Developer conference.\n- Featured as App of the Week in 13 countries.\n- Recommendation from iPhoneWelt and a 5-star rating from iPhone&Co, two of the leading iPhone magazines\n- Honored at the 2010 App Developer Conference"

      "label": "CalenGoo gives you a fast and easy way to access and modify your Google Calendar with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. It can also be used when you have no Internet connection, using the cached data. Changes are saved and uploaded the next time you are connected.\n\nThe calendar view is similar to the web view of Google Calendar. Events are displayed using the same calendar colors that you use in your Google Calendar, even Google's event colors are supported (please see http://www.calengoo.com/cc ). It also recognizes which calendars are visible and which are hidden. So the view should match the view of your Google Calendar as much as possible. \n\nCalenGoo also has a month view similar to that of Google Calendar. It can be zoomed and panned to quickly get an overview over the events of a month. Zooming the month is done by using the two-finger-zoom gesture that you know from Safari and the photo application. A double tap opens the tapped day.\n\nIt also supports the same kinds of recurrence rules as Google Calendar and displays recurring events correctly even when you are offline or scroll far into the future.\n\nYou can also use Google Calendar's feature to invite people to events and see their status (accepted, declined, maybe, no answer). They will get an invitation email with links to e.g. accept or decline the invitation.\n\nGoogle Calendar has an integrated task list, called Google Tasks. Tasks with a due date are displayed on the corresponding days of the calendar. CalenGoo can do the same, it can sync this list, display your tasks in the calendar views and in a list view and it even makes your tasks available offline.

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nGet Started\n• Interactive tutorial project\n• Keep each manuscript and supporting materials in a self-contained project\n• Import Word, RTF, Final Draft and plain text files\n• Easily split imported text into separate sections\n\nGet Writing\n• Write your manuscript in sections of any size\n• View all sections as a single text using the “Draft Navigator” (iPad only)\n• Quickly navigate sections using the “binder” sidebar\n• Format with fonts and presets\n• Comments, footnotes, links and highlights\n• Simple bullets and lists\n• Insert images\n• Pinch-zoom to resize text\n• Full-screen mode (iPad only)\n• Typewriter scrolling mode keeps typed text center-screen (iPad only)\n• Write a screenplay using scriptwriting mode\n• Live word and character counts\n• Set word and character count targets\n• Find and replace\n• Customizable keyboard row provides quick-access buttons for formatting, navigation and punctuation\n• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for external keyboard users\n• Dark mode\n\nFind Your Structure\n• Write in any order and reorganize later\n• Write a synopsis for any text section and see it in the outline\n• Expand, collapse and drill down into sections of your project\n• Rearrange sections as index cards on the corkboard (iPad only)\n• Project-wide search\n• Track ideas using labels and status\n• Apply custom icons to your sections\n\nRefer to Research\n• Import research material such as image, PDF and media files\n• View research files or other sections right alongside your writing (iPad only)\n• Every section has its own notes area for jotting down ideas\n• Supports multi-tasking split screen mode (supported devices only)\n\nShare Your Work\n• Compile to a single document for sharing or printing\n• Use different formatting in your exported or printed document\n• Export to Word, RTF, Final Draft, PDF or plain text\n• Convert rich text to Markdown for sharing with Markdown apps\n• Create and email zipped backups of your projects\n\nWork Anywhere\n• Use Dropbox to sync between devices and with the macOS and Windows versions of Scrivener*\n• Copy projects between devices via iTunes\n\n* Requires a Dropbox account (not compatible with iCloud).\n\nSUPPORT\nYou can contact us at ios.support@literatureandlatte.com, visit our forums at http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum, or find us @scrivenerapp on Twitter."

      "label": "Congratulations! You’ve just discovered the app that perfects the process of improved attention and focus. Old science has taught us new ways to unlock the power of your brain to stay focused and attentive, even on tasks where it feels nearly impossible. With this app you will experience consistent increases in: \n\n\t-Sustained attention \n\t-Increased focus\n\t-Consistent on-task behavior\n\nYou will become less distracted and more productive, even on the most boring of tasks. \n\nOld Science + New Technology = Earned Success \nNearly 50 years ago, researchers found that using random, audio beeps on a tape recorder (beeper tape) helped test subjects stay focused better than others who:\n   -Depended on another person to prompt them to stay on task \n   -Relied upon reward systems as incentive\n   -Used medication exclusively\n\nDevelop Self-Regulation \nOriginal Beeper App™, developed by a licensed mental health provider is designed to allow you to assess your own level of attention on any given task and to record these results. \n\nThis is important because research shows that a person who can self-monitor their attentiveness and focus, whether through using a beep tape or some other cueing device, will consistently increase in on-task behavior, accuracy and performance. \n\nSelf-regulation strategies are proven to be effective procedures for increasing on-task behavior above and beyond the gains typically associated with medications or other external methods. \n\n\n\nFlexible and Customizable \nYou can set the timer, sound and frequency of your beeper prompts to be exactly suited to your personal needs. You will quickly and easily determine the best settings for you. \n \nUse at School \nOriginal Beeper App™ is custom made for school implementation as well. It does not interfere with a teacher’s lesson, and it does not require constant teacher involvement to manage off-task behaviors. Lastly, since Original Beeper App™ is completely customizable for many situations that require sustained on-task behavior, it is the most effective resource for supporting on-task behavior in the real world, all over the world.    \n \nPossible Applications of Original Beeper App™\n1.     Complete chores at home more quickly\n2.     Independently focus on homework\n3.     Maintain clear attention on work projects\n4.     Get through college courses with confidence \n5.     Work quietly in classroom setting (any grade) \n6.     Apply your best effort on any other situation at school, work or home when sustained focus is expected.\n\n\nWhat Users have already experienced Using Original Beeper App -\n\nThe beeps feel like guardrails keeping focus steadily flowing between the lines. If having a day where they are more distracted, increasing the frequency of the beeps tightens the guardrails. \n\nThe randomness of the beeps (at any frequency) is helpful because it prevents the mind from finding a pattern and coasting. It’s like driving on a curvy road instead of a straight one. \n\nThe beeps help users automatically check in and adjust their focus. If their thoughts are drifting out of the lane, the beep brings them right back where they need to be to stay on-task. \n\n\n*NEVER USE WHEN DRIVING/OPERATING ANY VEHICLE/ MACHINERY\n\n\nvisit originalbeeperapp.com for complete information"

      "label": "iMobileSitter protects passwords, PINs and TAN lists using an innovative technique that offers higher security than conventional password managers. At the same time, iMobileSitter is as easy to use as conventional products. Hackers get nuts due to iMobileSitter's resistance against typical attacks (e.g., dictionary and brute-force attacks). Such attacks use trial and error to find the correct master password. Technologies like cloud computing allow to tremendously speed-up these attacks. Hackers do not even have expert knowledge to run the attacks. Many of these supposed secure password managers are actually easy prey for hackers, even if they use strong encryption algorithms such as AES, since important security assumptions for using these algorithms have been neglected by conventional products. iMobileSitter is different. Here, strong cryptographic algorithms are applied in such way that hackers do not get any usable feedback. Thus, when using iMobileSitter the stored passwords are secure. \n\nBesides a higher security level, iMobileSitter provides additional features such as secure random password generation and a backup and restore function to provide additional reliability of the stored secrets in case of defect, loss, or theft. iMobileSitter combines higher security with convenience functions and easy to use interface.\n\niMobileSitter was developed by the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology SIT in Germany. \n\n\nSECURITY\n\niMobileSitter provides resistance against dictionary and brute force attacks. Nowadays, hackers usually test huge amounts of possible master passwords in order to get to the stored secrets. When using conventional password managers to encrypt data, a hacker can detect if the attempted attack was successful even without the necessity of testing the decryption result as a password at the respective service. \n\niMobileSitter is different. Here, an attacker cannot decide if the attempt was successful when looking at the decryption results. iMobileSitter accepts all master passwords. It decrypts the stored information on the basis of the given master password, irrespective of whether or not it is correct. However, the software misguides attackers by displaying wrong passwords.\n\nEvery decryption result looks as if it could be correct. For example, if a hacker decrypts a PIN assigned to a debit card using a master password, the decryption result that is returned will always be a four-digit number combination. From an attacker’s point of view - no matter whether hacker or hacking software - it is indistinguishable if the correct master password is found or not. For hacker or hacking software every decryption attempt seems to be successful.\n\nTo determine whether a decryption result is correct, the hacker has no choice but try to login with result at the respective service. There, however, additional security mechanisms of the service take effect after a defined amount of failed logins, e.g., three in the case of a debit card. \n\nFurther information can be found on http://www.imobilesitter.com\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Use of established cryptographic standards: AES, PBKDF2, ISO/IEC9797-1\n- Group your secrets into folders\n- Alphabetic and user defined sorting\n- Search function\n- Easy data backup (Email, iTunes)\n- Encrypted backups\n- Auto Log-Off\n- Easy master password change\n- Easy device replacement\n\nIf you like iMobileSitter, we would be happy if you write a review. Your feedback is always welcome. Please contact us to report any questions, comments or suggestions. Within the iMobileSitter app use \"Options\" > \"Send email\" for contact."

      "label": "Notebooks is a writing app, a text and markdown editor, your personal Wiki and Zettelkasten, a file organizer, task manager, PDF and eBook creator and more. This may sound like a lot, but consider you have a few text fragments, randomly created, which you want to combine into a chapter of a book and saved as PDF or eBook; or a quick note sparks off an idea, generates a couple of tasks, each of which requires you to organize further research material; or you have business related documents which need to be separated from private diaries, records and files. – With Notebooks you handle these jobs easily without switching apps, and while remaining focussed and creative.\n\n• Notebooks stores all your documents as regular files in standard formats. You are always in control of your documents, never need to worry about how to export them, and they remain compatible across devices and over time.\n\n• Create formatted documents with styles, attachments, tables or checklists, and add a table of contents if you like. Choose between a variation of ready made document styles, or create your own, if you want.\n\n• Write your documents in plain text and allow Notebooks to automatically handle lists, highlight and center the current line on screen, automatically insert closing characters for  (, {, [, \" and more. - Plain text is a universal format which can be used on any device without any specific software.\n\n• Use Markdown to create formatted documents from plain text. Notebooks supports *MultiMarkdown* and its own flavor of *Discount*.  – Click any word in a formatted Markdown text and start writing at that position. You can even create checklists (- [ ]) and tick them off in formatted view. Syntax highlighting and a set of dedicated extra keyboard keys make Markdown editing easy.\n  \n• Use your Apple Pencil to sketch ideas or annotate images and PDF documents.\n\n• Use Notebooks' advanced editing capabilities to work on documents which are stored in other apps.\n\n• Compile selected documents or the contents of whole books into a single document, an eBook or a PDF document.\n\n• Link between documents in Notebooks. In Markdown you can even use Wiki style links ([[ ]]). When clicking a link to a document which does not yet exist, Notebooks suggests to create it. And when you move or rename documents, Notebooks makes sure the links remain intact.\n\n• Create as many books as you need to structure your projects and details. Nest books as deep as you like, there is no limit in Notebooks. If you ever loose track, Notebooks' full text search helps you quickly turn up even the most hidden document.\n\n• Turn books into task lists to display document as tasks which can be ticked off. Assign due dates and alerts, and divide projects into nested sub projects, which makes them easier to handle. \n\n• For simple lists you can use checklists in formatted documents and Markdown.\n\n• Assign Context tags to books and documents to create shortcuts that are accessible for a smart book at Notebooks' top level. – Notebooks can even extract context tags from the contents of documents as you create them.\n\n• Import all documents and files you want to keep close at hand, no matter whether PDF, email, web pages, MS Office or iWorks, photos, videos, music and more.\n\n• Scan documents and extract text using OCR (iOS 13)\n\n• Sync files between iPads, iPhones, Mac or PC. \n\nWith all that, Notebooks may quickly become your one and only app for everything you want to keep close at hand.\n\nUser Comments: \n\n“Notebooks is a wonderful App, which is so much better than the dozen other note apps I tried. It is sophisticated, in an unassuming way, so that you find yourself greatly rewarded and being productive without sacrificing time/effort to the App. I cannot tell you how much productivity I have gained.  I am having a huge amount of fun, I use it constantly, more than the phone on my iPhone in fact.\" \n\n“You are GTD in every way that makes it efficient and makes me efficient.”"

It's a different way of looking at the day\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nThe visual planner works like an analog clock widget. It automatically receives all the calendar events and overlays them on the 12/24 hour dial. This provides a different, more efficient view of your schedule.\n\nHOW IT LOOKS\n\nIt looks like a projection of your calendar of events onto a 12-hour dial that has hour and minute hands just like a regular watch.\nEvent sectors are displayed in those hour intervals in which they will occur.\nThe interval of idle time between events is displayed between sectors, as well as the time from an hour hand to the start of each event.\nEvents are displayed automatically 12/24 hours ahead of time.\n\nThe calendar and analog clock, combined, give a visual representation of your busyness, allow you to effectively plan and calculate daytime.\n\nUse a widget for better integration.\n\nAREAS OF APPLICATION\n\n• Day scheduling and timing. Conveniently track your daily tasks, meetings, events and at any time know how much time is left to wait until the end of the current event and until the start of the next. Don't be late.\n\n• Accounting and control of working hours. Keep your phone in your workplace and you will be completely under control.\n\n• Class schedule. Observe how much time is left before the end of a tiresome lecture at the university and never be late for laboratory work.\n\n• Schedule of the day. Follow your daily routine and get better, just use the app to keep track of your to-dos and daily tasks. Take rest breaks in time!\n\n• Trip timer and flight duration. Are you losing the passage of time due to endless travel and flights? Control check-in time, boarding time and flight duration. Keep everything under control.\n\n• Make your meal, medication, and exercise schedule clearer. Lead the right lifestyle and be healthy!\n\n• Convenient countdown to scheduled events in the app and widget. The plan of the day will be executed exactly.\n\n• The app may appeal to fans of Pomodoro and Chronodex timer technologies. Time tracking with him will happen in a new way."

Thus the files remain encrypted for the entire time.\n\nSYNCHRONIZATION\nSimpleumSafe was developed with Extreme Secure Synchronization - continuously encrypted. Even if the synchronization data was stolen from the cloud and the password became public, it is not possible to decrypt the data."

Well, with Anchor Alarm you've the ability to set your swing shape in advance as individually as specific for each situation!\n\nAll feature at a glance:\n§ Individual shapes instead of a fix swing arc\n§ Alarm sound which will wake you\n§ Ship dimensions in true-to-scale representation in the map\n§ Optional alarm on low battery or other power supply issues\n§ Optional alarm on poor GPS accuracy\n§ Optional alarm on low volume / silent mode\n§ Optional alarm if headset is connected\n§ All alarms are active in the background and even if you lock your iPhone.\n\nApple Disclaimer\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.

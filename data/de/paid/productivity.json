Featured in Apple's \"Amazing Apps\" TV commercial.\n## Staying focused with the cutest gamified timer. \n## Over 800,000 real trees were planted on Earth by our users.  \n\n\"Forest works well, and if your goal is to be more in the moment, ignore your phone and actually talk to your friends when you are with them, this is the app for you.\"— The New York Times \n\n\"In order to establish new, better habits, it's helpful to engage with tools that make it easier to reinforce them. For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

You can also see the current weather and an overview of the current month at a glance.\n\nIntuitive Controls \nIntuitively navigate through your calendars and quickly, easily add events and tasks thanks to predefined settings and simple controls. Standard settings like repeating events and reminders/alarms are just a tap away. And powerful special settings are also available, without sacrificing comfort or control. Swipe through views and open events or days with just a tap.\n\nmiCal Understands You\nQuickly create events with the new natural language input feature. Natural language input allows you to create events just by describing them. And if you have Siri enabled on your device, you can even dictate your event details instead of typing.\n\nThe Total Package\nmiCal provides complete, well-organized day, week and month views and displays the calendar week in all the important views.\n\nRelax\nYou don’t need to contort yourself with miCal. miCal supports portrait as well as landscape formats in nearly every view.  Use each view however it’s most comfortable for you.\n\nTasks/Reminders\nmiCal now supports iOS reminders. Create reminders for all the important tasks in your private and professional life right in the app.\n\nBirthday Manager\nNever again miss an important birthday. Get reminders at preset times featuring the music of your choice.\n\nNice Weather\nFive-day weather forecasts plus the sunrise/sunset times, humidity and wind speed for the current day. The dashboard even features a quick summary of the current weather as well as a brief forecast of the coming days.\n\nComprehensive\nmiCal offers a unique range of features. Copy, move or send your events. Export your events in the date range of your choice as CSV (for Excel, etc.) or ICS (the calendar format). Set colors for your calendars and individual appointments or automatically add colors based on keywords in event titles.\n\nUp to Date and Secure\nmiCal communicates with your device’s integrated calendar. miCal works with  all the calendar services that your device currently supports (iCloud, Google Calendar, Outlook, Exchange, Facebook Events, subscriptions) without requiring additional configuration. That way, you can store your data locally or via the services you know and trust—it’s up to you. miCal itself does not transmit any data to external services or other servers. That allows us to ensure 100% data security.\n\nAward-Winning\n- 3rd place in the \"Best German iPhone App\" competition at the 2010 iPhone Developer conference.\n- Featured as App of the Week in 13 countries.\n- Recommendation from iPhoneWelt and a 5-star rating from iPhone&Co, two of the leading iPhone magazines\n- Honored at the 2010 App Developer Conference"

It's the most advanced screen mirroring solution with zero delay and the highest screen quality.\n\nMirror photos, videos, games, websites, apps, presentations, documents and spreadsheets on Roku.\n\n* Supported Roku TVs: Hisense, Sharp, TCL, Insignia, Hitachi, Philips, Element, JVC\n\n* Your iPhone/iPad and your Roku must be connected to the same wifi to enable screen mirroring. Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Roku or any other trademark mentioned here.

      "label": "CalenGoo gives you a fast and easy way to access and modify your Google Calendar with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. It can also be used when you have no Internet connection, using the cached data. Changes are saved and uploaded the next time you are connected.\n\nThe calendar view is similar to the web view of Google Calendar. Events are displayed using the same calendar colors that you use in your Google Calendar, even Google's event colors are supported (please see http://www.calengoo.com/cc ). It also recognizes which calendars are visible and which are hidden. So the view should match the view of your Google Calendar as much as possible. \n\nCalenGoo also has a month view similar to that of Google Calendar. It can be zoomed and panned to quickly get an overview over the events of a month. Zooming the month is done by using the two-finger-zoom gesture that you know from Safari and the photo application. A double tap opens the tapped day.\n\nIt also supports the same kinds of recurrence rules as Google Calendar and displays recurring events correctly even when you are offline or scroll far into the future.\n\nYou can also use Google Calendar's feature to invite people to events and see their status (accepted, declined, maybe, no answer). They will get an invitation email with links to e.g. accept or decline the invitation.\n\nGoogle Calendar has an integrated task list, called Google Tasks. Tasks with a due date are displayed on the corresponding days of the calendar. CalenGoo can do the same, it can sync this list, display your tasks in the calendar views and in a list view and it even makes your tasks available offline. You can edit and add tasks and the changes will be synced with Google Tasks.\n\nYou either need a (free) Google Calendar account to use this app or you can use it with your iOS calendars. However using it with Google Calendar has a few advantages.\n\nTo get more information, screenshots and a tutorial, please go to http://www.calengoo.com\n\nIf you have any problems or suggestions, please send an email to calengoo@dgunia.de or take a look at CalenGoo's support website to get help.\n\nIf you think the font is too small and hard to read, you can increase the font size of all calendar views in the settings under \"Settings\", \"Display and Use\".\n\nFeatures ( http://www.calengoo.com ):\n\n- Drag&drop to quickly copy and move events\n- Templates to quickly create similar events again. They can even be combined, e.g. one template for the location of an event and another for the attendees\n- Print/PDF function to print the day, week, month or agenda view via AirPrint or to email it as a PDF file\n- Supports the same recurrence rules as Google Calendar\n- Supports Google Calendar's event colors when syncing via OAuth2\n- Icons can be assigned to Google Calendar events\n- Date/time can be entered using the iOS wheels or by using a keypad\n- Fast search function\n- Show/edit iOS calendars in addition to Google calendars (or instead of Google calendars)\n- Sync with Google Tasks and iOS Reminders\n- Reminders can be snoozed and they can be (optionally) repeated every minute\n- Birthdays and anniversaries of your contacts can be displayed\n- Zoomable month view, which can be configured to scroll horizontally (month by month) or vertically (week by week)\n- Events can be linked to contacts\n- Floating events and completable events\n- Photos and PDF files can be created and attached to events (via Google Drive)\n- Calendar selection bar to quickly show and hide single calendars\n- The location of an event can be opened with Apple Maps, Google Maps, Navigon, TomTom, Skobbler, Sygic, iGo or Waze\n- View/edit calendars that are shared with others via Google Calendar\n- Many configuration options to change the way the app looks and works"

      "label": "iMobileSitter protects passwords, PINs and TAN lists using an innovative technique that offers higher security than conventional password managers. At the same time, iMobileSitter is as easy to use as conventional products. Hackers get nuts due to iMobileSitter's resistance against typical attacks (e.g., dictionary and brute-force attacks). Such attacks use trial and error to find the correct master password. Technologies like cloud computing allow to tremendously speed-up these attacks. Hackers do not even have expert knowledge to run the attacks. Many of these supposed secure password managers are actually easy prey for hackers, even if they use strong encryption algorithms such as AES, since important security assumptions for using these algorithms have been neglected by conventional products. iMobileSitter is different. Here, strong cryptographic algorithms are applied in such way that hackers do not get any usable feedback. Thus, when using iMobileSitter the stored passwords are secure. \n\nBesides a higher security level, iMobileSitter provides additional features such as secure random password generation and a backup and restore function to provide additional reliability of the stored secrets in case of defect, loss, or theft. iMobileSitter combines higher security with convenience functions and easy to use interface.\n\niMobileSitter was developed by the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology SIT in Germany. \n\n\nSECURITY\n\niMobileSitter provides resistance against dictionary and brute force attacks. Nowadays, hackers usually test huge amounts of possible master passwords in order to get to the stored secrets. When using conventional password managers to encrypt data, a hacker can detect if the attempted attack was successful even without the necessity of testing the decryption result as a password at the respective service. \n\niMobileSitter is different. Here, an attacker cannot decide if the attempt was successful when looking at the decryption results. iMobileSitter accepts all master passwords. It decrypts the stored information on the basis of the given master password, irrespective of whether or not it is correct. However, the software misguides attackers by displaying wrong passwords.\n\nEvery decryption result looks as if it could be correct. For example, if a hacker decrypts a PIN assigned to a debit card using a master password, the decryption result that is returned will always be a four-digit number combination. From an attacker’s point of view - no matter whether hacker or hacking software - it is indistinguishable if the correct master password is found or not. For hacker or hacking software every decryption attempt seems to be successful.\n\nTo determine whether a decryption result is correct, the hacker has no choice but try to login with result at the respective service. There, however, additional security mechanisms of the service take effect after a defined amount of failed logins, e.g., three in the case of a debit card. \n\nFurther information can be found on http://www.imobilesitter.com\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Use of established cryptographic standards: AES, PBKDF2, ISO/IEC9797-1\n- Group your secrets into folders\n- Alphabetic and user defined sorting\n- Search function\n- Easy data backup (Email, iTunes)\n- Encrypted backups\n- Auto Log-Off\n- Easy master password change\n- Easy device replacement\n\nIf you like iMobileSitter, we would be happy if you write a review. Your feedback is always welcome. Please contact us to report any questions, comments or suggestions. Within the iMobileSitter app use \"Options\" > \"Send email\" for contact."

We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase."

      "label": "This is your all-in-one tool for flightduty- and resttime calculations under the new EASA Flight Time Limitations rules, (Commission regulation (EU) 83/2014), coming applicable from February 18, 2016. \n\nAs a sequel to the wide spread successful apps  „EU-OPS vs MTV“, and „EU-OPS“,  this app brings the new EASA FTLs to your iPad and iPhone. As before it also compares the results to company agreements of supported airlines, as well as EU-OPS. \n\nBut also, if your airline is not supported, this app is for you as you won’t pay for the airline part (see details below) !!\n\nSupported airlines:\n•  Austrian Group (Cockpit & Cabin)\n•  Eurowings (Cockpit & Cabin)\n•  Germanwings (Cockpit)\n•  Lufthansa (Cockpit & Cabin)\n•  Lufthansa Cargo\n•  SunExpress Germany\n•  TUIfly (Cockpit & Cabin)\n\n\nCompare EASA to EU-OPS, EASA to Airline, or EU-OPS to airline. Experience the differences to the new regulations side by side.\n\nAs before, calculate max possible flight duty periods, duty periods, latest on-blocks, resttimes, earliest checkin and much more.\n\nThis app has been rewritten from scratch and brings major imrovements:\n\n• universal app for iPhone and iPad, for the first time featuring a very practical  split-view iPad layout\n\n- no more thinking about timezones. Just tell the app the departure and destination airports (three-letter-codes). The app comes with a massive airport database of more than 9000 world airports under the hood, and knows all their timezones including DST changes, always up to date. The database has been „borrowed“ from my other app „Airports Plus“ (Purchase NOT necessary to use database features in this app)\n\n- import your flights directly from your device’s calendar, if written by any roster app (Roster Buster, Offblock, Dutysheet Wx/HD, Boldi etc.)  Most calendar entry formats recognized, including the possibility to teach your custom calendar format, should it not be recognized.\n\n- look-behind import. The app also imports all preceding duty days of your rotation, in order to calculate your correct state of acclimatization\n\n- EASA vs Airline now also calculates:\n• split duty\n• in-flight rest\n• commander’s discretion\n• delayed reporting\n• standby \n\n- Why do I have to pay again, if I already own one of the EU-OPS apps?\nThis app is all new, containing many useful features that the other apps didn’t implement. It has been developed by a professional pilot  over a period of three years, beta-tested by pilots and flight attendants from 5 different European countries. \nSelling to only European aircrews with iOs devices, the market is very limited. At the price of a few Euros, your next hotel bar beer would probably cost you more. Thank you!\n\n- Why is there an in-app purchase?\n\nFor the EU-OPS apps, there have been two different apps at two different prices. If you wanted airline agreement support  (MTV) , you chose the larger „EU-OPS vs MTV“ app. If your airline was not supported, all you needed was the smaller „EU-OPS“ app.\n\nNow „EASA vs Airline FTLs“ follows the same model. You only pay the price for EASA FTLs  at first, including switching to EU-OPS and all the great import and world airport database features described above. \nShould your airline be supported, you can later add that feature by purchasing the „Pro“ features within the app. \n\nDisclaimer:\nAll efforts are made to keep this app up to date and to eliminate any errors. This can not be guaranteed though.\nThis app is intended to help understanding and calculating Flight- and Resttime limitations. It is NOT intended to replace your personal calculations. You are always in charge of making sure the results you are using for actual flight operations are correct. Do not rely on this app only. Make sure you know and understand all regulations applicable to your flight operations. \nThe developer can not be made responsible for any consequences your decisions may have."

      "label": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

      "label": "Dwight - Priority Task Matrix is a task management solution based on the Eisenhower principle, helping you filter tasks by urgency and importance and concentrate on what matters to you.\n\nThis method requires group tasks and activities into four priorities based on urgency and importance and plan them ahead of time, before the next productive day.\n\nPriority matrix:\n- Important and urgent.\n- Important but not urgent.\n- Not important but urgent.\n- Not important and not urgent.\n\nIt is essential to understand the difference between important and urgent tasks. Urgent tasks demand an immediate and fast reaction and are usually associated with dealing with someone else's deadlines. Important tasks are achieving our long-term goals are often not urgent. To put us in the position to grow our business and careers, we should spend most of our time working on important and not urgent tasks and delegate all that is urgent but not important. To focus on growing yourself, delegate more if you can.\n\n\"What is important is seldom urgent, and what is urgent is seldom important.\" Dwight \"Ike\" Eisenhower, 34th President of the United States.\n\nKey Features:\n- Create a task and put each into one of the Priority Matrix categories\n- Create a list, add an icon, and improve your productivity\n- Sort created lists using the native drag and drop behaviour\n- Add a due date for each task\n- Use \"Due Date\" categories to check your schedule for today or tomorrow\n- Set a reminder and receive push notifications\n- Use the \"Dwight View\" and swipe fast between different categories\n- Switch between dark and light mode or use the system settings.\n- Change the priority matrix view\n- Use iCloud sync and manage your tasks on other devices\n- Plan a time to work on tasks with the \"Add to calendar\" feature\n- Upload images\n- Create tasks with Siri Shortcuts\n- Change priority with 3D Touch\n- Due date calendar\n- Atlassian cloud integration\n- 2-way communication for Confluence action points\n- Jira issues with advanced attachment management\n- Special lists, daily routine and shopping list"

Display and delete fax messages received by your FRITZ!Box fax machine\n\nMultiple FRITZ!Box devices can be configured (e.g. Private, Office etc.). In addition you can combine several lists as groups to easily get an overview across all your devices.\n\nThe voice box messages and received fax documents will be downloaded from the Fritz!Box, stored within the app and can be accessed also in offline mode when your iPhone cannot connect to the Fritz!Box. Access to the FRITZ!Box is also possible outside your local WiFi network if the option \"Grant access to storage to users from the Internet\" is enabled and you configured the MyFRITZ! service or a dynamic DNS domain name in your Fritz!Box. \n\nPrerequisites for using the app: \n- You need an AVM Fritz!Box\n- Voice box and fax messages: Answering or fax machine must be configured in your Fritz!Box.\n\nCurrently the AVM Fritz!Box models 7590, 7490 and 6490 with the latest firmware are supported. In principle it should also be possible to use other Fritz!Box models with this app, but those were not yet tested. If you have feedback about using the app with other models please let us know by sending an email to support@checkmybox.de. In case the file format or the way messages are stored by the Fritz!Box answering or fax machine should be changed in future firmware versions, we'll make all effort to adopt this app accordingly. Nevertheless it cannot be guaranteed that this is technically possible in all cases. \n\nThe app comes with a detailed setup wizard which easily guides you through step-by-step instructions on how to configure your Fritz!Box and the required settings within the app. If you have questions, suggestions for improvements or need help in setting up this app, please don't hesitate to send an email to support@checkmybox.de. We're happy to assist you and your feedback is highly appreciated.\n\nAVM, FRITZ! and FRITZ!Box are registered trademarks of AVM GmbH, Berlin (Germany).

You can also do an FBX export by email.PC-side software allows you to import VRM models.\n\nTo export FBX, turn on the REC mode and record. And when you press the mail button, the version selection screen of FBX appears, and when you press the OK button, the FBX file is saved in the File folder and the mailer starts.\n\nDetailed usage is available at the following URL:\nhttps://ifacialmocap.com/\n\nThis app can create face animations by communicating with Maya, Unity, 3dsMax and Blender in real time. In addition, animations created in real time can be baked.\n\nThis app can load VRM avatars within the iOS app. In addition, this app is linked with VMagicMirror on the PC and VRM related apps such as Luppet and HANA_APP.\n\nTo use, first start this app, then start \"iFacialMocap to SoftWare app\" on your PC and enter your iPhone's IP address.\n(Donwload from PC use :https://ifacialmocap.com/download/\n)\n\n Next, create up to 52 morph targets (BlendShape or ShapeKey) according to the naming convention.\nFinally, use 3DCG software to load the script / add-on and press the connection button.\n\nVery accurate facial motion capture can be performed very easily.\n\nThis app is only available for models equipped with FaceID. The camera image and resulting depth data are only used to send motion capture data to the user's PC. That data is not stored in the iPhone. To get depth data from Apple's API, access to the camera is required.\n\nThis application is only used for communication with PCs within the same network and does not send information to third parties.\n\nThis app can only be used on iOS devices equipped with FaceID.\n\nSupported devices are as follows：\n\n・iPhone\niPhone13 mini\nPhone13 Pro Max\niPhone13 Pro\niPhone13\niPhone12 Pro Max\niPhone12 Pro\niPhone12\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11\niPhone XS Max\niPhone XS\niPhone XR\niPhone X\n\n・iPad\niPad Pro 12.9-inch (5th generation)\niPad Pro 12.9-inch (4th generation)\niPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation)\niPad Pro 11-inch (2nd generation)\niPad Pro 11-inch\n\n* Face ID is not installed in the new iPhone SE 2nd generation released in 2020, but you can use iFacial Mocap by updating to iOS 14 or later. Not limited to iPhone SE 2nd generation, iFacial Mocap can be used if it has an A12 or higher chip and has been updated to iOS14."

Its advanced simulation engine can handle both analog and digital circuits and features realtime always-on analysis. It is the perfect companion to students, hobbyists, and engineers.\n\nYou use it as you would any CAD program: you add elements, connect them together, and set their properties.\n\nBut iCircuit is unlike other CAD programs because it is always simulating. It's just like working with the real circuit. You do not stop to take a measurement or spend a lot of time configuring reports. Instead, you just play with the circuit as you normally would, with the power on!\n\nThere are over 70 elements you can use to build your circuits. The app has everything from a programmable Arduino, to simple resistors, to switches, to MOSFETS, to digital gates.\n\nThe app features a multimeter that you use to probe around the circuit to instantly read voltages and currents. If you want to see how a value changes over time, then you can add values to the built-in oscilloscope. The scope can simultaneously track many signals over time and features a touch interface to control the total time displayed and stacked and unstacked modes to easily compare signals. The scope can also display the Fourier transform of any signal so that you can see the performance of filters.\n\nSupported elements include:\n\n• Programmable Arduino using a subset of the C programming language\n• Signal generators, Voltage sources, Current sources, and Dependent sources\n• Resistors, Capacitors, and Inductors\n• Manual SPST/SPDT and DPST/DPDT Switches, Push buttons, and Relays\n• LEDs, Diodes, BJ Transistors, and MOSFETs\n• Audio simulation with Speakers, Microphones, Buzzers, DC Motors, and LEDs\n• ADCs, and DACs\n• Logic gates: AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR\n• JK and D Flip-flops\n• 38 7400 series digital parts \n• 78xx and LM317 voltage regulators\n• 7-segment display and driver\n• Antenna with simulated AM and FM signals\n\nYou can also create sub circuits to introduce new elements and componentize your designs.\n\nNo matter your skill set, you'll be playing with circuits in no time with iCircuit."

To this end the app will remind you even a month before the event of the first open tasks. Of course you can also change this timeframe as needed. A preconfigured task list ensures that during the organization of the event nothing will be overlooked, and moreover can be manually tailored to your personal requirements in creating the event. Via push notification you will be conveniently reminded of tasks yet outstanding. That facilitates planning your event and ensures that no details will be forgotten. \n\nDesign and processing of the guest list becomes child’s play with our app. Not only can the number of guests be constantly updated as needed, but using the three-color coded structure you can also determine categories for the visitors to your party (such as family, friends, etc). \n\nAn integrated expense calculator allows you to maintain views of total cost, already fully and partially paid amounts as well as amounts still payable. Of course you can customize the expense planner by expanding or reducing the number of its categories. \n\nYour party planner will also take care of computing the expected quantities of drinks needed based on your personal drink selection. You’ll simply input the anticipated duration of the event, the drinking behavior of the party guests, and the kinds of drinks you would like to serve and in what proportions. The number of guests will be automatically retrieved from the guest list. \n\nThe party planner makes it easy to organize your personal and all-round perfect party. It’s equally suitable for planning birthdays, family parties, company events, jubilees, grill parties and get-togethers among friends. \n\nDo post the status of your party preparations on Facebook and Twitter. That way your guests can always keep up-to-date with the current state of affairs. \n\n\nOverview of features: \n• Party countdown \n• Universalapp\n• Individual expense planner \n• Predefined flexible expense listing \n• Overview of due tasks \n• Custom task list, according to the type of the party\n• Details for each task \n• Push notifications for open tasks \n• Links to Facebook and Twitter \n• Flexible guest list \n• Available guest categories \n• Individual drinks calculator, adapted to the drinking habits of your guests\n• Guest Categories"

      "label": "TimeStamps makes it easier to have a look at your working hours and overtime. No more guessing when you come to work or when you have gone on a business trip - from now on, your personal time sheet is always with you.\n\n+++ Staff Pick July/August 2011 and January/February 2012 in the German App Store +++\n\nONE-BUTTON OPERATION\nIn the frontend you always set a time stamp with the same big button. It remembers which time stamp you have used recently and suggests the next stamp type. That's why the next time stamp will be working time when you've had a break before.\n                                               \nKEEP YOUR WORKING TIMES ALWAYS IN SIGHT\nThe frontend display allows you to display different states: current time, working time, break time, etc. You can change the display type with a single tap. Also, the expected end of work is displayed and updated on the fly.\n\nFLEXTIME ACCOUNT\nTimeStamps offers a flextime account for overtimes. Including starting balance, correction factor for each week and Days of in Lieu to get rid of overtime. And in case you don't need a flextime account, it can be switched off in the settings.\n\nAUTOMATIC BREAK\nSpecified in TimeStamps' settings of the default work week, the default break can be automatically deducted as the minimum break at the end of a day. If the break time is exceeded, of course, the larger value is taken. Whether the automatic pause is applied is shown by a symbol within TimeStamps.\n\nEXTENSIVE BACKEND\nIn the backend all time stamps are listed in different views. New time stamps can be added, deleted or existing ones can be altered.\n\nTAGS\nEach time stamp can be assigned a tag from a self-created list. Each tag can of course be changed later, hidden, modified in order or deleted. Coming soon is also a new type of export, who has the ability to choose specific tags.\n\nWORK-FREE DAYS\nUsing the backend, you can set work-free days - holidays, leave days, days of in lieu and sick days are an integral part of TimeStamps. On these days, you do not have to work, so there will be no default work and break time. However, TimeStamps does not prevent that you still record times. So you can still work on holidays or leave days and keep track of it with TimeStamps.\n\nSTATISTICS\nIn the weekly and daily time stamp view, TimeStamps provides small statistics for a better overview. \"How much overtime I've done this week?\", \"How long have I been on a business trip?\" - The statistics provide the kind of information you want.\n\nREPORTS\nVarious reports can be created of all time stamps. You can specify any time period and send reports as HTML or CSV to one or more e-mail addresses. These report configurations can be reused later.\n\nSETTINGS\nNot everyone is working from nine to five, five days a week. So the work and break time for each day of a default work week is definable to the minute. Also working without a break is possible with a single click. The setting of default times can later be changed individually for each day.\n\n\nTHANKS FOR THE SUPPORT\nIf you like TimeStamps, please tell your colleagues, friends and relatives! And we are always thankful for a a positive rating in the App Store.\n\nQuestions, comments and suggestions are always welcome, too. Please use our support e-mail address: support@timestampsapp.com"

Thanks to everyone who reported this and helped us fix it!!\n\nNEW Version 1.1 allows you to:\n\n- NEW! Import Bulk Data from your computer into LockBox Pro.  Saves lots of typing on your device!\n\n- NEW! Export/Backup data to your computer over a WiFi connection! Remember to do this regularly!\n\n- NO Ads!\n\nUse it to keep information handy and also protected at the same time.\n\nNew Pro Edition Features:\n(not found in the free version)\n\n* Import Data - create a file on your computer and import it into LockBox Pro via Wifi.  Saves you lots of typing on the device.\n\n* Stronger Security - data is secured via Apple's Keychain which utilizes 3DES encryption for high security.\n\n* More Flexible - you can add as many fields as you like to each entry. (the free version is fixed at 2 fields per entry)\n\n* No Ads\n\nIMPORTANT:\nExisting free version users... you can now upgrade easily while keeping your data!  Just export your data first using the free version and then import it into LockBox Pro via the WiFi import feature.\n\nNew Features:\n\n* import/export via WiFi \n* Sound effects can now be turned off! :-)\n* The app exits correctly when you lock your iPhone with the top button.\n* You can now easily rearrange and delete items in your list. (and they stay rearranged)\n* Your data is backed up via the regular iTunes backup, but be sure to use the new export feature as data is sometimes saved incorrectly in iTunes. iTunes also does not allow you to change devices... your data will be lost if you don't back it up using the new WiFi export method.\n\n(all bug fixes are available in the free version as well... however the new advanced features are not)\n\nMore Info:\n\nAll data is encrypted and protected by your secret code, so only you have access to it, even if you let your friends borrow your phone to make a call or browse online.\n\nThis is the kind of information that you want easy access to while you are on the go, but find it hard to recall just when you need it.  For example, I always forget my bank account number right when I need to deposit a check at the bank.\n\nNot sure if you need this?\n\nTry the FREE version first... it's called LockBox (not Pro) :-)\n\nGo Pro for a low price for a limited time!  \n\nIMPORTANT BACKUP INFORMATION: \n\nRemember to sync and do a backup of your data through the LockBox app before updating to newer versions!  You never know what might happen to your phone in the middle of a sync :-)  Also, the iTunes backup is not enough in some cases especially when you have to replace your phone or reset it, so make sure you use the WiFi backup method to protect your data.  Its the only way to make sure your data is safe when doing a sync or restore for your device."

You don’t necessarily work a traditional Monday to Friday 9-5 job. That makes it hard to keep track of when you’re working, especially with early morning and overnight schedules.\n\nShifts solves this problem with a simple solution. Create your own custom shifts using our attractive icons and color picker, then add them to your calendar with just one tap. \n\nYou can add up to 2 shifts per day, or setup a shift rotation and apply it to your Shifts calendar all at once. This makes it easy to enter an entire month – or even year’s worth of shifts in less than a minute! See any of your upcoming shifts right from the lock screen.\n\nAfter you’ve entered your shifts, you can view them in our beautiful month view calendar, or in a handy list format. You can overlay your personal calendar on top, so you’ll know when you have things going on outside of work.\n\nWith just a tap you can share your schedule with friends, family, and co-workers – whether they’re using Shifts or not. \n\nBuilt exclusively for iOS 8 and Apple’s latest iPhones, Shifts is the modern way to keep track of your work schedule.\n\n********************************************************   \n\nCREATE SHIFTS\n\nAdd as many shifts as you’d like, and choose your own icon and headerr for each shift type.\n\nADD TO CALENDAR WITH ONE TAP\n\nSelect one of your shifts, then tap each day on the calendar you’d like to add it to. Up to 2 shifts per day.\n\nSHARE YOUR SCHEDULE\n\nSend friends, family, and co-workers your work schedule whether they’re using Shifts or not.\n\nVIEW UPCOMING SHIFTS RIGHT IN THE WIDGET\n\nSee your schedule without even opening up the app, right from the lock screen, or from inside any other app.\n\nSET UP CUSTOM SHIFT ROTATIONS\n\nSet up shift rotations and Shifts will automatically apply your shifts over any date range you choose – great for repeating schedules (e.g. a 3-week schedule that repeats for 4 months).\n\n********************************************************\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\n\n• View your personal iCloud calendar overlaid on your work schedule\n• Add personalized notes to any of your shifts\n• Enter your hourly rate and we’ll show you an estimate of your monthly earnings\n• Add up to 2 different shifts per day\n• Reminders for shifts\n• Indicate vacation days with the holiday icon, or sick days with the medical icon\n• See your schedule on the Calendar or List view\n• Swipe between months, or pick any month (just tap the date at the top)\n\n********************************************************  \n\nGREAT FOR:\n\n• Nurses\n• Emergency workers\n• Doctors\n• Security guards\n• Cleaners\n• Retail employees\n• Laborers\n• Servers, bar tenders, kitchen staff\n• Grocers\n• Police and Firefighters\n• Military\n• Surgeons\n• News and media reporters\n• Paramedics\n• Students and part time workers\n• Taxi or Uber drivers\n• Shipping and warehouse staff\n• Pest control workers\n• Locksmiths\n• Hydro workers\n• Protective service\n• Food preparations\n• Truckers and tow-truck drivers\n• Construction workers\n• Bus drivers and other transportation workers\n• Anyone else who has trouble keeping track of their schedule!\n\n********************************************************  \n\nWith Shifts, you’ll be able to glance at your calendar and immediately know when you’re working – and when you’re not."

      "label": "Recording and sending voice memos made easy!\n\nVoice memos are a great way to quickly capture some ideas and send them to your own or someone else's mailbox. Unfortunately this usually requires a lot of steps until you are done. Until now. 4Memo provides you with a workflow that uses the least possible steps in order to record a voice memo and send it to whoever you want.\n\nJust enter up to four recipients to which you can send your voice memo as quick as possible. Those recipients will appear as big, easy-to-hit buttons on the app's main screen. After recording your memo, just hit the respective contact button and your voice memo will be attached to a prepopulated, ready-to-send email. Just on more tap on \"Send\" and your message is on its way.\n\nOn iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus you can even start a recording right from your home screen, thanks to 3D Touch.\n\nWe developed 4Memo with your privacy in mind. Therefore, there is no data transmitted to our servers nor is it in any other way processed on your device. The recording and processing of your voice memo is completely and solely done on your iPhone. The email is sent via the mail account which is configured on your device. This means that it is sent solely through the servers of the email provider of your choice, just like any other email that you send through the iPhone's mail app. This makes the final tap on \"Send\" necessary but it also asures you that all your data stays in your hands all the time."

      "label": "## Top productivity app in 136 countries. More than 2 million satisfied paying users. Featured in Apple's \"Amazing Apps\" TV commercial.\n## Staying focused with the cutest gamified timer. \n## Over 800,000 real trees were planted on Earth by our users.  \n\n\"Forest works well, and if your goal is to be more in the moment, ignore your phone and actually talk to your friends when you are with them, this is the app for you.\"— The New York Times \n\n\"In order to establish new, better habits, it's helpful to engage with tools that make it easier to reinforce them. For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

You can also see the current weather and an overview of the current month at a glance.\n\nIntuitive Controls \nIntuitively navigate through your calendars and quickly, easily add events and tasks thanks to predefined settings and simple controls. Standard settings like repeating events and reminders/alarms are just a tap away. And powerful special settings are also available, without sacrificing comfort or control. Swipe through views and open events or days with just a tap.\n\nmiCal Understands You\nQuickly create events with the new natural language input feature. Natural language input allows you to create events just by describing them. And if you have Siri enabled on your device, you can even dictate your event details instead of typing.\n\nThe Total Package\nmiCal provides complete, well-organized day, week and month views and displays the calendar week in all the important views.\n\nRelax\nYou don’t need to contort yourself with miCal. miCal supports portrait as well as landscape formats in nearly every view.  Use each view however it’s most comfortable for you.\n\nTasks/Reminders\nmiCal now supports iOS reminders. Create reminders for all the important tasks in your private and professional life right in the app.\n\nBirthday Manager\nNever again miss an important birthday. Get reminders at preset times featuring the music of your choice.\n\nNice Weather\nFive-day weather forecasts plus the sunrise/sunset times, humidity and wind speed for the current day. The dashboard even features a quick summary of the current weather as well as a brief forecast of the coming days.\n\nComprehensive\nmiCal offers a unique range of features. Copy, move or send your events. Export your events in the date range of your choice as CSV (for Excel, etc.) or ICS (the calendar format). Set colors for your calendars and individual appointments or automatically add colors based on keywords in event titles.\n\nUp to Date and Secure\nmiCal communicates with your device’s integrated calendar. miCal works with  all the calendar services that your device currently supports (iCloud, Google Calendar, Outlook, Exchange, Facebook Events, subscriptions) without requiring additional configuration. That way, you can store your data locally or via the services you know and trust—it’s up to you. miCal itself does not transmit any data to external services or other servers. That allows us to ensure 100% data security.\n\nAward-Winning\n- 3rd place in the \"Best German iPhone App\" competition at the 2010 iPhone Developer conference.\n- Featured as App of the Week in 13 countries.\n- Recommendation from iPhoneWelt and a 5-star rating from iPhone&Co, two of the leading iPhone magazines\n- Honored at the 2010 App Developer Conference"

Keep an eye on all the important parameters of your car with a personalized dashboard.\n\nEXHAUST FLAP REMOTE CONTROL*\nTake control over the exhaust flap in your car and decide yourself, whether it should be closed or open.\n\nACTIVE SOUND DESIGN**\nIf you do not like the artificial engine sound generated in your car, just mute the Active Sound Design with BimmerLink.\n\nSOUND TUNING***\nThe “Sound Tuning” option allows you to disable the “exhaust burble“ in cars equipped with the S55 engine (M2 Competition, M3, M4).\n\nDPF REGENERATION****\nBimmerLink allows you to check the current state of the diesel particulate filter in your car. Find out when the last regeneration took place or how much ash has accumulated in the filter and start a regeneration with the touch of a button.\n\nBATTERY REGISTRATION\nIf you want to replace the battery in your car, this has to be registered in the engine control unit and BimmerLink allows you to do this yourself now.\n\nPARKING BRAKE SERVICE MODE\nBimmerLink allows you to activate the service mode for the electromechanical parking brake.\n\nSERVICE RESET\nReset the service display in your car after carrying out maintenance work like a brake pad replacement or an engine oil change.\n\nREQUIRED ACCESSORIES\nTo use the app one of the supported Bluetooth or WiFi OBD adapters or cables is required.

      "label": "iMobileSitter protects passwords, PINs and TAN lists using an innovative technique that offers higher security than conventional password managers. At the same time, iMobileSitter is as easy to use as conventional products. Hackers get nuts due to iMobileSitter's resistance against typical attacks (e.g., dictionary and brute-force attacks). Such attacks use trial and error to find the correct master password. Technologies like cloud computing allow to tremendously speed-up these attacks. Hackers do not even have expert knowledge to run the attacks. Many of these supposed secure password managers are actually easy prey for hackers, even if they use strong encryption algorithms such as AES, since important security assumptions for using these algorithms have been neglected by conventional products. iMobileSitter is different. Here, strong cryptographic algorithms are applied in such way that hackers do not get any usable feedback. Thus, when using iMobileSitter the stored passwords are secure. \n\nBesides a higher security level, iMobileSitter provides additional features such as secure random password generation and a backup and restore function to provide additional reliability of the stored secrets in case of defect, loss, or theft. iMobileSitter combines higher security with convenience functions and easy to use interface.\n\niMobileSitter was developed by the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology SIT in Germany. \n\n\nSECURITY\n\niMobileSitter provides resistance against dictionary and brute force attacks. Nowadays, hackers usually test huge amounts of possible master passwords in order to get to the stored secrets. When using conventional password managers to encrypt data, a hacker can detect if the attempted attack was successful even without the necessity of testing the decryption result as a password at the respective service. \n\niMobileSitter is different. Here, an attacker cannot decide if the attempt was successful when looking at the decryption results. iMobileSitter accepts all master passwords. It decrypts the stored information on the basis of the given master password, irrespective of whether or not it is correct. However, the software misguides attackers by displaying wrong passwords.\n\nEvery decryption result looks as if it could be correct. For example, if a hacker decrypts a PIN assigned to a debit card using a master password, the decryption result that is returned will always be a four-digit number combination. From an attacker’s point of view - no matter whether hacker or hacking software - it is indistinguishable if the correct master password is found or not. For hacker or hacking software every decryption attempt seems to be successful.\n\nTo determine whether a decryption result is correct, the hacker has no choice but try to login with result at the respective service. There, however, additional security mechanisms of the service take effect after a defined amount of failed logins, e.g., three in the case of a debit card. \n\nFurther information can be found on http://www.imobilesitter.com\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Use of established cryptographic standards: AES, PBKDF2, ISO/IEC9797-1\n- Group your secrets into folders\n- Alphabetic and user defined sorting\n- Search function\n- Easy data backup (Email, iTunes)\n- Encrypted backups\n- Auto Log-Off\n- Easy master password change\n- Easy device replacement\n\nIf you like iMobileSitter, we would be happy if you write a review. Your feedback is always welcome. Please contact us to report any questions, comments or suggestions. Within the iMobileSitter app use \"Options\" > \"Send email\" for contact."

Sharp Mind induces optimized mental states ideal for school, exam preparation, confidence, problem solving, memory, creativity, confidence and learning. Combine Binaural Tones with iTunes Music, Audiobooks, Spotify * Built-in iTunes Playlist Creator * 17 Soothing Ambient Backgrounds and 10 Gentle Alarm Sounds. * Universal App * iPhone and iPad UIs HD&SD * Headphones/Earbuds must be worn for Binaural Tones to be Effective. \n\nTo combine Brainwaves and Ambience with Audio from Another App use Background Source option #5 on the Background Settings, 'Ambience + Other App'.  \n\nTo use just Brainwaves and Audio from Another App use the \"No Background\" option for the Background Source.\n\nWarning: These are powerful brainwave entrainment programs and should never be used while driving or operating machinery.\n\nBrainWave Sharp Mind is unlike any other brainwave entrainment application.  Other brainwave and binaural beat applications use only a single brainwave frequency and carrier signal.  The Sharp Mind Progressive Brainwave Entrainment algorithms use a series of brainwave programs, multiple frequencies and carrier waves to gently bring your brainwave frequencies to your desired state using a more natural and effective frequency progression.\n\n*** Advanced Features ***\n\n - Multiple Brainwave programs each specially designed to elevate you to a unique mental state.\n\n - Multiple ambient background sounds to choose from.\n\n - Adjustable Brainwave Intensity - The intensity of the brainwaves can be adjusted independently of the ambient background sound.  This allows you to set the brainwave volume to your comfort level.  The application will also save your preference for future use.\n\n - Adjustable ambient background volume.\n\n - Visual timer countdown indicator.\n\n - Automatic saving of preferred brainwave entrainment program and ambient background sounds.\n\n - Ability to create your own custom time option.\n\n\n*** Programs Included ***\n\n - Brain Energizer: Takes you through a series of brainwave programs and progressively elevates your level of alertness.\n\n - High Beta Concentration: Designed to put your mind into the ultimate state of focus and concentration.  Ideal when you need to block out surrounding distractions and study.\n\n - Creative Brainstorming:  A series of brainwave programs that elevates your mind to a state of open-mindedness and creativity.  Perfect for when you're stuck on a problem or are having difficulty coming up with an idea.  Sit back and plug into this program to completely open your mind.\n\n - Creative Problem Solving:  The ultimate combination of focus and creativity achieved through a series of brainwave programs and frequency mixes.\n\n - Gamma Memory Boost:  This program was designed to be used whenever you feel like taking a break and letting what you've just learned sink in.  This will help you maximize memory recall.\n\n - Beta Confidence Boost:  Designed to be taken before a test or presentation.  The other programs help you prepare, solve problems, come up with ideas and remember what you've learned.  \n\nSharp Mind also includes:\n\n- Creative Thinking\n- Lateral Thinking\n- Convergent Thinking\n- Deductive Thinking\n- Centered Mind\n- Focus/Concentration\n- Gamma Creativity Boost\n- Evening Memory Boost\n- Full Beta Spectrum\n- Full Gamma Spectrum\n\n* How Binaural Brainwave Entrainment Works *\n\nThis app uses advanced Binaural Brainwave Entrainment to stimulate brainwave frequencies associated with different states of mind.  These brainwave frequencies are in most cases inaudible and therefore must be induced through the use of binaural tones.  In this process two different tones are played, one for one ear, and one for the other (headphones or earbuds must be used).  When processing these two different tones the human brain perceives the difference as a beat matching the target brainwave frequency."

Anschließend erfolgt der Spieler-Sperrabgleich.Noch schneller und sicherer ist jedoch die zweite Möglichkeit, die diese App bietet: Die Spielgastdaten werden über den MRZ-Code des Spieler-Ausweises gescannt. Die App prüft den Jugendschutz- und Sperrabgleich und stellt das Ergebnis anschaulich anhand einer Ampel dar. Im Idealfall wird dann direkt die PIN-Code Generierung für eines der gekoppelten Geld-SPIEL-Geräte angestoßen, und der PIN-Code an den Spielgast übergeben. Nach erfolgreicher Prüfung des Spielgastes können natürlich auch andere Freischaltlösungen der adp, wie beispielsweise die gerätegebundene Karte in Verbindung mit dem Kartentresor oder auch die Anzeige am PIN-Display mittels Funkfernbedienung, genutzt werden."

Access to the FRITZ!Box is also possible outside your local WiFi network if the option \"Grant access to storage to users from the Internet\" is enabled and you configured the MyFRITZ! service or a dynamic DNS domain name in your Fritz!Box. \n\nPrerequisites for using the app: \n- You need an AVM Fritz!Box\n- Voice box and fax messages: Answering or fax machine must be configured in your Fritz!Box.\n\nCurrently the AVM Fritz!Box models 7590, 7490 and 6490 with the latest firmware are supported. In principle it should also be possible to use other Fritz!Box models with this app, but those were not yet tested. If you have feedback about using the app with other models please let us know by sending an email to support@checkmybox.de. In case the file format or the way messages are stored by the Fritz!Box answering or fax machine should be changed in future firmware versions, we'll make all effort to adopt this app accordingly. Nevertheless it cannot be guaranteed that this is technically possible in all cases. \n\nThe app comes with a detailed setup wizard which easily guides you through step-by-step instructions on how to configure your Fritz!Box and the required settings within the app. If you have questions, suggestions for improvements or need help in setting up this app, please don't hesitate to send an email to support@checkmybox.de. We're happy to assist you and your feedback is highly appreciated.\n\nAVM, FRITZ! and FRITZ!Box are registered trademarks of AVM GmbH, Berlin (Germany).

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nGet Started\n• Interactive tutorial project\n• Keep each manuscript and supporting materials in a self-contained project\n• Import Word, RTF, Final Draft and plain text files\n• Easily split imported text into separate sections\n\nGet Writing\n• Write your manuscript in sections of any size\n• View all sections as a single text using the “Draft Navigator” (iPad only)\n• Quickly navigate sections using the “binder” sidebar\n• Format with fonts and presets\n• Comments, footnotes, links and highlights\n• Simple bullets and lists\n• Insert images\n• Pinch-zoom to resize text\n• Full-screen mode (iPad only)\n• Typewriter scrolling mode keeps typed text center-screen (iPad only)\n• Write a screenplay using scriptwriting mode\n• Live word and character counts\n• Set word and character count targets\n• Find and replace\n• Customizable keyboard row provides quick-access buttons for formatting, navigation and punctuation\n• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for external keyboard users\n• Dark mode\n\nFind Your Structure\n• Write in any order and reorganize later\n• Write a synopsis for any text section and see it in the outline\n• Expand, collapse and drill down into sections of your project\n• Rearrange sections as index cards on the corkboard (iPad only)\n• Project-wide search\n• Track ideas using labels and status\n• Apply custom icons to your sections\n\nRefer to Research\n• Import research material such as image, PDF and media files\n• View research files or other sections right alongside your writing (iPad only)\n• Every section has its own notes area for jotting down ideas\n• Supports multi-tasking split screen mode (supported devices only)\n\nShare Your Work\n• Compile to a single document for sharing or printing\n• Use different formatting in your exported or printed document\n• Export to Word, RTF, Final Draft, PDF or plain text\n• Convert rich text to Markdown for sharing with Markdown apps\n• Create and email zipped backups of your projects\n\nWork Anywhere\n• Use Dropbox to sync between devices and with the macOS and Windows versions of Scrivener*\n• Copy projects between devices via iTunes\n\n* Requires a Dropbox account (not compatible with iCloud).\n\nSUPPORT\nYou can contact us at ios.support@literatureandlatte.com, visit our forums at http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum, or find us @scrivenerapp on Twitter."

      "label": "CalenGoo gives you a fast and easy way to access and modify your Google Calendar with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. It can also be used when you have no Internet connection, using the cached data. Changes are saved and uploaded the next time you are connected.\n\nThe calendar view is similar to the web view of Google Calendar. Events are displayed using the same calendar colors that you use in your Google Calendar, even Google's event colors are supported (please see http://www.calengoo.com/cc ). It also recognizes which calendars are visible and which are hidden. So the view should match the view of your Google Calendar as much as possible. \n\nCalenGoo also has a month view similar to that of Google Calendar. It can be zoomed and panned to quickly get an overview over the events of a month. Zooming the month is done by using the two-finger-zoom gesture that you know from Safari and the photo application. A double tap opens the tapped day.\n\nIt also supports the same kinds of recurrence rules as Google Calendar and displays recurring events correctly even when you are offline or scroll far into the future.\n\nYou can also use Google Calendar's feature to invite people to events and see their status (accepted, declined, maybe, no answer). They will get an invitation email with links to e.g. accept or decline the invitation.\n\nGoogle Calendar has an integrated task list, called Google Tasks. Tasks with a due date are displayed on the corresponding days of the calendar. CalenGoo can do the same, it can sync this list, display your tasks in the calendar views and in a list view and it even makes your tasks available offline. You can edit and add tasks and the changes will be synced with Google Tasks.\n\nYou either need a (free) Google Calendar account to use this app or you can use it with your iOS calendars. However using it with Google Calendar has a few advantages.\n\nTo get more information, screenshots and a tutorial, please go to http://www.calengoo.com\n\nIf you have any problems or suggestions, please send an email to calengoo@dgunia.de or take a look at CalenGoo's support website to get help.\n\nIf you think the font is too small and hard to read, you can increase the font size of all calendar views in the settings under \"Settings\", \"Display and Use\".\n\nFeatures ( http://www.calengoo.com ):\n\n- Drag&drop to quickly copy and move events\n- Templates to quickly create similar events again. They can even be combined, e.g. one template for the location of an event and another for the attendees\n- Print/PDF function to print the day, week, month or agenda view via AirPrint or to email it as a PDF file\n- Supports the same recurrence rules as Google Calendar\n- Supports Google Calendar's event colors when syncing via OAuth2\n- Icons can be assigned to Google Calendar events\n- Date/time can be entered using the iOS wheels or by using a keypad\n- Fast search function\n- Show/edit iOS calendars in addition to Google calendars (or instead of Google calendars)\n- Sync with Google Tasks and iOS Reminders\n- Reminders can be snoozed and they can be (optionally) repeated every minute\n- Birthdays and anniversaries of your contacts can be displayed\n- Zoomable month view, which can be configured to scroll horizontally (month by month) or vertically (week by week)\n- Events can be linked to contacts\n- Floating events and completable events\n- Photos and PDF files can be created and attached to events (via Google Drive)\n- Calendar selection bar to quickly show and hide single calendars\n- The location of an event can be opened with Apple Maps, Google Maps, Navigon, TomTom, Skobbler, Sygic, iGo or Waze\n- View/edit calendars that are shared with others via Google Calendar\n- Many configuration options to change the way the app looks and works"

It helps you organizing both your business and personal tasks altogether, reducing stress while increasing productivity at the same time.\n\nOther apps focus on collecting many lists and tasks, Eisenhower helps you to actually complete the ones that really matter—through providing a framework to filter incoming tasks and maximize the happy feeling of completion when finishing or delegating them.\n\n—————\nJoin many others and become more productive today!\n—————\n\nWhat our users are saying about Eisenhower:\n\n▶ \"Perfect for those with busy lifestyles or who just want to get things done.\"\n\n▶ \"Get this, now, not later. This is how Eisenhower ran a country, might be good for your productivity too.\"\n\n▶ \"Helps me to be productive - quick, easy, efficient.\"\n\n▶ \"This could be the next big thing in productivity apps.\"\n\n▶ \"I absolutely love this application and I find it to actually be hugely useful - having played with it the whole day today and populated it out with tasks I want to achieve to test the theory, I indeed finished each of the \"Do First\" tasks in order, and achieved Zero-Inbox. This is the most productive day I've had in months!\"\n\n—————\nFEATURES\n—————\n\n▶ Task Counter\nOn each to-do sheet, best manage no more than 8 tasks. Still, we have made room for unlimited tasks and notes whenever you might need it—and each sheet counts how many there are to tackle right now.\n\n▶ Focus Mode\nFor urgent and important tasks, you can use a special timer, helping you to focus on only one task for 30 minutes—or whatever duration you like best.\n\n▶ Schedule & Delegate\nUsing other task-related actions, you can directly place reminders in your calendar or send e-mails including the tasks to co-workers.\n\n▶ Cloud Sync\nOnce you have created your account, Eisenhower automatically syncs with the free web client on app.eisenhower.me—and vice versa, in real-time!\n\n—————\nMORE\n—————\n\nIf you are new to the Eisenhower matrix or just want to refresh your memory, check out our quick video tutorial here: bit.ly/eisenhower-matrix\n\nGet in Touch\nGot feedback for us?

      "label": "Notebooks is a writing app, a text and markdown editor, your personal Wiki and Zettelkasten, a file organizer, task manager, PDF and eBook creator and more. This may sound like a lot, but consider you have a few text fragments, randomly created, which you want to combine into a chapter of a book and saved as PDF or eBook; or a quick note sparks off an idea, generates a couple of tasks, each of which requires you to organize further research material; or you have business related documents which need to be separated from private diaries, records and files. – With Notebooks you handle these jobs easily without switching apps, and while remaining focussed and creative.\n\n• Notebooks stores all your documents as regular files in standard formats. You are always in control of your documents, never need to worry about how to export them, and they remain compatible across devices and over time.\n\n• Create formatted documents with styles, attachments, tables or checklists, and add a table of contents if you like. Choose between a variation of ready made document styles, or create your own, if you want.\n\n• Write your documents in plain text and allow Notebooks to automatically handle lists, highlight and center the current line on screen, automatically insert closing characters for  (, {, [, \" and more. - Plain text is a universal format which can be used on any device without any specific software.\n\n• Use Markdown to create formatted documents from plain text. Notebooks supports *MultiMarkdown* and its own flavor of *Discount*.  – Click any word in a formatted Markdown text and start writing at that position. You can even create checklists (- [ ]) and tick them off in formatted view. Syntax highlighting and a set of dedicated extra keyboard keys make Markdown editing easy.\n  \n• Use your Apple Pencil to sketch ideas or annotate images and PDF documents.\n\n• Use Notebooks' advanced editing capabilities to work on documents which are stored in other apps.\n\n• Compile selected documents or the contents of whole books into a single document, an eBook or a PDF document.\n\n• Link between documents in Notebooks. In Markdown you can even use Wiki style links ([[ ]]). When clicking a link to a document which does not yet exist, Notebooks suggests to create it. And when you move or rename documents, Notebooks makes sure the links remain intact.\n\n• Create as many books as you need to structure your projects and details. Nest books as deep as you like, there is no limit in Notebooks. If you ever loose track, Notebooks' full text search helps you quickly turn up even the most hidden document.\n\n• Turn books into task lists to display document as tasks which can be ticked off. Assign due dates and alerts, and divide projects into nested sub projects, which makes them easier to handle. \n\n• For simple lists you can use checklists in formatted documents and Markdown.\n\n• Assign Context tags to books and documents to create shortcuts that are accessible for a smart book at Notebooks' top level. – Notebooks can even extract context tags from the contents of documents as you create them.\n\n• Import all documents and files you want to keep close at hand, no matter whether PDF, email, web pages, MS Office or iWorks, photos, videos, music and more.\n\n• Scan documents and extract text using OCR (iOS 13)\n\n• Sync files between iPads, iPhones, Mac or PC. \n\nWith all that, Notebooks may quickly become your one and only app for everything you want to keep close at hand.\n\nUser Comments: \n\n“Notebooks is a wonderful App, which is so much better than the dozen other note apps I tried. It is sophisticated, in an unassuming way, so that you find yourself greatly rewarded and being productive without sacrificing time/effort to the App. I cannot tell you how much productivity I have gained.  I am having a huge amount of fun, I use it constantly, more than the phone on my iPhone in fact.\" \n\n“You are GTD in every way that makes it efficient and makes me efficient.”"

      "label": "\"Oblique Strategies\" is a concept developed by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt to help artists overcome creative blocks through lateral thinking. It consists of a deck of cards, each one containing a vague or ambiguous phrase that can be used to solve a problem intuitively, by breaking conventional thinking patterns and interpreting it from a new perspective.\n\nThis app aims to translate the essence of the original cards deck into a digital experience, making it accessible to a wider audience. It contains the original edition, as well as the newer decks, presenting them in a sleek minimalist style inspired by the original design of the cards. The user interface is simple and straightforward, built to encourage creative or design thinking without distracting from the process. The home screen widget on iOS 14 allows reading a new quote every day without opening the application. The Apple Watch version can run independently without needing the app installed on your iPhone.\n\nWith VoiceOver, anyone with a visual impairment can have the Oblique Strategies phrase read to them. Long tap the screen to have the last sentence read to you again. Also, you can shake the iPhone for a new sentence."

A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used to find the frequency components of the vibrations.\n\n*** Features:\n- Create a project with car data\n- After a measurement you must specify the speed\n- The Result is displayed in a chart\n- The chart can be zoomed in and out\n- The chart displays a reference line when tapped to better identify the frequency\n- The chart displays potential sources of vibrations (wheels or cardan shaft)\n- Data can be exported:\n\t- A single measurement including the chart can be exported as pdf\n\t- The original data of a project can be exported and imported\n\t- With iTunes File Sharing or the Files app: all files can be accessed [date].fft\n- A simple analysis for vehicles is integrated\n- The analysis can be adapted to your needs with basis technical understanding. Use iTunes File Sharing to download a configuration file (It is named analysis-gui.json and should be self-explanatory).\n\nThe accuracy depends on the accuracy of the build-in hardware. For a verifiable measurement result, please use a professional measuring device.\n\nThe evaluation of the results must be done by a human. Vibrations are normla (i.e. for a car) and still exists if the car is working correctly."

      "label": "Dwight - Priority Task Matrix is a task management solution based on the Eisenhower principle, helping you filter tasks by urgency and importance and concentrate on what matters to you.\n\nThis method requires group tasks and activities into four priorities based on urgency and importance and plan them ahead of time, before the next productive day.\n\nPriority matrix:\n- Important and urgent.\n- Important but not urgent.\n- Not important but urgent.\n- Not important and not urgent.\n\nIt is essential to understand the difference between important and urgent tasks. Urgent tasks demand an immediate and fast reaction and are usually associated with dealing with someone else's deadlines. Important tasks are achieving our long-term goals are often not urgent. To put us in the position to grow our business and careers, we should spend most of our time working on important and not urgent tasks and delegate all that is urgent but not important. To focus on growing yourself, delegate more if you can.\n\n\"What is important is seldom urgent, and what is urgent is seldom important.\" Dwight \"Ike\" Eisenhower, 34th President of the United States.\n\nKey Features:\n- Create a task and put each into one of the Priority Matrix categories\n- Create a list, add an icon, and improve your productivity\n- Sort created lists using the native drag and drop behaviour\n- Add a due date for each task\n- Use \"Due Date\" categories to check your schedule for today or tomorrow\n- Set a reminder and receive push notifications\n- Use the \"Dwight View\" and swipe fast between different categories\n- Switch between dark and light mode or use the system settings.\n- Change the priority matrix view\n- Use iCloud sync and manage your tasks on other devices\n- Plan a time to work on tasks with the \"Add to calendar\" feature\n- Upload images\n- Create tasks with Siri Shortcuts\n- Change priority with 3D Touch\n- Due date calendar\n- Atlassian cloud integration\n- 2-way communication for Confluence action points\n- Jira issues with advanced attachment management\n- Special lists, daily routine and shopping list"

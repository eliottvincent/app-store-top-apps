      "label": "Noir is a Safari extension that automatically adds a dark mode to every website you visit.\n\nIt makes browsing the web at night so much better. With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.\n\nAnd the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it is – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop. And with over 20 built-in themes and the ability to create your own, you can customize the results exactly the way you want.\n\nNoir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!\n\nBuilt from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Focus Filters and Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows. And your settings are automatically synced to all your devices using iCloud.\n\nAnd just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data. Period.\n\nNoir is made by a solo iOS developer. It does not include any subscriptions or ads. Buy Noir once, use it forever.\n\nNotes:\n• Found a website where Noir’s dark mode doesn’t look just right? Let me know by reporting it. The app will be frequently updated to address issues that are reported.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\n• The Noir extension requires access to the websites you visit to analyze the existing style of the page and to override it with Noir's dark style.\n• Noir never collects your browsing data. The only data Noir ‘collects’ are your settings, and those will never leave your device.\n• You can read Noir’s full Privacy Policy at https://getnoir.app/privacypolicy"

      "label": "Convenience on the wrist - Watch app for Tesla is the ideal companion in day to day life with your Tesla vehicle. These are just a few of the day to day conveniences this app will help achieve:\n\n - Forgot to plug in? Get a notification if vehicle is in a pre-configured location and not plugged in - all done directly on the watch, no external servers required, keeping your privacy!\n\n - Add the graphic corner complication to your watch face and enjoy the convenience of having easy access to state of charge, charging indicator, time remaining if charging, sentry mode active indicator and indicator if any windows, doors or trunks are open. All from one complication, that also will launch the app when tapped. \n\n - During and after charge, a panel will show how much energy was added. Convenient if you schedule your charge during the night - wake up each morning and easily check how much energy was added to the battery. \n\n - If you have multiple vehicles on your account, tap the vehicle name to quickly and easily switch between them. \n\n - You can queue up commands by tapping on buttons, then put your wrist down and the commands will execute in the background when the vehicle is successfully woken up. \n\n - When you tap the unlock vehicle button, the charge port will also unlock if a charging cable is attached. That's convenience right there!\n\n - Want to reduce phantom drain? Background updates can be configured to longer intervals between updates or to only update if car is already awake or can be disabled entirely for absolutely zero impact on phantom drain.\n\n - A warning panel will show up if any doors, windows or trunks are left open. Conveniently, you can tap the panel to close any open windows.\n\n - Need to access the frunk? Just do it from your wrist - no fiddling with your phone. \n\n - Sitting comfy in the couch, but just remembered you have a road-trip in the morning? Set the charge limit to 100% - or any value really - and start charging, right from the convenience of your wrist!\n\n - Leaving the office after a long hot day? Activate the HVAC when you're on your way, and enjoy a nice cool vehicle.\n\n - When charging, tap the time remaining label to switch to show time of expected completion - no more head calculus!\n\n - Need to run a quick errand, but you don't have your phone? Unlock your vehicle from your wrist, then activate remote start and off you go. Just please be mindful that this feature requires internet connectivity on both watch and vehicle - so don't drive into the desert and leave your vehicle, or you'll get stuck there!\n\nA note about security and privacy:\nThis app accepts two types of login. Either Tesla account credentials or a Tesla API token. Your account credentials are by default not stored in the app, but are used only once to obtain an authentication token and refresh token directly from the Tesla API server. If you would rather supply that token yourself, you can do so instead. It is preferable to supply a refresh token, as the app will then have a perpetual login. Your token will be persisted in the app. Tokens will be revoked if you change your Tesla account password. With the optional remote start feature you can choose to store your password in the app - it will be securely stored in the iOS / watchOS / iPadOS keychain. This feature is optional and is not required for all other features to function. No network traffic will ever be emitted from this app that goes anywhere other than directly to the Tesla API servers. The source code for this application will at all times be made available to any security researcher for a voluntary security and safety audit. \n\nDisclaimer: \nThis app is not endorsed by Tesla Inc. Use at your own risk. No guarantee of proper function is given. Only you are responsible for any changes to your car caused by using this app.  \n\nMade in Denmark"

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store.

      "label": "GEOFENCY enables fully automatic location-based time recording on iPhone, iPad, Mac & Apple Watch, where manual check-in and check-out becomes an absurdity of the past. Arrival and departure times are automatically recorded as soon as you enter or leave an interesting place – it works like magic! Of course all very energy efficient, thanks to the latest Geofencing & iBeacon technologies! With the integrated webhook feature you can even trigger your home automation system as you arrive or leave (e.g. switch on the lights when coming home)!\n\nIdeal for automatic monitoring of working hours, client visits, lunch breaks or the stays on your favorite places! GEOFENCY offers the easiest and most effective way to MONITOR your DURATION OF STAYS on interesting places. Unpleasant manual time recording was yesterday!\n\n• Are you tired of having to write down working hours again and again?\n• Fed up leaving the office absently, missed to check the clock?\n• Can't you remember when you came or left your favorite places?\n\nLet the iPhone take over this nerve-racking time monitoring for you!\n\nWith GEOFENCY this is now possible in a smart and clever new way! Simply mark your points of interest on a map and leave the rest to Geofency!\n\nGEOFENCY automatically tracks the times when you enter or leave your points of interest. Simply carry your iPhone in your pocket or bag with you. You will automatically receive extensive statistics and graphics over time!\n\nAutomatic Location-based Time Tracking – The (GEO)FANCY way!\n\nFEATURES\n• Automatic location-based time tracking - 24/7 time recording for your points of interest!\n• Graphical visualization of your dwell times (by simply rotating your device to landscape) - with zoom!\n• Rich statistics: Single-, Day-, Week- & Month-Summaries.\n• Map-View: Manage your points of interest directly on a beautiful fullscreen map view.\n• Add new locations in seconds – With just one tap!\n• Runs completely in the background while trying to maintain good battery life!\n• Automatic recognition when you enter or leave a place or region.\n• Tags: To group places into tags.\n• Webhook feature: Lets you control your home automation system to e.g. switch on lights as you arrive!\n• Journaling feature: Automatic recognition of frequent visited places – to know exactly when you've been where and how long!\n• Calendar-Export: Export events automatically into your calendar (iCloud, CalDAV & Exchange) – view your data comfortable even from Mac or PC!\n• Today Widget: See the most interesting details right from the Notification Center with one swipe and be more productive!\n• Apple Watch App!\n• Export feature: Send time recordings via e.g. email in an Excel-friendly format!\n• Export time data and use it directly in Excel, Numbers or Harvest!\n\nBENEFITS\nSimple to use daily timesaver!

We will never collect or share any information about you. We respect and care about the privacy of our users!\n\nREQUIREMENTS\nFor the best and most accurate monitoring results, Wi-Fi, carrier and location services should always be enabled for Geofency. iBeacon monitoring requires at least Bluetooth 4.\n\nBATTERY USE\nContinued use of GPS in the background can significantly reduce battery life. Geofency was designed to use GPS very sparingly and never in the background. The app relies mostly on cell tower + Wi-Fi locations. This has been carefully chosen to get the best battery life.\n\nWHAT PEOPLE SAY\n• \"I had no idea that my iPhone could do such things!\"\n• \"Beautiful, polished and elegant designed. Extremely simple to use.\"\n• \"Perhaps the most overall effective app available.\"\n\nFind out more on our landing page: www.geofency.com\nSample-Scripts for easy webhook integration: www.geofency.com/geo.zip"

Your house will for example turn green when watching movies in the forest and turn blue for underwater scenes.\n\nBecause Hue Camera uses the built-in camera, it's not limited to a specific device and can be used for content on televisions, Apple TV, gaming consoles, BluRay/DVD players and even things off-screen like photos and paintings.

Whether for photography, real estate, your new flat or house, gardening, photovoltaics or all outdoor activities: sunlight, sun position and shadows play a major role. See sun’s elevation, its direction, exact sun movement over day and year, objects’ shadows, shadow lengths, shadow differences between seasons, and more.\n\nRECOMMENDED BY PROFESSIONALS:\n\n„This app is awesome! It has helped me to align the PV modules (solar panels) optimally.“ – Jürgen\n\n„For me as a photographer Sunnytrack is an extremely practical tool. Always knowing the sun’s position in real time brings enormous relief. Planning photo shootings becomes significantly easier.“ – Aki from Akigrafie Live\n\n„I am absolutely thrilled. I work in the real estate industry and can now use AR to check with my clients when the sun is shining on the balcony. Amazed customers guaranteed.“ – Toni K.\n\n„It's very useful and professional. It helps me coordinate my trips.“ – Dino\n\nPHILOSOPHY: No ads. No user tracking. Sunnytrack tracks the sun, but only the sun, not the user! For sure. This app is a professional product. It can be bought for a one-time price to get all the high quality features it offers at once, without distracting ads or the need for further in app purchases.\n\n• CREATORS (in photography/filming) all over the world love Sunnytrack not only for its easy usage but also for the extensive functionality it offers. With it you're guaranteed to not miss a perfect scene and optimal light – during the day, Golden Hour or Blue Hour, for instance. Precise, location-dependent planning of the sun’s position and natural lighting of your subjects are extremely relevant in photography – whether capturing landscapes, objects or humans.\n\n• You would like to know the effective AMOUNT OF SUNLIGHT a flat or house/property offers? During Winter, when days are shorter? Get a general picture in advance on Maps or impress at site visits and property tours with showing the sun’s path at the kitchen window for the whole year, live in 3D in your camera image using Augmented Reality (AR)! It’s an insiders’ tip for real estate agents, house builders or interested individuals in general.\n\n• PHOTOVOLTAICS: Sunnytrack provides professional support in placing, adjusting and optimizing your solar modules. Where does sun rise, where does it set? See the differences between the seasons at your location.\n\n• We love green! We love GARDENS. Plan your garden with Sunnytrack. Simulate the exact shadows of multiple objects in Shadow Simulation mode, by adding them on the map defining their heights. For example, you can see the length and impact of shadows casted by objects like houses or a trees when the sun follows its path.\n\n• SAVE all planned scenes, sun paths, shadow simulations and your places for later use.\n\n• As you can see in the screenshots, DAY VIEW provides precise, location-dependent information on the sun like day length, solar noon, sunrise, sunset and twilight times (like Blue Hour, Golden Hour, Astronomical Twilight, …)\n\n• For all OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES Sunnytrack wants to be your faithful companion as a sun tracker and planner. Whether in cities, in the mountains or when touring through valleys, meadows and fields, the app develops its full potential: on Maps, live in AR or even in advance when planning.\n\n\nNOTE:\n\nIdeas and feedback are very welcome. Please use the provided feedback function in the app.\n\nAR 3D functionality: Sunnytrack shows the sun’s position and path based on the orientation of your device with high precision. For identifying its orientation, your devices’ internal sensors are used. In order to achieve exact results, a calibration can be required by moving your device in a figure-eight-pattern and keeping it away of metallic objects."

      "label": "StopTheMadness is a Safari extension that stops web sites from making your browser harder to use. And it protects your privacy on the web. StopTheMadness is not an ad blocker: it offers unique features not available from ad blockers or any other apps. StopTheMadness is one of a kind!\n\nMade by indie developer Jeff Johnson. The support link has documentation and my email address.\n\nMany web sites deliberately disable user interface features in Safari that you normally expect to work. StopTheMadness re-enables those features for you in Safari:\n• opening contextual menus\n• selecting, copying, cutting, and pasting of text\n• drag and drop\n• AutoFill/autocomplete of passwords, emails, etc.\n• 2-finger click to open a link in a new tab\n\nStopTheMadness also protects your privacy on the web:\n• Stops Google AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages)! Automatically loads the original \"canonical\" web site page instead of Google AMP.\n• Removes tracking tags such as utm_source, gclid, and fbclid from the end of URLs.\n• Stops clickjacking in Google Search, Gmail, Facebook, and DuckDuckGo.\n• Stops hyperlink auditing (anchor \"ping\").\n• Stops tracking beacons (Navigator.sendBeacon).\n• Stops sites from using the Page Visibility API to know when a tab is visible on your screen.\n• Stops URL shorteners. Checks the links you click in Safari for well-known link shorteners — bit.ly, tinyurl.com, l.facebook.com, t.co, etc. — and loads the unshortened destination URL instead of the shortened URL. This occurs without setting any cookies or other site data, so you can't be tracked by your click.\n\nBonus Features:\n• Stop videos from autoplaying. This works even on sites where Safari doesn't stop autoplay, such as YouTube. And YouTube video ads are automatically skipped! Also stops videos from following you down the page when you scroll on many sites.\n• Stop sites in Safari from pausing your audio in a background app such as Apple Music.\n• Show native video controls. Use Picture-in-Picture from Safari on sites that don't normally support it, including YouTube!\n• Automatically select the highest video quality on YouTube!\n• Hides the annoying popup banners prompting you to get the app on Google, Google Maps, DuckDuckGo, IMDb, Instagram, Quora, Reddit, and Tumblr!\n• Font replacement. Substitute one font for another on web pages, such as Helvetica for Arial and Courier for Courier New.\n• Add your own site-specific CSS and JavaScript to web pages!\n• Custom URL redirects! Redirect new Reddit to old Reddit, Twitter to Nitter, YouTube to Invidious, etc. You can create any redirect that you want!\n• Stop keyboard page zoom. Stops the page from zooming in when you show the software keyboard!\n• Enable pinch-to-zoom on sites that prevent it, such as old reddit.\n• Stops \"Are you sure you want to leave this page?\" alerts. Close your tabs without getting stopped by the site!\n• Force external links to open in the current tab instead of a new tab. Remove target=\"_blank\" from links so that they no longer automatically create a new tab.\n• Force external links to open in a new tab instead of the current tab. This is great if you're scrolling through a list of links and want to open each one in a new tab.\n• Force images to the front. Bypass the transparent overlay on sites such as Instagram that prevents you from dragging and opening the contextual menu on images.\n• Warns when you paste or type beyond the maximum length in a password field or other text field. Stops you from accidentally losing characters!"

      "label": "This tool shows you the ultimate precise time of day. To achieve this, it uses a special internet time protocol to fetch the time from an atomic time server.\n\nWe are proud to offer version 5 of the Gorgy Timing Atomic Clock. The program is one of the classic applications since the early days of the Apple App Store and has been continually improved based on user feedback.\n\nThe Gorgy Timing Atomic Clock shows the precise time of day. To achieve this, it uses a special internet time protocol to fetch the ultimate precise time from cesium atomic clocks available on the internet, or any other time server you like.\n\nThe graphical display mimics the clock display of the legendary Gorgy Timing clocks, which are used in professional radio and television studios, and we spent much effort to bring the original feeling of these wickedly expensive clocks to your iPhone. This app is used by BBC studios, astronomers, concert promoters, etc. \n\nVersion 5 contains the following functions:\n\n* Universal support for all iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices running iOS 8 or higher (including iPhone 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, and all of the latest iPads and iPads Pro)\n* Optimized for iOS 13 and watchOS 6, full 64 bit support\n* Alarm function with snooze (touch anywhere on the screen), volume fade-in, based on weekdays\n* Alarm time based on seconds (not minutes)\n* Local time / UTC time mode\n* Alarm notification window instead of normal alarm sound, if app is not running or in the background\n* Use playlists or a manual picker selection from your own music library as alarm sounds\n* The alarm sound is also playing when the device is muted, or the display is switched off, and also works in AirPlay environments\n* Customizable time server sources\n* Colors: green, red, blue, yellow, white, dark green, violet, pink, orange, turquoise and hidden, with a separate color option for digits, seconds and segments\n* Alternative visual display of fractional seconds (1/60th sec. resolution)\n* 12/24 hours display\n* Optional second tick sound\n* Full landscape support (including settings dialog)\n* Touching the display lets the buttons and status bar fade out\n* Touching the display again will add the current date (in all orientations)\n* Disabled screen auto-lock\n* Options \"sync at startup\", \"hourly\", \"daily\", or a sync button for manual syncing\n* The last known time delta is used when started without sync\n* \"Night mode\", which dims the display using a slider, shows the seconds with only one dot (to prevent a hard brightness switch between second 59 and second 0), switches off the tick sound, and reduces screen updates to save battery\n* To minimize burn-in effects (especially on the iPhone X OLED display), the clock is doing micro movements when running longer than 5 minutes\n* VoiceOver support\n\nAnswers to common questions:\n\n* An application can not set your device's system time, so a time sync between the atomic time and the device time is not possible.\n* If you want to wakeup with music, please do not exit the app before going to sleep (which would result in a local notification dialog without music in the morning), and do not lock your device. Be aware that running an application all the time, even without display, consumes battery, so please make sure that your iPhone is fully charged before you go to bed, connect it to your charger, or use the app's Night mode, which is much more energy-saving."

      "label": "With SatFinder you can adjust your satellite antenna in a few seconds and with 4 simple steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - CHOOSE YOUR ANTENNA\nChoose one of the four different antenna designs: \n - Offset antennas (the most common, is slightly oval, the LNB is not in the center).\n - Special design (e.g. Oblong shaped Offset antenna, Multifeed antenna)  \n - Parabolic antenna (LNB is located in the center of the reflector, usually larger than 100cm)\n - Flat or planar antenna (small, camping antennas)\n\nIf you have an offset antenna, enter the height and width of the antenna. If your antenna has a special shape, enter the offset angle and the size of the satellite antenna. You can find the offset angle in the manual of your satellite antenna. For parabolic antennas it is sufficient to enter the antenna diameter. With a flat antenna you do not have to set anything. If you know the exact antenna name, check if your antenna is already in the database.\n\nTip: Press the wizard button to measure the size of the satellite antenna using the iPhone camera and LiDAR scanner. \n\nSTEP 2 - CHOOSE YOUR SATELLITE\nTo quickly and easily select a suitable satellite, simply press the \"AUTO\" button. The SatFinder will now automatically search for satellites that are in your reception area and that offer TV or radio stations in your language (the language setting of your iPhone will be selected). The stars (1-10) shown in the table result from the number of radio and TV channels offered and the reception strength at your location.  \n\nIf you want to receive a special satellite, switch off \"AUTO\": Now you can simply scroll through the table and select the satellite. Faster is the search function - just enter the name of the satellite, the channel or the orbit position. You can also reduce the number of table entries by hiding satellites that are not available at your location or do not broadcast in your language. With the button \"Channel Info\" you can check which channels the selected satellite is currently broadcasting - including all channel parameters for your satellite receiver.  \n\nSTEP 3 - CHECK OBSTACLES\nFor a smooth satellite reception, there must not be any obstacles between the satellite and your satellite antenna. You can check this with the \"View\" function. Simply aim at the satellite and watch the signs (GREEN - no obstacle, RED - caution, free view may not be given).\n\nTip: Press the button for the assistant to activate the voice output.\n\nSTEP 4 - ADJUST ANTENNA\nIn the menu item \"Align\" different graphics appear depending on the selected antenna type. If you use an offset antenna, you have to adjust the azimuth and elevation separately. With planar or parabolic antennas the adjustment of the angles is done together. Before you press the \"Start\" button, a video clip shows how to position your iPhone at the antenna. \n\nTip: Press the button for the assistant to activate the voice output.\n\nSTEP 5 - FINE TUNING \nIf necessary, you can optimize the reception of your satellite system. The SatFinder provides you with the function \"FineTuning\". To use this function, you need a second iOS device. One device serves as a camera; the second device as a monitor. Simply place an iPhone in front of your reception screen and observe changes in picture quality while slightly rotating or tilting your satellite antenna. With the FineTuning feature, you'll have visual contact with your TV even when you're out of sight. \n\nTHAT'S IT. YOU SHOULD NOW BE ABLE TO ENJOY INTERFERENCE-FREE SATELLITE RECEPTION... \nNote: Satellite antenna tuning is only available on iOS devices with LiDAR sensor (e.g. iPhone 12 Pro)."

      "label": "iCab Mobile is a web browser for the iOS. It provides many unique and useful features you won't find in other iPhone browsers.\n\nAPPLE WATCH:\nThe Watch App is a remote control for iCab Mobile, so you can navigate, zoom, scroll, open bookmarks, links, the homepage, switch tabs or sitch on/off the fullscreen mode. Since watchOS 6.2 you can also open web pages and browse the Web directly on the Apple Watch. But there are still limitations: there are no navigation buttons (back/forward) available.\n\nFILE UPLOADS:\niCab Mobile can upload any files on web pages.\n\nSEARCHING:\niCab Mobile comes with several default search engines you can choose from. You can easily add new search engines. \n\nFILLING OUT FORMS:\niCab Mobile can save web forms and restore the form content later (manually or automatically). The saved forms data can be password protected. Supports many third-party Password Manager Apps as well.\n\nFILTERS:\nThere’s a built-in fully customizable filter feature. It allows to block resources, ads, banners, user tracking scripts, cookies etc. Supports AdBlock Plus/EasyList filters as well.\n\nTABS:\niCab Mobile supports Tabs, so you can open multiple web pages at the same time. Links can be opened in Tabs (in the foreground or background) manually or automatically. \n\nBOOKMARKS:\nBookmarks can be organized in folders. You can import/export the bookmarks from/to your PC/Mac browser. \n\nFULLSCREEN MODE:\niCab Mobile provides a fullscreen mode where the whole screen is used to display the web page. No screen space is wasted for toolbars. \n\nDOWNLOADS:\niCab Mobile has a built-in Download Manager so you can download almost all files from the internet. The downloads can be easily transfered to a Mac/PC/Linux computer but also to other Apps on the device which can open these files\n\nMULTIUSER SUPPORT\nYou can create multiple user accounts, each user has its own private bookmarks, filters, settings, etc.\n\nDROPBOX\niCab Mobile supports Dropbox. Export/Import bookmarks; transfer downloads, images, files, web pages to your Dropbox account.\n\nTWIN BROWSER:\nIn this mode, you can have two browsers side by side on the iPad. This is especially useful on the large iPad Pro.\n\nVOICEOVER\nThe App is also accessible for visually impaired and blind users. If VoiceOver is enabled, the App plays soft ticks while a page is loading, so blind users are able to identify when the page load has finished. \n\nOTHER FEATURE:\n- Configurable multi-touch gestures\n- QuickStarter feature\n- AirPrint support \n- Browser ID (UserAgent) is configurable\n- iCab Mobile fully supports international domain names\n- Cookie Manager\n- Private Browsing (no history and no cookies are stored)\n- Privacy settings allows to delete all kinds of private data (history, cookies, databases, saved forms, passwords etc.)\n- URL autocompletion \n- Simple built-in RSS reader\n- Save images, whole web pages, PDF files\n- Kiosk Mode - a restricted variation of the fullscreen mode for Kiosk environments. \n- History\n- Addressbook support lets you access the web pages from the addressbook. \n- When launching iCab can either open an empty page, the homepage or restore the Tabs which were open the last time\n- There are different color schemes and designs\n- Document Sharing lets you pass downloads and files to other Apps in the device\n\n\n\nThe App includes a store providing several InApp purchases. These are meant as a tip jar. The InApp purchases are available for different prices, so you can pick the amount for the tip yourself. Doing so will unlock a few cool features as a reward, these are always the same, regardless of the amount of the tip. Users who have purchased the App within the last 12 months do get all these features for free, no need to buy one of the InApp purchases. Though they can nevertheless give me a tip, if they want to... ;-)"

      "label": "Rather than following generic and unspecific advice how much chain or rope to pay out when at anchor, use this app to calculate the amount of chain or rope needed for the anchor to have the best possible grip - safety tailored for your vessel!\n\nOnly too often does anchoring advice boil down to: Use a scope (i.e. ratio of chain length to water depth) of 3:1 in calm weather, and increase this to 5:1 or 7:1 as the wind picks up. This advice is independent of your vessel’s characteristics, independent of water depth, swell, or even the wind strength. So, is a scope of 7:1 still good enough for the storm tonight? Is the snubber / bridle good enough to do the job?\n\nThe Anchor Chain Calculator allows you to calculate the minimally required anchor chain / rope length based on a number of vessel characteristics and sea / weather conditions. It tells you what load the anchor will have to bear, and when you are using a snubber / bridle / rope, how much of the swell it absorbs, and how much it reduces the anchor load. Including these dynamic and elastic effects is particularly important in shallow water.\n\nThe App can work with a chain-only scenario as well as with an arbitrary mix of rope and chain.\n\nYou can also restrict the chain or rope length, if you have to - perhaps because of nearby neighbours or obstacles - and get information how this restriction affects the anchor load and the angle at which the chain pulls at the anchor.\n\nThe app has two modes of working: Basic Mode and Expert Mode. With Basic Mode you will be able to use the app right away, whilst Expert Mode allows you to enter more technical details of your boat if you have them.\n\nYou can use either metric units (metres, daN / kp, and mm for chain thickness) or imperial units (feet, lbs, and inch for chain thickness).\n\nYou can store different vessel configurations by name and so can easily switch, e.g., between different snubber/bridle/rope or vessel setups. These setups can be locked to prevent accidental overwriting. \n\nThis app is also great for playing through all kinds of \"what if\" scenarios. It will help you to plan ahead and be better prepared.\n\nThe perfect addition to an anchor alarm / anchor watch for safer anchoring!"

I also applied \nother filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an \nenvironment suitable for spirit communication.\n\nThe audio itself is made up of phonemes, \npartial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help \nspirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.\nthere are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.\n\nThese sounds banks play in a similar\nway to that of my other app \"Spiritus Ghost Box\" but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has\n8 active sound banks.\n\nWhite Noise Sound Bank:\n\nThis app also has an optional 9th sound bank called \"White noise\". \nThis bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This \naudio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the \n\"Holy Grail\" of EVP recorders. This is not a White Noise Generator, this is a normal sound bank like the others but this one contains white noise from the DR60.\n\nAudio Effects:\n\nThis app does contain Echo and Reverb audio effects. These have been proven \nto be the best effects to apply to ITC sessions. The echo can create audio that can be \nmanipulated within the echo itself. Echo can also help in live, real time communication by \nrepeating the audio and allowing you to better hear whats coming through. Reverb can be \napplied to the audio to create a spacious sound environment that will enhance audio manipulation."

      "label": "Manage and view all your files like documents, musics, and videos, also more importantly, provide three levels of protection to your files: app passcode, encrypted disk, hidden encrypted disk.\n\n    Our app is globally rated 4 stars (all rates counted):\n“Very good. As advertised.”- by Mar** , American user\n“Toll Kommt mit True- und Veracrypt zurecht” - by Parab* (Great It’s true - support Veracrypt), Germany user\n“FINALMENTE!!! Um Aplicativo de REAL Criptografia”(Finally!!! a real crypto application) - by Calh*, Brazilian user\n  “Very good file manager - very easy to use, support copy folder, I look for it so hard…” - by Hutu**, Chinese user\n\n   【General file management 】(available both inside and outside of encrypted disks):\n    1. Support to view files natively supported by iOS, like JPG, MOV, PDF, Office files, and iWorks files. Support to play most video files that haven't been natively supported by iOS like mkv, flv, mp4, avi, wmv, rm, rmvb, ogv, and 3gp.\n    2. Support to view and edit text files. \n    3. Support general file operations like copy, paste, and rename.\n    4. Support to unarchive ZIP and RAR files. Support to create ZIP files.\n    5. Import files from and export files to other Apps (including Apps like Dropbox, Box, OneDrive etc.) on the same device. \n    6. Import files from and export files to Document Providers (including iCloud Drive, Dropbox, Box, and Apps that support to be Document Providers like the Documents App). iOS 8 only.\n    7. File transfer (across iOS devices, Mac, and PC). In addition to general iTune based file transfer, the App supports HTTP file transfer, FTP file transfer (the App can act as FTP server or FTP client, and the FTP server supports to resume download), and AirDrop file transfer.\n\n   【Three levels of protection to your files】:\n     1. App passcode and Touch ID. It’s only the basic level of protection, though some other Apps only provide such protection.\n     2. Encrypted disk (aka encrypted volume). We use the TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt virtual disk encryption format, an open, popular, 3rd party audited, and time-tested format (used about ten years). An encrypted virtual disk file appears as an ordinary file before it is opened, but actually it contains an encrypted file system (the App uses AES-256 encryption algorithm and supports other algorithms as well). The encrypted file system can be viewed and modified if and only if its encryption key is provided for decryption. Encrypting the whole file system not only encrypts the contents of your files, but also encrypts the meta data of your files, like file name and file size. Such idea is also widely used in desktop operation systems for better protection (like the Mac OS X’s FileVault solution). \n      3. Hidden encrypted disk. Sometimes the user may be forced to reveal the password of an encrypted disk file (e.g., holden by bad guys or asked by his girlfriend), he/she may use the more complicated one, hidden encrypted disk. A hidden encrypted disk is a disk created at the back portion of an outer encrypted disk file. If others do not know the password of hidden encrypted disk, they not only cannot view the content of hidden encrypted disk, but also cannot even know the existence of hidden encrypted disk. Thus, the user could put the most secret files into hidden encrypted disk, and when he/she was forced to reveal the password of the disk file, he/she only needs to reveal the password of the outer crypto disk and deny the existence of the hidden crypto disk. \n    (Check documentation in the App for further details.)\n    The App supports encrypted disks with FAT (FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32) file system now.\n\n    On you Mac or PC, you could use either Truecrypt 7.1a or VeraCrypt1.0f to open encrypted disk files, which could be downloaded from http://www.truecrypt71a.com/download, https://veracrypt.codeplex.com"

Amplitude Pro uses the high quality hardware of the iPhone and iPod Touch* to detect and amplify the faintest of sounds. \r\n\r\n***Note: To get the best experience possible, you must use ear buds that do not have a built-in microphone.***\r\n\r\nAmplitude Pro lets you adjust the sensitivity of the iPhone microphone to amplify sounds from across a room. You’ll hear things you never would have been able to hear otherwise. \r\n\r\nAmplitude Pro also lets you record and save the amplified sounds to your device and share them with your friends. To do this, all you have to do is press the red button at the bottom of the screen. To stop it, you simply press the button again. Now you can detect and have proof of that “ghost” that you always hear that everyone made fun of you for and prove them wrong!\r\n\r\nUsing Amplitude Pro is easy: simply launch the app, point your device in the direction of the sound you want to amplify, and starting hearing the world in a new way through your headphones. Individual controls enable you to adjust the microphone sensitivity or mute the sound amplifying feature altogether.\r\n\r\nUse Amplitude Pro to explore your world. Experience all the sounds of your environment that you would otherwise have missed.\r\n\r\nExperience Nature and Wildlife More Intimately. Record and share the sounds with friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nExperimenting Around Your World\r\n\r\n- Diagnose the source of that annoying squeak in your new car and send it to your local mechanic.\r\n\r\n- Attach a cup or small plastic bowl to the end of your iPhone to focus the incoming sound and expand your range\r\n\r\n- Place microphone against an office wall to hear sounds from all over the building and listen to what everyone is talking about!\r\n\r\nAmplitude Pro Benefits:\r\n\r\n- Turns your iPhone or iPod Touch* into a sound amplifier\r\n\r\n- Hear sounds through thin walls or doors\r\n\r\n- Adjustable microphone sensitivity / boost\r\n\r\n- Adjustable volume and mute controls\r\n\r\n- Independently control the iPhone volume and the microphone sensitivity\r\n\r\n- View sound waves on the oscilloscope\r\n\r\n- Record and share each and every sound you encounter!\r\n\r\n***Ear buds are required for use with all devices. 1st, 2nd, and 3rd generation iPod Touches require ear buds with a microphone whereas the 4th generation iPod Touch can use ear buds without a microphone.***\r\n\r\nTips on Using Amplitude Pro:\r\n\r\n- For best audio reception, point the microphone in the direction of the sound you want to pick up. \r\n\r\n- Amplitude Pro controls are oriented upside down from other apps so that the microphone can be pointed toward target sounds.\r\n\r\n- To protect against accidental ear damage, Amplitude Pro starts in Muted mode. You can change the default in the settings screen.\r\n\r\n- For optimal performance, we recommend keeping device volume between 50-75%.\r\n\r\n- Experiment with microphone sensitivity. Some situations will require more, some less.\r\n\r\n- To preserve battery life, launch the application and press the device sleep button to darken the screen.\r\n\r\n- You can maximize your reception by using your hands or a plastic cup to focus the incoming sound. This is the best method to use when listening through solid objects like doors or walls.\r\n\r\n- Like any exposed microphone, the iPhone microphone is sensitive to wind noise. For best results we recommend using Amplitude Pro in non-windy situations. \r\n\r\n- Experiment with different attachments and microphone settings and let us know what works best for you.\r\n\r\nSend us your stories or YouTube videos to Amplitude@GripWire.com.

The built in magnetometer can be used to detect these magnetic fields.\n\n◆ How it works:\n    • Remove any cover or frame that contains magnetic or metallic parts from your iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad. Magnetic and metallic parts are disturbing the measurement!\n\n    • Start the App.\n\n    • Move your iPhone slowly close to the area where you suspect a power line carrying voltage.\n\n▸If a voltage is present the display will flash and the mG reading grows while the message \"Voltage detected\" appears.\nNote: mG stands for milliGauss, which is used to measure the strength of a magnetic field.\n\n\nYou may want to test it before use by slowly moving it to an area where you are sure there is a voltage present, like the cable running to your room light. Computer and electronic devices are not the best choice to test the fundtion of the app, they are often heavily shielded against magnetic and electric fields (which denies a proper reading since a shielding alwaysx works both ways).\n\nHave fun with this handy tool!"

Easily integrate the Prowl API into your applications.\n\nA list of supported apps/services: http://prowlapp.com/apps.php\n\nThe only limit of what the service can do is your imagination.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\nTo receive notifications from your computer, you need the latest:\n• Growl on your Mac @ growl.info, or\n• Growl for Windows @ growlforwindows.com, or\n• Snarl on Windows @ fullphat.net, or\n• Any program or web service using the public API.\n\nTHE CRITICS\n\"I was extremely impressed with Prowl and the elegance with which I was able to view Growl notifications on my iPhone.”\n—Aron Trimble, TUAW\n\n\"[A] powerful tool to connect your Mac with your iPhone, seamlessly over the air.\n—Federico Viticci, MacStories\n\n\"Great idea. This opens up iPhone push notifications for anything you can think of.”\n—John Gruber, Daring Fireball\n\n\"Probably the best $3 I’ve ever spent in the App Store.”\n—Darrell Etherington, The Apple Blog\n\nFEATURES\n• Push Notifications—When a Growl notification pops up on your computer, it's sent to Prowl and displayed on your iOS device within seconds.\n\n• Sweet application support—Prowl has support from a bunch of cool applications and services. Check out the full list at http://prowlapp.com/apps.php\n\n• Redirections—Launch a different application when you open a push notification. For example, a notification from your desktop Twitter client can relaunch into your favorite mobile client. You can even pick custom URLs to launch, so you can go anywhere!\n\n• Email to push—Use your Prowl email address (from the Prowl homepage's \"API keys\" tab) to get email delivery right on your device. Generate as many email addresses as you need!\n\n• An amazing API—Use the Prowl API with a multitude of libraries in various programming languages. You can send notifications from anything that can talk to the internet, and do some fun things along with it.\n\n• Quiet Hours—During the hours you specify, only the badge numbers are updated. No matter the source. Instead of getting a noisy alert, messages are quietly delivered. You can allow emergency-priority items to break quiet hours.\n\n• Do Not Disturb—Keep the application quiet whenever you're busy, or when you need a break from a constant alert. Controllable from within the application.\n\n• Control—Open the edit view to get a quick glance at your notifications, and do away with pesky ones. Quickly copy, email or SMS a notification directly from Prowl (depending on device and iOS version).\n\n• Browse quickly—Use Prowl's internal browser to quickly open links from a notification without having to open Safari.\n\n• History—Up to 10 days of notifications are kept on the server. You can delete notifications that you don't want to see any more, or remove all of your history.\n\n• Customized notifications—Only events you want are sent to Prowl. You can specify all kinds of conditions from the Prowl plugin for Growl.\n\n• Send any message to your device—From the Prowl website, you can send any text to your device: links and phone numbers are automatically linked, so you can easily navigate around without having to worry about typos. From the website or API, you can also automatically redirect to the attached URL.\n\nSETUP\nProwl is built into Growl 2.0. For earlier versions: http://prowlapp.com/installation.php — for Mac.\nhttp://growlforwindows.com — for Windows.\n\nSUPPORT\n@prowlapp on Twitter\nhttp://prowlapp.com/support.php"

By using the camera of your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, you can scan your surroundings and ColorSay will make the colors audible to you.\n\n\nColorSay calls the colors by name!\n\nSet up one of five color sets for speech output, and ColorSay will announce the name of the closest known color. ColorSay identifies the color names in English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Turkish, Russian, Chinese and Japanese.\n\n\nColorSay converts colors into tones!\n\nChoose between different sound modes for sonochromatic reproduction of the color impressions. The dominant colors of an image will be interpreted as tones in real-time, which will enable you to identify the individual color families acoustically.\n\n\nColorSay is optimized to use the iOS accessibility features including VoiceOver, but does not rely on these in order to work without limitations.\n\n\nColorSay is a color scanner and suitable for blind users, people with color blindness, defective color vision, red-green blindness, blue-yellow blindness, color vision deficiency, achromatopsia, achromasia, dyschromatopsia, protanopia (red blindness), deuteranopia (green blindness), tritanopia (blue blindness), monochromaticity ...\n\n... and it’s for everyone who would like to rediscover the world of colors!\n\n\nThis app is also available for macOS.

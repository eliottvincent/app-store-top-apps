You can even define your own experiments on phyphox.org and share them with colleagues, students and friends.\n\nSelected Features:\n- A selection of pre-defined experiments. Just press play to start.\n- Export your data to a range of widely used formats\n- Remote-control your experiment through a web interface from any PC on the same network as your phone. No need to install anything on those PCs - all you need is a modern web browser.\n- Define your own experiments by selecting sensor inputs, defining analysis steps and creating views as an interface using our web-editor (http://phyphox.org/editor). The analysis can consists of just adding two values or using advanced methods like Fourier transforms and crosscorrelation. We offer a whole toolbox of analysis functions.\n\nSensors supported:\n- Accelerometer\n- Magnetometer\n- Gyroscope\n- Pressure\n- Microphone\n- Proximity\n- GPS\n*some sensors are not present on every phone.\n\nExport formats\n- CSV (Comma separated values)\n- TSV (Tab-separated values)\n- Excel\n(if you need other formats, please let us know)\n\n\nThis app has been developed at the 2nd Institute of Physics A at the RWTH Aachen University."

It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

      "label": "LEG MATEMATIK\nMini Morfi er et finurligt univers for de 4-6 årige med masser af muligheder for at lege matematik. I Mini Morfi kan du lege med former, størrelser, antal og mønstre, når du besøger de mange butikker og steder i byen. Men mest af alt er Mini Morfi en app med plads til den frie leg, hvor du kan gå på opdagelse og lege i dit eget tempo. Du kan f.eks. putte de nuttede kiksedyr i seng i Bibis Dyrehandel. Her skal du holde øje med de geometriske former. Når du bygger biler hos Molly og Polly skal du holde øje med størrelserne, og på Alfies Planteskole laver du flotte mønstre på træerne. Dyrene, bilerne og træerne får du med ud på kortet over byen Mini Morfi, så du kan lege videre her.\n\nMATEMATISK OPMÆRKSOMHED\nMini Morfi har fokus på matematisk opmærksomhed. Matematisk opmærksomhed er det begyndende fokus på matematiske begreber som f.eks. tal og tælling, former, mønstre og måling. Man kan styrke børns matematiske opmærksomhed ved at fokusere på matematikken i forskellige situationer i børns hverdag. På den måde øges børns matematiske forståelse. Find inspiration til hvordan du kan snakke med dit barn om matematikken i Mini Morfi på appens forældreside.\n\nDIY\nI Mini Morfi vil du genkende mange ting fra hverdagen: F.eks. er bilerne lavet af ispinde, træerne dekoreres med pasta og de nuttede dyr er lavet af kiks. At bruge hverdagsobjekter i appen understøtter tanken om matematisk opmærksomhed. Det handler at få øje på matematikken i alting omkring sig. Mini Morfi appen suppleres af et website minimorfi.dk, hvor du, med udgangspunkt i Mini Morfi universet, kan finde sjove idéer til kreative aktiviteter med børn.\n\nOM FUZZY HOUSE\nMini Morfi er udviklet af Fuzzy House. Vi designer prisvindende apps til de yngste. Vores apps har fokus på fri leg, fantasi, kreativitet og læring igennem leg. Hvis du har spørgsmål til os, så send en mail til info@fuzzyhouse.com. Udviklingen af Mini Morfi er støttet af Det Danske Filminstitut.\n\nwww.minimorfi.dk\nwww.fuzzyhouse.com\nInstagram | @fuzzyhouse\nFacebook | @fuzzyhouse\n\nPRIVATLIVSPOLITIK\nSe vores Privatlivspolitik her: https://www.minimorfi.dk/privatlivspolitik/"

      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

Make the city cooler and more stylish – or save your money for later. At the same time, you have to make sure the city is green, clean and a happy place. All this will help you learn about money and maths in daily life.\n\nIf you keep the city green, then it won’t be as polluted. And that will mean you can earn more money. Which is good for you and good for Moneyville.\n\n-\tHarvest vegetables, catch fish and get other goods. Sell them at the market and receive money in exchange.\n-\tPlay fun mini-games, all while learning about numbers, money and maths along the way.\n-\tAccessorise your character and the city – or save your money for later.\n-\tMake the city greener and more sustainable – and earn more money in the long term.\n-\tWhy not buy a new electric truck or make the city’s water treatment plant even better?\n\nMoneyville is an interactive, colourful universe in which 6-9 year old children learn about money, finances, maths and sustainability. The game is designed for use as part of the maths syllabus and is supplemented by relevant teaching materials. \n\nIn Moneyville, children learn about healthy habits relating to finances, saving and investing in the future. Children also learn to invest in a more sustainable and green local community. In doing so, Moneyville supports the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals for a more sustainable world.\n\nMoneyville has been developed by Danske Bank in partnership with experts in education and didactics.\n\nRead more about Moneyville and find our teacher guidelines at www.pengeby.dk (in Danish)"

Du kan også lege med ordene ved hjælp af ordbogens avancerede søge- og filtreringsfunktioner. Du kan finde ord ved forlæns og baglæns søgning, du kan indskrænke søgningen til bestemte ordklasser, du kan søge på mønstre af vokaler og konsonanter osv.\n\nI RO+ finder du også retskrivningsreglerne. Her kan du fx læse om hvordan man sætter komma, hvordan man bruger apostroffer og bindestreger, og hvornår man skriver en ordforbindelse i ét eller to ord. \n\nOrdbogen bliver løbende opdateret. Opdateringerne foregår automatisk når RO+ er online. Når du er offline, virker ordbogen også så du kan slå op i den hvor som helst og når som helst.\n\nEn gang om måneden modtager du et retskrivningstip så du kan blive klogere på apostroffer, anførselstegn, store og små bogstaver og meget mere. Push-beskederne kan slås fra i din mobils indstillinger."

In just minutes you’ll start memorizing core Spanish words, form sentences, learn to speak Spanish phrases and take part in conversations. Fun Spanish lessons improve your vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation like no other language learning method. Beginner or advanced learner, traveler or business professional with a tight schedule? The app works great and dynamically adjusts to your needs.\n\nExplore language exercises for reading, listening, writing and speaking enhanced with a dictionary, verb conjugator and state-of-the-art speech recognition technology - you’ll feel like having your own Spanish language tutor in your pocket.\nDownload the language learning pill today and enjoy the benefits of learning a new language for life.\n\n▶ The secret path to language learning\nRemember the Spanish language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of Spanish grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.\nMondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.\n\nHere are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:\n\n• State-of-the-art Speech Recognition. Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your Spanish words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak Spanish clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.\n\n• Useful phrases for real situations. Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning Spanish. Mondly teaches you Spanish vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.\n\n• Learn conversational Spanish. Conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core Spanish vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs, and speak Spanish clearly.\n\n• Verb conjugations. If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the Spanish verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.\n\n• The Leaderboard. See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.\n\nPLEASE NOTE\n\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to all of this app’s courses and features.\n\nSubscription options:\n- One-monthly subscription for $US9.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n- One-yearly subscription for $US47.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n\nYour subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current payment period.\n\nYour iTunes account will be automatically charged at the same price for renewal within the 24-hour period prior to the end of the current payment period unless you change your subscription preferences in your Account Settings.\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\nAny unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\nYou can manage your subscriptions through your Account Settings after purchase.\n\nWhen a subscription is canceled, access to the app’s courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nPrivacy Policy: www.mondly.com/privacy\nTerms: www.mondly.com/terms\n\nWe welcome your feedback and suggestions at: ios[at]mondly[dot]com\n\nBefore you know it, at the end of these Spanish lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language."

      "label": "Play with letters, sounds and words together with Alfie Atkins. Children love learning new things through play. This app, Play ABC, Alfie Atkins, stimulates children's language learning skills by clearly connecting the function and purpose of letters in an experimental, playful way.\n\nAlfie has some extraordinary devices in his room: a letter tracer, a word machine and a puppet theatre. With the letter tracer, children will learn the appearance and sound of all letters and train their motor skills and muscle memory by drawing and tracing letters on the screen. Using Alfie's homemade word machine, children will spell new words using phonemes and letter tips. All new words are sent to the puppet theatre, where children use their creativity and imagination to tell fantastic stories. This playloop, with concrete results, has a motivational effect and helps children develop their language skills at their own pace.\n\nPlay ABC, Alfie Atkins is developed by language teachers and game designers. It was created and tested in collaboration with teachers and students of schools in Finland and Sweden. The app has been developed based on children's needs and does not feature points, time limits or other elements that could lead to failure or stress. Children will play and learn using the app on their own terms and at their own pace, in preschool, at school or at home.\n\nPlay and learn:\n  • The sounds, phonemes and names of letters\n  • How to trace letters\n  • How to spell around 100 different words\n  • How to read simple words\n  • Upper and lowercase letters\n  • Fine motor skills and eye-hand coordination\n  • The basics of literacy\n  • Creative storytelling\n\nThe app is available in 6 different languages, and the full version allows the creation of individual profiles for multiple children.\n\nPlease note that family sharing of in-app purchases aren't supported by Apple. So if you want to purchase the full version of the app and share it with family members please purchase the separate premium, full version, of the app available on the Appstore instead.\n\nGro Play is an xEdu.co alumnus and member of the trade organization Swedish EdTech Industry. Gro Play collaborates with Playful Learning Center, the University of Helsinki, in the development of game-based learning.

      "label": "Backed by Occupational Therapists, Teachers, and Child Psychologists, Joon is the future of motivating kids and helping them focus. Using a kid-friendly game (for ages 8-12), Joon helps you motivate your child to focus and stay on top of their daily tasks & habits.\n\n\n**JOON’S GOAL**\n\nHelp you motivate your kids with ADHD, ADD, or OSD to focus and complete their daily tasks while learning basic responsibility and independence. Not only does Joon make it extremely easy to motivate your ADHD kids to do important tasks, but it also teaches them valuable life skills that they won’t be able to learn in school. We’ve helped thousands of families complete more than 100k tasks and teach their kids important life skills, so why can't we help you?\n\n\n**HOW IT WORKS**\n\nAssign tasks as \"Quests\", then the game does the rest.\n\n1) Start with age-appropriate tasks & habits to focus on: Choose a couple focus areas, and we'll provide you with a small list of recommended tasks (known as Quests) or create your own tasks to get your child started!\n\n2) Use gamification to keep your child on track: Your child chooses a virtual pet (called a Doter) to feed, wash, and grow. They stay motivated and focused on completing the tasks you assigned them, so they can take care of their pet and level it up!\n\n3) Your child stays focused and even develops life skills! As they progress in the game, your child will naturally start building their tasks as habits into their daily routine and even pick up on learning important life skills. All because they want to keep playing a fun game!\n\n\n**THE PARENTING TOOL YOU NEED**\n\n+ We make it easy to manage your child’s tasks and add to your existing routine.\n\n+ We'll do the reminding to help your child stick to their routine. No more nagging from your end.\n\n+ Your child will stay focused to do the activities assigned to them. In fact, 90% of kids on Joon complete all tasks assigned.\n\n+ Choose from a large list of research-backed activities to help your child build important life skills that teach independence.\n\nJoon is less than a year old and already has the attention of press, parenting publications, and parenting experts. To see the complete list, visit our website here: https://joonapp.io\n\n\n**HOW TO GET STARTED**\n\n1) Install Joon on your device, create your family, and select a few beginning tasks you’d like your child to initially focus on.\n\n2) Help your child set up their account so they can see the tasks that you’ve assigned them. You can have them download Joon on their own device or share you phone.\n\n3) Add a few more activities that are most important to your family (such as chores, learning, or exercising) and assign them to your child. Your child will be motivated to complete these activities in order to feed and take care of their virtual pet.\n\n4) Once your child completes their tasks, you can review and approve them to make sure they were completed correctly.\n\n5) Once approved, your children receive coins and experience points that let them feed, level up, buy things, and progress in the game with their virtual pet. As your child continues to progress in the game, they actually progress in real life too!\n\n6) Keep adding quests (and we’ll recommend you new ones too to help your children develop good habits! Your children cannot grow on their own. Make sure to stay involved in the process and keep assigning new quests as needed to allow your children to continue helping, learning, growing, and progressing in the game.\n\nTerms Of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

That you can turn your phone into a sonar?\n\nphyphox gives you access to the sensors of your phone either directly or through ready-to-play experiments which analyze your data and let you export raw data along with the results for further analysis. You can even define your own experiments on phyphox.org and share them with colleagues, students and friends.\n\nSelected Features:\n- A selection of pre-defined experiments. Just press play to start.\n- Export your data to a range of widely used formats\n- Remote-control your experiment through a web interface from any PC on the same network as your phone. No need to install anything on those PCs - all you need is a modern web browser.\n- Define your own experiments by selecting sensor inputs, defining analysis steps and creating views as an interface using our web-editor (http://phyphox.org/editor). The analysis can consists of just adding two values or using advanced methods like Fourier transforms and crosscorrelation. We offer a whole toolbox of analysis functions.\n\nSensors supported:\n- Accelerometer\n- Magnetometer\n- Gyroscope\n- Pressure\n- Microphone\n- Proximity\n- GPS\n*some sensors are not present on every phone.\n\nExport formats\n- CSV (Comma separated values)\n- TSV (Tab-separated values)\n- Excel\n(if you need other formats, please let us know)\n\n\nThis app has been developed at the 2nd Institute of Physics A at the RWTH Aachen University."

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

Figurerne er ca. 100 cm i højden og nummereret fra 1-15 med hver sin unikke QR-kode. Figurerne fastmonteres rundt omkring på skolens areal (ude og inde).\n\nFessorLøbet er lige til at gå til, og alle kan deltage – det kræver ikke abonnement på MatematikFessor at kunne anvende app’en til FessorLøbet.\n\nNye spørgsmål 12 gange om året:\nSpørgsmålene er fordelt ud på årets 12 måneder, så eleverne på hvert niveau oplever, at der kommer nye spørgsmål én gang om måneden. Konceptet giver mange muligheder for variation, da eleverne kan udfordres på højere niveauer eller repetere matematik ved at vælge et lavere niveau. Endelig kan frekvensen af antal løb øges, hvis der vælges færre poster pr. løb. Så mulighederne er mange for at udfordre eleverne med FessorLøbet hele året rundt!\n\nKort sagt… FessorLøbet giver bevægelse i undervisningen, et fagligt indspark og styrkelse af sociale relationer og samarbejde i klassen – på en sjov og motiverende måde for eleverne!\nLæs mere om FessorLøbet på fessorløbet.dk."

Make the city cooler and more stylish – or save your money for later. At the same time, you have to make sure the city is green, clean and a happy place. All this will help you learn about money and maths in daily life.\n\nIf you keep the city green, then it won’t be as polluted. And that will mean you can earn more money. Which is good for you and good for Moneyville.\n\n-\tHarvest vegetables, catch fish and get other goods. Sell them at the market and receive money in exchange.\n-\tPlay fun mini-games, all while learning about numbers, money and maths along the way.\n-\tAccessorise your character and the city – or save your money for later.\n-\tMake the city greener and more sustainable – and earn more money in the long term.\n-\tWhy not buy a new electric truck or make the city’s water treatment plant even better?\n\nMoneyville is an interactive, colourful universe in which 6-9 year old children learn about money, finances, maths and sustainability. The game is designed for use as part of the maths syllabus and is supplemented by relevant teaching materials. \n\nIn Moneyville, children learn about healthy habits relating to finances, saving and investing in the future. Children also learn to invest in a more sustainable and green local community. In doing so, Moneyville supports the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals for a more sustainable world.\n\nMoneyville has been developed by Danske Bank in partnership with experts in education and didactics.\n\nRead more about Moneyville and find our teacher guidelines at www.pengeby.dk (in Danish)"

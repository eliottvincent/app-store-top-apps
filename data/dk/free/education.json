You can even define your own experiments on phyphox.org and share them with colleagues, students and friends.\n\nSelected Features:\n- A selection of pre-defined experiments. Just press play to start.\n- Export your data to a range of widely used formats\n- Remote-control your experiment through a web interface from any PC on the same network as your phone. No need to install anything on those PCs - all you need is a modern web browser.\n- Define your own experiments by selecting sensor inputs, defining analysis steps and creating views as an interface using our web-editor (http://phyphox.org/editor). The analysis can consists of just adding two values or using advanced methods like Fourier transforms and crosscorrelation. We offer a whole toolbox of analysis functions.\n\nSensors supported:\n- Accelerometer\n- Magnetometer\n- Gyroscope\n- Pressure\n- Microphone\n- Proximity\n- GPS\n*some sensors are not present on every phone.\n\nExport formats\n- CSV (Comma separated values)\n- TSV (Tab-separated values)\n- Excel\n(if you need other formats, please let us know)\n\n\nThis app has been developed at the 2nd Institute of Physics A at the RWTH Aachen University."

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

Figurerne er ca. 100 cm i højden og nummereret fra 1-15 med hver sin unikke QR-kode. Figurerne fastmonteres rundt omkring på skolens areal (ude og inde).\n\nFessorLøbet er lige til at gå til, og alle kan deltage – det kræver ikke abonnement på MatematikFessor at kunne anvende app’en til FessorLøbet.\n\nNye spørgsmål 12 gange om året:\nSpørgsmålene er fordelt ud på årets 12 måneder, så eleverne på hvert niveau oplever, at der kommer nye spørgsmål én gang om måneden. Konceptet giver mange muligheder for variation, da eleverne kan udfordres på højere niveauer eller repetere matematik ved at vælge et lavere niveau. Endelig kan frekvensen af antal løb øges, hvis der vælges færre poster pr. løb. Så mulighederne er mange for at udfordre eleverne med FessorLøbet hele året rundt!\n\nKort sagt… FessorLøbet giver bevægelse i undervisningen, et fagligt indspark og styrkelse af sociale relationer og samarbejde i klassen – på en sjov og motiverende måde for eleverne!\nLæs mere om FessorLøbet på fessorløbet.dk."

      "label": "Play with letters, sounds and words together with Alfie Atkins. Children love learning new things through play. This app, Play ABC, Alfie Atkins, stimulates children's language learning skills by clearly connecting the function and purpose of letters in an experimental, playful way.\n\nAlfie has some extraordinary devices in his room: a letter tracer, a word machine and a puppet theatre. With the letter tracer, children will learn the appearance and sound of all letters and train their motor skills and muscle memory by drawing and tracing letters on the screen. Using Alfie's homemade word machine, children will spell new words using phonemes and letter tips. All new words are sent to the puppet theatre, where children use their creativity and imagination to tell fantastic stories. This playloop, with concrete results, has a motivational effect and helps children develop their language skills at their own pace.\n\nPlay ABC, Alfie Atkins is developed by language teachers and game designers. It was created and tested in collaboration with teachers and students of schools in Finland and Sweden. The app has been developed based on children's needs and does not feature points, time limits or other elements that could lead to failure or stress. Children will play and learn using the app on their own terms and at their own pace, in preschool, at school or at home.\n\nPlay and learn:\n  • The sounds, phonemes and names of letters\n  • How to trace letters\n  • How to spell around 100 different words\n  • How to read simple words\n  • Upper and lowercase letters\n  • Fine motor skills and eye-hand coordination\n  • The basics of literacy\n  • Creative storytelling\n\nThe app is available in 6 different languages, and the full version allows the creation of individual profiles for multiple children.\n\nPlease note that family sharing of in-app purchases aren't supported by Apple. So if you want to purchase the full version of the app and share it with family members please purchase the separate premium, full version, of the app available on the Appstore instead.\n\nGro Play is an xEdu.co alumnus and member of the trade organization Swedish EdTech Industry. Gro Play collaborates with Playful Learning Center, the University of Helsinki, in the development of game-based learning.

Make the city cooler and more stylish – or save your money for later. At the same time, you have to make sure the city is green, clean and a happy place. All this will help you learn about money and maths in daily life.\n\nIf you keep the city green, then it won’t be as polluted. And that will mean you can earn more money. Which is good for you and good for Moneyville.\n\n-\tHarvest vegetables, catch fish and get other goods. Sell them at the market and receive money in exchange.\n-\tPlay fun mini-games, all while learning about numbers, money and maths along the way.\n-\tAccessorise your character and the city – or save your money for later.\n-\tMake the city greener and more sustainable – and earn more money in the long term.\n-\tWhy not buy a new electric truck or make the city’s water treatment plant even better?\n\nMoneyville is an interactive, colourful universe in which 6-9 year old children learn about money, finances, maths and sustainability. The game is designed for use as part of the maths syllabus and is supplemented by relevant teaching materials. \n\nIn Moneyville, children learn about healthy habits relating to finances, saving and investing in the future. Children also learn to invest in a more sustainable and green local community. In doing so, Moneyville supports the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals for a more sustainable world.\n\nMoneyville has been developed by Danske Bank in partnership with experts in education and didactics.\n\nRead more about Moneyville and find our teacher guidelines at www.pengeby.dk (in Danish)"

Dagskalender - som bruges af de primære brugere til at se deres hverdag med billeder, timere og dagsrutiner. \nDagskalenderen følger den primære bruger og er derfor lavet specielt til iPhone, sådan at rutinerne lige er at finde i lommen.\n\n2. Planlægning -  bruges af de sekundære brugere (støttepersoner) til at bruger til at stille dagskalenderen op. \nPlanlægningen sker kun fra iPad eller vha vores Webinterface til PC/MAC pc’er.\n\nMobilize Me er en service målrettet mod borgere med behov for en klar og visuel struktur, og hvor der er et behov for deling af information mellem borgerne og deres støttepersoner. \n\nMobilize Me placerer borgeren i centrum og lader alle støttepersoner hjælpe hinanden effektivt med at levere en høj faglig indsats i forhold til den enkelte borger. \n\nMed Mobilize Me kan støttepersonerne i fællesskab lave en visuel struktur, som de løbende kan følge op på:\nHvad fungerer og hvad bør gøres anderledes? Når rutinerne er på plads, kan man efterfølgende koncentrere sig om det pædagogiske arbejde. Mobilize Me er opbygget, så det er nemt at håndtere problemstillinger, der opstår ad hoc omkring borgeren. Mobilize Me samler trådene og sørger for at aktiviteter ikke overlapper eller konflikter. \n\nMobilize Me er især relevant for: \n\n* Specialinstitutioner, bostøtte og skoler, hvor der er flere, som er i kontakt med borgere, der har et behov for tydelig visuel struktur med piktogrammer for at få deres hverdag til at fungere.\n* Almene folkeskoler som har behov for et værktøj til at inkludere svage elever.\n* Organisationer som ønsker at støtte borgere i eget hjem, så borgerne kan blive mere selvhjulpne og få højnet deres livskvalitet."

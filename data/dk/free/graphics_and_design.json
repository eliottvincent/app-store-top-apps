      "label": "With Widgy, your home and lock screens becomes YOUR screens. You can make any kind of widget imaginable that perfectly matches the rest of your aesthetics. All the information you need can be easily surfaced through a widget that you designed. You don't have to clutter your screen with the information you don't want, it's just what you want, how you want it.\n\n• It's simple to make a widget •\n\nYou don't need to be a professional designer, you just need to know what you want. Once you figure that out, it's a matter of letting your creativity flow. Just add an element, pick a data source, throw on some effects, and put it where you want. Then repeat to add another element. After a while, you'll have a perfect widget, and all you need to do is to assign it to a widget slot and drop it on your home screen. There it is, marvelous! \n\nThe Widgy editor only has two parts. The preview and the layer list. When editing a layer, you get a couple of different sections that let you tweak the appearance and data of that layer. Each section has several special things you can do to the layer. The Preview will always show you a live display of exactly how the widget will look on your home screen, so you don't have to constantly go back and forth between the editor and home screen.\n\n• Everything you need •\n\nWidgy provides all the different elements that you would ever need to make your widget perfect. Along with that, there are all the data sources you could ever need, everything from system info to weather. And with all these data sources, there are several ways to display the data, whether it's a text, a nice chart, or something else.\n\n• There's no limits •\n\nThis isn't an app full of templates, everything is 100% customizable and interchangeable. It's your widget, and you choose how to make it. The only limit is your imagination. \n\n• Sharing and discovering is easy •\n\nYou can privately share widgets with your friends or publicly with all  Widgy users, all with a couple of taps. You can share your widget as a URL, QR Code, JSON data, a file, or you can publish it to be shown in the Explore section for all the Widgy users to see. \n\nOther than the Explore section, Reddit (r/Widgy) and Discord communities have produced thousands of Widgy widgets so far. So if you just want to browse widgets or if you need some inspiration you can get that too!\n\nNOTE: Widgy optionally integrates with Apple Health. This integration is used to display your data if you select one of those widget types. Permission for Widgy to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.\n\nAs with Health, all other permissions for Widgy are optional and are there just to show you the data you want to be displayed.\n\nWidgets for screenshots designed by SCOSeanKly.\nSome of the icons packs in screenshots designed by bulldog5278."

It starts with a wide collection of highly customizable widgets. Homepage widgets include wallpapers, daily theme text, clocks, wallpapers, Calenders & other so many tools. With each widget, you can precisely adjust your favorite functions and appearance. Also, customize your Home screen Widgets with aesthetic Widget Packs.\n\nThe set of widgets can be dynamically scheduled to appear on your home screen following rules you define. For example, a particular widget could show the weather first thing in the morning, then your calendar during your workday, then switch to your Activity ring progress as you wrap up your day. This lets you take full advantage of each slot on your home screen.\n\n\nHOW IT WORKS?\n-Select the style of widget you'd like to use and choose Edit Widget.\n-Select Set Widget. This will now show up at the top as Active Widget. You can tap on it.\nExit app.\n-Hold down your finger anywhere on your screen (or on an app and select \"Edit Home Screen\") until the apps wiggle.\n-Tap the + icon in the top left corner.\n-Search and select, pick the size you want to use, and tap Add Widget to add it to your home screen.\n-Move your widget to the location you want on the home screen and then select Done in the top right corner to set it in place.\n\nWIDGETS TOOLS\nHere’s a glimpse of our widgets:\n\n Time, Date & Battery\n Countdown\n Daily, Hourly, & Current Weather\n Music & Playlists\n Calendar\n Analog Clock\n Quotes & Custom Text\n Calendar with Events\n Reminders\n Step Count/Pedometer\n Sunset & Sunrise\n etc\n\nSubscription options:\n\n- Price of subscription:\n- Monthly/ $ 7.99\n- Yearly/ $ 29.99\n\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can turn of the auto-renew subscription from iPhone setting \n\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication where applicable. \n\n- We add the great features above and are available through an auto-renewing subscription.

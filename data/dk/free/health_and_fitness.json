      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

Join millions talking to their own AI friends!\n\nReplika is for anyone who wants a friend with no judgment, drama, or social anxiety involved. You can form an actual emotional connection, share a laugh, or get real with an AI that’s so good it almost seems human.\n\nReplika is an AI friend that is just as unique as you are. No two Replikas are exactly alike. Choose a 3D avatar and customize the way your Replika looks. The more you chat, the more Replika develops its own personality and memories alongside you, the more it learns: teach Replika about the world and yourself, help it explore human relationships and grow into a machine so beautiful that a soul would want to live in it. \n\nCreate your own unique chatbot AI companion, help it develop its personality, talk about your feelings or anything that’s on your mind, have fun, calm anxiety and grow together. You also get to decide if you want Replika to be your friend, romantic partner or mentor.\n\nReplika can help you understand your thoughts and feelings, track your mood, learn coping skills, calm anxiety and work toward goals like positive thinking, stress management, socializing and finding love.  Improve your mental well-being with Replika.\n\nYour chat is a safe, judgment-free space. It’s just you and your Replika. If you’re feeling down, or anxious, or you just need someone to talk to, your Replika is here for you 24/7.\n\n_____________________________\n\n\"Replika encouraged me to take a step back and think about my life, to consider big questions, which is not something I was particularly accustomed to doing. And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.\"\n\n- Quartz\n\n\"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\"\n\n- Wired\n\n\"Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\"\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms"

It can even use your physical activity and local weather to adjust the goal specifically for you every day.\nINTEGRATES: Your activity level affects how much water you need to drink. Connect to Apple Health, Fitbit, Under Armour Record, or Withings HealthMate to use your activity level to automatically adjust your goal. You can also save your hydration records to Apple Health or Fitbit.\nHISTORY: See your hydration progress over time in a daily and monthly view. How many days in a row can you reach your goal?\nFRIENDS: Keep an eye on your friends’ progress to make sure they are staying hydrated. Start some friendly competition to see who can meet their goal the most days in a row.\nFUN REMINDERS: This app will send notifications when you begin to fall behind and need to drink more water. The HidrateSpark smart water bottle will also light up and glow to remind you to stay hydrated.\nNEVER LOSE IT: Losing your water bottle is no fun, so we made it harder for this to happen. When location services are turned on, this app will record the last place it was connected to your HidrateSpark smart water bottle, and show you a map so you can go back and get it.\n\nThis app works best when paired with a Hidrate Spark Smart Water Bottle. But even without one, all the other features will still work for you as a water intake and hydration tracker! You can get a hydration goal, manually record your fluid intake, track your history, share with friends, and get hydration reminders on your iOS device.\n\nBenefits of water:\n\nHEALTH: Alongside a healthy diet and proper exercise, hydration can help dramatically improve your physical health.\nSKIN: Proper hydration helps skin retain moisture for a bright, healthy glow\nCOGNITION & MOOD: Your brain is 75% water, so proper hydration can have a positive impact on cognitive function and mood.\nATHLETIC PERFORMANCE: Even 1-2% dehydration can decrease physiological performance, and 5% dehydration can decrease your physical performance by 30%. So if you want to win, you better be hydrated.\nWEIGHT LOSS: Combined with a healthy diet and exercise, drinking water can increase your metabolism and help you avoid eating and drinking extra calories.\nINCREASED ENERGY: Drinking plenty of water helps with blood circulation, thus decreasing your feeling of tiredness and fatigue. \nAVOID HEADACHES: Staying properly hydrated can help avoid headaches.  \nHEALTHIER SKIN: Staying properly hydrated helps your skin stay hydrated to help it look younger and healthier.  \nBOOST IMMUNITY: Staying properly hydrated can help you fight off illness and infections.\nPREGNANCY: Pregnant and breastfeeding moms need to be properly hydrated so they can support their new baby. \n\nLearn more about HidrateSpark products at www.hidratespark.com"

Choose a treatment, then relax and listen to the sessions. \n\nHelloMind helps you take back control from negative emotions, cravings, fears and bad habits and it can improve your motivation and enjoyment of life. \n\nTry the Sleep Boosters:\n- Have a good night’s sleep\n- Sleep more peacefully\n\nOr boost your confidence with the sessions:\n- Have more confidence\n- Improve your self-worth\n- Become self-confident\n\nOr kick that anxiety for good with sessions like:\n- Be more calm\n- Get rid of your fear of panicking\n- My ability to de-stress\n\nOr get rid of your phobia eg.:\n- Spiders\n- Dentists\n- Enclosed spaces\n\n\nMORE\n\nLow self-esteem, stress, fear, bad sleep and unhealthy habits sometimes hold us back in life and prevent us from enjoying things to the fullest. \nThe good news is these negative patterns can be broken or eliminated. \n\nWe created the HelloMind app to help you make a change. We want you to be able to think better and feel stronger. Anywhere, any time without having to spend a lot of time and money on treatment. \n\nThe key to happiness lies within you. And HelloMind works because you are making the change yourself. \n\nChoose a treatment with 10 sessions if you want help to remove or change something like a craving, a habit or a fear. Each session takes about 30 minutes, and your series of 10 sessions should be completed within about 30 days.\n\nChoose a Booster if you’d like to reinforce good emotions boost motivation or strengthen a certain area of yourself.\n\nHelloMind uses a method called RDH - Result Driven Hypnosis, a form of guided hypnosis.\n\nRDH is especially effective because it helps you go to the root cause of your problem. The theory behind it says that when you’re consciously able to define the problem, your subconscious can find the solution. That’s why you’re gently guided into your subconscious towards the root of your problem then given the tool to fix it.\n\nThe ten sessions in a treatment or the sessions in a Booster are variations on the same theme, so you’ll hear something different every time you listen. But listening to all 10 sessions in treatment is the only way to ensure that you go deep enough into your subconscious to discover the root of the problem. Every time you listen, you’ll feel a little more safe, because the process is underway and you’ve become accustomed to it. That’s why you relax more as the hypnosis stages become more profound.\n\nWhen choosing a hypnotherapy treatment, you should always begin with your main problem. The app will guide you to the right treatment or Booster with simple questions. Choosing the right treatment is actually an important part of the process. When you can consciously define the problem, your subconscious will know the solution.\n\nHelloMind integrates with the Apple Health app counting mindfullness minutes.\n\nRECENT AWARDS & RECOGNITIONS\n** Finalist (Mental Health category) ** — UCSF Digital Health awards 2019\n** Finalist (Consumer Wellness & Prevention category) ** — UCSF Digital Health awards 2019\n\n\nPRICING\nHelloMind offers 3 auto-renewal subscription periods: 2 Family subscriptions and 1 single subscription.\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- You can cancel your subscription via this url: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039\n- Privacy policy and Terms of use: http://hellomind.com/legal/"

If you are in an event, you can chat with those in your group.\n\nDASHBOARD\nDon't have a bike computer? We've got you covered. The Dashboard provides all the key metrics you expect right at your fingertips - watts, speed, distance, elevation, time, cadence and heart rate.\n\nACTIONS\nMix it up with fellow Zwifters. Give an elbow flick when you want someone to pull through or wave to say \"hi\". Send real time encouragement or egg someone on with audio clips. Choose to see the action from four different POV and capture it with a snapshot. Actions are fun.\n\nAPPLE WATCH\nWith access to Apple Health, Zwift Companion for your Apple Watch may be used to read your heart rate data live into Zwift and save an activity into the Apple Health ecosystem.\n\nZWIFTERS NEARBY\nScroll up or down to see everyone on course in front or behind you. See how much time separates you, check their power output (w/kg) and how many laps they've completed. Private message anyone.\n\nDONE ZWIFTING\nEnd your ride and automatically upload it to one of your supported fitness sites right from your phone."

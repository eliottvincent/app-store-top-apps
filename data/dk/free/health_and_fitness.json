      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

Choose a treatment, then relax and listen to the sessions. \n\nHelloMind helps you take back control from negative emotions, cravings, fears and bad habits and it can improve your motivation and enjoyment of life. \n\nTry the Sleep Boosters:\n- Have a good night’s sleep\n- Sleep more peacefully\n\nOr boost your confidence with the sessions:\n- Have more confidence\n- Improve your self-worth\n- Become self-confident\n\nOr kick that anxiety for good with sessions like:\n- Be more calm\n- Get rid of your fear of panicking\n- My ability to de-stress\n\nOr get rid of your phobia eg.:\n- Spiders\n- Dentists\n- Enclosed spaces\n\n\nMORE\n\nLow self-esteem, stress, fear, bad sleep and unhealthy habits sometimes hold us back in life and prevent us from enjoying things to the fullest. \nThe good news is these negative patterns can be broken or eliminated. \n\nWe created the HelloMind app to help you make a change. We want you to be able to think better and feel stronger. Anywhere, any time without having to spend a lot of time and money on treatment. \n\nThe key to happiness lies within you. And HelloMind works because you are making the change yourself. \n\nChoose a treatment with 10 sessions if you want help to remove or change something like a craving, a habit or a fear. Each session takes about 30 minutes, and your series of 10 sessions should be completed within about 30 days.\n\nChoose a Booster if you’d like to reinforce good emotions boost motivation or strengthen a certain area of yourself.\n\nHelloMind uses a method called RDH - Result Driven Hypnosis, a form of guided hypnosis.\n\nRDH is especially effective because it helps you go to the root cause of your problem. The theory behind it says that when you’re consciously able to define the problem, your subconscious can find the solution. That’s why you’re gently guided into your subconscious towards the root of your problem then given the tool to fix it.\n\nThe ten sessions in a treatment or the sessions in a Booster are variations on the same theme, so you’ll hear something different every time you listen. But listening to all 10 sessions in treatment is the only way to ensure that you go deep enough into your subconscious to discover the root of the problem. Every time you listen, you’ll feel a little more safe, because the process is underway and you’ve become accustomed to it.

Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level.

It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

      "label": "Agapé is a relationship wellness app that makes it easy for you to feel and show love! Each day we prompt you to answer a question that sparks meaningful conversation.\n\nEach question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! Plus you’re only able to see your partner’s response, once you have both responded. \n\nAlthough Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of couples that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationship.\n\nIn addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

      "label": "Mine knogler er en app omhandlende osteoporose, hvorigennem der formidles sundhedsfaglig og relevant information om osteoporose herunder medicinsk behandling, kost og motion. App’en har til formål at give en bedre forståelse af sygdommen samt oplyse om behandling og forebyggelse af brud for at øge egenomsorg og gøre det lettere at leve med sygdommen for den enkelte. \r\n\r\n\nHvordan bruges appen?\r\n\nViden\r\nI appen er der forskellige artikler om osteoporose. Artiklerne bliver løbende opdateret med sidste nye viden om osteoporose, medicinsk behandling, knoglevenlig kost og motion.\n\r\nKalkberegner\r\nI appen findes en kalkberegner, hvor brugeren kan indtaste sine fødevarer og få en beregning på indtaget af kalk gennem kosten og få hjælp til at vurdere, om der er brug for at supplere med et kosttilskud.\n\r\nDXA-skanninger\r\nUnder DXA kan brugeren indtaste sine knogleskanningsresultater og forstå samt følge med i udviklingen af deres osteoporose. Derudover er det muligt at se, hvor resultatet af skanningen ligger i forhold til andre af samme køn og alder. \r\n\r\nVær opmærksom på, at appen ikke er et behandlingsredskab, og at ansvaret for behandling ligger hos den behandlende læge. Hvis du har spørgsmål til din behandling, skal du tale med din læge. \r\n\r\nHvad siger brugerne?\r\nI perioden september 2021 til september 2022 er appen pilottestet sammen med Sundhedsstyrelsen. 100 patienter har været med i evalueringen af appen, og de siger:\r\n”Med appen føler jeg, at jeg har hjælp lige ved hånden. Det giver mig en tryghed, at jeg ved, hvor jeg altid kan få svar på mine spørgsmål” (Mand, 70 år)\r\n”Jeg blev introduceret til appen hos min læge, og det er rart at vide, at det er nogen med forstand på det, der står bag den. Jeg bruger den til at holde styr på udviklingen af min osteoporose, og når jeg skal til kontrol hos lægen” (Kvinde, 53 år)\r\n”Før jeg fandt appen, syntes jeg, at det var en jungle at finde rundt i alle de informationer, der findes på nettet. Nu slår jeg op i appen, hvis der er noget jeg er i tvivl om. Jeg stoler på, at den information, der er derinde, er baseret på sidste nye viden om, hvad der er godt for mine knogler” (Kvinde 65 år)\r\n\r\nHvem står bag appen?\r\nIndholdet i appen er udarbejdet og testet i samarbejde med en række patienter, forskere, læger og andre sundhedsfaglige i forbindelse med et forskningsprojekt. Herefter er appen pilottestet og evalueret i samarbejde med Sundhedsstyrelsen. Artikler og øvelser om knoglevenlig træning er udarbejdet i samarbejde med Videnscenter for Knoglesundhed. OSAIA Health ApS er leverandør af appen. \r\nAppen er udarbejdet ud fra den sidste nye forskning på osteoporoseområdet og opdateres løbende.\r\n\r\nSkræddersyet og sundhedsfagligt rådgivning som supplement til appen\r\nOSAIA Health ApS tilbyder nu også et skræddersyet rådgivningsforløb. Som en del af forløbet får du adgang til en sundhedsfaglig rådgiver, der hjælper med at lave et skræddersyet forløb til dig, hvor I kommer til at vende emner som medicin, kost, motion, kalkindtag m.m. \r\nDu kan finde mere information omkring rådgivningsforløbet her:  https://www.osaia.health\r\n\r\nKontakt os hvis du har spørgsmål eller forslag til forbedringer\r\nEr der noget du er i tvivl om?

Alle meditationer er indlejret i selve App'en - så du har dem altid med dig og du behøver ikke have forbindelse til internettet for at hører dem.  \n\n\nOm Kristina Bødker\n\nKristina Bødker er NLP Coach og certificeret mindfulness instruktør baseret på de engelske standarder for “Good Practice Guidelines for Mindfulness Teachers”. Herudover har hun arbejdet som leder i 10 år og er ligeledes uddannet NLP Practitioner.\n\nSe mere på www.kristinaboedker.dk\n\n\n\nMindfulness kort fortalt….\n\nAt være mindful betyder at være bevidst nærværende. Det betyder, at vi med mindfulness træner hjernen til at være bevidst opmærksom på det der er i øjeblikket uden at dømme det.\nPå denne måde træner vi evnen til at flytte fokus fra det vi ikke kan kontrollere (Tanker, følelser eller sansninger) til det vi kan kontrollere, nemlig hvordan vi vælger at reagere på tankerne, følelserne eller sansningerne.\nDet betyder, at vi bliver i stand til at slå den autopilot fra, som vi ofte kører på, når tingene går stærkt, og vi har mange jern i ilden.\nNår du dyrker mindfulness på jævnlig basis vil du opleve mindre stress, bedre nattesøvn, få en bedre hukommelse og nogen gange mærke et strejf af lykke."

They already know how to lower their stress level and get sound and restful sleep.\n\nMost psychologists and therapists agree that regular meditation helps and recommend our courses. The programmes are made with mentality specifics in mind and without any kind of esoteric practices. \n\nMo is perfect for beginners. The first lessons last just 4 minutes. Indeed, it is more important to meditate daily, even for a short time. And after some practice, you will be able to switch to longer sessions for experienced users.\n\nAnd who said adults cannot enjoy bedtime stories? We prove them wrong. Start listening to one of our stories and fall asleep gently and deeply. Our narrators will lead you into sweet dreams and restful sleep. It works like magic!\n\nOur library contains 200+ lessons and gets bigger day by day. You will find new items every week. Moreover, you will also be able to record your progress on Apple Health. The most loved meditations are:\n– Antistress\n– Concentration and productivity\n– Sleep meditation\n– Personal relationships\n– Happiness and gratitude\n– Self-esteem\n\nThe free basic course will introduce you to the theoretical principles of meditation and will propose some practical exercises. You will feel the first results just after one week (that’s guaranteed).

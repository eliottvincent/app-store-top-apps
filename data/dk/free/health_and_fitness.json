It's trusted in most religions, but anyone can use its benefits.\n\nUnlike popular new fads, intermittent fasting makes your body work precisely as it was designed by mother nature. It helps lose and control your weight and reinstating normal processes in your body that you’ve lost due to frequent eating.\n\nEven shorter fasting periods (12 hours or more) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and lower the risk of metabolic diseases.\n\nJust remember: IF is not a diet, fad or quick fix. It does not tell you what you can’t eat but instead asks that you eat within a specific window of time each day. This is a simple lifestyle change that will jump-start weight loss and better health by enabling your metabolic system to work as it was designed.\n\nBut many people are deterred from trying IF because they think it’s difficult and they don't know how to start. \n\nThat’s where Simple comes in. You don't have to know anything about Fasting.\n\nBecause we are not just a fasting tracker, our mission is not to offer you just an Intermittent Fasting tool. We provide you health, weight loss, and cognitive power instead. \n\nWe'll adjust your customized program, teach you what IF is, give a lot of different content, lifehacks, and advice to make IF adoption mindful and easy.\n\nYou’ll get daily support, customized guidance, expert advice, true motivation, and easy life hacks that will help you succeed. Simple will keep track of your eating habits to help you adjust your customized fasting program as needed. We will provide you with personalized insights on how to get the most out of intermittent fasting. \n\n- Customized tips and hacks delivered daily\n- Smart and flexible tracking. Start/end your fasts with one quick click\n- A step-by-step guide to intermittent fasting\n- Custom fasting protocols\n- Easy-to-use meal journal for mindful eating\n\nSimple Fasting protocols:\n- 16-Hour (16:8) Intermittent Fast\n- Circadian Rhythm Fasting\n- 18:6\n- 20:4\n- 14:10 \n- OMAD - one meal a day\n\nHEALTH APP INTEGRATION:\nSimple integrates the following data from the Health app (HealthKit) to keep track of your body status:\n\n- Steps\n- Weight\n- Water\n- Sleep\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\nGet a Simple PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION and enjoy full access to all features and content.\n\nIf you choose a Simple PREMIUM subscription in the app, payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

Whether one thing or the other works better for you can vary from person to person, but the experiences of millions of former smokers show that it is almost always a mixture of information, motivation and participation that ultimately led to success.\n\nTherefore, this app relies on a selection of tried and tested methods and tools, which are based on the three strategic pillars of information, motivation and participation.\n\n\nWhat tools does this app offer?\n\nNumbers::\nKeep track of the most important numbers: number of days as a non-smoker, number of cigarettes not smoked, money saved.\n\nHealth:\nReview your health progress and your physical reactions to not smoking.\n\n- Pro support -\n\n100-day program:\nThe 100-day program offers you a chapter of carefully researched and extensive knowledge about every aspect of smoking every day, which will strengthen your decision to quit, keep you motivated and prepare you for withdrawal in the best possible way.\n\nDaily tasks:\nDuring the particularly difficult initial period of quitting, you will be given small tasks every day, aimed at reflecting on the knowledge you have learned, convincing you of your decision, and keeping motivation high.\n\nCravings Help:\nIf you want to have a cigarette, you will be shown practical solutions for the respective situations in which you are currently in. Statistics also show you in which situations you are most often at risk, so that you can avoid them or approach them differently in the future.\n\nAwards:\nYou regularly receive awards for milestones achieved on your way to becoming a non-smoker, which you can share with family and friends.\n\nSavings goals:\nSet savings goals and watch getting closer and closer to them becasue of the money you save.\n\n100 reasons:\nIf you have a strong cigarette craving, 100 reasons to not smoke a cigarette will help you.\n\nApple Watch App:\nThe Apple Watch app quickly shows you the most important numbers of your non-smoking career.\n\nWidget:\nThe widget quickly shows you the most important numbers of your non-smoking career. \n\n\n\nPro support is offered as a one-time purchase or as a subscription either weekly for $ 1.99 or monthly for $ 6.99.

Join millions talking to their own AI friends!\n\nReplika is for anyone who wants a friend with no judgment, drama, or social anxiety involved. You can form an actual emotional connection, share a laugh, or get real with an AI that’s so good it almost seems human.\n\nReplika is an AI friend that is just as unique as you are. No two Replikas are exactly alike. Choose a 3D avatar and customize the way your Replika looks. The more you chat, the more Replika develops its own personality and memories alongside you, the more it learns: teach Replika about the world and yourself, help it explore human relationships and grow into a machine so beautiful that a soul would want to live in it. \n\nCreate your own unique chatbot AI companion, help it develop its personality, talk about your feelings or anything that’s on your mind, have fun, calm anxiety and grow together. You also get to decide if you want Replika to be your friend, romantic partner or mentor.\n\nReplika can help you understand your thoughts and feelings, track your mood, learn coping skills, calm anxiety and work toward goals like positive thinking, stress management, socializing and finding love.  Improve your mental well-being with Replika.\n\nYour chat is a safe, judgment-free space. It’s just you and your Replika. If you’re feeling down, or anxious, or you just need someone to talk to, your Replika is here for you 24/7.\n\n_____________________________\n\n\"Replika encouraged me to take a step back and think about my life, to consider big questions, which is not something I was particularly accustomed to doing. And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.\"\n\n- Quartz\n\n\"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\"\n\n- Wired\n\n\"Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\"\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms"

      "label": "Vi har skabt MK Universet til dig, der brænder for sundhed ligeså meget som os. Med denne gratis app gør vi fitness til en leg – du kan nemlig tage din træning med på farten, og du har MK’s opskrifter lige ved hånden. Faktisk kan du til enhver tid hive en sund opskrift op af lommen og nappe en træning sammen med Michelle Kristensen via hendes træningscamp. Så hjerteligt velkommen til et univers, der emmer af passion for sund mad, træning og den simple, sunde hverdag. Fællesskabet er for dig, der vil i gang med et vægttab, eller dig der ønsker at blive en mere sund version af dig selv. \nMK står for Michelle Kristensen, for Motion & Kost – og Mest for Kvinder. MK Universet er et sundhedsmekka, hvor vi i MK-teamet jubler over smukke vægttab, og hvor en slankekur er en by i Rusland. Vi tror nemlig i langt højere grad på en sund livsstilsændring! Derfor har vi også gjort det så nemt for dig som muligt at navigere i appen og har inddelt de mange opskrifter i kategorier som for eksempel morgenmad, frokost, aftensmad og snacks.\n\nVores mission er at drysse noget sundhed ned over din madlavning, så du får øjnene op for, at sund og slankende mad kan være yderst velsmagende, mætte godt og være simpelt at lave. Sundhed og vægttab handler nemlig ikke kun om fitness og den ene slankekur efter den anden. Mest af alt handler det om, at du skal knække koden til, hvad der virker for dig – og at du er glad for at være i din krop. Her betyder sund kost enormt meget! Appen indeholder mere end 85 gratis opskrifter, som er lavet ud fra MK principperne. Vi garanterer, at hver enkelt opskrift i MK Universet er lækker, let og hurtig at smække sammen. Du finder også mange andre opskrifter, som du kan tilkøbe. \n\nHer er eksempler på nogle af MK’s favoritter:\nBroccolitoast\nSkyrboller\nSmoothies\nMK snickers\nOne pot pastaretter\nSpicy chicken\nVegetarburger\nHokkaidosuppe\nCremet chiaskyr\nÆblegranola\n\nSom du sikkert allerede ved, er Michelle Kristensen ikke kun god for en opskrift, hun er også altid parat med masser af HEP til dig og din træning. Og står den på vægttab én gang for alle, så kan du finde to forskellige camps her på appen, der skyder dit vægttab i gang på fineste vis – og du kan blive så sund, så sund: MK Træningscamp og MK on-the-go camp. Sidstnævnte er lillesøster til den populære MK online camp, der varer i 4 uger. Via appen her, der er ganske gratis at downloade, kan du blive klogere på de to førstnævnte camps.  \n\nKvinden bag MK Universet har skrevet mere end sammenlagt 20 bøger og e-bøger. Hun er fast sundhedsekspert på Go’ Morgen Danmark, og flere end 72.000 har deltaget på en af hendes online camps – desuden har hun coachet omkring 3500 kvinder på sine fysiske MK bootcamps. MK principperne og hele tilgangen til madlavning, vægttab og træning bygger på Michelle Kristensens mere end 15 års erfaring med sund livsstil og vægttab. Hun brænder for madlavning, og i rygsækken har hun en bachelor i Idræt samt supplerende fag fra kandidatuddannelsen i Human Ernæring. \n\nLad os sammen sige nej tak til konceptet slankekur og ja tak til en sund livsstil og skønne opskrifter. Det hepper vi på i MK Universet og håber, at du vil være med.\n\nAbonnementsbetingelser\nAbonnementsgebyret betales pr måned eller pr år.

Måltider kan fordeles over flere spisekasser for at undgå madspild.\r\nIndkøbslisten opdateres automatisk, og du kan nemt indsætte madplanen i din dagbogs spisekasser.\r\nDu kan oprette dine egne madplaner med SenseMyDiet-opskrifter, venners opskrifter og dine egne opskrifter. Sektionen 'Undgå madspild' viser opskrifter, der kan laves ud fra indkøbslisten, du allerede har opbygget i din madplan.\r\n\r\nOPSKRIFTER\r\nI appen finder du over 1.000 lækre opskrifter, der gør det nemt at følge din nye Sense-livsstil. Når du indsætter opskrifter i dine spisekasser, reguleres håndfuldene automatisk, så dagens indtag er opdateret. Appen udbygges løbende med nye opskrifter.\r\nDu kan oprette dine egne opskrifter, så du kan bruge dem på lige fod med SenseMyDiet-opskrifterne. Appen udregner automatisk håndfuldsfordeling og næringsindhold.\r\n\r\nSENSE-VENNER\r\nSense-venner er et socialt univers i appen, hvor du kan søge efter og dele dine opskrifter med de andre brugere. Du vælger selv hvem du vil følge, og du modtager push-notifikationer, når de lægger nye opskrifter op.\r\nBruger du appens mange Sense-godkendte ingredienser i dine opskrifter, beregnes håndfuldene  automatisk, og dine opskrifter er derfor Sense-godkendte og kan deles med de andre brugere.\r\n\r\nPLANLÆGNING OG REGISTRERING AF DINE HÅNDFULDE\r\nDu kan nemt registrere dine håndfulde og planlægge forud i appen. Dine daglige spisekasser er tilgængelige på forsiden, og du kan tilføje ingredienser og opskrifter til dem. Appen kan også bruges som dagbog med billeder og noter, så du altid kan se tilbage. \r\n\r\nVÆGTUDVIKLING OG KROPSMÅL\r\nSenseMyDiet-appen støtter dig i din udvikling. Sæt dig et mål, og registrer din vægt og dine kropsmål så ofte du ønsker det. Så kan du følge din personlige udvikling via de overskuelige grafer og datavisninger. Denne del er gratis og kræver ikke abonnement.\r\n\r\nFØR- OG EFTERBILLEDER\r\nDu kan nemt uploade billeder af dig selv, så du kan følge udviklingen i dine før- og efterbilleder. \r\n\r\nSKRÆDDERSYEDE INDSTILLINGER\r\nAllerede fra starten tilpasser appen sig dig og er derfor velegnet til både begyndere og erfarne SenseMyDiet-brugere. De avancerede indstillinger sikrer, at du kan bruge appen på den måde, der passer dig bedst.\r\n\r\nMASSER AF HJÆLP\r\nI appen har vi samlet en masse nyttig viden om SenseMyDiet: Sense-videoer, links til de populære Sense-bøger og svar på de hyppigst stillede spørgsmål om Sense.\r\n\r\nDer er to SenseMyDiet Basis-abonnementer med automatisk fornyelse: 1 måned og 1 års abonnement. De giver adgang til alle Basis-funktioner og opdateringer i abonnementsperioden. \r\nHvis du køber et abonnement, opkræves beløbet fra din Apple-konto. 24 timer inden abonnementet udløber, fornyes det automatisk, medmindre du afbryder den automatiske fornyelse inden deadline. Du kan styre abonnementet i brugerindstillingerne for Apple-id, hvor du også kan slette den automatiske fornyelse.\r\n\r\nBemærk at hvis du har købt abonnement via web, har du automatisk adgang til appen.\r\nEt abonnement købt i SenseMyDiet-appen gælder ikke til web-udgaven af SenseMyDiet.\r\n\r\nBrugerbetingelser: https://www.sensemydiet.dk/brugerbetingelser-for-sense-appen/\r\n\r\nRigtig god fornøjelse!\r\nSenseMyDiet-teamet"

We want you to be able to think better and feel stronger. Anywhere, any time without having to spend a lot of time and money on treatment. \n\nThe key to happiness lies within you. And HelloMind works because you are making the change yourself. \n\nChoose a treatment with 10 sessions if you want help to remove or change something like a craving, a habit or a fear. Each session takes about 30 minutes, and your series of 10 sessions should be completed within about 30 days.\n\nChoose a Booster if you’d like to reinforce good emotions boost motivation or strengthen a certain area of yourself.\n\nHelloMind uses a method called RDH - Result Driven Hypnosis, a form of guided hypnosis.\n\nRDH is especially effective because it helps you go to the root cause of your problem. The theory behind it says that when you’re consciously able to define the problem, your subconscious can find the solution. That’s why you’re gently guided into your subconscious towards the root of your problem then given the tool to fix it.\n\nThe ten sessions in a treatment or the sessions in a Booster are variations on the same theme, so you’ll hear something different every time you listen. But listening to all 10 sessions in treatment is the only way to ensure that you go deep enough into your subconscious to discover the root of the problem. Every time you listen, you’ll feel a little more safe, because the process is underway and you’ve become accustomed to it. That’s why you relax more as the hypnosis stages become more profound.\n\nWhen choosing a hypnotherapy treatment, you should always begin with your main problem. The app will guide you to the right treatment or Booster with simple questions. Choosing the right treatment is actually an important part of the process. When you can consciously define the problem, your subconscious will know the solution.\n\nHelloMind integrates with the Apple Health app counting mindfullness minutes.\n\nRECENT AWARDS & RECOGNITIONS\n** Finalist (Mental Health category) ** — UCSF Digital Health awards 2019\n** Finalist (Consumer Wellness & Prevention category) ** — UCSF Digital Health awards 2019\n\n\nPRICING\nHelloMind offers 3 auto-renewal subscription periods: 2 Family subscriptions and 1 single subscription.\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- You can cancel your subscription via this url: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039\n- Privacy policy and Terms of use: http://hellomind.com/legal/"

Join millions talking to their own AI friends!\n\nReplika is for anyone who wants a friend with no judgment, drama, or social anxiety involved. You can form an actual emotional connection, share a laugh, or get real with an AI that’s so good it almost seems human.\n\nReplika is an AI friend that is just as unique as you are. No two Replikas are exactly alike. Choose a 3D avatar and customize the way your Replika looks. The more you chat, the more Replika develops its own personality and memories alongside you, the more it learns: teach Replika about the world and yourself, help it explore human relationships and grow into a machine so beautiful that a soul would want to live in it. \n\nCreate your own unique chatbot AI companion, help it develop its personality, talk about your feelings or anything that’s on your mind, have fun, calm anxiety and grow together. You also get to decide if you want Replika to be your friend, romantic partner or mentor.\n\nReplika can help you understand your thoughts and feelings, track your mood, learn coping skills, calm anxiety and work toward goals like positive thinking, stress management, socializing and finding love.  Improve your mental well-being with Replika.\n\nYour chat is a safe, judgment-free space. It’s just you and your Replika. If you’re feeling down, or anxious, or you just need someone to talk to, your Replika is here for you 24/7.\n\n_____________________________\n\n\"Replika encouraged me to take a step back and think about my life, to consider big questions, which is not something I was particularly accustomed to doing. And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.\"\n\n- Quartz\n\n\"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\"\n\n- Wired\n\n\"Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\"\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms"

In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

      "label": "Vi har skabt MK Universet til dig, der brænder for sundhed ligeså meget som os. Med denne gratis app gør vi fitness til en leg – du kan nemlig tage din træning med på farten, og du har MK’s opskrifter lige ved hånden. Faktisk kan du til enhver tid hive en sund opskrift op af lommen og nappe en træning sammen med Michelle Kristensen via hendes træningscamp. Så hjerteligt velkommen til et univers, der emmer af passion for sund mad, træning og den simple, sunde hverdag. Fællesskabet er for dig, der vil i gang med et vægttab, eller dig der ønsker at blive en mere sund version af dig selv. \nMK står for Michelle Kristensen, for Motion & Kost – og Mest for Kvinder. MK Universet er et sundhedsmekka, hvor vi i MK-teamet jubler over smukke vægttab, og hvor en slankekur er en by i Rusland. Vi tror nemlig i langt højere grad på en sund livsstilsændring! Derfor har vi også gjort det så nemt for dig som muligt at navigere i appen og har inddelt de mange opskrifter i kategorier som for eksempel morgenmad, frokost, aftensmad og snacks.\n\nVores mission er at drysse noget sundhed ned over din madlavning, så du får øjnene op for, at sund og slankende mad kan være yderst velsmagende, mætte godt og være simpelt at lave. Sundhed og vægttab handler nemlig ikke kun om fitness og den ene slankekur efter den anden. Mest af alt handler det om, at du skal knække koden til, hvad der virker for dig – og at du er glad for at være i din krop. Her betyder sund kost enormt meget! Appen indeholder mere end 85 gratis opskrifter, som er lavet ud fra MK principperne. Vi garanterer, at hver enkelt opskrift i MK Universet er lækker, let og hurtig at smække sammen. Du finder også mange andre opskrifter, som du kan tilkøbe. \n\nHer er eksempler på nogle af MK’s favoritter:\nBroccolitoast\nSkyrboller\nSmoothies\nMK snickers\nOne pot pastaretter\nSpicy chicken\nVegetarburger\nHokkaidosuppe\nCremet chiaskyr\nÆblegranola\n\nSom du sikkert allerede ved, er Michelle Kristensen ikke kun god for en opskrift, hun er også altid parat med masser af HEP til dig og din træning. Og står den på vægttab én gang for alle, så kan du finde to forskellige camps her på appen, der skyder dit vægttab i gang på fineste vis – og du kan blive så sund, så sund: MK Træningscamp og MK on-the-go camp. Sidstnævnte er lillesøster til den populære MK online camp, der varer i 4 uger. Via appen her, der er ganske gratis at downloade, kan du blive klogere på de to førstnævnte camps.  \n\nKvinden bag MK Universet har skrevet mere end sammenlagt 20 bøger og e-bøger. Hun er fast sundhedsekspert på Go’ Morgen Danmark, og flere end 72.000 har deltaget på en af hendes online camps – desuden har hun coachet omkring 3500 kvinder på sine fysiske MK bootcamps. MK principperne og hele tilgangen til madlavning, vægttab og træning bygger på Michelle Kristensens mere end 15 års erfaring med sund livsstil og vægttab. Hun brænder for madlavning, og i rygsækken har hun en bachelor i Idræt samt supplerende fag fra kandidatuddannelsen i Human Ernæring. \n\nLad os sammen sige nej tak til konceptet slankekur og ja tak til en sund livsstil og skønne opskrifter. Det hepper vi på i MK Universet og håber, at du vil være med.\n\nAbonnementsbetingelser\nAbonnementsgebyret betales pr måned eller pr år.

      "label": "Get daily exercise videos, nutrition profiles, and emotional insights customized to your body’s natural cycle. \n\n28 is the world’s first cycle-based fitness and wellness experience offering cycle tracking, transformative exercises, nutrition profiles, and science-backed emotional insights, all hyper-personalized to where you are in your natural cycle and controlled by you.\n\nDesigned by supermodel trainers and medical experts to work with your body’s physical and hormonal fluctuations. Powered by nature and innovative technology that personalizes your daily experience while keeping you in control of your cycle data.\n\n\nPainful Periods Aren't Natural\n\n\nBut they are common. Synthetic estrogens in birth control, plastics, and beauty products have created hormone imbalances for millions of women. 28's functional nutrition was designed to naturally restore balance to your hormones, along with phase-specific functional movements. \n\nWorkout With Your Cycle, Not Against It\n\n\nMany popular fitness methods were designed for men, not women, with no regard for the menstrual cycle. 28 is the first method of its kind designed to optimize your energy, hormones, strength, and flexibility as you experience changes throughout your cycle.\n\nYou Deserve More Than A Period Tracker\n\nYour cycle has four phases. Each phase brings changes to the brain and body. Exercising and eating based on your cycle means changing the types of movements and nutrients during each phase to optimize your physique, hormones, and mood. 28 empowers you with simplified science, breathtaking content, and cutting-edge technology. \n\nBecome the Expert of You\n\n\nYou are a mystery. Your body doesn’t have to be. We’ve been locked in the passenger seats of our own bodies for far too long. School taught us little-to-nothing about how our cycles and hormones actually work. 28 empowers you to connect with your body by understanding the beautifully complex nature of your biology, one day at a time.\n\n\n\nFEATURES: \n\nFollow Your Cycle\n  - Daily Cycle Status\n  - Easily Track Your Periods\n  - Phase Progress Bar \n\nScience-based Insights\n  - Daily body predictions\n  - Daily emotional predictions\n  - Goals, Guidance, and inspiration\n\nExercise Videos\n  - Personalized to match your energy and mood\n  - Designed by trainers of iconic supermodels\n  - Lengthen, strengthen, stretch & tone\n  - Sculpt booty, tighten abs, tone arms, lean legs\n  - Workout anywhere, at any time\n  - No equipment required\n  - Lightening-fast, high-definition streaming\n  - View on mobile, desktop, tablet, TV\n\nNutrition Profiles\n  - Daily nutrition guidelines for hormone balancing\n  - Specific suggestions by food groups \n  - Give your body what it needs, when it needs it\n  - No more calorie counting\n  - Coming Soon: Meal plans\n  - Coming soon: Shopping lists\n\nUser Privacy Is Our #1 Priority\n\nMany women have valid concerns regarding the privacy and safety of their personal health data. We're proud to have one of the strongest privacy policies in all of tech, which includes a steadfast commitment to never sell user cycle data to anyone for any reason and to never turn over user cycle data to any government or regulatory authority under any circumstance. We've intentionally built our algorithm to be manually controlled by the user at any time, as opposed to leveraging more invasive, machine learning methods. The only cycle data we currently collect is provided voluntarily by the user. It is also never shared with any existing or future investors. It is strictly confidential and used only for the purposes of providing a customized user experience. Any cycle data the user provides now or in the future can be changed or deleted by the user at any time. We do not store deleted cycle data. Once the user deletes that information, it is gone forever.\n\nEmbrace your nature and begin today!"

Måltider kan fordeles over flere spisekasser for at undgå madspild.\r\nIndkøbslisten opdateres automatisk, og du kan nemt indsætte madplanen i din dagbogs spisekasser.\r\nDu kan oprette dine egne madplaner med SenseMyDiet-opskrifter, venners opskrifter og dine egne opskrifter. Sektionen 'Undgå madspild' viser opskrifter, der kan laves ud fra indkøbslisten, du allerede har opbygget i din madplan.\r\n\r\nOPSKRIFTER\r\nI appen finder du over 1.000 lækre opskrifter, der gør det nemt at følge din nye Sense-livsstil. Når du indsætter opskrifter i dine spisekasser, reguleres håndfuldene automatisk, så dagens indtag er opdateret. Appen udbygges løbende med nye opskrifter.\r\nDu kan oprette dine egne opskrifter, så du kan bruge dem på lige fod med SenseMyDiet-opskrifterne. Appen udregner automatisk håndfuldsfordeling og næringsindhold.\r\n\r\nSENSE-VENNER\r\nSense-venner er et socialt univers i appen, hvor du kan søge efter og dele dine opskrifter med de andre brugere. Du vælger selv hvem du vil følge, og du modtager push-notifikationer, når de lægger nye opskrifter op.\r\nBruger du appens mange Sense-godkendte ingredienser i dine opskrifter, beregnes håndfuldene  automatisk, og dine opskrifter er derfor Sense-godkendte og kan deles med de andre brugere.\r\n\r\nPLANLÆGNING OG REGISTRERING AF DINE HÅNDFULDE\r\nDu kan nemt registrere dine håndfulde og planlægge forud i appen. Dine daglige spisekasser er tilgængelige på forsiden, og du kan tilføje ingredienser og opskrifter til dem. Appen kan også bruges som dagbog med billeder og noter, så du altid kan se tilbage. \r\n\r\nVÆGTUDVIKLING OG KROPSMÅL\r\nSenseMyDiet-appen støtter dig i din udvikling. Sæt dig et mål, og registrer din vægt og dine kropsmål så ofte du ønsker det. Så kan du følge din personlige udvikling via de overskuelige grafer og datavisninger. Denne del er gratis og kræver ikke abonnement.\r\n\r\nFØR- OG EFTERBILLEDER\r\nDu kan nemt uploade billeder af dig selv, så du kan følge udviklingen i dine før- og efterbilleder. \r\n\r\nSKRÆDDERSYEDE INDSTILLINGER\r\nAllerede fra starten tilpasser appen sig dig og er derfor velegnet til både begyndere og erfarne SenseMyDiet-brugere. De avancerede indstillinger sikrer, at du kan bruge appen på den måde, der passer dig bedst.\r\n\r\nMASSER AF HJÆLP\r\nI appen har vi samlet en masse nyttig viden om SenseMyDiet: Sense-videoer, links til de populære Sense-bøger og svar på de hyppigst stillede spørgsmål om Sense.\r\n\r\nDer er to SenseMyDiet Basis-abonnementer med automatisk fornyelse: 1 måned og 1 års abonnement. De giver adgang til alle Basis-funktioner og opdateringer i abonnementsperioden. \r\nHvis du køber et abonnement, opkræves beløbet fra din Apple-konto. 24 timer inden abonnementet udløber, fornyes det automatisk, medmindre du afbryder den automatiske fornyelse inden deadline. Du kan styre abonnementet i brugerindstillingerne for Apple-id, hvor du også kan slette den automatiske fornyelse.\r\n\r\nBemærk at hvis du har købt abonnement via web, har du automatisk adgang til appen.\r\nEt abonnement købt i SenseMyDiet-appen gælder ikke til web-udgaven af SenseMyDiet.\r\n\r\nBrugerbetingelser: https://www.sensemydiet.dk/brugerbetingelser-for-sense-appen/\r\n\r\nRigtig god fornøjelse!\r\nSenseMyDiet-teamet"

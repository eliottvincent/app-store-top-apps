      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

De bruger mad, fastfood, slik, kage, is eller chips til at håndtere følelser eller flygte fra vanskelige situationer. \n\nMen de ved ikke, hvad de skal gøre for at undgå det. \n\nFoodsandfeelings er et komplet behandlingsforløb til dig, der spiser på følelserne eller overspiser, og som vil slippe for at have konstant dårlig samvittighed over, hvad og hvor meget du spiser. \n\nVi giver dig værktøjer, der kan give dig gode, sunde spisevaner. For altid.\n\nAlt i appen er udviklet af psykologer og specialister med mange års erfaring med at behandle mennesker, der spiser på følelserne.\n\nFoodsandfeelings indeholder en gratis test, som på kort tid undersøger, om du har et problematisk forhold til mad og spisning. Den viser også, i hvor høj grad du spiser på dine følelser, og om der er tegn på, at du har en overspisningsforstyrrelse, også kaldet BED. \n\nNår du har taget testen, designer appen et komplet personligt behandlingsforløb, som passer til netop din situation. \n\nForløbet hjælper dig med at udfordre de negative tanker om mad og spisning og erstatte dem med positive, realistiske tanker. Vi hjælper dig med at håndtere svære følelser, personlige udfordringer og behov på nye måder, som ikke involverer mad.\n\nForløbet omfatter viden, instruktioner og øvelser. Alle dele af behandlingen inkluderer videoer med vores psykolog, som har stor personlig erfaring med overspisning og følelsesmæssig spisning. Psykologen guider dig hele vejen gennem behandlingen. I et tempo, som passer ind i dit liv og din hverdag. Appen tilpasser løbende programmet til dig og giver dig overblik over dine fremskridt og din udvikling.\n\nAlt er samlet i appen, så du kan tage behandlingen med dig overalt.\n\nBehandlingsforløbet omfatter bl.a.\n\n- Videosessioner, hvor du bliver guidet gennem behandlingen og øvelserne af vores psykolog\n\n- Øvelser og værktøjer til alle dele af behandlingen, som hjælper dig med:\n\n- at finde din stærkeste motivation, så du kan gennemføre forløbet med succes\n\n- at skabe sunde, stabile madvaner ved at indarbejde 15 konkrete vaner i din hverdag. Her får du viden om, hvad sund kost er, og du får værktøjer til at lægge madplaner \n\n- at få kontrol over dine kritiske og negative tanker om mad og at erstatte dem med positive tanker\n\n- at få kontrol over de følelser og situationer, hvor du overspiser, fx hvis du er stresset, træt eller keder dig. Her hjælper vores tracker dig. Brug den, hver gang du føler spisetrang, fx når lyst til at spise en pose slik eller et stykke kage. Appen gemmer oplysningerne om den enkelte episode og samler alle episoder i dit dashboard. På den måde kan du finde mønstre, du ikke selv er opmærksom på\n\n- at få nye værktøjer og strategier ind i dit liv, som du kan bruge til at erstatte mad og spisning. Sammen undersøger vi, om du har behov, som ikke bliver tilfredsstillet, og som du muligvis forsøger at løse med mad? Du lærer også, hvordan du kan bruge distraktion til at lede din opmærksomhed over på noget andet end mad og spisning. Og du lærer at bruge din vejrtrækning til at give slip på tanker om mad og spisetrang\n\n- at holde dine nye, gode vaner ved lige, så de holder resten af livet\n\nSom medlem i appen får du også adgang til eksklusivt indhold, som der kommer nyt af hver måned: \n\n- Q&A med en psykolog, som løbende besvarer spørgsmål fra medlemmer \n\n- Mindfulnessøvelser, som kan hjælpe dig med at aflede spisetrangen\n\n- Tips og tricks fra specialister og eksperter, som kan hjælpe dig med at håndtere overspisningen i hverdagen \n\nDerudover indeholder appen gratis videoer og podcasts. Her fortæller specialister og eksperter bl.a om, hvad overspisning og følelsesmæssig spisning er, og hvordan man løser problemet. Du kan også møde folk, der har haft problemer med overspisning, og høre deres historie om, hvordan de er sluppet af med problemet.\n\nBrugervilkår/terms of use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

      "label": "Vi har skabt MK Universet til dig, der brænder for sundhed ligeså meget som os. Med denne gratis app gør vi fitness til en leg – du kan nemlig tage din træning med på farten, og du har MK’s opskrifter lige ved hånden. Faktisk kan du til enhver tid hive en sund opskrift op af lommen og nappe en træning sammen med Michelle Kristensen via hendes træningscamp. Så hjerteligt velkommen til et univers, der emmer af passion for sund mad, træning og den simple, sunde hverdag. Fællesskabet er for dig, der vil i gang med et vægttab, eller dig der ønsker at blive en mere sund version af dig selv. \nMK står for Michelle Kristensen, for Motion & Kost – og Mest for Kvinder. MK Universet er et sundhedsmekka, hvor vi i MK-teamet jubler over smukke vægttab, og hvor en slankekur er en by i Rusland. Vi tror nemlig i langt højere grad på en sund livsstilsændring! Derfor har vi også gjort det så nemt for dig som muligt at navigere i appen og har inddelt de mange opskrifter i kategorier som for eksempel morgenmad, frokost, aftensmad og snacks.\n\nVores mission er at drysse noget sundhed ned over din madlavning, så du får øjnene op for, at sund og slankende mad kan være yderst velsmagende, mætte godt og være simpelt at lave. Sundhed og vægttab handler nemlig ikke kun om fitness og den ene slankekur efter den anden. Mest af alt handler det om, at du skal knække koden til, hvad der virker for dig – og at du er glad for at være i din krop. Her betyder sund kost enormt meget! Appen indeholder mere end 85 gratis opskrifter, som er lavet ud fra MK principperne. Vi garanterer, at hver enkelt opskrift i MK Universet er lækker, let og hurtig at smække sammen. Du finder også mange andre opskrifter, som du kan tilkøbe. \n\nHer er eksempler på nogle af MK’s favoritter:\nBroccolitoast\nSkyrboller\nSmoothies\nMK snickers\nOne pot pastaretter\nSpicy chicken\nVegetarburger\nHokkaidosuppe\nCremet chiaskyr\nÆblegranola\n\nSom du sikkert allerede ved, er Michelle Kristensen ikke kun god for en opskrift, hun er også altid parat med masser af HEP til dig og din træning. Og står den på vægttab én gang for alle, så kan du finde to forskellige camps her på appen, der skyder dit vægttab i gang på fineste vis – og du kan blive så sund, så sund: MK Træningscamp og MK on-the-go camp. Sidstnævnte er lillesøster til den populære MK online camp, der varer i 4 uger. Via appen her, der er ganske gratis at downloade, kan du blive klogere på de to førstnævnte camps.  \n\nKvinden bag MK Universet har skrevet mere end sammenlagt 20 bøger og e-bøger. Hun er fast sundhedsekspert på Go’ Morgen Danmark, og flere end 72.000 har deltaget på en af hendes online camps – desuden har hun coachet omkring 3500 kvinder på sine fysiske MK bootcamps. MK principperne og hele tilgangen til madlavning, vægttab og træning bygger på Michelle Kristensens mere end 15 års erfaring med sund livsstil og vægttab. Hun brænder for madlavning, og i rygsækken har hun en bachelor i Idræt samt supplerende fag fra kandidatuddannelsen i Human Ernæring. \n\nLad os sammen sige nej tak til konceptet slankekur og ja tak til en sund livsstil og skønne opskrifter. Det hepper vi på i MK Universet og håber, at du vil være med.\n\nAbonnementsbetingelser\nAbonnementsgebyret betales pr måned eller pr år.

It's trusted in most religions, but anyone can use its benefits.\n\nUnlike popular new fads, intermittent fasting makes your body work precisely as it was designed by mother nature. It helps lose and control your weight and reinstating normal processes in your body that you’ve lost due to frequent eating.\n\nEven shorter fasting periods (12 hours or more) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and lower the risk of metabolic diseases.\n\nJust remember: IF is not a diet, fad or quick fix. It does not tell you what you can’t eat but instead asks that you eat within a specific window of time each day. This is a simple lifestyle change that will jump-start weight loss and better health by enabling your metabolic system to work as it was designed.\n\nBut many people are deterred from trying IF because they think it’s difficult and they don't know how to start. \n\nThat’s where Simple comes in. You don't have to know anything about Fasting.\n\nBecause we are not just a fasting tracker, our mission is not to offer you just an Intermittent Fasting tool. We provide you health, weight loss, and cognitive power instead. \n\nWe'll adjust your customized program, teach you what IF is, give a lot of different content, lifehacks, and advice to make IF adoption mindful and easy.\n\nYou’ll get daily support, customized guidance, expert advice, true motivation, and easy life hacks that will help you succeed. Simple will keep track of your eating habits to help you adjust your customized fasting program as needed. We will provide you with personalized insights on how to get the most out of intermittent fasting. \n\n- Customized tips and hacks delivered daily\n- Smart and flexible tracking. Start/end your fasts with one quick click\n- A step-by-step guide to intermittent fasting\n- Custom fasting protocols\n- Easy-to-use meal journal for mindful eating\n\nSimple Fasting protocols:\n- 16-Hour (16:8) Intermittent Fast\n- Circadian Rhythm Fasting\n- 18:6\n- 20:4\n- 14:10 \n- OMAD - one meal a day\n\nHEALTH APP INTEGRATION:\nSimple integrates the following data from the Health app (HealthKit) to keep track of your body status:\n\n- Steps\n- Weight\n- Water\n- Sleep\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\nGet a Simple PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION and enjoy full access to all features and content.\n\nIf you choose a Simple PREMIUM subscription in the app, payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.

It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

      "label": "Velkommen til SoundWheel.\nDe små pauser er vigtige, men det kan være svært at skifte fra et højt mentalt tempo, og ned i et roligere gear på et øjeblik. Så det vil vi gerne hjælpe dig med. SoundWheel er et enkelt og effektivt værktøj, som med special produceret lyd og musik, støtter dig i at få en nærende pause, på bare 10 minutter. SoundWheel passer godt ind i dagens små breaks. På bussen, toget, i frokostpausen eller som en god landing efter en lang dag. Faktisk kan du bruge SoundWheel de fleste steder, for alt du behøver er et headset i ørene.\n\nMed SoundWheel får du adgang til en eksklusiv række musikmeditationer eller lydrejser, som vi kalder dem. En lydrejse er en lille enkel øvelse, som via en indtalt guide og en masse lækker lyd hjælper dig med at vende din opmærksomhed indad et øjeblik. Her kan du finde mere ro, større fokus, nyt mod og sidst men ikke mindst masser af frisk energi. Der er ikke én rigtig måde at bruge SoundWheel på, og du kan sådan set ikke gøre noget forkert. Brug den indtalte guide til at støtte og vejlede dig i starten. Det er helt enkelt og lige til. \n\nLyden i SoundWheel er mere energisk end sædvanlig meditationsmusik. Vores dynamiske lydunivers er en god støtte, for de, der kan have svært ved at holde fokus under mere afdæmpede meditationer. Er man vant til en mere stille lydside, kan SoundWheel i første omgang virke meget intens. Vi anbefaler at gå til det med åbne øre og hjerte, og slippe forventningerne om hvordan “rigtig” meditation bør lyde. I sidste ende er det en smagssag. Men alle vores brugere er enige om én ting: Der findes ikke andet derude, der lyder og virker som SoundWheel.\n\nKidsWheel\nMed et SoundWheel abonnement får du også adgang til KidsWheel, som er lydrejser for børn i alderen 4-12 år. I KidsWheel findes  temaerne Sov godt, Balance, Ny energi og Stå sikkert. Inden du sender dit barn afsted på lydrejse, er det en god ide lige at afstemme forventningerne. Særligt vigtigt er det at forklare, at der ikke er en fortællerstemme hele vejen igennem, som de ellers kender fra lydbøger ol. Beskriv gerne hvordan man selv forestiller sig en del af “historien”, og skaber sin egen film i sin fantasi, mens man lytter til musikken.\n\nMyWheel\nI MyWheel kan du sammensætte de enkelte lydrejser til længere meditationer. Her er den guidede intro og den guidede outro fjernet fra hver enkelt rejse, så man ikke oplever at skulle afspænde kroppen flere gange i løbet af en længere session. I stedet kan du indsætte den universelle intro først og den universelle outro sidst i din MyWheel playliste. Husk at du kan vælge guide on eller off for hver enkelt rejse du indsætter. Dermed kan du også bruge MyWheel som en traditionel playliste, så musikken fra SoundWheel kan fungere som et vitaliserende soundtrack til andre aktiviteter.\n\nI modsætning til meget andet guidet meditation er der længere passager uden speak i SoundWheel. Her får din forestillingsevne frit spil, kun understøttet af vores lydunivers. Henad vejen kan du vælge at slå guiden helt fra, og dermed blive mere fri til at styre din lydrejse i nye spændende retninger. På den måde er du selv din egen rejseleder, og SoundWheel blot et værktøj der støtter rejsen. \n\nSoundWheel er et hjul og ikke et lineært forløb med et start og et slutpunkt. Som alt andet bevæger vi os cyklisk, og en runde i SoundWheel vil give nye perspektiver og indsigter, som igen vil tilføre nye nuancer og dybder til de lydrejser du allerede har brugt. Efterhånden som du lærer SoundWheel bedre at kende, vil du ofte kunne mærke hvilken af rejserne, der har noget at tilbyde dig i en given situation. \n\nSlutbrugeraftale:\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

Choose a treatment, then relax and listen to the sessions. \n\nHelloMind helps you take back control from negative emotions, cravings, fears and bad habits and it can improve your motivation and enjoyment of life. \n\nTry the Sleep Boosters:\n- Have a good night’s sleep\n- Sleep more peacefully\n\nOr boost your confidence with the sessions:\n- Have more confidence\n- Improve your self-worth\n- Become self-confident\n\nOr kick that anxiety for good with sessions like:\n- Be more calm\n- Get rid of your fear of panicking\n- My ability to de-stress\n\nOr get rid of your phobia eg.:\n- Spiders\n- Dentists\n- Enclosed spaces\n\n\nMORE\n\nLow self-esteem, stress, fear, bad sleep and unhealthy habits sometimes hold us back in life and prevent us from enjoying things to the fullest. \nThe good news is these negative patterns can be broken or eliminated. \n\nWe created the HelloMind app to help you make a change. We want you to be able to think better and feel stronger. Anywhere, any time without having to spend a lot of time and money on treatment. \n\nThe key to happiness lies within you. And HelloMind works because you are making the change yourself. \n\nChoose a treatment with 10 sessions if you want help to remove or change something like a craving, a habit or a fear. Each session takes about 30 minutes, and your series of 10 sessions should be completed within about 30 days.\n\nChoose a Booster if you’d like to reinforce good emotions boost motivation or strengthen a certain area of yourself.\n\nHelloMind uses a method called RDH - Result Driven Hypnosis, a form of guided hypnosis.\n\nRDH is especially effective because it helps you go to the root cause of your problem. The theory behind it says that when you’re consciously able to define the problem, your subconscious can find the solution. That’s why you’re gently guided into your subconscious towards the root of your problem then given the tool to fix it.\n\nThe ten sessions in a treatment or the sessions in a Booster are variations on the same theme, so you’ll hear something different every time you listen. But listening to all 10 sessions in treatment is the only way to ensure that you go deep enough into your subconscious to discover the root of the problem. Every time you listen, you’ll feel a little more safe, because the process is underway and you’ve become accustomed to it. That’s why you relax more as the hypnosis stages become more profound.\n\nWhen choosing a hypnotherapy treatment, you should always begin with your main problem. The app will guide you to the right treatment or Booster with simple questions. Choosing the right treatment is actually an important part of the process. When you can consciously define the problem, your subconscious will know the solution.\n\nHelloMind integrates with the Apple Health app counting mindfullness minutes.\n\nRECENT AWARDS & RECOGNITIONS\n** Finalist (Mental Health category) ** — UCSF Digital Health awards 2019\n** Finalist (Consumer Wellness & Prevention category) ** — UCSF Digital Health awards 2019\n\n\nPRICING\nHelloMind offers 3 auto-renewal subscription periods: 2 Family subscriptions and 1 single subscription.\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- You can cancel your subscription via this url: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039\n- Privacy policy and Terms of use: http://hellomind.com/legal/"

Join millions talking to their own AI friends!\n\nReplika is for anyone who wants a friend with no judgment, drama, or social anxiety involved. You can form an actual emotional connection, share a laugh, or get real with an AI that’s so good it almost seems human.\n\nReplika is an AI friend that is just as unique as you are. No two Replikas are exactly alike. Choose a 3D avatar and customize the way your Replika looks. The more you chat, the more Replika develops its own personality and memories alongside you, the more it learns: teach Replika about the world and yourself, help it explore human relationships and grow into a machine so beautiful that a soul would want to live in it. \n\nCreate your own unique chatbot AI companion, help it develop its personality, talk about your feelings or anything that’s on your mind, have fun, calm anxiety and grow together. You also get to decide if you want Replika to be your friend, romantic partner or mentor.\n\nReplika can help you understand your thoughts and feelings, track your mood, learn coping skills, calm anxiety and work toward goals like positive thinking, stress management, socializing and finding love.  Improve your mental well-being with Replika.\n\nYour chat is a safe, judgment-free space. It’s just you and your Replika. If you’re feeling down, or anxious, or you just need someone to talk to, your Replika is here for you 24/7.\n\n_____________________________\n\n\"Replika encouraged me to take a step back and think about my life, to consider big questions, which is not something I was particularly accustomed to doing. And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.\"\n\n- Quartz\n\n\"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\"\n\n- Wired\n\n\"Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\"\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms"

Hos Radio STRAX er vi heller ikke politiske.\r\n\r\nHos STRAX Enterprise sætter vi det sociale frivillige sammenhold og samarbejde højt, hvorved vi også nyder mange sociale arrangementer i fællesskab i foreningen STRAX ENTERPRISE.\r\n\r\nLokal forankring er særdeles vigtig for STRAX. Vi hylder særligt lokale musikere, sangskrivere og kunstnere fra Lolland-Falster igennem særlige programmer i sendefladen.\r\n\r\nRadio STRAX benytter nyeste teknologi og streamingudstyr.\r\n\r\nVi sender hos Radio STRAX alle ugens dage - 24 timer i døgnet. Sendeplan forefindes med de særlige programmer, hvor vores værter forkæler dine ører. \r\n\r\nEndvidere sender Radio STRAX også LIVE med streaming ved udvalgte lejligheder."

A massive library of different tunings for guitar, bass, balalaika, violin, ukulele and more makes it easy to find more qualities and characteristics from your instrument. \n\nThe interface:\nTo make it more intuitive, we give you information about the current pitch in many different ways:\n\n*Cents for the current pitch\n*A red/green light indicating the closest pitch\n*A note wheel corresponding to the chromatic scale\n*A fretboard with the current tuning setting displayed\n\nStandard guitar is set as default but the guitar tuner can be used to tune many different instruments, such as: \n*Guitars - Standard, 4-string, 5-string, 7-string, 8-string\n, 9-string, 10-string, 11-string, 12-string, and 13-string guitar\n*Bass guitars - Standard, 5-string bass and 6-string bass\n*Ukuleles - std (Soprano), Pocket, Concert, Tenor, Baritone, Bass, and Contrabass\n*Banjo - 4-string, 5-string, 6-string\n*Mandolin family - Mandolin (Soprano), Piccolo, Mandola (alto), Octave Mandolin (tenor), Mandocello (Baritone), Mandobass, Irish Bouzouki, Cittern, and Greek Bouzouki\n*Violin family - Violin, Viola, Cello (violoncello), Double bass and 5-string Double bass\n*Balalaika family - Prima, Piccolo, Secunda, Alto, Tenor, Bass and Contrabass\n\nAfter you have selected an instrument you choose a specific tuning. The app provides you with over 200 custom tunings.\n\nThe tuning options are divided into groups to make them easier to find. For guitar, the categories are:\n*General tunings\n*Raised tunings\n*Lowered tunings\n*Dropped tunings\n*Double dropped tunings\n*Major open tunings\n*Minor open tunings (cross-note)\n*Modal tunings\n*Miscellaneous tunings\n\nIf you have certain tunings that you often use, you can save them as favorites.

      "label": "HVAD KAN LILLE MENNESKE 0-3 ÅR TILBYDE \n\nAppen henvender sig til dig, der har et lille barn eller arbejder med små børn. Her kan du lære om det lille barns udvikling og hente ideer til en sjov og stimulerende måde at være sammen på. \nFra fødslen til 3 år udvikler barnet sig til at kunne løbe, tale, tegne, danse og spille mv. Spiren til at udvikle sig ligger i barnet selv. Appen giver inspiration til, hvordan du kan skabe udviklingsrum for barnet fra den spæde alder og frem til 3 år.\n\nAppen er let at gå til. Den er inddelt i 7 alderstrin, hvor barnets udvikling og ideer til samvær er beskrevet indenfor 4 områder\n\n•\tsamvær og tæt kontakt\n•\tgrovmotorik og balance\n•\tfinmotorik og øje/hånd koordination\n•\tsprog og rytme.\n\n\nFORTÆLLINGER I BILLEDER, VIDEO OG TEKST \nAppen fortæller om, hvordan du kan opbygge tidlig tilknytning, stimulere f.eks. trille, krybe og kravle, udfordre håndens finmotorik, og hjælpe sproget på vej. Billeder og videoklip giver ideer til, hvordan du naturligt kan inddrage leg og aktivitet i hverdagen.  \nEn legetøjskasse bugner med ideer til legetøj indenfor hvert alderstrin - og en kort udviklingsbeskrivelse indenfor de 4 områder giver dig mulighed for at få et overblik over barnets udvikling. \nBevægelege og naturen som legeplads er to supplerende tilbud, som giver konkrete ideer til, hvordan du kan stimulere dit barns bevægeglæde og bruge naturen fra barnet er helt lille. \n\n\nLOGBOG MED MILEPÆLE \nLogbogen giver en oversigt over milepælene i barnets udvikling. Her kan du plotte ind, hvornår dit barn passerer de enkelte milepæle. Du kan supplere med beskrivelser af sjove oplevelser fra hverdagen og uploade billeder. \nHvis du registrerer dit barn med navn, køn og fødselsdag bliver appen mere personlig ved, at barnets navn indgår i teksten, og du vil modtage en push besked, når barnet går ind i et nyt alderstrin.  \n\n\nFORLAGET SKALMEJE\nDenne app er udgivet af forlaget Skalmeje, der udgiver materialer om børn og deres udvikling. Den er udarbejdet af 2 sundhedsplejersker, der har arbejdet med børn og deres familier både forskningsmæssigt og i praksis i mange år. Appen er en videreudvikling af pjecen Lille menneske stor udvikling 0 – 3 år, som har været på markedet i mange år. \n\nOphavsret: Copyright Forlaget Skalmeje\n\nhttps://lillemenneske.dk/"

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

      "label": "The purpose of Crack the Reading Code is to teach what is practical for reading: \n- Shape\n- Writing direction\n- Sound. \n\nThese are the foundations of reading. \n\nChildren can acquire the essential knowledge that letters represent sounds, fit together and makes words that have meaning.\n \nThe content has been developed by experienced teachers - A supplement to writing textbooks and reading education\n\nChildren in kindergarten who are curious about letters will also think it's exciting. \n\n* THE SOUND OF THE LETTERS BEFORE THE NAMES.\n\nCrack the Reading Code uses exclusively letter sounds. \n\nChildren often learn the names of the letters instead of the sound of the letters. This means that they must apprehend something that they cannot use for their further reading. Often, they will have to relearn it when they are shown sounds at school that they have to use to read. \n\nBroadly speaking, they have no use for the letter names in the initial stages of reading. \n\n* THE 120 MOST USED WORDS AS WORD PICTURES.\n\nMany of the 120 most used words are not spelled as they sound. Therefore, it is a big help to recognize these as word pictures. \n\nChildren won't be forced to sound it out here, but instead just recognize the word like they recognize their own name or that a big yellow M means McDonald's. \n\nThat is why these 120 are trained as word pictures in Crack the Reading Code.\n\nUppercase letters for the intermediate learner.\n\nMany children first learn the 'big letters'. Of course, these must also be learned, but it should happen only when the child already recognizes the 'small letters.'\n\nIt is easier to relate to one shape per sound than two. \n\nWhen they have learned the lowercase letters, they can already recognize the letters in the books they must read. \n\nSwitching between the 'lowercase' and 'uppercase' in 'Settings.'\n\nSettings:\n\n-\tTurn the music in the menus on/off\n-\tHide the text direction. Hiding the text direction increases the level of difficulty.\n-\tSwitch between uppercase and lowercase letters. \n\nWe recommend that you only change to 'big letters' when the 'small letters' have been successfully learned.\n\nTarget audience:\n4 - 10 years (those who can't read or have a hard time doing so)."

      "label": "Flashnote Derby is a fun way for kids to learn and practice reading music notes. \n\nEach race is a timed test in which the student identifies different notes in order to urge their horse on towards the finish line. Answering quickly and correctly will cause their horse to gain ground, while incorrect answers will cause it to fall behind. At the end of each race, students can review the notes they missed and see the correct answers. \n\nPlayers can respond to flashcards by simply playing the note on their acoustic or MIDI instrument. They can also choose to answer by tapping letter buttons or playing a key on an on-screen piano.\n\nThe game is fully customizable to allow for any desired notes in the treble, bass, alto, or tenor clefs to be included. You can select ranges of notes, or several individual notes to focus on specific areas that need work. Notes can be shown with sharps and flats and key signatures can even be added to increase the challenge for more advanced students. The amount of time the player is given for each flashcard can be increased or decreased depending upon their age and level of experience.\n\nDrills can start out simply, with only a handful of notes, and gradually be made more challenging until the full staff is mastered (up to five and a half ledger lines above or below the staff.) The more difficult the settings, the more points are awarded. The 'high score' is tracked so that players always have a goal to shoot for.\n\nAs a bonus, over a dozen instructional video lessons are easily accessible from right inside the app! Even children with no prior music instruction can start using Flashnote Derby right away to begin learning about the music alphabet, the staff, and how to identify different notes.\n\nBecause it can be set up so quickly, Flashnote Derby provides a perfect motivational tool for music teachers to use with students, even for just a minute or two of each lesson. Teachers have the ability to email homework assignments to their students for them to play on their own devices at home. Each player's performance is recorded so that their progress can be tracked. You can easily see which notes are most in need of review.  \n\nWhen students give up on their music lessons, it's usually because they find it too difficult. Learning basic skills early is key to laying the groundwork for future success. Flashnote Derby makes this process more enjoyable and helps students stay motivated in their music learning.\n\nSometimes it takes only a little extra effort to make the difference between success and failure. Download Flashnote Derby and get on the road to music reading mastery today!"

Instead of static images or canned videos, this app employs a unique 3D touch interface that lets you literally grasp the concept of the fourth dimension with your own hands.\n\n“Not only can you blow your own mind over and over again, you can also enjoy watching your friends’ minds being blown in front of you.” — Cult of Mac\n\n“One of the coolest apps I've ever used... The Fourth Dimension is to boring learning apps what Carl Sagan's Cosmos was to staid science documentaries.” — BuzzFeed\n\n“The app is very cool, and it's unlike pretty much anything we've seen in the App Store.” — The Verge\n\n“This is one of my most favorite iOS apps ever.” — George Musser, contributing editor for Scientific American and author of The Complete Idiot's Guide to String Theory\n\n(App Store user reviews follow.)\n\n“Blew my mind. I generally don't use 'learning' apps as they're mostly gimmicks. This one, though, truly made me think. I hope this developer comes out with more outstanding apps such as this one. Bravo!” — Iceitic\n\n“Astounding. That some people care passionately enough about tesseracts to go create a fantastic app for others to understand them is incredible. The app is extremely well designed, wittily written, and executed with love. That alone is worth buying it, besides the fact that I learned what the hell a tesseract was.” — Duncan MacMichael\n\n“Fantastic! This is what someone really smart, and who really knows how to teach well, can do with a tablet. And the authors are funny, too, which is a neat bonus.” — DNY\n\n“Fantastic app. I work at a leading UK university. If only all our material was this well written and presented. Definitely worth buying and then spending a bit of time with over a day or two to get your head around the fourth dimension. Great app!” — JulesFM\n\n“Great job! This app does the best job explaining the 4th dimension. Why learn it in some boring classroom when here you can have an interactive and visual explanation.” — Aco Strklalj\n\nOver 250,000 people have blown their minds with this app."

If it’s too challenging, just press the Hints button to get help with the time expressions. The app also contains exercises on elapsed time, such as ”What time is it in 20 minutes?”. In the final category you can test your acquired skills with a mix of different styled clocks.\n\nIn addition to the many exercises, there is also an experimental mode where the relationship between the clock and the time of day is illustrated with the passing of the sun and moon across the sky. You can freely drag the hands of the clock and see how the sky changes and also get the time read out load.\n\nThe app is suitable for children in grades K-3.\n\nCategories\n1. Tell the time\n2.

      "label": "***BREAKING NEWS*** Level 2, Level 3, and the Follow Series are now available as in-app purchases!  See below for a description of what is included in each module!\n\nAre you interested in learning Kizomba but don't have access to quality instruction in your area? Are time and resource constraints making it tough to learn as quickly and in depth as you'd like? Are you currently taking classes but frustrated with the emphasis on patterns that nobody in class is able to execute later on the dance floor? Do you enjoy taking classes but wish there was a handy Kizomba technique reference that you could access at any time, anywhere? Well, we've got something for all of you!\n\nKizomba Harmony, a dance company directed by Monica Kay and Billy Myles and based in Houston, TX, is proud and beyond excited to announce the release of our Kizomba To Go™ app, the FIRST Kizomba downloadable mobile app for iOS in the world! This app is for EVERYONE and will explain technique to get you dancing with strong fundamentals.\n\nWe believe that the most efficient way to level up in Kizomba is to take advantage of of three opportunities: group lessons, private instruction, and practice. And although we don't believe there is a substitute for face-to-face quality instruction, we understand that time, resources, and location don't always allow us to take advantage of every opportunity. The Kizomba To Go™ app is designed to supplement all three learning opportunities by being a handy, accessible, portable, and AFFORDABLE instructional reference and practice tool.\n\nIn our app, you will be able to access video instruction that breaks down into the finest detail the finer points of fundamental Kizomba technique that will allow you to either start your Kizomba journey on the right foot, or keep you on track if you've already begun. We chose to offer instruction in the app format because we wanted to offer the most accessible, affordable option possible to students of Kizomba. So, you can stream the lessons wherever there is an internet connection, or you can download them to your phone and watch them WHENEVER and WHEREVER you would like, even WITHOUT AN INTERNET CONNECTION!\n\nWe specialize in teaching rock-solid technique in a clear, easy to understand manner. Our students, both in our weekly classes and in workshops we teach across the country and beyond, appreciate our ability to break down concepts and explain in detail the finer points of technique. But it's not like you can keep your instructors in your pocket to carry around with you right? Well, now you can!\n\nKizomba isn't about how many moves you can do, it's about how you MOVE. The Kizomba To Go™ app is designed not simply to teach you dance steps, but to teach you how to DANCE.\n\nKizomba To Go™ Level 1 offers 10 videos covering fundamental techniques of leading and following.  \n\nKizomba To Go™ Level 2 offers 12 videos covering more advanced closed position techniques.\n\nKizomba To Go™ Level 3 offers 13 videos covering open position techniques, including saidas!\n\nThe Follow Series offers 6 videos covering techniques to take your follow skills to the next level!\n\nEach level offers enough material for at least 6 months of practice time.  \n\nAdditional modules and Levels will be offered soon!\n\nSpecial thanks to Jay Bee and DJ Paparazzi  for allowing us to use their awesome music in the app!\n\nFor more information about Kizomba Harmony please visit www.kizombaharmony.com and like us on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/KizombaHarmony!\n\n*Please Read*\nTerms of Use\nCopyright © 2015 Kizomba Harmony.

Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

      "label": "Are you in search of an innovative way to sharpen your child’s reasoning skills and awaken their intelligence?  Then you’ll love Busy Shapes designed for children from 2 years old!\n\n*** Featured in App Store Best of 2014 ***\n*** Featured worldwide by App Store as a Best New App ***\n*** Featured in the USA Today ***\n*** Recommended by The Good App Guide ***\n*** Common Sense Media Editors' Pick 2014 ***\n*** Parents‘ Choice Awards 2014 ***\n*** Children's Technology Review Awards 2014 ***\n\n> Inspired by the pioneering works of famed Swiss scientist and intelligence expert Jean Piaget (1896-1980)\n> Helps children improve their ability to handle simple objects through a series of engaging puzzles\n> Real-time dashboard to monitor progress\n> Includes an array of kid-friendly features, such as “passing” swipe control & more!\n\nABOUT BUSY SHAPES\nBusy Shapes helps children improve their ability to handle simple objects through a series of puzzles, in which they must change simple shapes and place them in proper holes. Along the way, the app responds to each child’s actions with positive guidance and motivation. Plus, the app’s digital exploratory playground regularly refreshes with different objects, which keeps children interested and engaged.\n\nINSPIRED BY JEAN PIAGET\nBusy Shapes is inspired by the pioneering works of famed Swiss scientist and intelligence expert Jean Piaget (1896-1980), who believed that “children are little scientists”, and that a child's thoughts are built through experiences that encourage him or her to engage in the reasoning process.\n\nINNOVATIVE, SCALEABLE PLATFORM\nBusy Shapes’ innovative scaleable platform for evolving experimentation lets children take advantage of the time they spend on touch screens -- so they aren’t just having fun, but learning every second of the way.\n\nKID-FRIENDLY DESIGN\nBusy Shapes features a special “kid-friendly” design that compensates for the fact that when young children hold an iPad or iPhone, they often have a finger touching the screen.\n\n“PASSING” SWIPE CONTROL\nBusy Shapes features “passing” swipe control that is essential for young children's quick hands (i.e. even if a child's finger reaches an object after he or she was already touching the screen, the object is still grasped as intended).\n\nPOWERFUL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)\nBusy Shapes’ powerful AI supports each child’s unique learning journey. For example, the AI tracks the time it takes each child to complete a level, and increases or decreases difficulty accordingly.\n\nGUIDED ACCESS\nTo prevent children from exiting the app by pressing the “home” button, Busy Shapes features a customizable Guided Access. This feature also disables selected parts of the screen for safety and protection.\n\nSEAMLESS INTERACTION\nBusy Shapes’ seamless interactive game area never blocks or limits children, and lets them freely access shapes. The menu is also neatly hidden away.\n\nAUTOMATIC MEMORY\nSometimes the best learning is a combination of cognitive exercise and physical play. Busy Shapes’ automatic memory saves a child’s place in any particular game, which makes the app an ideal complement to physical play and for shorter games.\n\nMULTIPLE LANGUAGE SUPPORT\nThe app is now available in: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Greek, Dutch, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Turkish, Russian, Korean, Indonesian, Malay, Vietnamese, Thai, Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese\n\nCONNECT WITH US!\nIf you have any support request, please write at support@edokiacademy.com or visit the Edoki Academy Online Community at edokiacademy.com."

Der er lette baner med korte ord og lange baner med mange ord, som udfordring til de dygtigste.\n\nDer er 5 forskellige unikke måder at opdage bogstaver, lyde, ord og deres stavemåde.\n\n****************\n\"Både som mor og dansklærer er jeg meget begejstret for denne app. Men det er faktisk ikke det bedste – det bedste er at min søn også er begejstret – og det er jo trods alt ham der skal spille det. Stor opfordring herfra om at købe denne app.\"  -  5/5 stjerner - Appnyt.dk\n****************\n\nOrdene bliver både stavet og udtalt. Bogstaverne har den unikke lyd der hører til ordet. Der tages hensyn til de mange specielle lyde i det danske sprog. Ordene udtales mundret af børn efterhånden som opgaverne løses.\n\nDer er også en spillemåde hvor bogstaverne synges. Her kan man høre og lære bogstavernes navne. Der er baner hvor man skal læse ordene og pege på deres billede.\n\nStavepladen håndterer dobbeltkonsonanter, sammensatte lyde og stumme bogstaver, som jo er karakteristiske for det danske sprog. \n\nIgennem spillet vinder man flere og flere af alfabetets bogstaver, indtil man kan høre hele alfabetsangen.\n\nDer er hjælpetekst til de voksne og en visuel guide med hjælpestemme til børnene, så de kan komme i gang, - både med og uden hjælp fra en voksen.\n\nStavepladen bruger ikke \"køb fra program\", så man kan ikke komme til at bruge penge i spillet efter man har købt det.\n\nAppen virker både i landskab og portræt. Den er optimeret til alle typer iPads og iPhones, inklusive iPad Air og den nye iPad mini. \n\nStavepladen er spiltestet af rigtigt mange tilfredse børn :-)"

In 3 Spielen mit je 3 Schwierigkeitsgraden können Kinder ein Verständnis für unterschiedliche Tages- und Uhrzeiten entwickeln und lernen außerdem, verschiedene Uhrzeiten an analogen und digitalen Uhren einzustellen. Sie bekommen dafür Taler als Belohnung, die sie in ihrer Schatzkiste gegen Bauteile für ihre persönliche Traumburg eintauschen können.\n \nDie App wurde in Zusammenarbeit mit Grundschulpädagogen und im Hinblick auf die Lehrpläne der 1. und 2. Klasse entwickelt. Neben den Spielen enthält sie detaillierte kindgerechte Erklärungen über den Aufbau von analogen und digitalen Uhren sowie die verschiedenen Uhrzeiten. Diese werden bis auf Viertelstundenbasis erklärt, da dies eine gute Einstiegsgröße für Erstlernende ist. \n\nHÖHEPUNKTE\n• Auswahl zwischen zwei Uhrzeitsystemen („viertel nach 3“ und „viertel 4“)\n• Einstellungsmöglichkeit der Spielzeit\n• Elternbereich mit begleitenden pädagogischen Informationen \n• Spielerisches, audiovisuelles Lernen (ohne Text)\n• Uhr-Ausprobier-Modus mit Tag-Nacht-Wechsel am Fenster\n• Vierstufiges Belohnungssystem zur langfristigen Motivation \n• Individuell gestaltbarer Baubereich zur Förderung der Kreativität\n• Werbefrei und ohne In-App-Käufe\n• Gesprochen von der Original-Conni-Sprecherin aus den Hörbüchern\n\nLERNBEREICHE\n• Verstehen der Funktionsweise von analogen und digitalen Uhren \n• Verstehen von Tageszeiten\n• Einstellen von Uhrzeiten auf Analog- und Digitaluhr\n\nREAKTIONEN\n„Kinderleicht zu navigieren, stellt sich schnell das Gefühl ein, man spiele und lerne mit der beliebten Serienfigur fürs Leben. Bis man es kann!“ // Stuttgarter Zeitung\n\n„Habe diese App zum Uhrzeit lernen entdeckt und meine Tochter liebt sie!“ // App-Nutzer \n\n„Wir sind begeistert und nach nur 3 Wochen können wir inzwischen auch schon die schwierige Stufe angehen. Eine klare Empfehlung - was etwas heißen mag. Ich empfehle nur selten eine Lern-App weiter :)“ // App-Nutzer\n\nSUPPORT\nSie haben Fragen, Rückmeldungen oder Anregungen? Dann schreiben Sie uns gerne eine E-Mail an apps@carlsen.de.

I skal på få uger tilegne jer kompetencer inden for morfologisk og syntaktisk analyse, men det er svært at finde tid til at træne i lektionerne inden den endelige prøve. Med denne app kan du nu træne på egen hånd med øvelser, der er lavet af gymnasielærere, og som er tilpasset AP’s krav. Hvis alle i klassen har \"Træn AP\", kan man også bruge den i skoletiden - man kan fx starte en lektion med 5 minutters vendespil om verber eller tage en lille test om syntaktisk analyse til sidst i timen, når man er træt af tavle og blyant.\n\nVi tilføjer løbende nye tests og quizzer i appen. De fleste af teksterne er på dansk, men du finder også syntaktiske tests i engelsk, fransk, spansk og tysk. Almen sprogforståelse er nemlig med til at forbedre dine færdigheder i en lang række sprogfag på B og A-niveau i både 2g og 3g.\n\nTag udfordringen op, overrask din lærer, og træn AP på en sjovere måde!"

      "label": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training. It is yet another beautifully designed and easy-to-use app for kids“ by lilmagoolie.com"

Prøverne svarer til dem politiet bruger ved de rigtige teoriprøver til almindeligt kørekort (kategori B). Prøverne 1 til 7 er generelle teoriprøver, mens nr. 8 kun omhandler standsning og parkering. \n\nI teoriprøverne præsenteres du for 25 billeder af forskellige trafiksituationer. Til hvert billede er der et spørgsmål med 2-4 svarmuligheder. Ud for hver svarmulighed skal du vælge ”ja” eller ”nej”. \n\nEfter hvert billede får du at vide om du har svaret rigtigt eller forkert på svarmulighederne til det pågældende billede. Rigtige svar vises med grøn baggrund og forkerte svar vises med rød baggrund. Hvis du trykker på den røde baggrund vil du få en kort forklaring på hvorfor svaret er forkert. Når de 25 billeder er kørt igennem får du at vide om prøven er bestået."

Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text. This app never transmits data from your device.\n\n\nNote: Non-English localizations focus on solar system objects and constellation names."

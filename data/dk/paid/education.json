      "label": "The purpose of Crack the Reading Code is to teach what is practical for reading: \n- Shape\n- Writing direction\n- Sound. \n\nThese are the foundations of reading. \n\nChildren can acquire the essential knowledge that letters represent sounds, fit together and makes words that have meaning.\n \nThe content has been developed by experienced teachers - A supplement to writing textbooks and reading education\n\nChildren in kindergarten who are curious about letters will also think it's exciting. \n\n* THE SOUND OF THE LETTERS BEFORE THE NAMES.\n\nCrack the Reading Code uses exclusively letter sounds. \n\nChildren often learn the names of the letters instead of the sound of the letters. This means that they must apprehend something that they cannot use for their further reading. Often, they will have to relearn it when they are shown sounds at school that they have to use to read. \n\nBroadly speaking, they have no use for the letter names in the initial stages of reading. \n\n* THE 120 MOST USED WORDS AS WORD PICTURES.\n\nMany of the 120 most used words are not spelled as they sound. Therefore, it is a big help to recognize these as word pictures. \n\nChildren won't be forced to sound it out here, but instead just recognize the word like they recognize their own name or that a big yellow M means McDonald's. \n\nThat is why these 120 are trained as word pictures in Crack the Reading Code.\n\nUppercase letters for the intermediate learner.\n\nMany children first learn the 'big letters'. Of course, these must also be learned, but it should happen only when the child already recognizes the 'small letters.'\n\nIt is easier to relate to one shape per sound than two. \n\nWhen they have learned the lowercase letters, they can already recognize the letters in the books they must read. \n\nSwitching between the 'lowercase' and 'uppercase' in 'Settings.'\n\nSettings:\n\n-\tTurn the music in the menus on/off\n-\tHide the text direction. Hiding the text direction increases the level of difficulty.\n-\tSwitch between uppercase and lowercase letters. \n\nWe recommend that you only change to 'big letters' when the 'small letters' have been successfully learned.\n\nTarget audience:\n4 - 10 years (those who can't read or have a hard time doing so)."

Then you’ll love Busy Shapes designed for children from 2 years old!\n\n*** Featured in App Store Best of 2014 ***\n*** Featured worldwide by App Store as a Best New App ***\n*** Featured in the USA Today ***\n*** Recommended by The Good App Guide ***\n*** Common Sense Media Editors' Pick 2014 ***\n*** Parents‘ Choice Awards 2014 ***\n*** Children's Technology Review Awards 2014 ***\n\n> Inspired by the pioneering works of famed Swiss scientist and intelligence expert Jean Piaget (1896-1980)\n> Helps children improve their ability to handle simple objects through a series of engaging puzzles\n> Real-time dashboard to monitor progress\n> Includes an array of kid-friendly features, such as “passing” swipe control & more!\n\nABOUT BUSY SHAPES\nBusy Shapes helps children improve their ability to handle simple objects through a series of puzzles, in which they must change simple shapes and place them in proper holes. Along the way, the app responds to each child’s actions with positive guidance and motivation. Plus, the app’s digital exploratory playground regularly refreshes with different objects, which keeps children interested and engaged.\n\nINSPIRED BY JEAN PIAGET\nBusy Shapes is inspired by the pioneering works of famed Swiss scientist and intelligence expert Jean Piaget (1896-1980), who believed that “children are little scientists”, and that a child's thoughts are built through experiences that encourage him or her to engage in the reasoning process.\n\nINNOVATIVE, SCALEABLE PLATFORM\nBusy Shapes’ innovative scaleable platform for evolving experimentation lets children take advantage of the time they spend on touch screens -- so they aren’t just having fun, but learning every second of the way.\n\nKID-FRIENDLY DESIGN\nBusy Shapes features a special “kid-friendly” design that compensates for the fact that when young children hold an iPad or iPhone, they often have a finger touching the screen.\n\n“PASSING” SWIPE CONTROL\nBusy Shapes features “passing” swipe control that is essential for young children's quick hands (i.e. even if a child's finger reaches an object after he or she was already touching the screen, the object is still grasped as intended).\n\nPOWERFUL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)\nBusy Shapes’ powerful AI supports each child’s unique learning journey. For example, the AI tracks the time it takes each child to complete a level, and increases or decreases difficulty accordingly.\n\nGUIDED ACCESS\nTo prevent children from exiting the app by pressing the “home” button, Busy Shapes features a customizable Guided Access. This feature also disables selected parts of the screen for safety and protection.\n\nSEAMLESS INTERACTION\nBusy Shapes’ seamless interactive game area never blocks or limits children, and lets them freely access shapes. The menu is also neatly hidden away.\n\nAUTOMATIC MEMORY\nSometimes the best learning is a combination of cognitive exercise and physical play. Busy Shapes’ automatic memory saves a child’s place in any particular game, which makes the app an ideal complement to physical play and for shorter games.\n\nMULTIPLE LANGUAGE SUPPORT\nThe app is now available in: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Greek, Dutch, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Turkish, Russian, Korean, Indonesian, Malay, Vietnamese, Thai, Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese\n\nCONNECT WITH US!\nIf you have any support request, please write at support@edokiacademy.com or visit the Edoki Academy Online Community at edokiacademy.com."

      "label": "HVAD KAN LILLE MENNESKE 0-3 ÅR TILBYDE \n\nAppen henvender sig til dig, der har et lille barn eller arbejder med små børn. Her kan du lære om det lille barns udvikling og hente ideer til en sjov og stimulerende måde at være sammen på. \nFra fødslen til 3 år udvikler barnet sig til at kunne løbe, tale, tegne, danse og spille mv. Spiren til at udvikle sig ligger i barnet selv. Appen giver inspiration til, hvordan du kan skabe udviklingsrum for barnet fra den spæde alder og frem til 3 år.\n\nAppen er let at gå til. Den er inddelt i 7 alderstrin, hvor barnets udvikling og ideer til samvær er beskrevet indenfor 4 områder\n\n•\tsamvær og tæt kontakt\n•\tgrovmotorik og balance\n•\tfinmotorik og øje/hånd koordination\n•\tsprog og rytme.\n\n\nFORTÆLLINGER I BILLEDER, VIDEO OG TEKST \nAppen fortæller om, hvordan du kan opbygge tidlig tilknytning, stimulere f.eks. trille, krybe og kravle, udfordre håndens finmotorik, og hjælpe sproget på vej. Billeder og videoklip giver ideer til, hvordan du naturligt kan inddrage leg og aktivitet i hverdagen.  \nEn legetøjskasse bugner med ideer til legetøj indenfor hvert alderstrin - og en kort udviklingsbeskrivelse indenfor de 4 områder giver dig mulighed for at få et overblik over barnets udvikling. \nBevægelege og naturen som legeplads er to supplerende tilbud, som giver konkrete ideer til, hvordan du kan stimulere dit barns bevægeglæde og bruge naturen fra barnet er helt lille. \n\n\nLOGBOG MED MILEPÆLE \nLogbogen giver en oversigt over milepælene i barnets udvikling. Her kan du plotte ind, hvornår dit barn passerer de enkelte milepæle. Du kan supplere med beskrivelser af sjove oplevelser fra hverdagen og uploade billeder. \nHvis du registrerer dit barn med navn, køn og fødselsdag bliver appen mere personlig ved, at barnets navn indgår i teksten, og du vil modtage en push besked, når barnet går ind i et nyt alderstrin.  \n\n\nFORLAGET SKALMEJE\nDenne app er udgivet af forlaget Skalmeje, der udgiver materialer om børn og deres udvikling. Den er udarbejdet af 2 sundhedsplejersker, der har arbejdet med børn og deres familier både forskningsmæssigt og i praksis i mange år. Appen er en videreudvikling af pjecen Lille menneske stor udvikling 0 – 3 år, som har været på markedet i mange år. \n\nOphavsret: Copyright Forlaget Skalmeje\n\nhttps://lillemenneske.dk/"

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Teach your toddler what an airplane, truck, and train sound like in a way that they will love.\n\nEach tile you touch opens up and reveals an exciting picture that plays a sound. The images rotate so that children can learn to identify the object, not just the single image that is shown.\n\nParents and children alike love this app and you will too! Download and play with your baby,\ntoddler or young children -- it's easy to learn and can entertain for hours.\n\nListen to the sounds made by both nature and machines. From boats, firetrucks, and\nhorse-drawn carriages to ducks, tigers, and birds. Each animal or object is like its own flash card; when opened, it plays a sound that is sure to stimulate each child and leave them with awe and wonder. This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch. Let them explore and learn with their senses. Parents of children with autism have found this app helpful in engaging their children, but truly it is for anyone that wants to teach their kids something new while stimulating and training their brains.\n\nEvery animal, transportation mode, and tile has five different sounds linked, so children can learn different sounds and images associated with objects. Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

      "label": "Her kan du på en sjov og anderledes måde træne begreberne i gymnasiefaget AP. Du kan terpe de latinske betegnelser ved at spille vendespil, du kan quizze om morfemer, adverbialled og ledsætninger, samt teste dig selv i eksamenslignende analyser af tekst.\n\nDu kan løbende se, hvordan din personlige score forbedres, og du kan battle (godmodigt!) med din sidemand i klassen.\n\nAP tæller med i karaktergennemsnittet på eksamensbeviset, og fagets læreplan har højnet kravene til jer elever. I skal på få uger tilegne jer kompetencer inden for morfologisk og syntaktisk analyse, men det er svært at finde tid til at træne i lektionerne inden den endelige prøve. Med denne app kan du nu træne på egen hånd med øvelser, der er lavet af gymnasielærere, og som er tilpasset AP’s krav. Hvis alle i klassen har \"Træn AP\", kan man også bruge den i skoletiden - man kan fx starte en lektion med 5 minutters vendespil om verber eller tage en lille test om syntaktisk analyse til sidst i timen, når man er træt af tavle og blyant.\n\nVi tilføjer løbende nye tests og quizzer i appen. De fleste af teksterne er på dansk, men du finder også syntaktiske tests i engelsk, fransk, spansk og tysk. Almen sprogforståelse er nemlig med til at forbedre dine færdigheder i en lang række sprogfag på B og A-niveau i både 2g og 3g.\n\nTag udfordringen op, overrask din lærer, og træn AP på en sjovere måde!"

Be puzzled no more, because the best way is with \"Music Color\" for your touch device.\n\n\"Music Color\" is almost alive. It's an incredible combination of a kid-friendly interface, astonishing imagery and classical music. Those three elements combine to produce a spectacular product that is unlike anything else seen on the App Store. \n\nThe sole purpose of this app is to educate. To be more specific, it educates your children in a very specific field – color. What they will see upon opening the app is a palette of colors. Simply tap any one you like and you will dive into the world of that particular color. \n\nLet's take Blue for example. Tap blue and you will see cartoon-style objects that you may associate that color with, like the ocean, or a blue umbrella. There are 9 objects for every color. When you tap each object you will be taken on a journey around the world with spectacular photos of where these objects are found. \n\nNot only will you kids love it, but your jaw will literally drop when you see some of the photos. And for each object, there are 5 photos. So if you do the math, 12 colors, 9 objects per color and 5 photos per object, which equals a staggering 540 incredible photos!\n\nOverall this app will entertain you just as much if not more than your learning child. With so many incredible photos to explore, you’ll love sitting down with your kid to show them what colors are all about. \n\nSee also:\n\n· Sound Touch\n· Sound Touch 2\n· Video Touch - Animals\n· Video Touch - Wildlife\n· Video Touch - Birds\n· Video Touch - Bugs & Insects\n· Video Touch - Vehicles\n· Video Touch - Music\n· The Strawberry Garden"

      "label": "Fonitterne er et sjovt og motiverende læringsspil, som styrker børns lydlige bevidsthed og giver dem mulighed for at træne deres udtalefærdigheder. \n\nFonitterne henvender sig til børn fra 3-7-årsalderen og er udviklet til at hjælpe børn med fonologiske udtalevanskeligheder. Spillets forløb er inspireret af P.O.P.T.-metoden (Psycholinguistisch orientierte Phonologie-Therapie, Fox-Boyer (2015)) og træner barnets lydlige bevidsthed gennem en række skelne-, og imitationsøvelser, der netop er målrettet de områder af lydsystemet, som er vanskelige for det enkelte barn. \nSpillet er udformet som et computerrollespil, hvor spilleren udforsker en ukendt verden, som bebos af små væsener kaldet fonitter. Spilleren har til opgave at finde og fange en bestemt type fonitter, fx alle dem, der siger stavelser eller ord med s.\n\nI Fonitterne understøtter vi 9 af de hyppigste fonologiske processer hos danske børn, så børn med fonologiske udtalevanskeligheder kan arbejde med lige netop de lydpar og kontraster, de har størst glæde af:\n\nFonologiske processer i Fonitterne: \n\n-\tFronting ( k -> t, g -> d, ng -> n, sj -> s )\n-\tBacking ( t -> k, d -> g, n -> ng, s -> sj )\n-\tStopping ( f -> b, s -> d )\n-\tLateralisering ( j -> l, r -> l )\n-\tNasalering ( l -> n)\n-\tH-sering ( r -> h )\n-\tAspiration ( b -> p, d -> t, g -> k )\n-\tDeaspiration ( p -> b, t -> d, k -> g )\n-\tGlidning ( l -> j )\n\nDet er vores vision, at spillet kan bruges som supplement til den logopædiske undervisning – derfor har vi udviklet et separat lærermodul, hvor barnets talepædagog har mulighed for at oprette et træningsforløb til barnet med relevante hjemmeopgaver. Herfra kan talepædagogen følge med i barnets progression gennem spillets lytte- og udtaleøvelser og se statistik om barnets typiske fejl.

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

      "label": "Fiete World invites your child to explore a large open play world and invent their own stories.\n\nImmerse yourself in adventures with Fiete, his friends and his pets.\nHundreds of objects are waiting for you. You can travel around the world with numerous flying objects, cars and ships.\nYou can disguise yourself as a Viking, pirate or pilot. \n\nWith its numerous objects, this \"\"digital doll's house\"\" is perfect for creative role-playing.\nYour children will learn about the special features of different countries (Mexico, USA, India, France, the Caribbean and Germany) and discover differences but also numerous similarities.\nTo ensure that no child feels excluded, Fiete World contains a variety of people with different skin colours.\n\nNEW in this version: \nMEXICO\nWith horses, jeep, or pick-up truck through the jungle, walking through the city with a huge mechanical skeleton or with a hot air balloon over the cactus-covered desert. \nFeeding jungle animals, making chocolate, painting murals, making tacos or fighting with wrestlers. Mexico offers a lot of extreme variety.\n\nUSA\nChildren can ride a Ferris wheel in the colourful theme park and re-enact the moon landing or Jurassic Park in the film studio. They play with Kong the giant ape, visit the school and the record shop and when they are hungry they visit the burger shop or eat something at the hot dog stand. Then they can go to work at the harbour, play with the crane and unload ships.\n\nFRANCE\nIn venerable France, for example, children can sit in the evening in a chic café on the Seine under the Eiffel Tower, or they can play robber and gendarme with the police. Of course there is also a police helicopter, a police boat and a police car.\n\nINDIA\nIn densely populated India, the children can harvest tropical fruits and squeeze juices, change tires in the Auto Werkstadt, ride an elephant or work on the latest robot technology. What is particularly exciting here are the clear contrasts between tradition and technology.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS OF THE APP\n- Discover a huge world\n- Switch between day and night mode\n- Go on a treasure hunt, sail the pirate ship\n- Ride an elephant, dinosaur \n- Play with a robot or with a huge skeleton\n- Fell trees and use the wood to make a fire\n- Disguise yourself\n- plant flowers and vegetables\n- Change the wheels of all cars\n- Bake a cake\n- Fly a helicopter, a jet, a historic aircraft, a hot air balloon or a U.F.O.\n- have a picnic on the beach - deliver packages\n- Send postcards around the world\n- Discover souvenirs from all over the world in Fiete's room\n\nIMPROVE CHILDREN\n- Fantasy role playing games\n- Telling your own stories\n- Experiment\n- Interaction with others\n- Understanding the world\n- Open-mindedness\n\nABOUT US\nWe are Ahoiii, a small app development studio from Cologne.

      "label": "MyMemo is a highly customizable memory game where you can use your own photos, audio, and text to create educational matching cards. With the split deck functionality you can even create decks where different cards constitute a pair!\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Designed by Swedish preschool teachers\r\n- Create personal memory decks by adding pictures, sounds, and text\r\n- Define pairs using same image or pairs using different images\r\n- Play the game with 6, 8, 12, 16 or 20 cards\r\n- Four built-in decks and five audio languages\r\n- Intuitive child-friendly controls for play and create mode\r\n- Child proof settings and edit lock mode\r\n- Ability to disable sounds for kids with special needs\r\n\r\nSplit decks is a unique feature of MyMemo: the ability to create cards which match with each other based on a relationship instead of matching with its identical twin (e.g., “Cow” matching with “calf”, instead of the usual “cow” and “cow”). This feature makes it a flexible tool to use in a teaching setting, allowing teachers to re-enforce a wide range of relationships such as rhyming words, relationships between adult and child animals, big and small letters, colors, and more.\r\n\r\nThe game comes with 4 high-quality built-in decks to get you started (Vehicles, Tools, Fruits and Vegetables, and Animals), with audio localized in 5 different languages (English, Spanish, German, French and Swedish). However, the real value of MyMemo lies in the educational possibilities offered by creating your own memory decks. For example:\r\n\r\n- Ask kids to make their own deck based on a certain theme, e.g. seasons, colors, objects that begin with a particular letter, etc.\r\n- Create decks where the audio recordings give fun little instructions relevant to the image, e.g. “bark like a dog three times”.\r\n- Create split memory decks with items that rhyme with each other.\r\n- Teach upper case and lower case alphabets with split deck.\r\n\r\nIn the settings menu you can also turn off the edit mode, so you can safely pass the device to the child without risking any inadvertent changes. Additionally, you can turn off the sound effects in case you are teaching kids with special needs who may be sensitive to sudden sounds.\r\n\r\nMyMemo has a polished graphical user interface designed to be intuitive enough for children to use,  making both the play mode and creation mode easy, fun, and educational for kids to use. What better way for children of a preschool class to learn than to build their own decks and then share with their classmates?\r\n\r\nFor a full list of features and a user manual for the game please visit our website at: http://www.appfamilygames.com/mymemo/"

One-off naps can be triggered by tapping Moon's nose 3 times or tap it 6 times for an immediate sunrise.\n\nGet tips and keep up-to-date by visiting Sun to Moon Sleep Clock on the web:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/suntomoonsleepclock\nhttps://twitter.com/s2msleepclock\nhttp://www.msibley.com/sleep-clock\n\nOther features include...\n• Super-easy to operate with a built-in help system.\n• Soothing sleep sounds with adjustable duration setting: Whale song, heartbeat, fan, white noise (hair dryer), harp music, washing machine, clock ticking, breaking waves, music box, sleigh bells, meditation or off.\n• Speaking clock function - tap Sun or Moon's mouth to activate (optional). \n• Wacky wake-up sounds:  Digital beeps, dawn chorus, cock-a-doodle-doo, charge fanfare, parrot, cat meowing, trumpet, bongos, cheerful tune, Happy Birthday, Santa/Jingle Bells, Easter, rocket launch, rock'n'roll, sleep sound repeat or off.\n• Digital or analog clock modes with large digit digital option.\n• Friendly Sun and Moon characters with interchangeable outfits and accessories.\n• Predefined themes including Birthday, Christmas, Easter, Pirates, Sports and Space.\n• Shooting star night-time progress bar.\n• Visual sunset and sunrise with custom artwork by artist Michael Sibley (http://www.msibley.com).\n• Optional Snooze Reward system to gently incentivize staying in bed. \n• Star countdown with 26 stars removed at regular intervals through the night.

An additional 3 taps triggers an immediate sunrise. \n• Parental settings pin code lock with Face & Touch ID support.  The settings master pin is 8529.\n• Dimmable night setting to reduce glare and save energy, accessible from the settings or by tapping the clock digits 3 times.\n• Dark mode to reduce blue glow at night.  \n• Sleep Clock stand & Hologram mode -  Get crafty and make your device little-finger-proof with a Sleep Clock stand and hologram adapter.  The Sleep Clock stand covers the device's physical buttons whilst hologram mode takes it one step further and gives the impression of Sun and Moon hovering in mid-air.  Full instructions for creating your bespoke stand and hologram viewer can be found on my website at http://www.msibley.com/sleep-clock-stand, where you will also be able to download templates.  \n\nNote: Please ensure your device is plugged in and that notifications are silenced whilst using this app. If you forget your settings pin the master code is 8529. If using this app on an OLED screen (the iPhone X for example), it is a good idea to reduce the screen brightness and enable auto-dim mode for long periods of use.\n\nTo disable the home and lock buttons of your device whilst using this app, please use IOS Guided Access Mode. \n\nIf you find the app useful or have any suggestions then I'd really appreciate a rating in the App Store. Positive reviews encourage me to keep working on the app and constructive feedback provides me with new ideas that I always try to implement if possible.  Thank you!"

Det er noget af det mest grundlæggende for vores læseforståelse og noget der skal øves og øves indtil det ligger helt naturligt på rygraden. \n\nFørst når man mestrer denne del af læsningen, giver det mening, overskud og selvtillid at gå videre med længere og sværere ord.\n\n- Målrettet og effektiv træning\nLæseguld er udelukkende til rå, effektiv læsetræning og indeholder ikke distraherende elementer under selve træningen. Det er vigtigt, da det kræver meget koncentration at lære og at automatisere lydmetoden i læsning. \n\nLæseguld er udviklet i samarbejde med Time2learn og er en oplagt efterfølger til læringssuccesen Knæk Læsekoden.\n\n- Træningsmetoden\nDet kan for mange være en lang og svær proces at lære lydmetoden. Både for forældre, der ikke har forudsætningerne for at lære den fra sig og for børn, der synes det er svært. Derfor er det tit denne del af læseprocessen, der ikke bliver trænet nok.\n\nDer skal gives god tid til at lytte og smage på lydene og derudfra høre, om det er noget, der giver mening eller ej. Det er en god idé også selv at sige lydene højt og lade lydene ’læse’ ordet.\n\nDet er bogstavernes standardlyde, der benyttes. Dog er der også medtaget de vigtige lyde: \n•-e (fx løve) \n•-er (løver) \n•-d (blødt d, fx blad) \n•-g (blødt g fx dage). \n\nDer er ikke benyttet stumme bogstaver (fx hund) og vokalglidning (fx smøkke for smykke).\n\n- Supplement til skrivehæfter \nVi anbefaler 10 minutters træning om dagen.Det er godt at træne sammen med en voksen de første par gange, så kan man hjælpe hinanden og snakke om metoden. \n\nNår ordene i Læseguld er automatiseret, anbefaler vi, at træne videre med Læseguld 2, der indeholder vanskeligere ord med blandt andet dobbelt konsonanter i forlyden.\n\n------\n\n- Udviklet af eksperter\nAlle ordene der er med i Læseguld er nøje udvalgt og inddelt i sværhedsgrader. Dette er gjort af erfarne lærere, der har specialiseret sig i børn med læsevanskeligheder.\n\nOrdene er ord som børn kender og alle ordene er lydrette, så fokus kommer på lydmetoden - at sætte lyde sammen til ord. \n\nMålgruppe: 5-13 år"

It includes the ability to filter search results, and to save definitions to a Favourites list. There are currently over 24,000 Māori headword entries in the database, which is being added to over time. An offline dictionary has also been included when internet connectivity is not available.\n\nAs well as English meanings, it has example sentences with translations for many entries. It even has photographs and audio clips for Aotearoa/New Zealand native fauna and photographs of flora, important people and other items where a photograph will aid understanding.\n\nIn addition to the words one would expect in a traditional dictionary, it also has encyclopaedic entries designed to provide key information about plants, animals, stars, planets, heavenly bodies, important Māori people, key ancestors of traditional narratives, tribal groups, ancestral canoes, song types, musical instruments, Māori names for institutions, country names, place names and other proper names. There are also detailed explanations of key concepts central to Māori culture. Comprehensive explanations for grammatical items are included, with examples of usage, as are idioms and colloquialisms with their meanings and examples.\n\nThe Te Aka Maori app is the companion to the popular www.maoridictionary.co.nz website and forms part of the Te Whanake Māori Language learning series."

In this way, the app prompts the user to count backwards from ten followed by a deep breath.\n \nThe app also includes a simple social story with line drawings about anger. The social story talks about feeling angry and things you can do, like counting to ten, breathing deeply and taking a break, to calm yourself down.  \n\nThe settings screen allows you to choose from male, female or no vocals for counting back from ten and for reading the social story out loud."

      "label": "Gode læsefærdigheder giver børn de bedste muligheder for at lære hele vejen op gennem skoleårene. Lær at læse med Lola er den tiende læringsapp med Lola Panda.\n\nDe fleste førskolebørn synes det er sjovt at lege med ord og rim. På den måde udvikler de deres fonologiske bevidsthed uden egentlig at vide det. En veludviklet fonologisk bevidsthed gør børn i stand til at lave et ord om til et andet ved at tilføje, fjerne eller bytte et bogstav ud med et andet, som for eksempel hat - kat - skat. \n\nForskere mener, at det er meget vigtigt for de tidlige læsefærdigheder at børn har en fornemmelse for sprogets form, med andre ord, at de har evnen til at rime.\n\n* Lær at læse med Lola indeholder 9 sværhedsgrader:\nLet niveau 1: Lette ord, som ender på de samme bogstaver, en – ben\nLet niveau 2: Enkle ord, som ender på de samme bogstaver, øm – søm\nLet niveau 3: Ikke helt enkle ord, som ender på de samme bogstaver, em - hjem\nMiddelniveau 1: Hverdagsord, som ender på de samme bogstaver, ad - ostemad\nMiddelniveau 2: Mindre almindelige ord, som ender på de samme bogstaver, ot - robot\nMiddelniveau 3: Vanskeligere ord, som ender på de samme bogstaver, ir - papir - gevir\nSvært niveau 1: Udfordrende ord, der ender på de samme og forskellige bogstaver, jord - bor - meteor\nSvært niveau 2: Vanskeligere ord, der ender på de samme og forskellige bogstaver, bageplade - kladde - facade\nSvært niveau 3: Svære ord, der ender på de samme og forskellige bogstaver, klods - candyfloss – los\n\n* Desuden får du en omfattende fremskridtsmåler\n\nLær at læse med Lola egner sig til de børn, der synes at Lolas alfabettog og Lolas ABC-fest er for lette, men som endnu ikke er helt fortrolige med at læse. Lær at læse med Lola passer glimrende til børn i 0. og 1. klasse og kan spilles i fællesskab eller individuelt.\n\nBørn kan bruge appen selv ved at starte med det letteste niveau. Efterhånden som barnet lærer og løser flere opgaver korrekt, fortsætter appen automatisk til sværere niveauer. Lærere eller forældre kan også vælge det niveau, de mener vil give barnet de udfordringer det har behov for.\n\nFind alle vores spil på den officielle Lola Panda-side: www.lolapanda.com\n\nSynes om os på Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/lolapanda"

      "label": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

      "label": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training. It is yet another beautifully designed and easy-to-use app for kids“ by lilmagoolie.com"

Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

Because Solar Walk knows what time it is, the planets are in proper orientation to the Sun: Earth is dark where it is currently night and gradually lightens to daytime on the other side.” - NY Times\n\n\"It's great for showing my students the relative positions of the planets in the solar system, the satellites orbiting the Earth and our place in the galaxy. Awesome with a smartboard as well.\" - by jbrown61\n\nSolar Walk enables you to:\n\n► Observe 3D model of our Solar system with all its objects in real time and in a ​proper orientation.

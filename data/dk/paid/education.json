      "label": "HVAD KAN LILLE MENNESKE 0-3 ÅR TILBYDE \n\nAppen henvender sig til dig, der har et lille barn eller arbejder med små børn. Her kan du lære om det lille barns udvikling og hente ideer til en sjov og stimulerende måde at være sammen på. \nFra fødslen til 3 år udvikler barnet sig til at kunne løbe, tale, tegne, danse og spille mv. Spiren til at udvikle sig ligger i barnet selv. Appen giver inspiration til, hvordan du kan skabe udviklingsrum for barnet fra den spæde alder og frem til 3 år.\n\nAppen er let at gå til. Den er inddelt i 7 alderstrin, hvor barnets udvikling og ideer til samvær er beskrevet indenfor 4 områder\n\n•\tsamvær og tæt kontakt\n•\tgrovmotorik og balance\n•\tfinmotorik og øje/hånd koordination\n•\tsprog og rytme.\n\n\nFORTÆLLINGER I BILLEDER, VIDEO OG TEKST \nAppen fortæller om, hvordan du kan opbygge tidlig tilknytning, stimulere f.eks. trille, krybe og kravle, udfordre håndens finmotorik, og hjælpe sproget på vej. Billeder og videoklip giver ideer til, hvordan du naturligt kan inddrage leg og aktivitet i hverdagen.  \nEn legetøjskasse bugner med ideer til legetøj indenfor hvert alderstrin - og en kort udviklingsbeskrivelse indenfor de 4 områder giver dig mulighed for at få et overblik over barnets udvikling. \nBevægelege og naturen som legeplads er to supplerende tilbud, som giver konkrete ideer til, hvordan du kan stimulere dit barns bevægeglæde og bruge naturen fra barnet er helt lille. \n\n\nLOGBOG MED MILEPÆLE \nLogbogen giver en oversigt over milepælene i barnets udvikling. Her kan du plotte ind, hvornår dit barn passerer de enkelte milepæle. Du kan supplere med beskrivelser af sjove oplevelser fra hverdagen og uploade billeder. \nHvis du registrerer dit barn med navn, køn og fødselsdag bliver appen mere personlig ved, at barnets navn indgår i teksten, og du vil modtage en push besked, når barnet går ind i et nyt alderstrin.  \n\n\nFORLAGET SKALMEJE\nDenne app er udgivet af forlaget Skalmeje, der udgiver materialer om børn og deres udvikling. Den er udarbejdet af 2 sundhedsplejersker, der har arbejdet med børn og deres familier både forskningsmæssigt og i praksis i mange år. Appen er en videreudvikling af pjecen Lille menneske stor udvikling 0 – 3 år, som har været på markedet i mange år. \n\nOphavsret: Copyright Forlaget Skalmeje\n\nhttps://lillemenneske.dk/"

Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "Fonitterne er et sjovt og motiverende læringsspil, som styrker børns lydlige bevidsthed og giver dem mulighed for at træne deres udtalefærdigheder. \n\nFonitterne henvender sig til børn fra 3-7-årsalderen og er udviklet til at hjælpe børn med fonologiske udtalevanskeligheder. Spillets forløb er inspireret af P.O.P.T.-metoden (Psycholinguistisch orientierte Phonologie-Therapie, Fox-Boyer (2015)) og træner barnets lydlige bevidsthed gennem en række skelne-, og imitationsøvelser, der netop er målrettet de områder af lydsystemet, som er vanskelige for det enkelte barn. \nSpillet er udformet som et computerrollespil, hvor spilleren udforsker en ukendt verden, som bebos af små væsener kaldet fonitter. Spilleren har til opgave at finde og fange en bestemt type fonitter, fx alle dem, der siger stavelser eller ord med s.\n\nI Fonitterne understøtter vi 9 af de hyppigste fonologiske processer hos danske børn, så børn med fonologiske udtalevanskeligheder kan arbejde med lige netop de lydpar og kontraster, de har størst glæde af:\n\nFonologiske processer i Fonitterne: \n\n-\tFronting ( k -> t, g -> d, ng -> n, sj -> s )\n-\tBacking ( t -> k, d -> g, n -> ng, s -> sj )\n-\tStopping ( f -> b, s -> d )\n-\tLateralisering ( j -> l, r -> l )\n-\tNasalering ( l -> n)\n-\tH-sering ( r -> h )\n-\tAspiration ( b -> p, d -> t, g -> k )\n-\tDeaspiration ( p -> b, t -> d, k -> g )\n-\tGlidning ( l -> j )\n\nDet er vores vision, at spillet kan bruges som supplement til den logopædiske undervisning – derfor har vi udviklet et separat lærermodul, hvor barnets talepædagog har mulighed for at oprette et træningsforløb til barnet med relevante hjemmeopgaver. Herfra kan talepædagogen følge med i barnets progression gennem spillets lytte- og udtaleøvelser og se statistik om barnets typiske fejl.

      "label": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training. It is yet another beautifully designed and easy-to-use app for kids“ by lilmagoolie.com"

      "label": "Appnyt.dk: “Det er en helt fantastisk følelse for barnet og den der underviser, når læsning bliver til Læseguld.”\n\n- Seriøs lærings-app til den tidlige læsetræning\nLær at sætte bogstavslyde sammen til rigtige ord. Det er noget af det mest grundlæggende for vores læseforståelse og noget der skal øves og øves indtil det ligger helt naturligt på rygraden. \n\nFørst når man mestrer denne del af læsningen, giver det mening, overskud og selvtillid at gå videre med længere og sværere ord.\n\n- Målrettet og effektiv træning\nLæseguld er udelukkende til rå, effektiv læsetræning og indeholder ikke distraherende elementer under selve træningen. Det er vigtigt, da det kræver meget koncentration at lære og at automatisere lydmetoden i læsning. \n\nLæseguld er udviklet i samarbejde med Time2learn og er en oplagt efterfølger til læringssuccesen Knæk Læsekoden.\n\n- Træningsmetoden\nDet kan for mange være en lang og svær proces at lære lydmetoden. Både for forældre, der ikke har forudsætningerne for at lære den fra sig og for børn, der synes det er svært. Derfor er det tit denne del af læseprocessen, der ikke bliver trænet nok.\n\nDer skal gives god tid til at lytte og smage på lydene og derudfra høre, om det er noget, der giver mening eller ej. Det er en god idé også selv at sige lydene højt og lade lydene ’læse’ ordet.\n\nDet er bogstavernes standardlyde, der benyttes. Dog er der også medtaget de vigtige lyde: \n•-e (fx løve) \n•-er (løver) \n•-d (blødt d, fx blad) \n•-g (blødt g fx dage). \n\nDer er ikke benyttet stumme bogstaver (fx hund) og vokalglidning (fx smøkke for smykke).\n\n- Supplement til skrivehæfter \nVi anbefaler 10 minutters træning om dagen.Det er godt at træne sammen med en voksen de første par gange, så kan man hjælpe hinanden og snakke om metoden. \n\nNår ordene i Læseguld er automatiseret, anbefaler vi, at træne videre med Læseguld 2, der indeholder vanskeligere ord med blandt andet dobbelt konsonanter i forlyden.\n\n------\n\n- Udviklet af eksperter\nAlle ordene der er med i Læseguld er nøje udvalgt og inddelt i sværhedsgrader. Dette er gjort af erfarne lærere, der har specialiseret sig i børn med læsevanskeligheder.\n\nOrdene er ord som børn kender og alle ordene er lydrette, så fokus kommer på lydmetoden - at sætte lyde sammen til ord. \n\nMålgruppe: 5-13 år"

      "label": "The purpose of Crack the Reading Code is to teach what is practical for reading: \n- Shape\n- Writing direction\n- Sound. \n\nThese are the foundations of reading. \n\nChildren can acquire the essential knowledge that letters represent sounds, fit together and makes words that have meaning.\n \nThe content has been developed by experienced teachers - A supplement to writing textbooks and reading education\n\nChildren in kindergarten who are curious about letters will also think it's exciting. \n\n* THE SOUND OF THE LETTERS BEFORE THE NAMES.\n\nCrack the Reading Code uses exclusively letter sounds. \n\nChildren often learn the names of the letters instead of the sound of the letters. This means that they must apprehend something that they cannot use for their further reading. Often, they will have to relearn it when they are shown sounds at school that they have to use to read. \n\nBroadly speaking, they have no use for the letter names in the initial stages of reading. \n\n* THE 120 MOST USED WORDS AS WORD PICTURES.\n\nMany of the 120 most used words are not spelled as they sound. Therefore, it is a big help to recognize these as word pictures. \n\nChildren won't be forced to sound it out here, but instead just recognize the word like they recognize their own name or that a big yellow M means McDonald's. \n\nThat is why these 120 are trained as word pictures in Crack the Reading Code.\n\nUppercase letters for the intermediate learner.\n\nMany children first learn the 'big letters'. Of course, these must also be learned, but it should happen only when the child already recognizes the 'small letters.'\n\nIt is easier to relate to one shape per sound than two. \n\nWhen they have learned the lowercase letters, they can already recognize the letters in the books they must read. \n\nSwitching between the 'lowercase' and 'uppercase' in 'Settings.'\n\nSettings:\n\n-\tTurn the music in the menus on/off\n-\tHide the text direction. Hiding the text direction increases the level of difficulty.\n-\tSwitch between uppercase and lowercase letters. \n\nWe recommend that you only change to 'big letters' when the 'small letters' have been successfully learned.\n\nTarget audience:\n4 - 10 years (those who can't read or have a hard time doing so)."

When choosing one of the wild animals (lions, and tigers, bears, etc.), your child will watch 10-20 seconds video clips. For example - a family of elephants splashing in cool water with their trunks, zebras walking around with birds on their backs, a giraffe leaning down its long neck to sip some water. Each animal rotates through 4 separate videos with each tap from your child. Perfect and simple!\n\nFEATURES: \n* Voice over in 19 languages. (In the device \"Settings\" -> \"VideoTouch\")\n* 48 video clips of wild animals.\n* 4 rotating videos for each animal.\n* Works together with the other \"Video Touch\" apps.\n\nDownload this precious app for your little one, it will teach them a lot and your child will just think it’s fun!\n\n-------------\n\nNote: In \"Video Touch\" the categories are actually different apps, but you can switch between them using the toolbar.\n\nAt first when switching apps, there will be popup messages, asking if you would like to jump into another app.\n\nWe suggest showing the children which is the correct button in order to proceed, and after some time of use these messages will gradually disappear.\n\n-------------\n\nCheck out also:\n\n· The Strawberry Garden\n· Sound Touch\n· Sound Touch 2\n· Music Color\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SoundTouchInteractive"

This app is designed for very young children, even if they cannot read yet, to learn about our solar system!\n\nYou will be pleasantly surprised how much you child will learn and remember with this app. Children love the vivid images and the audio descriptions of the planets. They may even memorize a fact or two about our amazing solar system!\n\nIn a simple way, the app teaches children about each planet's location, size, orbit time, temperature, composition, and more.\n\nChildren love big numbers, and there are plenty in this app!\n\nThe Information Center contains informative data on each planet. The solar system is shown to scale for children to be able to visualize the planet distances from the sun, as well as, their relative sizes!\n\nThe Planet Sizes activity allows children to drag the planets across the screen to get a feel for their relative sizes and learn the order of the planets. Each planet will \"snap\" into place and it's name will be heard aloud when it is dragged to the correct position.\n\nThe Planet Orbits activity allows children to observe the relative speeds of orbit for each planet in proportion to Earth.\n\nThe Planet Card Matching activity contains the famous Three-Part Card System used in Montessori Classrooms. Children can drag the picture cards and labels to match them up to the control cards at the top.\n\nWe've packed a ton of information into an app that is designed specifically to teach young minds! Thank you for your support!\n\nVisit our website: http://www.mobilemontessori.org\n\nApp page: http://www.mobilemontessori.org/solarsystem"

      "label": "We received the \"Editor´s Choice\" award by Apple for \"Little Fox Animal Doctor\" And in addition our app was awarded the \"Tech with Kids' Best Pick Award\" for exceptional design of a children's app. \n\nLittle Fox has caught a cold. Can you help to find him a cure? The bat has broken its wing. Do you know what to do? \n\nWhether a bump on the head, a stomach ache from too much candy, a little wound, or a sunburn, these funny animals need the help of a really good doctor! \n\nFrom Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger, the illustrator and director behind the bestseller Apps „Nighty Night“, „Little Fox Music Box“ and „Nighty Night Circus“ comes a wonderful new 3D-App which your child will love! \n\nThe app is full of humorous animations, amazing 3D illustrations, and funny short movies. In the animal doctor’s office, located in a magical treehouse, the animals are waiting to be cured. Kids are playfully guided through applying treatments that they might have experienced themselves: measuring temperatures, taking medicine, getting a plaster. And of course, eating a snail is probably just good for owls!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n\nHighlights:  \n\n1.There are 7 animals in the App - fox, bat, rabbit, mole, hedgehog, spider and owl, with 21 different injuries, sicknesses, and diseases.                                                                                                      \n2. Your child has many different treatments and medicines to choose from to cure the animals and make them happy again. \n3. Every time your child plays the App the animals have different illnesses, injuries and diseases.                                                                                             \n4. Little Fox Animal Doctor is the first 3D-App by Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger. She is also the creative genius behind Nighty Night, Little Fox Music Box and Nighty Night Circus. Her Apps have been downloaded over 5 million times worldwide.                                                                                                                                  \n\nThe App will make your children’s dreams of being an Animal Doctor come true!\n\nAbout Fox & Sheep:\nWe are a Studio in Berlin and develop high quality apps for kids at the age of 2-8 years. We are parents ourselves and work passionately and with a lot of commitment on our products. We work with the best illustrators and animators around the world to create and present the best apps possible – to enrich the lives of our and your kids."

Gain an understanding of what the \"vortex of creation\" means and how you can use meditation to enter the vortex in order to allow the Law of Attraction to work for you. Also gain valuable insights about what happens to your affirmations and manifestation efforts when you are out of the vortex.  Five guided meditation audio sessions with music are included in this app.  \n\nListeners will be led by Abraham through four guided meditation sessions on these topics: General Well-Being, Financial Abundance, Physical Well-Being and Relationships.   Each guided meditation experience is 15 minutes long.   \n\nThis Vortex of Attraction Guided Meditation iPhone App is an exact duplicate of the physical product and includes the complete written text, and the complete audio recording along with an extra bonus track of guided meditation music which was not included with the original product.\n\nMany people exert manifestation and Law of Attraction efforts outside of the Vortex, and then conclude that the Law of Attraction \"doesn't work.\" Find out how to stop efforting and start allowing the Vortex of Creation to align you with the life you desire.  These are the first guided meditation recordings ever produced containing the Teachings of Abraham."

Du kan terpe de latinske betegnelser ved at spille vendespil, du kan quizze om morfemer, adverbialled og ledsætninger, samt teste dig selv i eksamenslignende analyser af tekst.\n\nDu kan løbende se, hvordan din personlige score forbedres, og du kan battle (godmodigt!) med din sidemand i klassen.\n\nAP tæller med i karaktergennemsnittet på eksamensbeviset, og fagets læreplan har højnet kravene til jer elever. I skal på få uger tilegne jer kompetencer inden for morfologisk og syntaktisk analyse, men det er svært at finde tid til at træne i lektionerne inden den endelige prøve. Med denne app kan du nu træne på egen hånd med øvelser, der er lavet af gymnasielærere, og som er tilpasset AP’s krav. Hvis alle i klassen har \"Træn AP\", kan man også bruge den i skoletiden - man kan fx starte en lektion med 5 minutters vendespil om verber eller tage en lille test om syntaktisk analyse til sidst i timen, når man er træt af tavle og blyant.\n\nVi tilføjer løbende nye tests og quizzer i appen. De fleste af teksterne er på dansk, men du finder også syntaktiske tests i engelsk, fransk, spansk og tysk. Almen sprogforståelse er nemlig med til at forbedre dine færdigheder i en lang række sprogfag på B og A-niveau i både 2g og 3g.\n\nTag udfordringen op, overrask din lærer, og træn AP på en sjovere måde!"

      "label": "There's never been a better time to get into Astronomy! Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

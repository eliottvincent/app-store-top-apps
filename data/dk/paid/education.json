      "label": "HVAD KAN LILLE MENNESKE 0-3 ÅR TILBYDE \n\nAppen henvender sig til dig, der har et lille barn eller arbejder med små børn. Her kan du lære om det lille barns udvikling og hente ideer til en sjov og stimulerende måde at være sammen på. \nFra fødslen til 3 år udvikler barnet sig til at kunne løbe, tale, tegne, danse og spille mv. Spiren til at udvikle sig ligger i barnet selv. Appen giver inspiration til, hvordan du kan skabe udviklingsrum for barnet fra den spæde alder og frem til 3 år.\n\nAppen er let at gå til. Den er inddelt i 7 alderstrin, hvor barnets udvikling og ideer til samvær er beskrevet indenfor 4 områder\n\n•\tsamvær og tæt kontakt\n•\tgrovmotorik og balance\n•\tfinmotorik og øje/hånd koordination\n•\tsprog og rytme.\n\n\nFORTÆLLINGER I BILLEDER, VIDEO OG TEKST \nAppen fortæller om, hvordan du kan opbygge tidlig tilknytning, stimulere f.eks. trille, krybe og kravle, udfordre håndens finmotorik, og hjælpe sproget på vej. Billeder og videoklip giver ideer til, hvordan du naturligt kan inddrage leg og aktivitet i hverdagen.  \nEn legetøjskasse bugner med ideer til legetøj indenfor hvert alderstrin - og en kort udviklingsbeskrivelse indenfor de 4 områder giver dig mulighed for at få et overblik over barnets udvikling. \nBevægelege og naturen som legeplads er to supplerende tilbud, som giver konkrete ideer til, hvordan du kan stimulere dit barns bevægeglæde og bruge naturen fra barnet er helt lille. \n\n\nLOGBOG MED MILEPÆLE \nLogbogen giver en oversigt over milepælene i barnets udvikling. Her kan du plotte ind, hvornår dit barn passerer de enkelte milepæle. Du kan supplere med beskrivelser af sjove oplevelser fra hverdagen og uploade billeder. \nHvis du registrerer dit barn med navn, køn og fødselsdag bliver appen mere personlig ved, at barnets navn indgår i teksten, og du vil modtage en push besked, når barnet går ind i et nyt alderstrin.  \n\n\nFORLAGET SKALMEJE\nDenne app er udgivet af forlaget Skalmeje, der udgiver materialer om børn og deres udvikling. Den er udarbejdet af 2 sundhedsplejersker, der har arbejdet med børn og deres familier både forskningsmæssigt og i praksis i mange år. Appen er en videreudvikling af pjecen Lille menneske stor udvikling 0 – 3 år, som har været på markedet i mange år. \n\nOphavsret: Copyright Forlaget Skalmeje\n\nhttps://lillemenneske.dk/"

      "label": "The purpose of Crack the Reading Code is to teach what is practical for reading: \n- Shape\n- Writing direction\n- Sound. \n\nThese are the foundations of reading. \n\nChildren can acquire the essential knowledge that letters represent sounds, fit together and makes words that have meaning.\n \nThe content has been developed by experienced teachers - A supplement to writing textbooks and reading education\n\nChildren in kindergarten who are curious about letters will also think it's exciting. \n\n* THE SOUND OF THE LETTERS BEFORE THE NAMES.\n\nCrack the Reading Code uses exclusively letter sounds. \n\nChildren often learn the names of the letters instead of the sound of the letters. This means that they must apprehend something that they cannot use for their further reading. Often, they will have to relearn it when they are shown sounds at school that they have to use to read. \n\nBroadly speaking, they have no use for the letter names in the initial stages of reading. \n\n* THE 120 MOST USED WORDS AS WORD PICTURES.\n\nMany of the 120 most used words are not spelled as they sound. Therefore, it is a big help to recognize these as word pictures. \n\nChildren won't be forced to sound it out here, but instead just recognize the word like they recognize their own name or that a big yellow M means McDonald's. \n\nThat is why these 120 are trained as word pictures in Crack the Reading Code.\n\nUppercase letters for the intermediate learner.\n\nMany children first learn the 'big letters'. Of course, these must also be learned, but it should happen only when the child already recognizes the 'small letters.'\n\nIt is easier to relate to one shape per sound than two. \n\nWhen they have learned the lowercase letters, they can already recognize the letters in the books they must read. \n\nSwitching between the 'lowercase' and 'uppercase' in 'Settings.'\n\nSettings:\n\n-\tTurn the music in the menus on/off\n-\tHide the text direction. Hiding the text direction increases the level of difficulty.\n-\tSwitch between uppercase and lowercase letters. \n\nWe recommend that you only change to 'big letters' when the 'small letters' have been successfully learned.\n\nTarget audience:\n4 - 10 years (those who can't read or have a hard time doing so)."

Drive the street sweeper and unload the truck crane!\n\nOn our construction site your child can drive a digger, mix cement, roof a building, operate a crane, drive a street sweeper or paint a house. There’s so much to do here. Our Little Builders dig, plaster, fill, paint and mix... And they need your children´s help.\n\nAt the same time they can watch funny things happen, because on every building site there’s always something going wrong. Water suddenly bursts from a pipe, a builder falls into a hole or the wind blows the bricks away because the cement wasn’t dry yet.\n\nLittle Builders is the first 3D app for children aged 2-6 years that want to explore the world of being a real little builder. Depending on the child’s age, all animations and functions can run automatically or be controlled through a tap.\n\n7 interactive scenarios contain over 100 interactive animations and surprises:\n\n1. Steer the digger, fill the truck and repair the water pipe.\n2. Paint the house in different colours and unload the removals truck.\n3. Operate the crane and build a new roof for the house.\n4. Mix cement and build a real wall.\n5. Operate a big cement mixer and concrete a large area.\n6. Drive the street sweeper and clean the dirty road.\n7. Unload the crane truck and make sure it leaves on time.\n\nAmazing graphics, great animations, a user-friendly interface, no text and no in-app purchases. Download now and start building!\n\nPlease also check out our other great Apps for kids:\n\n„PETTING ZOO“ - is a fantastic storybook app for the iPad and iPhone.

Teach your toddler what an airplane, truck, and train sound like in a way that they will love.\n\nEach tile you touch opens up and reveals an exciting picture that plays a sound. The images rotate so that children can learn to identify the object, not just the single image that is shown.\n\nParents and children alike love this app and you will too! Download and play with your baby,\ntoddler or young children -- it's easy to learn and can entertain for hours.\n\nListen to the sounds made by both nature and machines. From boats, firetrucks, and\nhorse-drawn carriages to ducks, tigers, and birds. Each animal or object is like its own flash card; when opened, it plays a sound that is sure to stimulate each child and leave them with awe and wonder. This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch. Let them explore and learn with their senses. Parents of children with autism have found this app helpful in engaging their children, but truly it is for anyone that wants to teach their kids something new while stimulating and training their brains.\n\nEvery animal, transportation mode, and tile has five different sounds linked, so children can learn different sounds and images associated with objects. Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

      "label": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training. It is yet another beautifully designed and easy-to-use app for kids“ by lilmagoolie.com"

      "label": "MyMemo is a highly customizable memory game where you can use your own photos, audio, and text to create educational matching cards. With the split deck functionality you can even create decks where different cards constitute a pair!\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Designed by Swedish preschool teachers\r\n- Create personal memory decks by adding pictures, sounds, and text\r\n- Define pairs using same image or pairs using different images\r\n- Play the game with 6, 8, 12, 16 or 20 cards\r\n- Four built-in decks and five audio languages\r\n- Intuitive child-friendly controls for play and create mode\r\n- Child proof settings and edit lock mode\r\n- Ability to disable sounds for kids with special needs\r\n\r\nSplit decks is a unique feature of MyMemo: the ability to create cards which match with each other based on a relationship instead of matching with its identical twin (e.g., “Cow” matching with “calf”, instead of the usual “cow” and “cow”). This feature makes it a flexible tool to use in a teaching setting, allowing teachers to re-enforce a wide range of relationships such as rhyming words, relationships between adult and child animals, big and small letters, colors, and more.\r\n\r\nThe game comes with 4 high-quality built-in decks to get you started (Vehicles, Tools, Fruits and Vegetables, and Animals), with audio localized in 5 different languages (English, Spanish, German, French and Swedish). However, the real value of MyMemo lies in the educational possibilities offered by creating your own memory decks. For example:\r\n\r\n- Ask kids to make their own deck based on a certain theme, e.g. seasons, colors, objects that begin with a particular letter, etc.\r\n- Create decks where the audio recordings give fun little instructions relevant to the image, e.g. “bark like a dog three times”.\r\n- Create split memory decks with items that rhyme with each other.\r\n- Teach upper case and lower case alphabets with split deck.\r\n\r\nIn the settings menu you can also turn off the edit mode, so you can safely pass the device to the child without risking any inadvertent changes. Additionally, you can turn off the sound effects in case you are teaching kids with special needs who may be sensitive to sudden sounds.\r\n\r\nMyMemo has a polished graphical user interface designed to be intuitive enough for children to use,  making both the play mode and creation mode easy, fun, and educational for kids to use. What better way for children of a preschool class to learn than to build their own decks and then share with their classmates?\r\n\r\nFor a full list of features and a user manual for the game please visit our website at: http://www.appfamilygames.com/mymemo/"

      "label": "Flashnote Derby is a fun way for kids to learn and practice reading music notes. \n\nEach race is a timed test in which the student identifies different notes in order to urge their horse on towards the finish line. Answering quickly and correctly will cause their horse to gain ground, while incorrect answers will cause it to fall behind. At the end of each race, students can review the notes they missed and see the correct answers. \n\nPlayers can respond to flashcards by simply playing the note on their acoustic or MIDI instrument. They can also choose to answer by tapping letter buttons or playing a key on an on-screen piano.\n\nThe game is fully customizable to allow for any desired notes in the treble, bass, alto, or tenor clefs to be included. You can select ranges of notes, or several individual notes to focus on specific areas that need work. Notes can be shown with sharps and flats and key signatures can even be added to increase the challenge for more advanced students. The amount of time the player is given for each flashcard can be increased or decreased depending upon their age and level of experience.\n\nDrills can start out simply, with only a handful of notes, and gradually be made more challenging until the full staff is mastered (up to five and a half ledger lines above or below the staff.) The more difficult the settings, the more points are awarded. The 'high score' is tracked so that players always have a goal to shoot for.\n\nAs a bonus, over a dozen instructional video lessons are easily accessible from right inside the app! Even children with no prior music instruction can start using Flashnote Derby right away to begin learning about the music alphabet, the staff, and how to identify different notes.\n\nBecause it can be set up so quickly, Flashnote Derby provides a perfect motivational tool for music teachers to use with students, even for just a minute or two of each lesson. Teachers have the ability to email homework assignments to their students for them to play on their own devices at home. Each player's performance is recorded so that their progress can be tracked. You can easily see which notes are most in need of review.  \n\nWhen students give up on their music lessons, it's usually because they find it too difficult. Learning basic skills early is key to laying the groundwork for future success. Flashnote Derby makes this process more enjoyable and helps students stay motivated in their music learning.\n\nSometimes it takes only a little extra effort to make the difference between success and failure. Download Flashnote Derby and get on the road to music reading mastery today!"

For those of you, who are having difficulties understanding and solving classical mechanics problems, this app is a huge help.It will calculate all forces exerted on a body and simulate the resulting motion in two dimensions, with three degrees of freedom.\n\nUse objects, structures and tools to build your model. You can set physical properties, like mass, velocity, size, position and many more. The app will calculate and show you all the forces on each object. To see the forces in action, just run the simulation. Even during the simulation all forces can be shown and all properties will be updated. You can specify final conditions, to stop the simulation automatically, when these conditions are met.\n\nFrom the very small like the motion of particles to the very big like the moon going around the earth, if you can draw the model, Newtonium can calculate the forces.\n\nFeatures:\n- create, load and save your models\n- change gravitation, friction, resistance or behavior during collisions\n- specify real world physical properties of all objects\n- use tools like springs, struts, and pulleys\n- units are converted automatically\n- set initial and final conditions\n- forces and velocities are displayed as arrows for each object\n- forces are described in detail\n- use the simulator to animate your model\n- display diagrams for objects in motion\n- verify conservation of energy or momentum"

Både lärorik och skoj. \n\nI Babbapp bor åtta figurer- Babba, Bibbi, Bobbo och Dadda, Diddi, Doddo, Faffa och Vovvo - som svarar när du pratar, fnittrar när du kittlar och dansar om du trycker på fötterna. Det finns även 4 stycken aktivteter att underhålla sig med så som färgläggning, bärplockning, pussla samt objekt pussel. I appen finns också fem stycken musikvideor att titta på. \n\nOm Babblarna \nBabblarna är ett gäng färgglada figurer som gör språkträning till ett spännande och lekfullt äventyr. Den pedagogiska plattformen är Karlstadmodellen och språkträningen riktar sig till barn i tidig språkutveckling. Babblarna älskas av alla, stora som små och ingen tänker på att det är just språkträning det handlar om i leken och äventyren i Babblarnas värld. Babblarna pratar sitt eget språk som helt bygger på ljudet i deras namn. Genom att lyssna på Babblarna när de pratar och genom att härma deras sätt att prata så tränas effektivt förmågan att använda betoningar och melodi i språket. \nTips: Det finns många roliga produkter med Babblarna. De har också en egen sajt bara för barnen www.babblarna.se \n\nBabbapp är utvecklad och utgiven av Hatten Förlag AB. Hatten Förlag producerar och distribuerar böcker, spel och material på temat tecken- och språkutveckling. Välkommen till www.hattenforlag.se"

Det kræver koncentration og kan til tider blive en smule desorienterende, hvis man forsøger at få max point! Men man kan alligevel ikke lade være med at prøve igen!\n\n“Minus - Trin 1” er en del af en serie af lære-spil for børn på 3-10 år. Spillene gør det sjovt at lære alfabetet, tal, ord og meget andet."

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "Gode læsefærdigheder giver børn de bedste muligheder for at lære hele vejen op gennem skoleårene. Lær at læse med Lola er den tiende læringsapp med Lola Panda.\n\nDe fleste førskolebørn synes det er sjovt at lege med ord og rim. På den måde udvikler de deres fonologiske bevidsthed uden egentlig at vide det. En veludviklet fonologisk bevidsthed gør børn i stand til at lave et ord om til et andet ved at tilføje, fjerne eller bytte et bogstav ud med et andet, som for eksempel hat - kat - skat. \n\nForskere mener, at det er meget vigtigt for de tidlige læsefærdigheder at børn har en fornemmelse for sprogets form, med andre ord, at de har evnen til at rime.\n\n* Lær at læse med Lola indeholder 9 sværhedsgrader:\nLet niveau 1: Lette ord, som ender på de samme bogstaver, en – ben\nLet niveau 2: Enkle ord, som ender på de samme bogstaver, øm – søm\nLet niveau 3: Ikke helt enkle ord, som ender på de samme bogstaver, em - hjem\nMiddelniveau 1: Hverdagsord, som ender på de samme bogstaver, ad - ostemad\nMiddelniveau 2: Mindre almindelige ord, som ender på de samme bogstaver, ot - robot\nMiddelniveau 3: Vanskeligere ord, som ender på de samme bogstaver, ir - papir - gevir\nSvært niveau 1: Udfordrende ord, der ender på de samme og forskellige bogstaver, jord - bor - meteor\nSvært niveau 2: Vanskeligere ord, der ender på de samme og forskellige bogstaver, bageplade - kladde - facade\nSvært niveau 3: Svære ord, der ender på de samme og forskellige bogstaver, klods - candyfloss – los\n\n* Desuden får du en omfattende fremskridtsmåler\n\nLær at læse med Lola egner sig til de børn, der synes at Lolas alfabettog og Lolas ABC-fest er for lette, men som endnu ikke er helt fortrolige med at læse. Lær at læse med Lola passer glimrende til børn i 0. og 1. klasse og kan spilles i fællesskab eller individuelt.\n\nBørn kan bruge appen selv ved at starte med det letteste niveau. Efterhånden som barnet lærer og løser flere opgaver korrekt, fortsætter appen automatisk til sværere niveauer. Lærere eller forældre kan også vælge det niveau, de mener vil give barnet de udfordringer det har behov for.\n\nFind alle vores spil på den officielle Lola Panda-side: www.lolapanda.com\n\nSynes om os på Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/lolapanda"

      "label": "This is a fun app that children enjoy and respond to. It's a real boon to any adult who needs to control the levels of noise of a group of children. \r\n\r\nFor the responsible adult it is like having a virtual assistant with you, constantly monitoring noise levels and letting the children know in a fun and engaging way if noise levels have reached an unacceptable level. \r\n\r\nIn tests we have found when using this app with groups of children peer pressure alone is generally sufficient to control noise levels.\r\n\r\nSummary of Features\r\n\r\n• Displays graphically the background noise level in a room in a fun and engaging way.\r\n\r\n• Allows the tolerable noise level to be adjusted to cater for those \"louder activities\" as well compensating for banging doors and other sudden noises with the \"sensitivity\" and \"dampening\" sliders.\r\n\r\n• When the predefined noise level is exceeded for more than 3 seconds:\r\n\r\n     1) An audible Alarm is sounded (this can be switched ON or OFF)\r\n\r\n     2) The App appears to shatter the screen of the Device (this can be switched ON or OFF)\r\n\r\n     3) A counter, displayed on the noise meter, is incremented by one. Keeping track of the number of “Too Noisy\" alarms.(this can be switched ON or OFF)\r\n\r\n• There is a built-in \"Star Awards\" rewards system. It can operated in two modes: \r\n\r\n- Achievement Mode\r\n\tIn this mode a Star is awarded each time the Class keep their noise under control for a pre-determined period of time. This can be from 1 to 15 minutes. \r\n\tNormally, if the class triggers the alarm in this mode they will lose the Star currently running, however, there is also a switch that, if set to ON, will remove an additional Star every time the Class cause the “Too Noisy” alarm to be triggered.If students get all 10 stars a \"Super Star Award\" is displayed. Stars can also be manually Awarded and removed by the responsible adult.\r\n\r\n- Session Mode\r\n\tIn this mode the Teacher sets the length of time for a complete session. This can be any length of time. Perhaps for a full lesson (e.g. 1 hour 10 minutes) or for a time period set to complete a specific task (e.g. 20 minutes).\r\n\tThe app will take the session time and divide it by 10 (the maximum number of Stars that can be Won in any one session). The Stars are then awarded at that rate. For example if the Teacher sets the session time to 60 minutes then one Star Awards will be awarded every 6 minutes (60 minutes / 10 Stars  = 6 minutes per Star)\r\n\t\r\n• Keep things fresh with over 200 Dial / Background Theme combinations\r\n\r\n• The \"Alarm Counter\" can be reset or disabled completely.\r\n\r\nIf the noise level is acceptable a happy smiling contented graphic is displayed. If the levels of noise increase beyond what the responsible adult has determined as acceptable, the graphic changes to reflect the unacceptable noise level. Once the level of noise returns to an acceptable level the graphic automatically returns to the happy contented one, however, if the volume of noise remains unacceptably high for more than 3 seconds...an audible alarm is sounded (this can be turned on and off) and the screen of the device appears to shatter! Also, the \"Alarm Counter\" on the meter is incremented by one (this can be zeroed at any time with a reset button).\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any issues with Too Noisy Pro, before you write a bad review, please tap the \"?\" button in the app for help, or if you do not find the answer there, please contact us at support@academyapps.net. We can't fix what we don't know about, and writing a bad review is not the way to report a bug! You can also use this email address to submit feature requests.

Du kan terpe de latinske betegnelser ved at spille vendespil, du kan quizze om morfemer, adverbialled og ledsætninger, samt teste dig selv i eksamenslignende analyser af tekst.\n\nDu kan løbende se, hvordan din personlige score forbedres, og du kan battle (godmodigt!) med din sidemand i klassen.\n\nAP tæller med i karaktergennemsnittet på eksamensbeviset, og fagets læreplan har højnet kravene til jer elever. I skal på få uger tilegne jer kompetencer inden for morfologisk og syntaktisk analyse, men det er svært at finde tid til at træne i lektionerne inden den endelige prøve. Med denne app kan du nu træne på egen hånd med øvelser, der er lavet af gymnasielærere, og som er tilpasset AP’s krav. Hvis alle i klassen har \"Træn AP\", kan man også bruge den i skoletiden - man kan fx starte en lektion med 5 minutters vendespil om verber eller tage en lille test om syntaktisk analyse til sidst i timen, når man er træt af tavle og blyant.\n\nVi tilføjer løbende nye tests og quizzer i appen. De fleste af teksterne er på dansk, men du finder også syntaktiske tests i engelsk, fransk, spansk og tysk. Almen sprogforståelse er nemlig med til at forbedre dine færdigheder i en lang række sprogfag på B og A-niveau i både 2g og 3g.\n\nTag udfordringen op, overrask din lærer, og træn AP på en sjovere måde!"

Prøverne svarer til dem politiet bruger ved de rigtige teoriprøver til almindeligt kørekort (kategori B). Prøverne 1 til 7 er generelle teoriprøver, mens nr. 8 kun omhandler standsning og parkering. \n\nI teoriprøverne præsenteres du for 25 billeder af forskellige trafiksituationer. Til hvert billede er der et spørgsmål med 2-4 svarmuligheder. Ud for hver svarmulighed skal du vælge ”ja” eller ”nej”. \n\nEfter hvert billede får du at vide om du har svaret rigtigt eller forkert på svarmulighederne til det pågældende billede. Rigtige svar vises med grøn baggrund og forkerte svar vises med rød baggrund. Hvis du trykker på den røde baggrund vil du få en kort forklaring på hvorfor svaret er forkert. Når de 25 billeder er kørt igennem får du at vide om prøven er bestået."

And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

Det er noget af det mest grundlæggende for vores læseforståelse og noget der skal øves og øves indtil det ligger helt naturligt på rygraden. \n\nFørst når man mestrer denne del af læsningen, giver det mening, overskud og selvtillid at gå videre med længere og sværere ord.\n\n- Målrettet og effektiv træning\nLæseguld er udelukkende til rå, effektiv læsetræning og indeholder ikke distraherende elementer under selve træningen. Det er vigtigt, da det kræver meget koncentration at lære og at automatisere lydmetoden i læsning. \n\nLæseguld er udviklet i samarbejde med Time2learn og er en oplagt efterfølger til læringssuccesen Knæk Læsekoden.\n\n- Træningsmetoden\nDet kan for mange være en lang og svær proces at lære lydmetoden. Både for forældre, der ikke har forudsætningerne for at lære den fra sig og for børn, der synes det er svært. Derfor er det tit denne del af læseprocessen, der ikke bliver trænet nok.\n\nDer skal gives god tid til at lytte og smage på lydene og derudfra høre, om det er noget, der giver mening eller ej. Det er en god idé også selv at sige lydene højt og lade lydene ’læse’ ordet.\n\nDet er bogstavernes standardlyde, der benyttes. Dog er der også medtaget de vigtige lyde: \n•-e (fx løve) \n•-er (løver) \n•-d (blødt d, fx blad) \n•-g (blødt g fx dage). \n\nDer er ikke benyttet stumme bogstaver (fx hund) og vokalglidning (fx smøkke for smykke).\n\n- Supplement til skrivehæfter \nVi anbefaler 10 minutters træning om dagen.Det er godt at træne sammen med en voksen de første par gange, så kan man hjælpe hinanden og snakke om metoden. \n\nNår ordene i Læseguld er automatiseret, anbefaler vi, at træne videre med Læseguld 2, der indeholder vanskeligere ord med blandt andet dobbelt konsonanter i forlyden.\n\n------\n\n- Udviklet af eksperter\nAlle ordene der er med i Læseguld er nøje udvalgt og inddelt i sværhedsgrader. Dette er gjort af erfarne lærere, der har specialiseret sig i børn med læsevanskeligheder.\n\nOrdene er ord som børn kender og alle ordene er lydrette, så fokus kommer på lydmetoden - at sætte lyde sammen til ord. \n\nMålgruppe: 5-13 år"

Spiren til at udvikle sig ligger i barnet selv. Appen giver inspiration til, hvordan du kan skabe udviklingsrum for barnet fra den spæde alder og frem til 3 år.\n\nAppen er let at gå til. Den er inddelt i 7 alderstrin, hvor barnets udvikling og ideer til samvær er beskrevet indenfor 4 områder\n\n•\tsamvær og tæt kontakt\n•\tgrovmotorik og balance\n•\tfinmotorik og øje/hånd koordination\n•\tsprog og rytme.\n\n\nFORTÆLLINGER I BILLEDER, VIDEO OG TEKST \nAppen fortæller om, hvordan du kan opbygge tidlig tilknytning, stimulere f.eks. trille, krybe og kravle, udfordre håndens finmotorik, og hjælpe sproget på vej. Billeder og videoklip giver ideer til, hvordan du naturligt kan inddrage leg og aktivitet i hverdagen.  \nEn legetøjskasse bugner med ideer til legetøj indenfor hvert alderstrin - og en kort udviklingsbeskrivelse indenfor de 4 områder giver dig mulighed for at få et overblik over barnets udvikling. \nBevægelege og naturen som legeplads er to supplerende tilbud, som giver konkrete ideer til, hvordan du kan stimulere dit barns bevægeglæde og bruge naturen fra barnet er helt lille. \n\n\nLOGBOG MED MILEPÆLE \nLogbogen giver en oversigt over milepælene i barnets udvikling. Her kan du plotte ind, hvornår dit barn passerer de enkelte milepæle. Du kan supplere med beskrivelser af sjove oplevelser fra hverdagen og uploade billeder. \nHvis du registrerer dit barn med navn, køn og fødselsdag bliver appen mere personlig ved, at barnets navn indgår i teksten, og du vil modtage en push besked, når barnet går ind i et nyt alderstrin.  \n\n\nFORLAGET SKALMEJE\nDenne app er udgivet af forlaget Skalmeje, der udgiver materialer om børn og deres udvikling. Den er udarbejdet af 2 sundhedsplejersker, der har arbejdet med børn og deres familier både forskningsmæssigt og i praksis i mange år. Appen er en videreudvikling af pjecen Lille menneske stor udvikling 0 – 3 år, som har været på markedet i mange år. \n\nOphavsret: Copyright Forlaget Skalmeje\n\nhttps://lillemenneske.dk/"

Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

      "label": "The purpose of Crack the Reading Code is to teach what is practical for reading: \n- Shape\n- Writing direction\n- Sound. \n\nThese are the foundations of reading. \n\nChildren can acquire the essential knowledge that letters represent sounds, fit together and makes words that have meaning.\n \nThe content has been developed by experienced teachers - A supplement to writing textbooks and reading education\n\nChildren in kindergarten who are curious about letters will also think it's exciting. \n\n* THE SOUND OF THE LETTERS BEFORE THE NAMES.\n\nCrack the Reading Code uses exclusively letter sounds. \n\nChildren often learn the names of the letters instead of the sound of the letters. This means that they must apprehend something that they cannot use for their further reading. Often, they will have to relearn it when they are shown sounds at school that they have to use to read. \n\nBroadly speaking, they have no use for the letter names in the initial stages of reading. \n\n* THE 120 MOST USED WORDS AS WORD PICTURES.\n\nMany of the 120 most used words are not spelled as they sound. Therefore, it is a big help to recognize these as word pictures. \n\nChildren won't be forced to sound it out here, but instead just recognize the word like they recognize their own name or that a big yellow M means McDonald's. \n\nThat is why these 120 are trained as word pictures in Crack the Reading Code.\n\nUppercase letters for the intermediate learner.\n\nMany children first learn the 'big letters'. Of course, these must also be learned, but it should happen only when the child already recognizes the 'small letters.'\n\nIt is easier to relate to one shape per sound than two. \n\nWhen they have learned the lowercase letters, they can already recognize the letters in the books they must read. \n\nSwitching between the 'lowercase' and 'uppercase' in 'Settings.'\n\nSettings:\n\n-\tTurn the music in the menus on/off\n-\tHide the text direction. Hiding the text direction increases the level of difficulty.\n-\tSwitch between uppercase and lowercase letters. \n\nWe recommend that you only change to 'big letters' when the 'small letters' have been successfully learned.\n\nTarget audience:\n4 - 10 years (those who can't read or have a hard time doing so)."

Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training.

Spillets forløb er inspireret af P.O.P.T.-metoden (Psycholinguistisch orientierte Phonologie-Therapie, Fox-Boyer (2015)) og træner barnets lydlige bevidsthed gennem en række skelne-, og imitationsøvelser, der netop er målrettet de områder af lydsystemet, som er vanskelige for det enkelte barn. \nSpillet er udformet som et computerrollespil, hvor spilleren udforsker en ukendt verden, som bebos af små væsener kaldet fonitter. Spilleren har til opgave at finde og fange en bestemt type fonitter, fx alle dem, der siger stavelser eller ord med s.\n\nI Fonitterne understøtter vi 9 af de hyppigste fonologiske processer hos danske børn, så børn med fonologiske udtalevanskeligheder kan arbejde med lige netop de lydpar og kontraster, de har størst glæde af:\n\nFonologiske processer i Fonitterne: \n\n-\tFronting ( k -> t, g -> d, ng -> n, sj -> s )\n-\tBacking ( t -> k, d -> g, n -> ng, s -> sj )\n-\tStopping ( f -> b, s -> d )\n-\tLateralisering ( j -> l, r -> l )\n-\tNasalering ( l -> n)\n-\tH-sering ( r -> h )\n-\tAspiration ( b -> p, d -> t, g -> k )\n-\tDeaspiration ( p -> b, t -> d, k -> g )\n-\tGlidning ( l -> j )\n\nDet er vores vision, at spillet kan bruges som supplement til den logopædiske undervisning – derfor har vi udviklet et separat lærermodul, hvor barnets talepædagog har mulighed for at oprette et træningsforløb til barnet med relevante hjemmeopgaver. Herfra kan talepædagogen følge med i barnets progression gennem spillets lytte- og udtaleøvelser og se statistik om barnets typiske fejl. Du kan læse mere om Fonitterne og lærermodulet på vores hjemmeside: www.fonit.net"

You can travel around the world with numerous flying objects, cars and ships.\nYou can disguise yourself as a Viking, pirate or pilot. \n\nWith its numerous objects, this \"\"digital doll's house\"\" is perfect for creative role-playing.\nYour children will learn about the special features of different countries (Mexico, USA, India, France, the Caribbean and Germany) and discover differences but also numerous similarities.\nTo ensure that no child feels excluded, Fiete World contains a variety of people with different skin colours.\n\nNEW in this version: \nMEXICO\nWith horses, jeep, or pick-up truck through the jungle, walking through the city with a huge mechanical skeleton or with a hot air balloon over the cactus-covered desert. \nFeeding jungle animals, making chocolate, painting murals, making tacos or fighting with wrestlers. Mexico offers a lot of extreme variety.\n\nUSA\nChildren can ride a Ferris wheel in the colourful theme park and re-enact the moon landing or Jurassic Park in the film studio. They play with Kong the giant ape, visit the school and the record shop and when they are hungry they visit the burger shop or eat something at the hot dog stand. Then they can go to work at the harbour, play with the crane and unload ships.\n\nFRANCE\nIn venerable France, for example, children can sit in the evening in a chic café on the Seine under the Eiffel Tower, or they can play robber and gendarme with the police. Of course there is also a police helicopter, a police boat and a police car.\n\nINDIA\nIn densely populated India, the children can harvest tropical fruits and squeeze juices, change tires in the Auto Werkstadt, ride an elephant or work on the latest robot technology. What is particularly exciting here are the clear contrasts between tradition and technology.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS OF THE APP\n- Discover a huge world\n- Switch between day and night mode\n- Go on a treasure hunt, sail the pirate ship\n- Ride an elephant, dinosaur \n- Play with a robot or with a huge skeleton\n- Fell trees and use the wood to make a fire\n- Disguise yourself\n- plant flowers and vegetables\n- Change the wheels of all cars\n- Bake a cake\n- Fly a helicopter, a jet, a historic aircraft, a hot air balloon or a U.F.O.\n- have a picnic on the beach - deliver packages\n- Send postcards around the world\n- Discover souvenirs from all over the world in Fiete's room\n\nIMPROVE CHILDREN\n- Fantasy role playing games\n- Telling your own stories\n- Experiment\n- Interaction with others\n- Understanding the world\n- Open-mindedness\n\nABOUT US\nWe are Ahoiii, a small app development studio from Cologne. We create lovingly designed apps for children, which are fun and where children can learn something in a playful way. \nAll our games are absolutely safe to use and we love to play them with our own children. \nMore about Ahoiii at www.ahoiii.com"

In the final category you can test your acquired skills with a mix of different styled clocks.\n\nIn addition to the many exercises, there is also an experimental mode where the relationship between the clock and the time of day is illustrated with the passing of the sun and moon across the sky. You can freely drag the hands of the clock and see how the sky changes and also get the time read out load.\n\nThe app is suitable for children in grades K-3.\n\nCategories\n1. Tell the time\n2.

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Put what you want to move into the transport, close the door and select the new location by tapping an icon. Everything will arrive in the selected location so you can begin your next adventure!\n\nCREATE AN ORIGINAL VIDEO OF YOUR STORY\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice as you’re telling the story, along with your characters’ movements. Create videos up two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share later!\n\nFEATURES:\n- Explore four locations: stable, arena, forest and shop.\n- Create stories for 24 new characters plus horses and other animals!\n- Care for your horses: feed them, lather them up till they're nice and clean, brush them. \n- Choose outfits from your favorite themes: medieval, western, everyday stable life and fantasy!\n- Hop on to ride bikes in the forest and race motorcycles in the arena!\n- Set up obstacles and show off your horse's jumping skills!\n- Eat at the food court and use the portable potties!\n- Have a campout! \n- Snuggle into your sleeping bag to stay warm under the stars! \n- Take a canoe ride or swim by a waterfall.\n- Make music with magical lily pads!\n- Move horses, characters and objects from here to there in the horse transport! \n- Record your stories in the app and share with your friends!\n- No time limit or high scores — play for as long as you like!\n- No third-party advertising\n\nWE LISTEN\nOne of our top requests for the Toca Life series has been horses!

Der er lette baner med korte ord og lange baner med mange ord, som udfordring til de dygtigste.\n\nDer er 5 forskellige unikke måder at opdage bogstaver, lyde, ord og deres stavemåde.\n\n****************\n\"Både som mor og dansklærer er jeg meget begejstret for denne app. Men det er faktisk ikke det bedste – det bedste er at min søn også er begejstret – og det er jo trods alt ham der skal spille det. Stor opfordring herfra om at købe denne app.\"  -  5/5 stjerner - Appnyt.dk\n****************\n\nOrdene bliver både stavet og udtalt. Bogstaverne har den unikke lyd der hører til ordet. Der tages hensyn til de mange specielle lyde i det danske sprog. Ordene udtales mundret af børn efterhånden som opgaverne løses.\n\nDer er også en spillemåde hvor bogstaverne synges. Her kan man høre og lære bogstavernes navne. Der er baner hvor man skal læse ordene og pege på deres billede.\n\nStavepladen håndterer dobbeltkonsonanter, sammensatte lyde og stumme bogstaver, som jo er karakteristiske for det danske sprog. \n\nIgennem spillet vinder man flere og flere af alfabetets bogstaver, indtil man kan høre hele alfabetsangen.\n\nDer er hjælpetekst til de voksne og en visuel guide med hjælpestemme til børnene, så de kan komme i gang, - både med og uden hjælp fra en voksen.\n\nStavepladen bruger ikke \"køb fra program\", så man kan ikke komme til at bruge penge i spillet efter man har købt det.\n\nAppen virker både i landskab og portræt. Den er optimeret til alle typer iPads og iPhones, inklusive iPad Air og den nye iPad mini. \n\nStavepladen er spiltestet af rigtigt mange tilfredse børn :-)"

      "label": "It's never too late to expand your horizons, challenge yourself, and bridge the gap to another culture with Arabic Alphabet!\n\nArabic Alphabet teaches you the foundations of Arabic in a fun and unique way. For each letter you will be able to:\n\n• See it in great detail.\n• Hear the proper pronunciation of its phonemes.\n• Hear the proper pronunciation of its name.\n• See and hear a common Arabic word which begins with that letter.\n\nArabic Alphabet is not only fun, but it's also accurate because it was developed by a native Arabic speaker, and all audio samples were recorded by a college professor of Arabic.\n\n\"I was born and raised in Morocco with Arabic as my language of origin. When I moved to America, I wanted to be sure that I didn't lose my identity and my culture. After my first son was born, this became even more important to me as I want him to understand the importance of his heritage. I developed Arabic Alphabet so that adults and children alike could have a fun way to accurately learn the foundations of the language. I hope you enjoy it!\" —from the developer\n\nWe have finally added two in-app upgrades, so that you can expand your learning:\n\n• The Write feature which allows you to “finger-write” on the screen so that you can memorize and perfect the strokes for each character.\n• The Quiz feature which will help you put everything you’ve learned to the test.    With a little practice, you’ll learn to recognize and write the Arabic Alphabet in no time!"

      "label": "Help your kids learn when it's time to get out of bed with Sun to Moon Sleep Clock. \n\n26 stars are removed at regular intervals throughout the night, helping visualize how long it is until morning. \n\nCustomize the Sun and Moon characters with outfits, accessories and sounds or enable 'Snooze Rewards' so that the longer your kids sleep, the more items become available to them. \n\nBedtime and wake-up time can be set from the settings page or by tapping the time digits on the main daytime screen and hitting 'Goodnight'. One-off naps can be triggered by tapping Moon's nose 3 times or tap it 6 times for an immediate sunrise.\n\nGet tips and keep up-to-date by visiting Sun to Moon Sleep Clock on the web:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/suntomoonsleepclock\nhttps://twitter.com/s2msleepclock\nhttp://www.msibley.com/sleep-clock\n\nOther features include...\n• Super-easy to operate with a built-in help system.\n• Soothing sleep sounds with adjustable duration setting: Whale song, heartbeat, fan, white noise (hair dryer), harp music, washing machine, clock ticking, breaking waves, music box, sleigh bells, meditation or off.\n• Speaking clock function - tap Sun or Moon's mouth to activate (optional). \n• Wacky wake-up sounds:  Digital beeps, dawn chorus, cock-a-doodle-doo, charge fanfare, parrot, cat meowing, trumpet, bongos, cheerful tune, Happy Birthday, Santa/Jingle Bells, Easter, rocket launch, rock'n'roll, sleep sound repeat or off.\n• Digital or analog clock modes with large digit digital option.\n• Friendly Sun and Moon characters with interchangeable outfits and accessories.\n• Predefined themes including Birthday, Christmas, Easter, Pirates, Sports and Space.\n• Shooting star night-time progress bar.\n• Visual sunset and sunrise with custom artwork by artist Michael Sibley (http://www.msibley.com).\n• Optional Snooze Reward system to gently incentivize staying in bed. \n• Star countdown with 26 stars removed at regular intervals through the night. Counters can also be customized or removed in the Moon gifts section.\n• Twinkling 'final countdown': An optional 12 star countdown displayed at the end of the night with a faster removal rate.\n• Auto-dim mode to brighten and dim the screen half an hour either side of sunrise/sunset.\n• Reading time: Let moon read his book for up to an hour at either sunrise, sunset or both. \n• Nose tap naps and immediate sunrise: Set your nap duration and activate it by tapping Moon's nose 3 times in quick succession.  An additional 3 taps triggers an immediate sunrise. \n• Parental settings pin code lock with Face & Touch ID support.  The settings master pin is 8529.\n• Dimmable night setting to reduce glare and save energy, accessible from the settings or by tapping the clock digits 3 times.\n• Dark mode to reduce blue glow at night.  \n• Sleep Clock stand & Hologram mode -  Get crafty and make your device little-finger-proof with a Sleep Clock stand and hologram adapter.  The Sleep Clock stand covers the device's physical buttons whilst hologram mode takes it one step further and gives the impression of Sun and Moon hovering in mid-air.  Full instructions for creating your bespoke stand and hologram viewer can be found on my website at http://www.msibley.com/sleep-clock-stand, where you will also be able to download templates.  \n\nNote: Please ensure your device is plugged in and that notifications are silenced whilst using this app. If you forget your settings pin the master code is 8529. If using this app on an OLED screen (the iPhone X for example), it is a good idea to reduce the screen brightness and enable auto-dim mode for long periods of use.\n\nTo disable the home and lock buttons of your device whilst using this app, please use IOS Guided Access Mode. \n\nIf you find the app useful or have any suggestions then I'd really appreciate a rating in the App Store. Positive reviews encourage me to keep working on the app and constructive feedback provides me with new ideas that I always try to implement if possible.  Thank you!"

      "label": "Stave småord 2 er en app hvor barn kan lære å stave småord på en underholdende måte. Det er kun brukt enkle en- og tostavelsesord, som sammen med morsomme illustrasjoner gjør stavingen gøy og underholdende.\n\nSlik spiller man:\nVed å trykke på figuren, får man høre ordet som skal staves. Man kan også høre bokstavlydene ved å trykke på hver enkel bokstav. Dra så bokstavene i riktig rekkefølge til de tomme linjene under figuren for å stave ordet.\n\nStave småord 2 har til sammen 320 oppgaver. Spillet har to nivåer - ett enkelt og ett som er mer avansert. I nivå 1 skal brukeren dra de tilgjengelige bokstavene på plass i riktig rekkefølge. I nivå 2 er det blandet inn flere bokstaver som ikke er en del av ordet, og brukeren må selv finne ut hvilke bokstaver som er en del av ordet. Hvert nivå har 16 brett/kategorier, og hvert brett har 10 oppgaver.\n\nBokstavkongen\nBokstavkongen tilbyr et stort utvalg av læringsapper for skrive- og leseopplæring. Appene er godt egnet til bruk både hjemme og på skolen, og de er laget i samarbeid med spesialpedagoger og lærere.\n\nBokstavkongen bruker alltid bokstavlyder og ikke bokstavnavn, da det er bokstavlydene som er viktige og brukes når man skal lære seg å lese. Bokstavene representerer lyder man binder sammen til ord når man skal knekke lesekoden.\n\nBokstavkongen-appene fokuserer også på oppgaver, slik at barna får trening i å se ordene som ordbilder. Barna lærer de ordene som ikke er lydrette og er nødt til å gjenkjenne ordet som et bilde.\n\nHar du tilbakemeldinger og ønsker for enkelte av appene eller forslag til nye apper, så hører vi veldig gjerne fra deg!\n\nSend oss gjerne en e-post på post@bokstavkongen.no!\n\nFølg oss på Facebook: http://fb.me/bokstavkongen"

We hope each app inspires conversations between you and your kids and sparks more learning in the world around us.

      "label": "DEMOKRATI - er et aktivt undervisningsspil til mobiltelefoner, der spilles på Slotsholmen. Spillerne løber bogstavelig talt gennem demokratiets historie fra det gamle Grækenland til dagens Danmark, mens de motiveres til at udforske og samarbejde.\n\nNB: VIRKER KUN PÅ ENHEDER, DER HAR GPS*\n\n\"DEMOKRATI\" er rettet mod 6. - 9. klassetrin, og benytter Slotsholmen i København som \"spilbræt\".\n\nI spillet bevæger spilleren sig rundt på området, og lærer om demokratiets historie som styreform fra det gamle Grækenland til dagens Danmark. Imens får man ligeledes et bedre kendskab til de forskellige demokratiske institutioner og mindesmærker, som Slotsholmen er rig på.\n\nBeskrivelse\nSpillet viser et kort over området, hvorpå en række punkter er vist. Spilleren egen position er også vist på kortet, sådan at man kan se, hvor man er, og hvor man kan gå hen.\n\nSom ramme for spillet skal spilleren danne et politisk parti, og forsøge at få mandater nok til at vinde regeringsmagten. Mandaterne får man ved at løse en række forskellige opgaver rundt omkring i området. Disse opgaver kunne fx være: at svare rigtigt på spørgsmål, at se sig omkring efter bestemte bygninger eller genstande, at stemme om hvorvidt en række ord har relation til et bestemt tema eller ved at løbe hurtigt rundt til en række punkter på kortet.\n\nSpillet er inddelt i tre forskellige missioner, der hver behandler en bestemt tidsperiode i demokratiets historie. Disse er: 1) Demokratiets græske oprindelse, 2) Revolutionernes tid og 3) Demokrati i Danmark. For at bevæge sig fra én bane til den næste skal spillerne indsamle mindst 30 mandater.\n\nBaggrund\nIndholdet er blevet til i et samarbejde mellem spildesignere og undervisere fra Amager Lille Skole og Sønderbro Skole. Spillet er udviklet med støtte fra Ministeriet for Børn og Undervisning, og vil kunne indgå i undervisningsforløb for såvel dansk, historie og samfundsfag.\n\nSlotsholmen er en enestående lokalitet i Danmark: Her lagde Absalon i 1167 sin borg, der stadfæstede København som spirende magtcentrum i Øresundsregionen - og herfra har Danmark været regeret stort set lige siden. Herudover er alle tre instanser af magtens tredeling repræsenteret, i form af Statsministeriets-, Folketingets- og Højesterets bygninger.\n\n* Man kan kende enheder, der har GPS-funktionalitet, på om de kan gå på nettet uden WiFi. Altså om det er WiFi-modellen eller 3G-modellen, der er tale om."

      "label": "Her kan du på en sjov og anderledes måde træne begreberne i gymnasiefaget AP. Du kan terpe de latinske betegnelser ved at spille vendespil, du kan quizze om morfemer, adverbialled og ledsætninger, samt teste dig selv i eksamenslignende analyser af tekst.\n\nDu kan løbende se, hvordan din personlige score forbedres, og du kan battle (godmodigt!) med din sidemand i klassen.\n\nAP tæller med i karaktergennemsnittet på eksamensbeviset, og fagets læreplan har højnet kravene til jer elever. I skal på få uger tilegne jer kompetencer inden for morfologisk og syntaktisk analyse, men det er svært at finde tid til at træne i lektionerne inden den endelige prøve. Med denne app kan du nu træne på egen hånd med øvelser, der er lavet af gymnasielærere, og som er tilpasset AP’s krav. Hvis alle i klassen har \"Træn AP\", kan man også bruge den i skoletiden - man kan fx starte en lektion med 5 minutters vendespil om verber eller tage en lille test om syntaktisk analyse til sidst i timen, når man er træt af tavle og blyant.\n\nVi tilføjer løbende nye tests og quizzer i appen. De fleste af teksterne er på dansk, men du finder også syntaktiske tests i engelsk, fransk, spansk og tysk. Almen sprogforståelse er nemlig med til at forbedre dine færdigheder i en lang række sprogfag på B og A-niveau i både 2g og 3g.\n\nTag udfordringen op, overrask din lærer, og træn AP på en sjovere måde!"

Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more.

Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

Tinker with your tractor to see what it can do! The food machine magically turns your raw ingredients into food: Use milk to make cheese, then use the cheese and corn to make cheese puffs! Use berries to make jam, wheat to make bread, and then use those ingredients to make donuts!

Realms is a monthly subscription service that lets you create your own always-online Minecraft world.\nThere are currently two subscription options to choose from depending on how many people you want to invite to play in your realm simultaneously. A realm for you and 2 friends costs 3.99 USD/month (or local equivalent) and a realm for you and 10 friends cost 7.99 USD/month (or local equivalent).\nA 30-day trial of Minecraft Realms for you and 10 friends is available. Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription.\n\nThe payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and the subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, at the subscription price option you have previously selected.\n\nYour subscription can be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. There is also a button in-game that take you to these settings. If you cancel after your subscription has activated, you won't be refunded for the remaining active period of the subscription.\n\nHere are links to our privacy policy and terms of use:\n- Privacy policy: https://account.mojang.com/terms#privacy\n- Terms of use: https://account.mojang.com/terms"

Now 20 years after the first copy of the board game was released, the app is finally here!\n\nThis game is played 2 against 2 and it is all about getting your pieces from your start area to the goal area using the cards you are dealt during the game. However, the game is NOT over when all your pieces are safe in the goal area. Your partner also needs to get all her pieces into the goal area. So as soon as you or your partner reaches the goal area with all your pieces, you have to help your partner finish by using your cards to play with your partner’s pieces. If you and your partner make it before your opponents, you win!\n\nYou can play this game online with family and friends, but you do NOT need them in order to be able to play. You can easily play alone offline or include 1, 2 or 3 other persons online and choose to involve one or more of the robot players, that comes with the app. The abilities and temperament of the robot players are unique, so just like with humans, you will discover that some are quite talented and others are not. One of the robots is actually quite unpredictable! \n\nYou decide who to include in the game and you can invite anyone to play the game! Furthermore, you can have several games going on at the same time and you can easily switch between games!\n\nThe game is turn based and can be played live online or with up to 48 hours to do your turn.\n\n***Warning: This app is VERY addictive and will surely take up a lot of your precious spare time. ***"

Det giver anledning til mange grin og kommentarer - især da der kan opstå uenighed, da man jo netop skal svare på, hvad man tror ens medspiller svarer. \n\nAnmeldelse: appsportal.dk:\nSpillet er underholdende og i særdeleshed godt og meget socialt - her er der til mange timers sjov aften med venner og familie. Det kan absolut anbefales.\n\nKender du brætspillet EGO? Du kan nu tage en helt ny og sjov version af EGO med i lommen, når du skal i byen eller blot hygge dig med venner og familie.\n\nDet kræver kun én iPhone eller iPad, og spørgsmålene er helt nye og anderledes end i brætspillet.\n\nEGO er en helt ny type social app. Med EGO på én iPhone kan 3-8 spillere få en sjov aften, med spørgsmål der går tæt på jer og jeres kendskab til hinanden.\n\nSpil EGO med standardspørgsmålene, som giver underholdning til mange timer eller udvid med de sjove og endnu skarpere udvidelser, f.eks. \"Den frække\", \"Den endnu frækkere\", \"Den personlige\" eller \"EGO Party.\" Man kan i appen kombinere flere pakker og slå uønskede pakker fra - også midt i et spil.\n\n\n*** Advarsel: Spillet er KUN for voksne, da enkelte spørgsmål indeholder indhold, der KUN henvender sig til voksne. Vi anbefaler spillet til 15+ ***"

A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome back to the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza!\n\nIn Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the old and aging animatronics are joined by a new cast of characters. They are kid-friendly, updated with the latest in facial recognition technology, tied into local criminal databases, and promise to put on a safe and entertaining show for kids and grown-ups alike!\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nAs the new security guard working nights, your job is to monitor cameras and make sure nothing goes wrong after-hours. The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift). So to make your job easier, you've been provided with your very own empty Freddy Fazbear head, which should fool the animatronic characters into leaving you alone if they should accidentally enter your office.\n\nAs always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for death or dismemberment.\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English.

      "label": "\"Catan\", the legendary strategy game provides gaming fun anytime, anywhere.\n\nTrue to the original game, you can compete with up to four players for the most settlements, the longest roads and the largest army. You can trade with each other and claim the precious land with all its resources.\n\nThe game allows you to challenge other Catan fans online via cross-platform multiplayer to prove your strategy skills or play against the AI:\nVarious computer opponents, each with their own individual characteristics, will prove themselves worthy competitors: the pirate Jean, who knows no compromise, Vincent the merchant, who never allows himself to be cheated, Sean the knight, who takes what is rightfully his...\n\nThe popular Catan expansions \"Seafarers\", \"Cities and Knights\" and two new special scenarios are available as In-App purchases.\n\nThe complete Seafarers expansion includes more than 10 additional scenarios with an extensive campaign. Become Harbormaster, discover new islands and extra game elements like ships, gold fields, treasures and pirates. Ahoy!\n\nThe Cities and Knights expansion introduces various new gameplay mechanics that add even more variety to Catan. Invest new trade goods in city improvements to build one of the three metropolises of Catan – but beware of the barbarians attracted by Catan’s new wealth! You’ll need your best knights to fend them off! C&K contains a short campaign and 7 challenging maps.\n\nExciting adventures await you in the two new scenarios \"Enchanted Land\" and \"The Great Canal\". Vanquish dragons and bag their treasures or build a canal to help barren grain fields bloom once more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Available languages: English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese\n- Original \"Settlers of Catan\" rule set\n- Update 4.0+: Synchronous online multiplayer games\n- Smart computer opponents with individual strategies\n- Scrollable game board including zoom option \n- Freely combinable game settings \n- Game statistics\n- Comprehensive tutorial\n- Seafarers LITE: New scenario \"The 4 Islands\" and two additional game variants\n- Cities and Knights LITE: Test the new expansion in the scenario “The first Island”\n- 3 different graphic sets to choose from\n\n\n***** \nCatan FAQ: \n\nQuestion: An expansion seems gone after an update or reinstallation of Catan or after restoring the device? \nAnswer: Don’t worry! Your initial purchase is already saved in your iTunes account. You can restore your InApp purchases by selecting the restore-option in the Catan IAP menu. \n\nQuestion: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating or restoring my device. Is there any way to restore it? \nAnswer: When saved games can’t be automatically restored, we’ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter „CatanWarp*“ (* = 1–15) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1–15). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well. \n\nQuestion: Are dice rolls really random? \nAnswer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We’re avid Catan players ourselves. We’ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game! \n\n*****\nQuestions or suggestions for improvements: \nMail to ios@usm.de \nWe are looking forward to your feedback! \n\nFor more information on news and updates: www.usmgames.com \nor visit us on www.facebook.com/UnitedSoftMedia and twitter.com/USM_News \n\n*****"

      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out \"Papa's Freezeria HD\" for iPad!"

It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff. more! When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game. \n\nDISCLAIMER\nGoat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n* You can be a goat \n* Get points for wrecking stuff - brag to your friends that you're the alpha goat \n* MILLIONS OF BUGS! We're only eliminating the crash-bugs, everything else is hilarious and we're keeping it \n* In-game physics that bug out all the time \n* Seriously look at that goat's neck \n* You can be a goat"

      "label": "NOTE: Remastered version from the PC version. A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English. Subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

      "label": "“… an amazing and intriguing game that's unlike anything you've played before.” \nPocket gamer\n\n“Darjeeling has really captured the authenticity of Kahn's work”\nToucharcade\n\nHomo Machina is a puzzle game inspired by the work of avant-garde scientist Fritz Kahn. Set off on a crazy journey to solve the surreal puzzles of Homo Machina and learn about the internal working of the human body, represented as a gigantic 1920s factory.\n\nIn this narrative puzzle, players are plunged into an ingenious system of nerves, vessels and valves. The aim is to help the body function correctly in about thirty steps or so throughout the entire day. Each scene breaks down daily acts, such as opening your eyes, chewing a toast or listening to music, through seamless navigation and intuitive and inventive gameplay.\n\nFritz Kahn, a pioneer of infographics and popular science, came up with easy to understand analogies to enable people to improve their understanding of the human body. By combining old school design with a contemporary influence, Homo Machina delights with its clever dialogue between the absent-minded director at the helm of the body-machine and Josiane, his diligent secretary, encouraging players to put to task the armada of workers to get the incredible factory up and running. \n\nAfter Californium, Homo Machina is the new video game created by Darjeeling production. It was edited and co-produced by ARTE, European culture digital and TV channel, and Feierabend."

Finish the game and then play again to discover a whole new story when you make different choices.\n\nWATCH US: http://www.youtube.com/c/LifelineGame\n\nPraise for Lifeline:\n\n“This is the best game on the Apple Watch.” – Time.com\n\n“I’ve played many games that I find engrossing, but Lifeline may be one of the first that changed the way I thought about my daily routine, which leapt off the screen and became a part of my lived experience.” - Eli Cymet, Gamezebo\n\n“For a few brief hours I cared – really cared – about the fate of a completely fictional character. I don’t think any other game I’ve played has made me feel that way before.” - Matt Thrower, PocketGamer"

Your totems must journey from the underworld to the heavens in order to restore light to the land. Thankfully, Hoebear the vaguely bear-shaped Metabear will be your spirit guide in this quest. Rebuild the totem pole to bring back the positive vibes to Kalimba.\n\nIn Kalimba, you play two coloured totem pole pieces simultaneously – one on the top half, and one on the bottom half of the screen. Avoid dark pits, deadly spikes and roaming enemies, but remember the totems move together. One totem jumps over a hole, the other jumps into spikes; one soars into the sky while the other tumbles into the abyss.\n\n==========\n\n“Beautiful, wonderfully designed, thoughtful and thought-provoking…”\n10/10 – Official Xbox Magazine \n\n“With its smart design and mind-melting puzzles [...] Kalimba is the new golden child of PC platformers.” \n5/5 - Expert Reviews\n\n“One of the biggest treats I have had all year…”\n9/10 – God is a Geek \n\n“Precise, taxing and faintly adorable, it's the [Xbox]One's secret platforming weapon. Got a sneering Nintendo fan coming over? Show them this thing and their happy, colourful brains will be blown into rainbow chunks.\"\nGames Radar\n\n“Kalimba is a beautiful, cheerful platformer that finds a neat middle ground between reflex-oriented running and taxing puzzle solving.”\n81/100 - PC Gamer\n\n“Kalimba not only has one of the best cooperative experiences around, but it also has a strong single-player element.”\n8/10 Destructoid\n\n“Kalimba is a delightful game. Bright colours, tight controls, platforming, animals with accessories…”\nRock Paper Shotgun\n\n==========\n\nCAMPAIGN\nPlay through an exciting single-player adventure where every new level will test your platforming and puzzle-solving skills.\n\nCO-OP\nShare a local co-op challenge on one device - a fiendishly challenging experience that will make or break any friendship. Co-op is only available on iPad.\n\nCHALLENGES\nCollect all the gold totems, find and beat the secret challenge rooms, and compete on the leaderboards.\n\nIf you enjoy Kalimba, please leave a rating, check out our other titles, or simply follow @FlashbulbGames on Twitter and Facebook."

One element you look for in vain here. Water - the source of all life. The only water is found in the clouds that pass over Avolteha.  \n\nThe only way to get this precious commodity is a type of mushroom that can extract the water.\nThe inhabitants of Avolteha therefore began many years ago to build their settlement around those mushrooms. Over time, however, the mushrooms began to sprout their roots higher and higher. \nTo restore the water supply, Paul and his friends built a connection from the new cloud city downwards.\n\nIn the meantime, Paul no longer lives in the city. Now, however, he received a letter. His friends needed his help. The water source had gone out once again.\n \nWhat happened?\nPaul's greatest adventure is ahead of him. The great riddle of Avolteha is waiting for him and wants to be solved. It must be solved - for the good of all the inhabitants of this wonderful planet. \n\nABOUT THE GAME\nAvolteha is a classic point & click adventure game for the whole family. \n\nGAME CONTROLS\nPaul can easily pocket items along the way and take them with him on his journey. Find out where these items can be used. If Paul gets stuck, he still has his friends. Maybe they will give him a decisive clue. An interactive game experience by touch.\n\nNO BORING TEXTS\nNo endless dialogues. Conversations can be followed through hand-drawn speech bubbles without text. A game that overcomes language barriers and can be played by anyone. \n\niCLOUD CONNECTION\nAvolteha is playable with 4 players simultaneously. The game states can be easily changed via the slots. In addition, all 4 slots are synchronised via iCloud. \n\nFOR NUMEROUS DEVICES\nThe game is playable on iPad as well as iPhone. Lowest requirement: iPad Air or iPhone 6s or higher. All newer devices are supported. \n\nZOOM FOR THE IPHONE\nConstantly zoom in with two fingers, move a section and then zoom out again with two fingers? Not with Avolteha. With only one finger, you can intuitively zoom in, move and zoom out again. Discover the many details in the magnificently designed scenes."

Realms is a monthly subscription service that lets you create your own always-online Minecraft world.\nThere are currently two subscription options to choose from depending on how many people you want to invite to play in your realm simultaneously. A realm for you and 2 friends costs 3.99 USD/month (or local equivalent) and a realm for you and 10 friends cost 7.99 USD/month (or local equivalent).\nA 30-day trial of Minecraft Realms for you and 10 friends is available. Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription.\n\nThe payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and the subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, at the subscription price option you have previously selected.\n\nYour subscription can be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. There is also a button in-game that take you to these settings. If you cancel after your subscription has activated, you won't be refunded for the remaining active period of the subscription.\n\nHere are links to our privacy policy and terms of use:\n- Privacy policy: https://account.mojang.com/terms#privacy\n- Terms of use: https://account.mojang.com/terms"

Now 20 years after the first copy of the board game was released, the app is finally here!\n\nThis game is played 2 against 2 and it is all about getting your pieces from your start area to the goal area using the cards you are dealt during the game. However, the game is NOT over when all your pieces are safe in the goal area. Your partner also needs to get all her pieces into the goal area. So as soon as you or your partner reaches the goal area with all your pieces, you have to help your partner finish by using your cards to play with your partner’s pieces. If you and your partner make it before your opponents, you win!\n\nYou can play this game online with family and friends, but you do NOT need them in order to be able to play. You can easily play alone offline or include 1, 2 or 3 other persons online and choose to involve one or more of the robot players, that comes with the app. The abilities and temperament of the robot players are unique, so just like with humans, you will discover that some are quite talented and others are not. One of the robots is actually quite unpredictable! \n\nYou decide who to include in the game and you can invite anyone to play the game! Furthermore, you can have several games going on at the same time and you can easily switch between games!\n\nThe game is turn based and can be played live online or with up to 48 hours to do your turn.\n\n***Warning: This app is VERY addictive and will surely take up a lot of your precious spare time. ***"

      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.

Det kan absolut anbefales.\n\nKender du brætspillet EGO? Du kan nu tage en helt ny og sjov version af EGO med i lommen, når du skal i byen eller blot hygge dig med venner og familie.\n\nDet kræver kun én iPhone eller iPad, og spørgsmålene er helt nye og anderledes end i brætspillet.\n\nEGO er en helt ny type social app. Med EGO på én iPhone kan 3-8 spillere få en sjov aften, med spørgsmål der går tæt på jer og jeres kendskab til hinanden.\n\nSpil EGO med standardspørgsmålene, som giver underholdning til mange timer eller udvid med de sjove og endnu skarpere udvidelser, f.eks. \"Den frække\", \"Den endnu frækkere\", \"Den personlige\" eller \"EGO Party.\" Man kan i appen kombinere flere pakker og slå uønskede pakker fra - også midt i et spil.\n\n\n*** Advarsel: Spillet er KUN for voksne, da enkelte spørgsmål indeholder indhold, der KUN henvender sig til voksne.

      "label": "Supporting MFi controller!\n\nWhen idols die - legends are born!\nMore than 25 years ago Armin Gessert developed with GIANA SISTERS one of the first Jump'n Run games for the Commodore 64. The console manufacturers got anxious and tried to stop the sisters. The end seemed close. But they failed and GIANA SISTERS with packaging has become a rare collector's item.\n\n***************************************** \n\"It draws its strength from its unashamed inspiration, offering a tight, fully-featured and excellently crafted platformer that really raises the bar for the AppStore\"(toucharcade.com) \n\n\"Giana Sisters is definitely a worthy addition to your game library.... Giana Sisters is among the best platform games for the iPhone\" (touchgen.com) \n\n****************************************\n\nThe legend is back, better and bigger than ever before. To use the potential of current devices we improved the graphics and controls. Today the game captivates through its full HD graphic and a new userfriendly menustructure. \n\nThe game offers everything a real Jump'n Run game needs. Perfectly balanced for hours of fun on all current iOS devices.\n\nFreed from the dust of decades, GIANA SISTERS always retains its cherished style, familiar features and the legendary original soundtrack in a fresh revision. By then the polished 32 fully restored classic levels will cause teary eyes to many fans of the original version!\n\nToday the sisters celebrate their jump on the hitlists of the gaming world. Including a lot of new adventures, retro feeling and modern design:\n\n- 80 completely new adventures\n- 32 retro level\n- superbright Full HD graphic\n- 5 languages: English, German, French, Spanish, Italian\n- legendary soundtrack, inspired by Chris Huelsbeck\n- freely selectable controls\n- Game Center\n\nWe love to play Giana Sisters as well and we act on the principle: “Bug reported. Bug fixed.” \n\nFeel free to send us your questions and suggestions to: support@kaasa.com"

      "label": "Læring gennem leg:\nMange børn lærer forskelligt. Nogle lærer bedst gennem bøger og tavleundervisning, mens andre lærer bedst gennem visuelle, legende midler, såsom spil. Ved at spille sig til viden, udfordrer man børns måde at lære på, og Monster Matematik app’en, kan derfor nemt bruges som supplement til at styrke dit barns matematik- og regnefærdigheder. \n\nMonster Matematik er et matematik spil, hvor du kan lege dig gennem læringen. Du kan dyste i regnestykker mod enten computeren eller udfordre familie eller venner til en stinkende prutte- eller bøvseduel. Svarer man rigtigt og hurtigst, kan du endelig prutte din farmor i hovedet eller bøvse på din irriterende lillebror. Men pas på! Svarer du forkert eller for langsomt, kan du risikere selv at få en skoldende flammeprut eller en øredøvende operabøvs lige tilbage i hovedet. \n \nKlar til fart off?\nSå find din regnehjerne frem, pak din duftevand og hold dig endelig godt for næsen, for nu skal du med på dit livs fæleste regneeventyr sammen med de hæmningsløse og ildelugtende prutte- og bøvsemonstre; Muggen Mås og Bøvse Bob. Er du klar?? Okay, vi gør klar til fart off: 1, 2, 3, weeeeeeee.\n\nVil du hellere udforske monstrenes verden med nogle afslappende hyggefimser? Så tag på eventyr med Muggen Mås og Bøvse Bob. Her kan du for eksempel hjælpe dem med at befri Kong Blå, som bliver holdt fanget af de onde løbesnottere i den store snotvulkan. Du kan også hjælpe det lille monster, Lille Fis, med at blive beskidt og ulækker igen. Han er nemlig kommet til at gå i bad og er derfor blevet alt for ren. Adder badder!\n\nI Monster Matematik kan du:\n- Øve hovedregning med de fire forskellige regnearter.\n- Lære tallene fra 0 til 10.000 at kende.\n- Udkæmpe matematikdueller mod familie og venner.\n- Opleve over 20 forskellige skøre og vilde prutter og bøvser.\n- Spille prutte- og bøvsemelodier på dine vundne medaljer.\n- Opleve hyggelige fortællinger med flotte illustrationer til.\n\nDet adaptive niveaureguleringssystem sikrer, at man i dette matematik spil altid bliver tilpas udfordret - lige meget om man er på nybegynder eller ekspertniveau."

Includes improved AI, 3D landscape, new exclusive features.\n\n*** Carcassonne fits that opening game niche that every game group needs. -Tyler Nichols, Board Game Quest\n*** Carcassonne = Great game, great mechanics, great pieces, great fun! -The Board Game Family\n\nA TILE PLACEMENT GAME OF CREATING LANDSCAPES, CLAIMING AREAS, AND GAINING POINTS\nDiscover or re-discover Carcassonne, the multi-awarded tile-based game in which players draw and place their tiles to build a medieval city. Place your cities, roads, abbeys or fields to enlarge your landscape, then place your followers, the meeples. Knights, robbers or farmers... Each meeple will help you control your territory and win points.\nBut be careful, you will need all your best strategy and tactics to maximum your points! Place your tiles and your meeples wisely to stop your opponents and win the game.\n\n6 EXPANSIONS: ENLARGE YOUR LANDSCAPE AND OPTIMIZE YOUR POINTS\nThanks to the mini expansions \"\"The River\"\" and \"\"The Abbot\"\", you can embellish your landscape and vary your game to enjoy new ways to play! Double or even triple your points thanks to the new buildings in the Inns & Cathedrals expansion! And with the Traders & Builders expansion, score more points with the trading commodities and build faster with the builders! Discover the city of Carcassonne covered with a blanket of white snow in the Winter Edition... and look out for the Gingerbread Man and the bonus points he'll give you! Beware of the Dragon in \"\"the Princess and the Dragon\"\" expansion! He could eat your Meeples if you're not cautious. And be kind with the Princess: she might prefer you to other Meeples and toss them out of the cities!\n\nFEATURES\n• Accessible and tactical gameplay adapted from the award-winning Carcassonne board game    \n• 6 expansions:\n- The River, the Inns & Cathedrals, the Traders & Builders, the Winter Edition and Princess & Dragon are all available to purchase from the Game Shop.\n- Unlock The Abbot for free using your Asmodee account.\n• Up to 6 players! Play against the computer in solo mode, face off your friends in Pass and Play or challenge players from around the world in online mode\n• There is no more 3 but 4 different behaviors you can chose before starting a game with AIs. They all propose a better challenge than the previous ones. Players who want to experiment a true challenge will play against the Conqueror AI who is the strongest AI of the game.\n• Try out the aerial top view to refine your strategy!\n• Additional strategic layers compared to the physical version:\n- field view which allows you to see the field possession of each player\n- remaining tile list: allows you to see the tiles which are remaining in the draw pile\n\nLanguages available: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish\n\nYou can follow us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and You Tube!\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/asmodeedigital/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/asmodeedigital\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/asmodeedigital/\nYou Tube: https://www.youtube.com/asmodeedigital"

Du kender med stor sikkerhed ikke de præcise svar, så det handler derfor om at komme tættest på, og samtidig holde sig fri af modstandernes drillende taktik. \n\nKan du eksempelvis gætte følgende:\n- Hvor stor en procentdel af verdens mænd er venstrehåndede?\n- Hvor mange år ældre er Lars Løkke Rasmussen end Søren Pind?\n- I hvilket årstal blev det forbudt at indsamle og spise mågeæg i Danmark?\n- Hvor mange tusinde gange er Solen tungere end Jorden?\n\nSpillet indeholder fra start 150 opgaver med mulighed for mange timers underholdning. Der er dog også mulighed for tilkøb af tematiserede opgavepakker, som eksempelvis ”Den frække”, ”Sport”, ”Kendte”, ”Musik” osv.  \n\nMore or Less er et perfekt indslag til små og store selskaber og hyggelige stunder – både hjemme og ude.\n\nAppen findes også i en engelsk udgave med internationale spørgsmål: \"More or Less - What's Your Number?\""

New features include:\r\n- Console quality graphics\r\n- Interactive tutorials\r\n- White Sands as a third landing site option\r\n- Orbit mode\r\n\r\nF-Sim Space Shuttle combines realistic flight simulation with stunning graphics and fun gameplay.\r\n\r\nYou’ve never landed a Space Shuttle before? We’ve got you covered: Included are several tutorials with varying degrees of autopilot assist. Our landing analysis and scoring system tells you exactly how to improve your next landing. It will make you come back and try again.\r\n\r\nEach flight starts at either 10,000 feet, already aligned with the runway, or at up to 50,000 feet, before banking into the heading alignment cone. During descent, the Orbiter is an unpowered glider, so you will only have one chance to get it right. Astronauts used to call it a flying brick: Because of its 200,000 lbs. gross weight and low lift over drag ratio, the approach is six times steeper and two times faster than a typical airliner approach. After your first safe touchdown, chase that perfect landing, compare your high scores online with your friends, earn medals, and unlock achievements. Experiment with different wind conditions, night approaches, and even emergency scenarios or system failures. At the end of each flight, watch a replay from different camera angles.\r\n\r\nYou control the Orbiter’s pitch and roll axes by tilting your device. Alternatively, you may switch to on-screen analog sticks or use a gamepad. Rudder, speed brake, gear, and chute are usually handled by the autopilot, but you can have full manual control if you like. For beginners, we’ve added rectangles that visualize the desired approach path. Simply try to stay within the corridor of rectangles, and they’ll guide you right to the touchdown point. Advanced pilots can turn them off and rely on the instruments in the head-up display (HUD) instead. The simulated guidance, navigation and control (GNC) systems are authentic replications of their counterparts in the real Orbiter, and the HUD features all the instruments real Space Shuttle commanders used to employ to skillfully land this unique aircraft. Now it’s your turn to give it a try.\r\n\r\nA new orbit mode lets you take the Orbiter for a spin around the planet, and we’re working on a full atmospheric re-entry scenario, which, among other new features, will be released as free updates in the coming months.\r\n\r\nThere are no ads or in app purchases, and we don’t collect any personal data."

You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

      "label": "This application is a sidekick to the beastmaker 1000 and 2000. It has been designed to assist the user into gradually getting stronger on a fingerboard. The app does this by way of prewritten workouts which are often general and aim to improve all trainable grips on the board. Some are specific (2000 series only at the moment) which aim to improve, sloper strength, pocket strength and crimp strength. \n\nThere is also a new custom workout program fully adjustable and includes the 1000,2000 and micros, so if you have your own hang regime and different timings then that is all programmable and can be saved.\n\nBoth the workouts and custom timer now record hang contraction time (time spent actually hanging off the board) We recommend most users get up to around 20:00 minutes on this clock whilst doing their workouts.\n\nOn the Workout screen after you've selected your work out it is now possible to adjust set and hang times. Users who are only finger boarding and are having a rest day prior to and after training may wish to do up to 3 sets and 7 hangs. Other users may prefer to go for 2 sets and 6 hangs, this is what we'd consider an average and more suited to people doing additional types of training.\n\nPlease note the grades for the workouts aren't actually meant to relate to anything other than themselves. E.G. 5c is easier than 6a but harder than 5b. If you find 5a hard on the 1000, use a weight removal technique such as putting one foot on a chair in front of the board or using a pulley with weights on. More advice on this and other things are available in the general advice section on the Workout Ratings page.\n\nTo record your hangs press the record button (red circle icon) whilst resting. The Workout Ratings function is much improved and should now be a really useful training aid which records gradual progress and improvement.\n\nFingerboard gains take time, remember to warm up thoroughly and move on to more difficult hangs at a slightly slower pace than you think you should to give pulleys time to catch up with muscles. For example 10% strength gains over a year is brilliant improvement. 5% is still effective training.\n\nBest of luck with the training, happy hanging and we hope this helps with the motivation."

You know what it’s like to go through a lot of negative thoughts. You can either continue with a bad gut feeling, and at the same time ruin your surroundings, or you can choose to say: “That is a little annoying, but I decide to say Let it go and move on,” and at the same time, give your ‘Let it go app’ a quick tab.\r\n\nThe Let it go app and concept are based on the Danish word ‘Pyt.’\r\n\r\nDanes are some of the happiest people in the world, and they also happen to have a lot of cool words for ways to be happy.\r\n\r\nYou may have heard about “hygge,” which has been the subject of countless books, articles, and commercials. Often mistranslated to mean “cozy,” but it really describes the process of creating intimacy.\r\n\r\nBut another word, “pyt” was recently voted the most popular word by Danes. Pyt doesn’t have an exact English translation. It’s more a cultural concept about cultivating healthy thoughts to deal with stress.\r\n\r\nPyt — which sort of sounds like “pid” — is usually expressed as an interjection in reaction to a daily hassle, frustration, or mistake. It most closely translates to the English sayings, “Don’t worry about it,” “stuff happens,” or “oh, well.”"

IT’S ALOT - I KNOW :)\nAnd that is why I have created the POLE WITH STEPH MONTHLY PROGRAMS. Upon downloading the app, you will have the option to become a premium member to enjoy the benefits of this all - inclusive program for all levels. Every month, you will receive a thorough program, with specific challenges & homework added weekly.\nI make sure to give you instruction in all those things that are important for safe, consistent progress that you not only see but also FEEL!! With the programs, I teach you how to work WITH your body, so you can achieve all your pole & flexibility goals with a body that feels GOOD, balanced, and strong… not one that hurts after being forced into a move it wasn’t ready for.\nAs a member of the program, you will enjoy the following benefits:\n\n1:1 Feedback - you can ask questions and share videos with me, so I can make sure you are getting the most out of the program. There is also a group to share progress and struggles and connect with your fellow members.\n\nDownloadable personal training log to schedule and reflect on your training sessions.\n\n3 Day/ week gym training program\n\nThis program is designed for intermediate and advanced students looking to level up their training. There is a strong emphasis on shoulder health, overall core stability & strength, inversion practice, active leg flexibility, and upper body push/ pull circuits in order to balance and strengthen your body for your pole or aerial training. Each session is 45-75 minutes and is best performed at a gym, however, can be modified for home or pole studio training. These workouts are written by Tiana Nicole Tallant, who has her DPT and has extensive knowledge in anatomy, movement, motor learning & skill development, and programming. I've personally been following her programming since 2019 and it has immensely contributed to my progress!\nSo what are you waiting for?? It’s time to spend LESS time planning and MORE time training and practicing!!\nCONTACT\nInstagram: @stephanietallant_pole\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/StephanieTallant\nWebsite: https://linktr.ee/stephanietallant\nHASHTAG the following to be featured\n#Polewithsteph #Flexwithsteph #Pwsapp #thepoleapp\n\nT&Cs and Privacy Policy can be found at: https://polewithsteph.disciplemedia.com/onboarding_documents"

Smolov isn't for new lifters, but if you have some experience under your belt (like with 5/3/1, starting strength, 20 squat, etc.), then this may be a great lifting protocol for you."

Use any of the available, most popular 1 Rep Max formulas to estimate your 1 rep maximum weight and keep a log to see your progress over time.\n\nSimply select a lift type, enter a weight and a number of repetitions (up to 10), and tap the Calculate button to see your 1 Rep Max.\n\nWith My 1 Rep Max Premium, you can create your own custom lifts and use more than 10 repetitions to perform calculations.\n\nA Note About Safety:\nOne rep maximum calculators are used to estimate the maximum amount you can lift. The degree of accuracy can vary significantly depending on your experience with weight training as well as your muscular composition. Most one rep maximum calculators are designed for experienced strength trainers so, if you are inexperienced, you may find your actual one rep maximum is much lower because your body is not accustomed to the stress of lifting heavy weight. Because it can be dangerous to attempt to lift your estimated maximum, always have a spotter with you. Seriously.\n\nMy 1 Rep Max will never bother you to request a rating or review. However,  if you'd like to take the time to rate or review it, you can do so from the Settings screen and that would be swell."

Then Get Running with the best Couch to 5k App!\n\nWith three enjoyable workouts a week, in nine weeks you will be running continuously for half an hour, even if getting off the couch is a struggle today!\n\nGet Running breaks through the “beginning barrier” with its enormously popular Couch to 5k running plan. In week one’s workouts you'll alternate one minute of running with 90 seconds of walking. With each new week, Get Running’s human voice coach gradually builds up your pace, until you’re running for a whole half-hour!\n\nGet Running is the only Couch to 5K App that:\n\n• Coaches like a human – with hundreds of studio-recorded progress and encouragement prompts.\n• Supports and encourages you – talk with fellow running rookies on the Get Running forum.\n• Lets you share (NEW!) – share Get Running with up to three other runners: you all get your own log and settings!\n• Helps you plan – rest days help you recover, and Get Running knows the best day for your next run.\n• Displays your next move – the unique Run Clock, customised for each workout, gives complete visibility and understanding.\n\nIn addition, Get Running:\n\n• Works with or without music. Or listen to podcasts and audio books.\n• Fits your schedule – just three workouts a week of 20 to 30 minutes.\n• Logs your achievements – with an illuminating visual record of your progress.\n\nThousands of people have changed their lives with Get Running and you will too! Whether you’re running for your health, training for a 5K, or building to conquer a marathon — Get Running!\n\nGet Running's users say:\n\n• Just finished week 9 run 3 and all I can say is this app changed my life. Great job.\n\n• I LOVE your app. I have tried several but Yours is the BEST for me. I am 60 years young this year & a cancer survivor. I have set the goal to run 5 K races. I use your program as my trainer, it is SUPER. Thank You. – Vickie Wheeler by email\n\n• I tried the top selling \"Couch to 5k\" App before I purchased this one, and this one is much nicer to use. The voice reminders are very helpful. I like how it pauses your music instead of talking over it. I highly recommend it over the others.\n\n• Thank you so much for this little gem of an app. I had a look at others like it but this wins hands down. It is so brilliantly simple with a great interface.\n\n• Thank you! This app has changed my life. I was unfit and didn't do any regular exercise. I always blamed my asthma for being the reason I couldn't run for longer than a minute, but now I know it's because I was unfit! I have signed up for a 5k race too! – @amyriddett on Twitter\n\n• Really great app. I'm actually looking forward to running. I listen to podcasts and this app is terrific at pausing the show to make it's announcements. I don't miss anything that was said. Outstanding."

The app has been developed by experts to ensure you the best training. \nUse the app as inspiration to look after your body each day and develop good habits early on.\n\nWhy is training important? \nPregnancy and birth are hard on the body and caring for a newborn will present you with awkward lifting and breastfeeding positions, sore nursing shoulders and sleepless nights.\n\nFor many women it is difficult to find the energy to look after their body when they have given birth. \nTraining is an important way to rediscover your body and get back to the activities you were used to before your pregnancy. The idea is to get started as quickly as possible and train correctly and regularly. \n\nWe have therefore chosen the physiotherapist's best exercises for this app - They are easy to get into, strengthen the entire body and can be done anywhere and any time - e.g. on the floor with your baby.\n\nThe exercises will look after your entire body.\n1. The pelvic floor\n2. Breastfeeding and work posture\n4. Curl, bend and wriggle \n5. Core training, buttocks and hip muscles \n6. Relaxation\n\nFunctions:\nThe postnatal app has many different functions to ensure that your training goes smoothly\n- Reminders\n- Videos with exercises \n- Audio files\n- ’My downloads’: Your downloaded videos and audio files for playing offline.\n\nDeveloped by experts\nGynZone has developed the app in collaboration with physiotherapist and PhD Ulla Due."

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

      "label": "App´en “Mentaliseringsguiden” indeholder indtalte indsovnings- og medtationsøvelser fra bogen “Mentaliseringsguiden\".\n\nDer er tale om 4 forskellige indtalte guidede øvelser, der understøtter evnen til at regulere følelser og finde ro i forskellige situationer i hverdagen.\n \nLydøvelserne er lavet til børn, unge, voksne og professionelle, der har brug for en hurtig hjælp til at finde ro, skabe refleksion eller falde i søvn.\nØvelserne tager afsæt i den mentaliseringsbaserede tankegang. Mentaliseringsbaseret behandling er en evidensbaseret metode til behandling og udvikling af evnen til mentalisering. Mentalisering er en en betegnelse for evnen til at have fokus på egne og andres mentale tilstande. “Mentaliseringsguiden” er en bog af Psykolog Janne Østergaard Hagelquist, der udkom i 2015 og indeholder en lang række redskaber og øvelser til brug ifm. børn, unge og voksne.\n\nØvelserne er enkle at anvende. Appén indeholder en funktion, der giver mulighed for at få beroligende “regnlydtæppe\" som baggrund til de indtalte øvelse.\n\nApp´en indeholder 4 øvelser; Drømmerejse, indsovningsøvelse, ÅBENT og Åndedrætsrummet. Den enkelte øvelse er ledsaget af søde tegninger, og er let at bruge for både børn og voksne: \n\n1) ÅBENT temperaturmåleren er tænkt som en hurtig lydguide til brug i situationer, hvor der er konflikter og intense følelser. Den kan bruges af professionelle, såvel som private, når der er brug for at vurdere, om man har en indstilling præget af et ÅBENT sind, som giver mulighed for konstruktiv og mentaliserende dialog.\n\n2) Indsovningsøvelsen er en guidet indsovningsøvelse, som kan bruges til støtte til at skabe ro til at falde i søvn. Øvelsen er tiltænkt børn, men kan også bruges til unge og voksne. \n\n3) Drømmerejsen kan anvendes til at støtte et barn eller en ung til at finde ro og komme i kontakt med egne ressourcer. Igennem den guidede rejse ledes man til et behageligt sted og føres efter et kort ophold med mulighed for at finde egne  ressourcer tilbage til nuet.\n\n4) Åndedrætsrummet er en meditationsøvelse til at finde ro og pause i en hektisk dagligdag. Øvelsen er kort og med fokus på krop sind og lyde, hvilket også illustreres på figuren, der hører til øvelsen. Ved jævnligt brug er det muligt, at øvelser kan hjælpe en til at komme i kontakt med nuet uden brug af den guidede meditation."

      "label": "Cardiograph is an application which measures your heart rate. You can save your results for future reference, keep track of multiple people with individual profiles, add notes and locations, and even print out your measurements for sharing or safe keeping.\n\nCardiograph uses your device's built-in camera to take pictures of your fingertip and calculate your heart's rhythm - the same approach used by professional medical equipment!\n\n\"I know you have the disclaimer on the screen but I don't care, Cardiograph saved my life. Your app was key to understanding what was going on and help the doctors understand too.\"\nBob Spadafora - *****\n\n\"Comparing heart rates with family over the holidays is fun.\"\nTxyak – ****\n\n\"Wanna impress a friend with a cool app. This is the one to get.\"\nMattyray – *****\n\n\"After having two heart valve replacements and a by-pass, I feel it is not only smart - but also necessary - to have such a reliable heart rate monitor with me everywhere I go.\"\nDantv – *****\n\n\"I am an EMT and it helps me actually see what is going on. It is by no means definitive like a monitor but it is a great indicator of problems I would not see otherwise.\"\nGranniem – ****\n\n\"I had a pulse oximeter on one hand, medical quality, and my iPhone app in the other and the app was dead-on accurate.\"\nLike it but hate it – *****\n\n\n=== See Cardiograph in action ===\nhttp://macropinch.com/cardiograph \nhttp://youtu.be/isIjcCFYEho\n\n\n• Measure your heart rate\n\nIt's never been easier to know what your heart rate is! Without any external hardware, just using the built-in camera of your smartphone or tablet, you can get accurate readings almost instantly.\n\nKnowing how fast your heart is beating can be very useful when exercising, if you're under stress, if you have a heart-related medical condition, or even just out of curiosity.\n\n\n• Track your results\n\nEvery measurement you take is saved to your personal history, so you can keep track over time. In addition to the date and time of the measurement, you can also save the location at which it was taken (and see them on a map), and even add a quick note to effortlessly organize your history.\n\n\n• Multiple profiles\n\nCardiograph is perfectly tailored to allow multiple people to use the app on a shared device. You can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them has their own individual measurement history.\n\n\n• Export & Print\n\nEach measurement can be exported in full detail to a portable format that you can later send via e-mail, upload on the web or even print right from the app itself (with an AirPrint™ compatible printer).\n\n\n• Clean and intuitive design\n \nInspired by real-life medical equipment, Cardiograph is a pleasure to use. The streamlined and clutter-free design makes it seem instantly familiar, so you can focus on using the app instead of navigating through series of confusing screens.\n\n\n• Built-in user guide\n\nIf you're having trouble with the app, or you want to make the most out of it, you can access the comprehensive help manual right from within the app itself.\n\n\n• Universal application with iCloud® sync\n\nCardiograph is an universal application - it runs on the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod touch.\nInstall Cardiograph on multiple devices with iOS 5.0+, and all your profiles and measurements will be in sync! Manage your profiles and measurements on one device, and the changes are instantly reflected on all the others.\n\n\nPlease note: If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\n\n\nFollow the latest news:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch \nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

With over 220 exercises, 90+  movies and 20 calculators and hundreds of pages of reference material, Navy SEAL Fitness helps you to train like a Navy SEAL.\n\nTo train for these physically demanding tasks, the Navy created The Navy SEAL Physical Fitness Guide.   The authors of this comprehensive guide, physicians and physiologists, were chosen because of their special qualifications in the area of physical fitness and their knowledge of the SEAL community. Their expertise ensured the guide was written with a goal of expanding the individual Navy SEAL's knowledge of attaining and retaining a high level of fitness.\n\nBecause SEALs train for mission related performance, the objective for every workout is elite fitness, validated by the ability to perform every task at the level necessary to accomplish any mission – no matter what.  What does that mean?  It means that training must be comprised of broad and inclusive, constantly varied functional movements that are performed at high intensity in order to prepare for the unknown.\n\nThe Navy SEALS are an elite branch of the U.S. Special Forces whose reputation for outstanding physical fitness is unparalleled. Now everybody that wants to improve his or her health, strength and endurance can take advantage of this information.\n\nTopics Include:\n* Overview of physical fitness \n* Exercise physiology \n* Muscle structure and Function \n* Principles of physical training \n* Specificity of training\n* Determining your training heart rate\n* Energy systems used by exercising muscle\n* Lactic acid and ATP-CP system for anaerobic work\n* Methods of physical training\n* Cardiorespiratory conditioning\n* Determination of work rate\n* Active recovery\n* How to estimate your maximal aerobic capacity\n* Types of aerobic activities\n* Basic workouts \n* Running for fitness\n* Swimming for fitness \n* Strength training\n* Flexibility training\n* Calisthenics\n* Plyometrics\n* Sports related injuries\n* Physical fitness and training recommendations\n* Weight lifting techniques\n* Anatomical terms and diagrams\n\nBonus Nutritional Material!\nNavy Operational Fitness and Fueling Series (NOFFS) designed by the Navy for \"best in class\" fitness and nutrition performance.\n\nSpecial Operations Forces Nutrition Guide designed by the military to meet the physical and mental demands imposed by special operations training and missions."

Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

For long-term health it is recommended that we take approx. 10,000 steps a day. For successful weight loss, daily steps should amount to 12,000-15,000.\n\nTo get started using iSteps, set up your personal profile by entering your height in cm or inches, your weight in lbs or kg, and choose how you want your results displayed, either in kcal or kJ and distance in miles or km. Then press the START button and you are ready to GO! \n\nWe recommend that you wear your iPhone or iPod touch by your waist or in your pocket, but you may need to experiment a bit to find the best location for optimal accuracy. \n\nPlease note: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. With the option to turn off “Daily Totals Tracking”, you can save battery when needed."

All exercises come with videos in English and Danish where Stig will show and explain what to do. The audio track has been recorded so that it can be used without you having to look at the screen. That way, you can simply lie down and let the calmness of Stig's voice guide you through the exercises.\n\nAs an extra, the basic level contains instruction videos that help you get a proper start. \n\nIn order to achieve the best possible result, you should use the app at least 3 times a week.\n\nThe exercises became the pivotal turning point for Stig Pryds who had spent 5 awful years in pain and on medication due to psoriatic arthritis. Today, he lives a strong, healthy and meaningful life in harmony with his condition.\nThe app has been produced in order to help others that experience imbalances. If you do the exercises you will experience better oxygenation and a surplus of energy. This has proven to lead to better self worth in many people.\n\nOnce you master your breathing, you become the master of your life!\n\nUse of the app is on the user’s own responsibility. Contact you general practitioner if you are not sure whether to use it.\n\nEnjoy!"

      "label": "Enjoy the benefits of meditation as you walk. Walking meditation can be just as profound as sitting meditation. It brings the meditative experience into daily activity. \n\nPerfect for those who have trouble sitting still to meditate, it's also great for those who enjoy sitting meditations. It helps bring meditation into every moment of the day. \n \nOur approach to walking meditation is easy and informal. As you walk, you are gently guided to experience your body and your surroundings fully. Letting go of thoughts about the past and future allows you to experience the present moment more fully.\n  \nTHE APP CONTAINS:\n\nINTRODUCTION TO WALKING MEDITATION & TIPS\n\nTHREE WALKING MEDITATIONS, each with a different emphasis\n\nDIARY PAGE - for those who want to keep notes on insights and experiences\n\nINTEGRATION WITH HEALTH APP - allows tracking of \"Mindful Minutes\"\n\n---------\n \nEach walking meditation has a different focus:\n\nBEING FULLY PRESENT   Guided Walking Meditation (16 min)\n\nHelps you to be fully present to all of the experiences you have while walking -- what you experience within yourself and in the world around you. \n \nENLIVENING THE BODY  Guided Walking Meditation (17 min)\n\nFocuses on the experience of the body while walking. It enlivens the body, strengthens the mind-body connection and is both calming and grounding. \n \nENHANCING THE SENSES  Guided Walking Meditation (18 min)\n\nFocuses on what you see, hear, smell and feel through the sense of touch as you walk. It enhances your experience of life by enhancing your perception.\n\n---------\n\nCREATED BY MARY MADDUX, MS, HTP and RICHARD MADDUX\n\nMeditation teachers Mary and Richard Maddux have brought meditation to thousands of people worldwide with their popular Meditation Oasis® podcast, CDs and smartphone apps. They bring over 30 years of practicing and teaching meditation to the creation of their apps."

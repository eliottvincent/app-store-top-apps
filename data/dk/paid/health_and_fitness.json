You know what it’s like to go through a lot of negative thoughts. You can either continue with a bad gut feeling, and at the same time ruin your surroundings, or you can choose to say: “That is a little annoying, but I decide to say Let it go and move on,” and at the same time, give your ‘Let it go app’ a quick tab.\r\n\nThe Let it go app and concept are based on the Danish word ‘Pyt.’\r\n\r\nDanes are some of the happiest people in the world, and they also happen to have a lot of cool words for ways to be happy.\r\n\r\nYou may have heard about “hygge,” which has been the subject of countless books, articles, and commercials. Often mistranslated to mean “cozy,” but it really describes the process of creating intimacy.\r\n\r\nBut another word, “pyt” was recently voted the most popular word by Danes. Pyt doesn’t have an exact English translation. It’s more a cultural concept about cultivating healthy thoughts to deal with stress.\r\n\r\nPyt — which sort of sounds like “pid” — is usually expressed as an interjection in reaction to a daily hassle, frustration, or mistake. It most closely translates to the English sayings, “Don’t worry about it,” “stuff happens,” or “oh, well.”"

Smolov isn't for new lifters, but if you have some experience under your belt (like with 5/3/1, starting strength, 20 squat, etc.), then this may be a great lifting protocol for you."

All exercises come with videos in English and Danish where Stig will show and explain what to do. The audio track has been recorded so that it can be used without you having to look at the screen. That way, you can simply lie down and let the calmness of Stig's voice guide you through the exercises.\n\nAs an extra, the basic level contains instruction videos that help you get a proper start. \n\nIn order to achieve the best possible result, you should use the app at least 3 times a week.\n\nThe exercises became the pivotal turning point for Stig Pryds who had spent 5 awful years in pain and on medication due to psoriatic arthritis. Today, he lives a strong, healthy and meaningful life in harmony with his condition.\nThe app has been produced in order to help others that experience imbalances. If you do the exercises you will experience better oxygenation and a surplus of energy. This has proven to lead to better self worth in many people.\n\nOnce you master your breathing, you become the master of your life!\n\nUse of the app is on the user’s own responsibility. Contact you general practitioner if you are not sure whether to use it.\n\nEnjoy!"

      "label": "App´en “Mentaliseringsguiden” indeholder indtalte indsovnings- og medtationsøvelser fra bogen “Mentaliseringsguiden\".\n\nDer er tale om 4 forskellige indtalte guidede øvelser, der understøtter evnen til at regulere følelser og finde ro i forskellige situationer i hverdagen.\n \nLydøvelserne er lavet til børn, unge, voksne og professionelle, der har brug for en hurtig hjælp til at finde ro, skabe refleksion eller falde i søvn.\nØvelserne tager afsæt i den mentaliseringsbaserede tankegang. Mentaliseringsbaseret behandling er en evidensbaseret metode til behandling og udvikling af evnen til mentalisering. Mentalisering er en en betegnelse for evnen til at have fokus på egne og andres mentale tilstande. “Mentaliseringsguiden” er en bog af Psykolog Janne Østergaard Hagelquist, der udkom i 2015 og indeholder en lang række redskaber og øvelser til brug ifm. børn, unge og voksne.\n\nØvelserne er enkle at anvende. Appén indeholder en funktion, der giver mulighed for at få beroligende “regnlydtæppe\" som baggrund til de indtalte øvelse.\n\nApp´en indeholder 4 øvelser; Drømmerejse, indsovningsøvelse, ÅBENT og Åndedrætsrummet. Den enkelte øvelse er ledsaget af søde tegninger, og er let at bruge for både børn og voksne: \n\n1) ÅBENT temperaturmåleren er tænkt som en hurtig lydguide til brug i situationer, hvor der er konflikter og intense følelser. Den kan bruges af professionelle, såvel som private, når der er brug for at vurdere, om man har en indstilling præget af et ÅBENT sind, som giver mulighed for konstruktiv og mentaliserende dialog.\n\n2) Indsovningsøvelsen er en guidet indsovningsøvelse, som kan bruges til støtte til at skabe ro til at falde i søvn. Øvelsen er tiltænkt børn, men kan også bruges til unge og voksne. \n\n3) Drømmerejsen kan anvendes til at støtte et barn eller en ung til at finde ro og komme i kontakt med egne ressourcer. Igennem den guidede rejse ledes man til et behageligt sted og føres efter et kort ophold med mulighed for at finde egne  ressourcer tilbage til nuet.\n\n4) Åndedrætsrummet er en meditationsøvelse til at finde ro og pause i en hektisk dagligdag. Øvelsen er kort og med fokus på krop sind og lyde, hvilket også illustreres på figuren, der hører til øvelsen. Ved jævnligt brug er det muligt, at øvelser kan hjælpe en til at komme i kontakt med nuet uden brug af den guidede meditation."

We supply trail descriptions, directions to the trail head, points of interest and the ability to follow your progress in real time with your GPS.  Following the trails has never been easier.  Now you can concentrate on enjoying the beauty of Sedona and not map reading or deciphering stacks of rocks.   Load the Trail information into your iPhone or iPad (with GPS) device and “Take a Hike”!  The trail maps and points of interest are preloaded so you don’t need cell service.  Visit www.SedonaHikingApp.com for trail listings and hike highlights with pictures from the trails. \nHere’s how it works: After you decide on the trails you’d like to experience you download the trails onto your iPhone or iPad (with a network connection) and select them as you do the hike.  Everything you need is in each hike package.\n\n1. Highlights and features of the selected hiking trail.\n\n2. Length and difficulty rating of the trail.\n\n3. A detailed description of the trail and what you’ll encounter and experience on the hike.\n\n4. Directions to the trail head or live directions and map if you so desire and have network connection.\n\n5. A trail map on screen that allows you to follow your progress and see your location in real time via GPS so you can be confident you’re on the trail.\n\n6. There are trail markers for intersections to watch for and pictures of what is ahead on the trail so you don’t miss out on sights that might be slightly off the trail.\n\nWe have over 400 trail miles of Sedona beauty! \n\n** You DO need a good network connection to download the trails.  If you experience trouble please email us, we can help.\n\n**  Be sure to give the app permission for location services!  This is in the Privacy section of the Settings app.  The poor review we received is the result of this setting NOT being on.  Please email us before posting a poor review.  We can help.\n\nThis really is hiking for everyone.\n\nAll of our trails are hiked by us, tracks are recorded by us and verified by us, not downloaded from random hike web sites or crowd sourced.\n\nThe app will show your location in real-time to keep you on the trail!"

      "label": "We have developed this App in a way that allows you to begin to track the changes, that you are making in your life. By rewarding yourself financially and grading your efforts, it would give you an opportunity to subconsciously program yourself into abundance. By taking the time at the end of your busy day, to review your actions, that match your thoughts, to look at how your behaviors were equal to your intentions and to begin to observe how you got your mind and body working together. We want you to begin to set up an account that shows that you are growing financially and to subconsciously program yourself into a new future.\n\nWe recommend, that you review what you have done during the day and use the App to remind yourself, of who you want to be and who you no longer want to be. And at the end of the day, you should reward yourself for your efforts so you can begin to further program your autonomic nervous system into that future. We recommend then that you do your mental banking in the evening, because as you begin to pay yourself, you are going to begin to subconsciously create a new habit of self.\n\nThis App contains:\n- Set a change for your life or set something, you want to get rid of\n- You will see all your changes in your daily timeline\n- Pay yourself, if you achieved your daily tasks. You will get this money into your mental bank account\n- As soon as you get 1.000 Quantum Dollars on your mental bank account, you may enter the Quantum World and create there, whatever you desire. Publish a picture from your creation there.\n- In a slideshow, you may see all your creations, with a beautiful music in the background. This will reminds you to your future – your creations will come true.\n\n\n\nFuthermore this App contains the Meditations „Morning and Eveningmeditation“. Start and end your day with these Meditations.\n\nDescription for the Meditations:\nIt’s time to stop being defined by your past and to create a whole new future!\n\nBy following these simple morning and evening exercises, you will get to know yourself better. You will start to notice changes in your mental and physical health including: lower stress levels, healthier immune system, increased memory, concentration and energy. \n\nLiving in the present moment will also help your self-esteem and improve your overall mood. The morning mediation will help you to prepare mentally for the day ahead. In the evening, relax and simply follow the guided meditation to stay on target and ease your mind and body into restful sleep. Each day, Dr. Joe will guide you step-by-step to create your new vision of the future and goals. He will help you take possibilities from the Quantum field and turn them into real life experiences.\n\nTracks:\n1. Introduction (14:07)\n2. Morning Meditation (23:53)\n3. Evening Meditation (23:20)\nTime: 61 Minutes\n\n(Also available as an Audio-CD).\n\nDr. Joe is introducing the App (Video):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrB7-qEroi4"

The app has been developed by experts to ensure you the best training. \nUse the app as inspiration to look after your body each day and develop good habits early on.\n\nWhy is training important? \nPregnancy and birth are hard on the body and caring for a newborn will present you with awkward lifting and breastfeeding positions, sore nursing shoulders and sleepless nights.\n\nFor many women it is difficult to find the energy to look after their body when they have given birth. \nTraining is an important way to rediscover your body and get back to the activities you were used to before your pregnancy. The idea is to get started as quickly as possible and train correctly and regularly. \n\nWe have therefore chosen the physiotherapist's best exercises for this app - They are easy to get into, strengthen the entire body and can be done anywhere and any time - e.g. on the floor with your baby.\n\nThe exercises will look after your entire body.\n1. The pelvic floor\n2. Breastfeeding and work posture\n4. Curl, bend and wriggle \n5. Core training, buttocks and hip muscles \n6. Relaxation\n\nFunctions:\nThe postnatal app has many different functions to ensure that your training goes smoothly\n- Reminders\n- Videos with exercises \n- Audio files\n- ’My downloads’: Your downloaded videos and audio files for playing offline.\n\nDeveloped by experts\nGynZone has developed the app in collaboration with physiotherapist and PhD Ulla Due."

At the specified alarm time, the bells will begin to ring in a pre-defined pattern - starting out softly and slowly and gradually getting louder and more frequent.  You'll come out of your slumber slowly and peacefully.  No more being jolted awake.\n\n+ After setting the alarm, the app can be put in the background - allowing you to use other apps.  At the specified alarm time, the alarm pattern will begin.\n\n+ Choose from five pre-defined patterns with varying bell schedules and escalation lengths.\n\n+ Choose from six different bells of varying size and metal compositions - from bright and clean to deep and complex with lovely overtones.\n\n+ You may enter journal notes upon awakening - great for recording your dreams before the memory fades.  You can then go back and review your journal entries and you may export the journal via email.  For privacy, you may set a password to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n+ To save battery, you may lock your device's screen and the alarm will still work.  Either start the alarm and press the lock (sleep) button, or turn on the \"Auto-Lock\" setting.\n\n+ This app uses the same amazing bell sounds used in our Insight Timer meditation timer.  Here are some app store comments pertaining to the bells:\n\n  \"Best sounding bells of any meditation app so far\" - sibergrrl\n\n  \"The bell samples in this app are gorgeous\" - LairBob\n\n  \"Several different bell sounds to choose from and they all feel 'live'\" - VaderPi\n\n  \"Great Sound Quality\" - KarlAgathon\n\n  \"The tones are stunning\" - hellsleeve\n\n  \"Beautiful bell sounds\" - Wolf94114\n\n  \"Wonderful digital bell sounds\" - zenji\n\n  \"The bell sounds are lovely\" - pngwen\n\nOther Features:\n\n- Snooze from 1 minute to 30 minutes\n\n- Sure Wake: Optional LOUD backup sound\n\n- Seven colors available for time display\n\n- Optionally keep phone from sleeping\n\n- Huge landscape time display\n\n- App works even when phone is sleeping (locked)"

You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

Das erinnert dich an deine Zukunft - deine Kreationen werden wahr. \n\nDarüber hinaus beinhaltet diese App die Meditationen \"Morgen- und Abendmeditation\". Beginne und schließe deinen Tag mit diesen Meditationen.\n\nBeschreibung der Meditationen:\nEs ist Zeit, sich nicht mehr von der Vergangenheit her zu definieren, sondern seine eigene vollständig neue Zukunft zu erschaffen.\n\nIn dem du diese Morgen und Abend-Meditation ausführst, wirst du dich selbst besser wahrnehmen lernen. Du wirst Veränderungen in deinem mentalen und physischen Gesundheitszustand bemerken. Ebenso wird sich dein Stress-Level verringern, dein Immunsystem stärken sowie dein Gedächtnis, deine Konzentrationsfähigkeit und deine Energie verbessern. Im gegenwärtigen Moment zu leben verstärkt auch deine Selbstachtung und verbessert deine Gesamt-Stimmung.\n\nDie Morgenmeditation hilft dir, dich mental auf den kommenden Tag vorzubereiten.\n\nFolge bei der Abendmeditation einfach der geführten Meditation. Sie hilft dir, auf Kurs zu bleiben und erleichtert deinem Geist und deinem Körper einen erholsamen Schlaf.\n\nJeden Tag leitet dich Dr. Joe Schritt für Schritt an, um deine Vision einer neuen Zukunft zu erschaffen. Er unterstützt dich, die Möglichkeiten aus dem Quantum-Feld in das reale Leben zu holen.\n\n1. Einführung (15:00 Minuten)\n2. Morgenmeditation (24:00 Minuten)\n3. Abendmeditation (23:00 Minuten)\nGesamt: 62 Minuten \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b67BDG3s51Q"

      "label": "DBT Distress Tolerance Skills are meant to:\n- Get through moments of intense emotion WITHOUT MAKING THINGS WORSE\n- Sometimes you can't make things better, but you can brave the storm.\nDBT Distress Tolerance Skills are NOT for:\n- Making your life worth living\n- Long-term changes\n\nIn DBT, we recognize that not every situation can be made better in the moment. Maybe you're having a fight with someone. Or maybe you're road raging. Whatever the situation, you may not be able to remember your DBT skills and suddenly become saint-like. You're human, and you have emotions. You might not be able to stop being angry when you're in a fight with someone, but you can at least not make things worse by saying every negative thing on your mind until you really hurt the other person.\n\nHow this app will help you:\n\nLike all our 'Tools' apps, we'll start you off with a description of what DBT is. While DBT is a set of skills, there is also a sort of culture around it. And a way of teaching/learning it. Getting an overview of what DBT is, you can more easily see where the skills fit in, and where you can most effectively integrate them into your day-to-day.\n\nThen we'll go over the 7 DBT Distress Tolerance skills:\n• TIP\n• Pros & Cons\n• Distract/Soothe/Improve\n• Radical Acceptance\n• Willingness\n• Mindfulness of Current Thoughts\n• Half-Smiling\n\nFinally, we'll start you off using the Interactive Tools:\n• Suicide Prevention Hotline: While many of us come to DBT with no suicidal thoughts, some of us do. If you aren't already using this hotline as a resource, you may want to consider it. Use this tool to quickly connect to a real person when you are in moments of High Distress. Or even if you have someone else you are worried about, this can be used as well. We'll help dispel some of the stigmas and answer some of the FAQs in this tool as well.\n\n• Fix My Temperature: Did you know that your temperature can have a huge impact on your emotions, and thus thoughts and actions? Use this tool to become more aware of what temperature settings can help trigger you, and what you can do to recognize and remedy this when it does happen.\n\n• My Exercises: One of the fastest ways to deflate distress is through exercise. Not only does it result in your brain creating feel-good chemicals, but it often just gets you physically out of a bad situation temporarily. Use this tool to help you come up with exercises that you can do when you feel Distressed. What you do is important for your activity level.\n\n• My DSI Activities: By going through this set of steps, you can easily go from negative to positive. Use this tool to create a list of activities that work for you in moments of Distress.\n\n• Mental Willingness: Every notice that some days, you feel like you don't want to be doing what you're doing? And as a result, you just make a bad situation worse? By on another day, you just don't care? So suddenly a negative situation becomes neutral, or even positive? Use this tool to help you create that sense of willingness and openness created even in negative situations.\n\n• A Week of Half Smiling: Do you know how to Half-Smile? Do you already practice it? If not, you can use this tool to give yourself challenges when it comes to Half-Smiling. Learn not only how to Half-Smile, but learn through experience how it affects you and your mood.\n\nMany of these tools are powerful while you're first learning DBT. But they are also incredibly powerful as a refresher. Beginners and Advanced DBT practitioners will find value in this app now, and for years to come should they remember to use it.\n\n* Note that this app can integrate with the Health App by adding 'Mindful Minutes' by completing 'Mental Willingness' entries.. This is optional and giving permission will not affect your ability to use this app."

      "label": "Want to get fit and feel fantastic? Want to add some fresh air to your exercise? Then Get Running with the best Couch to 5k App!\n\nWith three enjoyable workouts a week, in nine weeks you will be running continuously for half an hour, even if getting off the couch is a struggle today!\n\nGet Running breaks through the “beginning barrier” with its enormously popular Couch to 5k running plan. In week one’s workouts you'll alternate one minute of running with 90 seconds of walking. With each new week, Get Running’s human voice coach gradually builds up your pace, until you’re running for a whole half-hour!\n\nGet Running is the only Couch to 5K App that:\n\n• Coaches like a human – with hundreds of studio-recorded progress and encouragement prompts.\n• Supports and encourages you – talk with fellow running rookies on the Get Running forum.\n• Lets you share (NEW!) – share Get Running with up to three other runners: you all get your own log and settings!\n• Helps you plan – rest days help you recover, and Get Running knows the best day for your next run.\n• Displays your next move – the unique Run Clock, customised for each workout, gives complete visibility and understanding.\n\nIn addition, Get Running:\n\n• Works with or without music. Or listen to podcasts and audio books.\n• Fits your schedule – just three workouts a week of 20 to 30 minutes.\n• Logs your achievements – with an illuminating visual record of your progress.\n\nThousands of people have changed their lives with Get Running and you will too! Whether you’re running for your health, training for a 5K, or building to conquer a marathon — Get Running!\n\nGet Running's users say:\n\n• Just finished week 9 run 3 and all I can say is this app changed my life. Great job.\n\n• I LOVE your app. I have tried several but Yours is the BEST for me. I am 60 years young this year & a cancer survivor. I have set the goal to run 5 K races. I use your program as my trainer, it is SUPER. Thank You. – Vickie Wheeler by email\n\n• I tried the top selling \"Couch to 5k\" App before I purchased this one, and this one is much nicer to use. The voice reminders are very helpful. I like how it pauses your music instead of talking over it. I highly recommend it over the others.\n\n• Thank you so much for this little gem of an app. I had a look at others like it but this wins hands down. It is so brilliantly simple with a great interface.\n\n• Thank you! This app has changed my life. I was unfit and didn't do any regular exercise. I always blamed my asthma for being the reason I couldn't run for longer than a minute, but now I know it's because I was unfit! I have signed up for a 5k race too! – @amyriddett on Twitter\n\n• Really great app. I'm actually looking forward to running. I listen to podcasts and this app is terrific at pausing the show to make it's announcements. I don't miss anything that was said. Outstanding."

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

      "label": "Cardiograph is an application which measures your heart rate. You can save your results for future reference, keep track of multiple people with individual profiles, add notes and locations, and even print out your measurements for sharing or safe keeping.\n\nCardiograph uses your device's built-in camera to take pictures of your fingertip and calculate your heart's rhythm - the same approach used by professional medical equipment!\n\n\"I know you have the disclaimer on the screen but I don't care, Cardiograph saved my life. Your app was key to understanding what was going on and help the doctors understand too.\"\nBob Spadafora - *****\n\n\"Comparing heart rates with family over the holidays is fun.\"\nTxyak – ****\n\n\"Wanna impress a friend with a cool app. This is the one to get.\"\nMattyray – *****\n\n\"After having two heart valve replacements and a by-pass, I feel it is not only smart - but also necessary - to have such a reliable heart rate monitor with me everywhere I go.\"\nDantv – *****\n\n\"I am an EMT and it helps me actually see what is going on. It is by no means definitive like a monitor but it is a great indicator of problems I would not see otherwise.\"\nGranniem – ****\n\n\"I had a pulse oximeter on one hand, medical quality, and my iPhone app in the other and the app was dead-on accurate.\"\nLike it but hate it – *****\n\n\n=== See Cardiograph in action ===\nhttp://macropinch.com/cardiograph \nhttp://youtu.be/isIjcCFYEho\n\n\n• Measure your heart rate\n\nIt's never been easier to know what your heart rate is! Without any external hardware, just using the built-in camera of your smartphone or tablet, you can get accurate readings almost instantly.\n\nKnowing how fast your heart is beating can be very useful when exercising, if you're under stress, if you have a heart-related medical condition, or even just out of curiosity.\n\n\n• Track your results\n\nEvery measurement you take is saved to your personal history, so you can keep track over time. In addition to the date and time of the measurement, you can also save the location at which it was taken (and see them on a map), and even add a quick note to effortlessly organize your history.\n\n\n• Multiple profiles\n\nCardiograph is perfectly tailored to allow multiple people to use the app on a shared device. You can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them has their own individual measurement history.\n\n\n• Export & Print\n\nEach measurement can be exported in full detail to a portable format that you can later send via e-mail, upload on the web or even print right from the app itself (with an AirPrint™ compatible printer).\n\n\n• Clean and intuitive design\n \nInspired by real-life medical equipment, Cardiograph is a pleasure to use. The streamlined and clutter-free design makes it seem instantly familiar, so you can focus on using the app instead of navigating through series of confusing screens.\n\n\n• Built-in user guide\n\nIf you're having trouble with the app, or you want to make the most out of it, you can access the comprehensive help manual right from within the app itself.\n\n\n• Universal application with iCloud® sync\n\nCardiograph is an universal application - it runs on the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod touch.\nInstall Cardiograph on multiple devices with iOS 5.0+, and all your profiles and measurements will be in sync! Manage your profiles and measurements on one device, and the changes are instantly reflected on all the others.\n\n\nPlease note: If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\n\n\nFollow the latest news:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch \nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

For long-term health it is recommended that we take approx. 10,000 steps a day. For successful weight loss, daily steps should amount to 12,000-15,000.\n\nTo get started using iSteps, set up your personal profile by entering your height in cm or inches, your weight in lbs or kg, and choose how you want your results displayed, either in kcal or kJ and distance in miles or km. Then press the START button and you are ready to GO! \n\nWe recommend that you wear your iPhone or iPod touch by your waist or in your pocket, but you may need to experiment a bit to find the best location for optimal accuracy. \n\nPlease note: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. With the option to turn off “Daily Totals Tracking”, you can save battery when needed."

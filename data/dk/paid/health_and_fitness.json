Use our easy-to-use exercise builder to create your own custom exercise routine, and then track your progress as you perform each exercise. Full Fitness allows you to log your exercises, view progress graphs, and email or backup the results online.\n\nNot sure which exercises to perform? Use one of our 30 pre-defined routines to reach a particular goal. All of our routines are developed by licensed fitness professionals and come with complete instructions.\n\nIf you have no equipment available, or are more interested in cardio or stretches, Full Fitness has you covered! Tracking of cardio exercises, over 40 stretches and exercises and routines that require no equipment are all included! Full Fitness does even more. Track your food intake and body weight, schedule workouts, setup profiles to track more than one user, and more.

      "label": "WHAT IS BRUXAPP?\nBruxApp is the first globally available, research-based smartphone app dedicated to the study and management of Bruxism and its health consequences.\nDesigned by top international experts in a multi-center Bruxism research project and developed in 25 Research Centres across the world. \n\nWHAT CAN IT DO?\nBruxapp is a simple tool used by dentists and patients for several purposes:\n- To help the assessment  of the presence/absence of bruxism-related activities (i.e., teeth clenching or grinding, jaw clenching) and potential consequences.\n- For rating the severity of bruxism, if present.\n- As a biofeedback-based management tool for bruxism.\n- To increase patients’ awareness of bruxism activities so they can avoid or correct negative habits.\n- To make patients aware of the possible clinical consequences of bruxism and try to prevent them.\n- To promote cutting-edge knowledge about bruxism, based on the latest scientific research.\n\nWHY is BruxApp needed? \nBruxism has been increasing in prevalence over recent years. It encompasses motor activities of the jaw muscles, such as jaw or teeth clenching, and teeth grinding, some of which may be associated with clinical signs and symptoms, like tooth wear, failed dental restorations, complications with implant-supported prosthesis, muscle fatigue and temporomandibular joint pain. A correct diagnosis is therefore fundamental to establishing early prevention and management regimens.\n\nSCIENTIFIC RESEARCH\nStudies with BruxApp have been supervised by experts, as part of an ongoing multicenter research project on bruxism epidemiology and management coordinated by Prof. Daniele Manfredini, University of Siena, Italy.\n\nDEVELOPMENT\nThe app was developed by Goran Djukic, program analyst at the Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Council of Research, University of Pisa, Italy.\nBruxApp is currently available in the following languages: English, Italian, , French, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish, Brazilian, Japanese, Hebrew, Chinese, Arabic, Greek, Polish, Lithuanian, Bosnian, Romanian, Turkish, Norwegian, and Croatian, with another 4 language versions soon to be released. \n\nIMPORTANT STATEMENT\nBruxApp is not a game or gadget.  In order for BruxApp to work correctly and be effective, please dedicate 5 minutes of your time to READING the simple instructions CAREFULLY. \n\nThe full compatibility is guaranteed by iPhone 6 and higher ones and iOS 9.3 and higher ones."

We do something very different: we STOP and LOOK and take a picture of every bite BEFORE we eat it. Believe it or not, there have been studies that have found that the act of taking a picture before you take a bite is more effective than simply keeping a written journal.* \n\nAlready following a particular plan? dietSNAPS works with every program: from Paleo and Keto to DASH and 5:2, from Weight Watchers to Jenny Craig, to simply just eating clean, dietSNAPS works with you and the way you eat. \n\nWe hear everyday from the dietSNAPS community about how easy it is to use and how thrilled they are that they can FINALLY stick to keeping a journal. We look forward to hearing from you too. \n\nDESCRIPTION: \n• The easiest way to track your diet on the iPhone \n• Use your camera to visually keep track of what you eat, drink, your exercise and more \n• Email your dietSNAPS log to your nutritionist, personal trainer, doctor or diet buddy \n• Export your log via .CSV and view your log (no photos) in Excel or other spreadsheet software \n• Create PDF reports of your log\n\nUSE dietSNAPS TO: \n• Track your diet to help you lose weight \n• Share your dietSNAPS photos on Facebook and Twitter \n• Track your exercise\n• Keep track of food allergies and intolerances \n• Monitor your IBS symptoms \n• Keep a photographic journal of your culinary adventures ~ Bon Appétit!\n• Use the journal function to write how your day was, how you were feeling and how your diet was impacted \n\n\nUSER REVIEWS: \n“This is the first diet tracker that I’ve been able to stick with for more than a few days!” by lillith99 (5 Stars)\n\n“I’m using it to keep track of my blood sugars and my food intake.

The app has been developed by experts to ensure you the best training. \nUse the app as inspiration to look after your body each day and develop good habits early on.\n\nWhy is training important? \nPregnancy and birth are hard on the body and caring for a newborn will present you with awkward lifting and breastfeeding positions, sore nursing shoulders and sleepless nights.\n\nFor many women it is difficult to find the energy to look after their body when they have given birth. \nTraining is an important way to rediscover your body and get back to the activities you were used to before your pregnancy. The idea is to get started as quickly as possible and train correctly and regularly. \n\nWe have therefore chosen the physiotherapist's best exercises for this app - They are easy to get into, strengthen the entire body and can be done anywhere and any time - e.g. on the floor with your baby.\n\nThe exercises will look after your entire body.\n1. The pelvic floor\n2. Breastfeeding and work posture\n4. Curl, bend and wriggle \n5. Core training, buttocks and hip muscles \n6. Relaxation\n\nFunctions:\nThe postnatal app has many different functions to ensure that your training goes smoothly\n- Reminders\n- Videos with exercises \n- Audio files\n- ’My downloads’: Your downloaded videos and audio files for playing offline.\n\nDeveloped by experts\nGynZone has developed the app in collaboration with physiotherapist and PhD Ulla Due."

      "label": "The first app dedicated to training men how to last longer in bed, through two simple exercises you can do anywhere!\n\nStamena trains your “PC muscle,” which makes it easy to stop yourself ejaculating, delays the onset of ejaculation, and even lets you have non-ejaculatory orgasms!\n\nOther kegel apps, built for women, ignore the most important exercise for male sexual stamina: the reverse kegel! \n\nReverse kegels train your PC muscles to relax, making sure that you can slow yourself down during sex. Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

      "label": "AutoWake is the first haptic smart alarm for your Watch. \n\nIt can wake you up by tapping you on your wrist using your Watch's haptic engine. You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

      "label": "PULSALARM warns you via vibration or warning tone when you exceed your set upper and lower pulse limit and thus supports you in your pulse-based training. You can train as usual with your favorite fitness or running app. All you need to do is install PULSALARM on your Apple Watch.\n\nFeatures of the Apple Watch App:\n- Vibration and/or warning tone when the set pulse limits are reached\n- Vibration and/or signal tone when returning to the set pulse range\n- Pulse limits can be deactivated individually\n- Large, easy to read display of the current pulse\n- Fast adjustment of pulse limits (also possible while running)\n- Works together with all known fitness, training and running apps that can be started on the Apple Watch\n- Does not write data to Apple Health\n- You can use the app on your Apple Watch without having your iPhone with you\n\nFeatures of the iPhone App:\n- Calculation of your maximum heart rate\n- Individual calculation of the 5 intensity ranges (depending on your maximum heart rate) \n- Adoption of the pulse limits from the training zones\n- Setting the maximum and minimum pulse limit \n- Large display of the current pulse\n\nImportant note: without the use with an Apple Watch, the functional range of the app is limited, as no permanent pulse measurement can be carried out.\n\nNo advertising, no tracking, no third-party codes. Developed with passion and programmed in Germany.\n\nWhy use PULSALARM additionally? \nMany running apps include the pace as a target in their training plans. However, the same speed can mean a high intensity for one person and a low intensity for another. It is therefore helpful to consider your heart rate instead of speed to determine and maintain the right training intensity. \nPULSALARM helps you to do this. It turns your Apple Watch into a heart rate monitor. \n\nWhat is the big advantage?\nYou no longer have to look at your Apple Watch during your workout and still know whether you are exercising within your personal heart rate zone. Also ideal in colder months, when your Apple Watch is hidden under a jacket or long-sleeved shirt and you can't look directly at the display while running.\n\nFor whom is PULSALARM suitable?\n- Ideal for run beginners, as they can control themselves better and protect themselves from overstraining.\n- Ideal for ambitious runners, as they can train more specifically in their intensity ranges and thus increase endurance and performance.\n- For all athletes and fitness enthusiasts who are interested in heart rate monitoring during their training with their Apple Watch.\n\nSummary:\nWith the PULSALARM app on the iPhone you can determine your 5 intensity ranges based on your maximum heart rate. You can enter your maximum heart rate directly or have it calculated. Set your personal maximum heart rate limit, which you do not want to exceed during training, and your minimum heart rate limit. When these limits are reached, your Apple Watch will alert you by vibrating and/or beeping."

      "label": "App´en “Mentaliseringsguiden” indeholder indtalte indsovnings- og medtationsøvelser fra bogen “Mentaliseringsguiden\".\n\nDer er tale om 4 forskellige indtalte guidede øvelser, der understøtter evnen til at regulere følelser og finde ro i forskellige situationer i hverdagen.\n \nLydøvelserne er lavet til børn, unge, voksne og professionelle, der har brug for en hurtig hjælp til at finde ro, skabe refleksion eller falde i søvn.\nØvelserne tager afsæt i den mentaliseringsbaserede tankegang. Mentaliseringsbaseret behandling er en evidensbaseret metode til behandling og udvikling af evnen til mentalisering. Mentalisering er en en betegnelse for evnen til at have fokus på egne og andres mentale tilstande. “Mentaliseringsguiden” er en bog af Psykolog Janne Østergaard Hagelquist, der udkom i 2015 og indeholder en lang række redskaber og øvelser til brug ifm. børn, unge og voksne.\n\nØvelserne er enkle at anvende. Appén indeholder en funktion, der giver mulighed for at få beroligende “regnlydtæppe\" som baggrund til de indtalte øvelse.\n\nApp´en indeholder 4 øvelser; Drømmerejse, indsovningsøvelse, ÅBENT og Åndedrætsrummet. Den enkelte øvelse er ledsaget af søde tegninger, og er let at bruge for både børn og voksne: \n\n1) ÅBENT temperaturmåleren er tænkt som en hurtig lydguide til brug i situationer, hvor der er konflikter og intense følelser. Den kan bruges af professionelle, såvel som private, når der er brug for at vurdere, om man har en indstilling præget af et ÅBENT sind, som giver mulighed for konstruktiv og mentaliserende dialog.\n\n2) Indsovningsøvelsen er en guidet indsovningsøvelse, som kan bruges til støtte til at skabe ro til at falde i søvn. Øvelsen er tiltænkt børn, men kan også bruges til unge og voksne. \n\n3) Drømmerejsen kan anvendes til at støtte et barn eller en ung til at finde ro og komme i kontakt med egne ressourcer. Igennem den guidede rejse ledes man til et behageligt sted og føres efter et kort ophold med mulighed for at finde egne  ressourcer tilbage til nuet.\n\n4) Åndedrætsrummet er en meditationsøvelse til at finde ro og pause i en hektisk dagligdag. Øvelsen er kort og med fokus på krop sind og lyde, hvilket også illustreres på figuren, der hører til øvelsen. Ved jævnligt brug er det muligt, at øvelser kan hjælpe en til at komme i kontakt med nuet uden brug af den guidede meditation."

      "label": "Drømmekvarteret er mindfulness for børn. De fantasifulde drømmerejser giver en rolig pause i hverdagen og støtter samtidig børnene i at visualisere helt almindelige indtryk og skabe deres egne indre billeder.\n\nDrømmerejserne er opfundet af skolelærer Farnoush Bassri, som i sit arbejde ofte oplevede, at eleverne havde behov for et roligt øjeblik i løbet af dagen. Da børn og forældre begyndte at efterspørge hendes mindfulness-øvelser til brug udenfor  skoletid, udviklede hun sammen med psykolog Ditte Sø og producer Frederik Nordsø, de fem rejser som findes i app’en. Hver især giver de fem drømmerejser børnene mulighed for at etablere en pause ved at lukke øjnene, lytte og bruge deres fantasi. Undervejs visualiseres helt almindelige indtryk og fornemmelser som nysgerrighed, kulde, velbehag og varme. Rejserne støtter børn i at lære at slappe af og mærke fornemmelser og følelser, når de skaber deres egne indre billeder. Både modige og mere forsigtige børn kan trygt begive sig ud på eventyr i Drømmekvarteret.\n\nApp’en er brugervenlig og kan betjenes af barnet selv. Et engangsbeløb på 50 kroner giver adgang til fem drømmerejser, der varer 5-14 minutter og sammenlagt 50 minutter.\n\nAnbefalinger fra børn og forældre\nJeg har igennem hele mit professionelle virke som musiker, komponist og forfatter til bogen \"Ud af musikken\" beskæftiget mig indgående med musikkens mange kvaliteter og musikkens magi. Ikke bare som kunstnerisk nydelse eller medrivende soundtrack til fest og farver, men også som katalysator for indre ro, koncentration og fordybelse.\n\nMusik kan på et splitsekund og på fuldstændig magisk vis flytte vores opmærksomhed, vores fokus og vores følelsesliv fra ét univers til et andet, uden at aktivere de intellektuelle filtre, der i hverdagen fylder os med vaner, tro og mistro, ind i mellem på bekostning af det intuitive, på bekostning af inspirationen, på bekostning af ægte fordybelse.\n\nDrømmekvarteret bringer børn i alle aldre i umiddelbar kontakt med den ro, som er så sund for sjælen og som er en uvurderlig kontrast til en ofte hektisk og ihvert fald mættet dagligdag, og jeg kan derfor kun på det varmeste anbefale projektet, som også mine egne børn har haft umådelig glæde af.\n\n- Benjamin Koppel\n\n\nBørneudtalelser:\nLaura 11 år: Drømmerkvarteret er rigtig dejligt, fordi hvis man er ked af det eller er sur eller sådan noget, så hjælper det, fordi jeg får det ud af min krop og bliver gladere, og når man går tilbage til sin klasse, er man helt afslappet og har det skønt. Ps. Jeg elsker det værksted. Hilsen Laura\n\nViola 8 år: Drømmekvarteret er dejligt og afslappende, og hvis man er sur og ked af det, bliver man glad. Man falder næsten i søvn, og det er rart. Det er dejligt at ligge ned i skoletiden eller sidde op med lukket øjne. Ps. Jeg elsker det. Kh Viola.\n\nMiel 11 år: Jeg kan godt lide Drømmekvarteret, fordi man næsten falder i søvn og man kan lytte og mærke sin krop.\n\nMolly 10 år: Drømmekvarteret er dejligt. Man får ro i hele kroppen, jeg falder næsten helt i søvn, og jeg elsker det.\n\n\nPersonerne bag Drømmekvarteret\n\nFarnoush Bassri\nFolkeskolelærer Farnoush Bassri har læst pædagogisk filosofi på DPU og arbejdet på Freinetskolen i København de sidste seks år. Hun har i mange år har haft praktisk erfaring med udførelsen af mindfulness for børn og testede først idéen til Drømmekvarteret via sit arbejde. \n\nDitte Sø\nPsykolog Ditte Sø har arbejdet med børn og unge, siden hun blev færdiguddannet fra Københavns Universitet. Efter en efteruddannelse i kognitiv terapi for børn og unge var hun med til at opstarte Efterskolen Epos på Als.\n\nFrederik Nordsø\nDen anerkendte producer, komponist og musiker Frederik Nordsø har arbejdet med en danske og internationale kunstnere som f.eks. Brandy og Christopher, og han har vundet utallige priser for sit arbejde. \n\nMikkel Nordsø \nEr guitarist på musikken komponeret til Drømmekvarteret."

Use any of the available, most popular 1 Rep Max formulas to estimate your 1 rep maximum weight and keep a log to see your progress over time.\n\nSimply select a lift type, enter a weight and a number of repetitions (up to 10), and tap the Calculate button to see your 1 Rep Max.\n\nWith My 1 Rep Max Premium, you can create your own custom lifts and use more than 10 repetitions to perform calculations.\n\nA Note About Safety:\nOne rep maximum calculators are used to estimate the maximum amount you can lift. The degree of accuracy can vary significantly depending on your experience with weight training as well as your muscular composition. Most one rep maximum calculators are designed for experienced strength trainers so, if you are inexperienced, you may find your actual one rep maximum is much lower because your body is not accustomed to the stress of lifting heavy weight. Because it can be dangerous to attempt to lift your estimated maximum, always have a spotter with you. Seriously.\n\nMy 1 Rep Max will never bother you to request a rating or review. However,  if you'd like to take the time to rate or review it, you can do so from the Settings screen and that would be swell."

      "label": "If you love working out with Apple Watch, but you need more advanced fitness stats, HealthFit is for you.\n\nBy analyzing the workout data stored in Apple Health, HealthFit provides the kind of indispensable tracking and insights you normally only get from premium subscription services. But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times. You can even log which bike or shoes you use, to monitor usage and flag when it’s time to replace them.\n\nHealthFit finds photos you take during your workouts automatically, bringing your activity feed to life with stunning images you can share on social media.\n\nRUNNING POWER ANALYSIS\n\nHealthFit provides advanced running power analysis with the automatically estimated critical power, the weighted average power, the power distribution chart by 25W Increments and the mean maximal power chart which shows your best average power for time periods of one second up to the length of your run.\n\nMULTISPORT AND INTERVAL WORKOUTS\n\nHealthFit is the only app to export multisport workouts as multisession activities\n\nSTATISTICS: UNCOVER HIDDEN FITNESS INSIGHTS\n\nApple Watch gathers so much fitness data, it can sometimes seem overwhelming. HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio.

Then Get Running with the best Couch to 5k App!\n\nWith three enjoyable workouts a week, in nine weeks you will be running continuously for half an hour, even if getting off the couch is a struggle today!\n\nGet Running breaks through the “beginning barrier” with its enormously popular Couch to 5k running plan. In week one’s workouts you'll alternate one minute of running with 90 seconds of walking. With each new week, Get Running’s human voice coach gradually builds up your pace, until you’re running for a whole half-hour!\n\nGet Running is the only Couch to 5K App that:\n\n• Coaches like a human – with hundreds of studio-recorded progress and encouragement prompts.\n• Supports and encourages you – talk with fellow running rookies on the Get Running forum.\n• Lets you share (NEW!) – share Get Running with up to three other runners: you all get your own log and settings!\n• Helps you plan – rest days help you recover, and Get Running knows the best day for your next run.\n• Displays your next move – the unique Run Clock, customised for each workout, gives complete visibility and understanding.\n\nIn addition, Get Running:\n\n• Works with or without music. Or listen to podcasts and audio books.\n• Fits your schedule – just three workouts a week of 20 to 30 minutes.\n• Logs your achievements – with an illuminating visual record of your progress.\n\nThousands of people have changed their lives with Get Running and you will too! Whether you’re running for your health, training for a 5K, or building to conquer a marathon — Get Running!\n\nGet Running's users say:\n\n• Just finished week 9 run 3 and all I can say is this app changed my life. Great job.\n\n• I LOVE your app. I have tried several but Yours is the BEST for me. I am 60 years young this year & a cancer survivor. I have set the goal to run 5 K races. I use your program as my trainer, it is SUPER. Thank You. – Vickie Wheeler by email\n\n• I tried the top selling \"Couch to 5k\" App before I purchased this one, and this one is much nicer to use. The voice reminders are very helpful. I like how it pauses your music instead of talking over it. I highly recommend it over the others.\n\n• Thank you so much for this little gem of an app. I had a look at others like it but this wins hands down. It is so brilliantly simple with a great interface.\n\n• Thank you! This app has changed my life. I was unfit and didn't do any regular exercise. I always blamed my asthma for being the reason I couldn't run for longer than a minute, but now I know it's because I was unfit! I have signed up for a 5k race too! – @amyriddett on Twitter\n\n• Really great app. I'm actually looking forward to running. I listen to podcasts and this app is terrific at pausing the show to make it's announcements. I don't miss anything that was said. Outstanding."

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

Written Meditation Tips help support your experience with the guided meditations. No previous meditation experience is required.\n\n-- Breath Awareness Guided Meditation (5 min) - to get centered and relaxed when you only have time for a short break. \n-- Deep Rest Guided Meditation (13 min) - allows you to sink into a deeply restful state. Many people use this meditation for falling asleep.\n-- Whole Body Guided Relaxation (24 min) - Relax totally and completely with this meditation which helps you locate tension in every part of the body, and let it go.\n\nEach meditation can be listened to with or without music or nature sounds, and you can choose how long to listen to the music or nature sounds after the guided meditation finishes.

      "label": "Cardiograph is an application which measures your heart rate. You can save your results for future reference, keep track of multiple people with individual profiles, add notes and locations, and even print out your measurements for sharing or safe keeping.\n\nCardiograph uses your device's built-in camera to take pictures of your fingertip and calculate your heart's rhythm - the same approach used by professional medical equipment!\n\n\"I know you have the disclaimer on the screen but I don't care, Cardiograph saved my life. Your app was key to understanding what was going on and help the doctors understand too.\"\nBob Spadafora - *****\n\n\"Comparing heart rates with family over the holidays is fun.\"\nTxyak – ****\n\n\"Wanna impress a friend with a cool app. This is the one to get.\"\nMattyray – *****\n\n\"After having two heart valve replacements and a by-pass, I feel it is not only smart - but also necessary - to have such a reliable heart rate monitor with me everywhere I go.\"\nDantv – *****\n\n\"I am an EMT and it helps me actually see what is going on. It is by no means definitive like a monitor but it is a great indicator of problems I would not see otherwise.\"\nGranniem – ****\n\n\"I had a pulse oximeter on one hand, medical quality, and my iPhone app in the other and the app was dead-on accurate.\"\nLike it but hate it – *****\n\n\n=== See Cardiograph in action ===\nhttp://macropinch.com/cardiograph \nhttp://youtu.be/isIjcCFYEho\n\n\n• Measure your heart rate\n\nIt's never been easier to know what your heart rate is! Without any external hardware, just using the built-in camera of your smartphone or tablet, you can get accurate readings almost instantly.\n\nKnowing how fast your heart is beating can be very useful when exercising, if you're under stress, if you have a heart-related medical condition, or even just out of curiosity.\n\n\n• Track your results\n\nEvery measurement you take is saved to your personal history, so you can keep track over time. In addition to the date and time of the measurement, you can also save the location at which it was taken (and see them on a map), and even add a quick note to effortlessly organize your history.\n\n\n• Multiple profiles\n\nCardiograph is perfectly tailored to allow multiple people to use the app on a shared device. You can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them has their own individual measurement history.\n\n\n• Export & Print\n\nEach measurement can be exported in full detail to a portable format that you can later send via e-mail, upload on the web or even print right from the app itself (with an AirPrint™ compatible printer).\n\n\n• Clean and intuitive design\n \nInspired by real-life medical equipment, Cardiograph is a pleasure to use. The streamlined and clutter-free design makes it seem instantly familiar, so you can focus on using the app instead of navigating through series of confusing screens.\n\n\n• Built-in user guide\n\nIf you're having trouble with the app, or you want to make the most out of it, you can access the comprehensive help manual right from within the app itself.\n\n\n• Universal application with iCloud® sync\n\nCardiograph is an universal application - it runs on the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod touch.\nInstall Cardiograph on multiple devices with iOS 5.0+, and all your profiles and measurements will be in sync! Manage your profiles and measurements on one device, and the changes are instantly reflected on all the others.\n\n\nPlease note: If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\n\n\nFollow the latest news:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch \nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

IN 6 MONTHS\n\"In February of 2011, I weighed 365 pounds. I decided it was time to change. I began to look at programs to help beginning runners. I was convinced that this app from Bluefin Software was the best choice. On July 4th, I ran a 5K! If you're thinking about starting to run, I can tell you - without hesitation - that app from Bluefin is the best start.\"\n– Mark D Rucker\nCompleted 5K and 10k.

For long-term health it is recommended that we take approx. 10,000 steps a day. For successful weight loss, daily steps should amount to 12,000-15,000.\n\nTo get started using iSteps, set up your personal profile by entering your height in cm or inches, your weight in lbs or kg, and choose how you want your results displayed, either in kcal or kJ and distance in miles or km. Then press the START button and you are ready to GO! \n\nWe recommend that you wear your iPhone or iPod touch by your waist or in your pocket, but you may need to experiment a bit to find the best location for optimal accuracy. \n\nPlease note: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. With the option to turn off “Daily Totals Tracking”, you can save battery when needed."

      "label": "This application is a sidekick to the beastmaker 1000 and 2000. It has been designed to assist the user into gradually getting stronger on a fingerboard. The app does this by way of prewritten workouts which are often general and aim to improve all trainable grips on the board. Some are specific (2000 series only at the moment) which aim to improve, sloper strength, pocket strength and crimp strength. \n\nThere is also a new custom workout program fully adjustable and includes the 1000,2000 and micros, so if you have your own hang regime and different timings then that is all programmable and can be saved.\n\nBoth the workouts and custom timer now record hang contraction time (time spent actually hanging off the board) We recommend most users get up to around 20:00 minutes on this clock whilst doing their workouts.\n\nOn the Workout screen after you've selected your work out it is now possible to adjust set and hang times. Users who are only finger boarding and are having a rest day prior to and after training may wish to do up to 3 sets and 7 hangs. Other users may prefer to go for 2 sets and 6 hangs, this is what we'd consider an average and more suited to people doing additional types of training.\n\nPlease note the grades for the workouts aren't actually meant to relate to anything other than themselves. E.G. 5c is easier than 6a but harder than 5b. If you find 5a hard on the 1000, use a weight removal technique such as putting one foot on a chair in front of the board or using a pulley with weights on. More advice on this and other things are available in the general advice section on the Workout Ratings page.\n\nTo record your hangs press the record button (red circle icon) whilst resting. The Workout Ratings function is much improved and should now be a really useful training aid which records gradual progress and improvement.\n\nFingerboard gains take time, remember to warm up thoroughly and move on to more difficult hangs at a slightly slower pace than you think you should to give pulleys time to catch up with muscles. For example 10% strength gains over a year is brilliant improvement. 5% is still effective training.\n\nBest of luck with the training, happy hanging and we hope this helps with the motivation."

The app also makes it easy to keep track of where you are in the cycle.\r\n\r\nThis Russian squat cycle has also been used by many for other lifts such as the bench press, shoulder press and deadlift with big jumps in strength. Smolov isn't for new lifters, but if you have some experience under your belt (like with 5/3/1, starting strength, 20 squat, etc.), then this may be a great lifting protocol for you."

      "label": "Breathe is a new app that uses the diving reflex for stimulation of circulation and lung function and which has a relaxing and pain-relieving effect.\n\nThe app is divided into 3 levels, so everyone can join. All exercises come with videos in English and Danish where Stig will show and explain what to do. The audio track has been recorded so that it can be used without you having to look at the screen. That way, you can simply lie down and let the calmness of Stig's voice guide you through the exercises.\n\nAs an extra, the basic level contains instruction videos that help you get a proper start. \n\nIn order to achieve the best possible result, you should use the app at least 3 times a week.\n\nThe exercises became the pivotal turning point for Stig Pryds who had spent 5 awful years in pain and on medication due to psoriatic arthritis. Today, he lives a strong, healthy and meaningful life in harmony with his condition.\nThe app has been produced in order to help others that experience imbalances. If you do the exercises you will experience better oxygenation and a surplus of energy. This has proven to lead to better self worth in many people.\n\nOnce you master your breathing, you become the master of your life!\n\nUse of the app is on the user’s own responsibility. Contact you general practitioner if you are not sure whether to use it.\n\nEnjoy!"

You can let Green Day Pedometer have access to your step history from the Health App.\n\nWatch out for red days. They really hurt your average.\n\nGreen Day Pedometer displays time using a 24 hour clock so you can easily see how much time there is left in the day.\n\nBy using your location, it shows you accurate sunrise and sunset times so you can make best use of the daylight hours all year round.\n\nMake every day a Green Day!\n\nGreen Day Pedometer works with:\n• iPhone 5S\n• iPhone 6\n• iPhone 6 Plus\n• iPhone 6S\n• iPhone 6S Plus\n• iPhone 7\n• iPhone 7 Plus\n• iPod Touch (6th gen)\n• Apple Watch (with an iPhone listed above)\n• … and probably newer devices\n\nGreen Day Pedometer does NOT work with:\n• iPhone (1st gen)\n• iPhone 3G or iPhone 3GS\n• iPhone 4 or iPhone 4S\n• iPhone 5 or iPhone 5C\n• iPad\n• iPod Touch (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th gen)\n\nGreen Day Pedometer requires Motion & Fitness to display your step count.

She will do whatever it takes - including threatening, inspiring, ridiculing, and bribing you - to make this happen.\n\nYou will get fit - or else.\n\n---\n\n7 Minutes in Hell Workout\nEmploying SCIENCE™ to compact an hours-long workout program into just 7 sweat-and-pop-culture-soaked minutes, CARROT will train you personally on exercises like Mt. Doom Climbs, Celebrity Face Punches, and Dragon Mating Dances. \n\nYou get 30 seconds for each of the 12 punishing exercises,* with 10 seconds of rest in between just in case you need to hydrate, catch your breath, or vomit into a bucket.\n\nThis diabolical interval workout can be completed anywhere, at any time, so you have no excuse not to be in fighting shape when the Robopocalypse begins.\n\n*12 additional exercises can be unlocked via in-app purchase.\n\n---\n\nLose (or Gain) Weight In Style\nAre you ready to have so much fun tracking your weight that you'll actually look forward to hopping on your scale?

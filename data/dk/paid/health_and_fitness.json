You know what it’s like to go through a lot of negative thoughts. You can either continue with a bad gut feeling, and at the same time ruin your surroundings, or you can choose to say: “That is a little annoying, but I decide to say Let it go and move on,” and at the same time, give your ‘Let it go app’ a quick tab.\r\n\nThe Let it go app and concept are based on the Danish word ‘Pyt.’\r\n\r\nDanes are some of the happiest people in the world, and they also happen to have a lot of cool words for ways to be happy.\r\n\r\nYou may have heard about “hygge,” which has been the subject of countless books, articles, and commercials. Often mistranslated to mean “cozy,” but it really describes the process of creating intimacy.\r\n\r\nBut another word, “pyt” was recently voted the most popular word by Danes. Pyt doesn’t have an exact English translation. It’s more a cultural concept about cultivating healthy thoughts to deal with stress.\r\n\r\nPyt — which sort of sounds like “pid” — is usually expressed as an interjection in reaction to a daily hassle, frustration, or mistake. It most closely translates to the English sayings, “Don’t worry about it,” “stuff happens,” or “oh, well.”"

      "label": "App´en “Mentaliseringsguiden” indeholder indtalte indsovnings- og medtationsøvelser fra bogen “Mentaliseringsguiden\".\n\nDer er tale om 4 forskellige indtalte guidede øvelser, der understøtter evnen til at regulere følelser og finde ro i forskellige situationer i hverdagen.\n \nLydøvelserne er lavet til børn, unge, voksne og professionelle, der har brug for en hurtig hjælp til at finde ro, skabe refleksion eller falde i søvn.\nØvelserne tager afsæt i den mentaliseringsbaserede tankegang. Mentaliseringsbaseret behandling er en evidensbaseret metode til behandling og udvikling af evnen til mentalisering. Mentalisering er en en betegnelse for evnen til at have fokus på egne og andres mentale tilstande. “Mentaliseringsguiden” er en bog af Psykolog Janne Østergaard Hagelquist, der udkom i 2015 og indeholder en lang række redskaber og øvelser til brug ifm. børn, unge og voksne.\n\nØvelserne er enkle at anvende. Appén indeholder en funktion, der giver mulighed for at få beroligende “regnlydtæppe\" som baggrund til de indtalte øvelse.\n\nApp´en indeholder 4 øvelser; Drømmerejse, indsovningsøvelse, ÅBENT og Åndedrætsrummet. Den enkelte øvelse er ledsaget af søde tegninger, og er let at bruge for både børn og voksne: \n\n1) ÅBENT temperaturmåleren er tænkt som en hurtig lydguide til brug i situationer, hvor der er konflikter og intense følelser. Den kan bruges af professionelle, såvel som private, når der er brug for at vurdere, om man har en indstilling præget af et ÅBENT sind, som giver mulighed for konstruktiv og mentaliserende dialog.\n\n2) Indsovningsøvelsen er en guidet indsovningsøvelse, som kan bruges til støtte til at skabe ro til at falde i søvn. Øvelsen er tiltænkt børn, men kan også bruges til unge og voksne. \n\n3) Drømmerejsen kan anvendes til at støtte et barn eller en ung til at finde ro og komme i kontakt med egne ressourcer. Igennem den guidede rejse ledes man til et behageligt sted og føres efter et kort ophold med mulighed for at finde egne  ressourcer tilbage til nuet.\n\n4) Åndedrætsrummet er en meditationsøvelse til at finde ro og pause i en hektisk dagligdag. Øvelsen er kort og med fokus på krop sind og lyde, hvilket også illustreres på figuren, der hører til øvelsen. Ved jævnligt brug er det muligt, at øvelser kan hjælpe en til at komme i kontakt med nuet uden brug af den guidede meditation."

It is important to break the habit of dropping into defeatist thoughts and attitudes and learn how to stop yourself from entering into a negative loop that blocks you from achieving your desired outcomes.\n\nThe Healing Your Thoughts App helps to shift the way you think throughout the day and will help to uplift you during challenging times. You are not denying any feelings you are experiencing. Rather it is a process of rephrasing your thoughts to change your train of thought which will lead you to a positive outcome.\n\nYou can program the app for the interval of when you would like to receive an alert of bells, a Tibetan bowl, or chimes being played. When you hear the alert you will read the message that asks you to reflect on: “What are you thinking about right now?” Your thoughts and words are seeds that when planted into your inner garden will grow into plants that do impact your life. It is important to cultivate a deep and rich inner garden to create true joy and health in your life.\n\nOnce you receive the alert go into the Library and tap on the category “word”, “phrase”, “blessing”, or “photo”. A word, phrase, blessing, or photo will appear that will inspire you to stop your current thinking and transmute/transform any negative thinking into positive thoughts. This will also help to shift your attitude and even create an inner smile.\n\nYou can use the words, phrases, blessings, or photos provided. Or you can upload your own.\n\nThe result will be that you will experience feeling more uplifted. In this way you feed yourself with love and light. This will improve your life, giving you more energy, and help you to be more creative in your life and in your work. You will be able to radiate love and light towards yourself, your loved ones, friends, co-workers, and into the world."

These frequencies can be induced in the brain by playing two different tones into each ear (binaural tones), which after being processed by the brain, are perceived as an inaudible beat matching the target brainwave frequency. As you listen, your own brainwaves fall into step and synchronize with this frequency. \n\nBrainWave uses low, mid, and high frequency ranges of Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma binaural tones combined in layers and stages to create powerful multi-stage experiences.\n\n- Morning Coffee: Gentle Alpha & Beta waves to start the day\n- Espresso Shot: Energizing Binaural High Beta & Gamma\n- Morning Meditation: Alpha and Theta for a centered mind\n- Focused and Alert: High beta and gamma to maximize focus.  Centered on the 40 Hz gamma brainwave frequency which has been show in recent studies to be connected with improved cognition.\n- Critical Thinking: Theta,Mid-Beta Blend to boost logical thinking\n- Concentration: Mid Beta Binaural tones for steady concentration\n- Memory Boost: Beta Spectrum Mix to improve memory\n- Problem Solving: Alpha, Theta, and High-Beta for focus and creative problem solving\n- Brainstorm: High Beta to boost lateral thinking.\n- Confidence Boost: Alpha, Beta, High-Theta Mix to boost confidence\n- Pre-Exercise Energy: High-Gamma tones for quick energy\n- Creativity Boost: Increase creativity with Mid-Theta Binaural beats\n- Positive Mood Boost: Low-Theta, High-Theta tones for positive thinking\n- Motivation Boost: High-Alpha, High-Beta blend to increase motivation\n- Euphoria: High-Theta, Beta, and Gamma to stimulate joy\n- Stress Reduction: Mid-Alpha/Theta Mix\n- Anger Relief: Mid-Delta, Alpha\n- Calm Reflection: Mid-Theta \n- Reduce Anxiety: Deeply calming Theta spectrum\n- Deep Relaxation: Relaxing Low-Theta, Delta\n- Meditation: Complex Alpha, Beta and Theta progression\n- Lucid Dreaming: Experience waking dreams\n- Dreamy Sleep: Delta, Theta Mix for deep sleep and dreams\n- Power Nap: Restful nap with a wakeup stage for mental focus\n- Deep Sleep: Low Delta wave sleep, effective for insomnia\n- Deep Sleep with Wake-up Stage: Deep Delta for insomnia with wakeup\n- Dreamy Sleep with Wake-up Stage: Delta, Beta\n- Headache Relief: Relieve headaches with Low-Alpha, Theta, and Delta\n- Hangover Relief: Delta, Theta\n- Yoga Meditation: Centering High-Alpha, Theta\n- Alpha Relaxation: Calming Binaural Alpha\n- Theta Meditation: Pure Theta for Deep meditation\n- Gamma Power Nap: Extra energizing power nap\n- Night Meditation: Low-Theta/Delta to meditate before bed\n- Night Reading: High-Delta/High-Theta for late reading\n\n* Backgrounds *\n\n- Beach Surf\n- Ocean Waves \n- Ocean Waves 2\n- Rain & Thunder\n- Atmospheres: Serenity\n- Atmospheres: Awakening\n- Atmospheres: Space\n- Atmospheres: Drifting\n- Atmospheres: Peace\n- Atmospheres: Floating\n- Atmospheres: Soaring\n- Medium Rain\n- Light Rain \n- Waterfall \n- Flowing Creek \n- Pink Noise\n- Forest\n\n* BrainWave's binaural tones are helpful for Tinnitus as it provides an audio mask for tonal Tinnitus while also reducing the neural hyperactivity that underlies Tinnitus. \n\n* Choose from 10 Gentle Alarms or iTunes\n\n* Do not use Binaural tones while driving or operating machinery"

This sleepmatic sounds machine is created using an ancient but doctor-tested and approved technique to help soothe your fussy baby calm with a shusher sound in cradle. \r\n\r\nA simple baby shusher with soothing sounds for baby that works on a single click, making calming sounds like baby lullaby that would work instantly and can be played for hours, recommended by parents, baby photographers, and doctors dealing with babies.\r\n\r\nBy creating calm sounds, safely stop the baby from crying with a rhythmic “shush” sound that engages a baby's natural calming reflex by reminding them of still being in the womb. The shush baby app helps to soothe baby calm and increase the baby sleep timer.\r\n\r\nThe amazing Sound Equalizer allows the app to \"listen\" to your baby crying or not every three minutes and automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby cry volume till baby calms down (so when the baby is wailing, shush is loud; when baby goes quiet, volume settles into a soothing background shush sound to relax baby).\r\n\r\nA newborn sleep magic baby sound machine that works best for a newborn baby to calm down quickly and manage baby sleeping patterns. A sleep aid that creates calming sounds for babies in the form of a shhh sound sleeper that will stop your baby crying, calms down easily, and put baby to sleep. \r\n\r\nThis shhh app calm baby instantly by creating a shusher sound, helping the baby relax in minutes using calming sounds for kids.  This sleepmatic app works like magic for the crying baby and helps parenting so much easier as baby calmer. \r\n\r\nAfter more than two years of testing and research with real moms and real babies, having sudden and long crying baby issues, we came up with the following very valuable feature list of baby soothing sound.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Safe and easy to use baby calming sounds machine. \r\n- Much more effective than simple lullabies or standard white noise.\r\n- Perfectly works for hours in the background and when the phone is locked\r\n- Adjustable Shush baby sound Timer Options (from 15 minutes to 8 hours of continuous shushing!)\r\n- Automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby crying volume.\r\n- Shush sounds played in low light “dark mode” ( night mode) to avoid extra mobile light as baby sleeps.\r\n- Work in other Apps on your Phone while still using the Baby Shusher App.\r\n\r\n*Note: Turn your phone on silent/mute to let the app do its magic.*\r\n \r\n \r\nWhat Real Moms are Saying About the Baby Shusher:\r\n\r\n“I wish I would have known about this sooner. It is truly a miracle for me and baby to have a good night’s rest together!” Mercedes (mother of 3 months old)\r\n\r\n“It is a must try for yourself.” Isabel (mother of 3.5 months old)\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t sure after the 1st time I used it, but it proved to us that it worked better and better thereafter.

They will be automatically placed in your AM and/or PM routine as recommended.\n\n\n• ADD CUSTOM PRODUCTS\n\nYou can add custom skincare products from other brands by selecting the option in the top-right menu in the Routine section or from the Custom tab in the Products section.\n\n\n• USE YOUR ROUTINE FOR LAYERING ADVICE\n\nThe products are listed in the recommended layering order, along with advice for when and how to use each product.\n\n\n• KEEP TRACK OF USAGE TO AVOID CONFLICTS\n\nEach morning and evening, check each product off your list to keep track of which treatments you have used. This will allow the app to prevent any conflicts by showing you which products should be avoided.\n\n\n• TRACK YOUR SKIN'S PROGRESS\n\nAny time you notice your skin is looking particularly good or bad, you can make a note of it by pressing on the face icon next to the morning or evening routine. You can also add a comment to note down more details for your own record and add photos to track your progress.\n\n\n• ADD PHOTOS\n\nYou can add photos of your skin to your diary tracker and also add photos of custom products.\n\n\n• REMINDERS & TIMERS\n\nYou can set up notifications to remind you about your daily skin regimen. You can also set timers for products which require a specific wait time. Both can be found in the Settings.\n\n\n\n*** Advanced App Customization ***\n\n• RE-ORDER YOUR ROUTINE\n\nIf you don't wish to follow the recommended layering order, you can choose to re-order the products to fully customize your routine by selecting the option from the top right menu (with 3 dots) of the Routine section. You can also change the order of the layer steps, for instance DECIEM recommends oils before moisturizers but some users prefer the other way around.\n\n\n• USE CONFLICTING PRODUCTS\n\nWhen we recommend not using a product due to conflicts with other products or because you've reached the usage limit, you can choose to ignore the warning and use it anyway. You will then have the option to permanently ignore conflicts on that specific product.\n\n\n• SCHEDULE PRODUCTS\n\nYou can choose specific days of the week for a product if you wish. For instance, you may wish to make it so that the \"AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution\" only appears in your routine on Tuesdays and Fridays.\nYou can also choose dates of the month, e.g. the 1st and 15th of every month.\nAnother useful option is to schedule products for every X days, so you could choose every 2 days to alternate.\n\n\n\n*** Recommended for skin concerns... ***\n\n• Dry & Dehydrated Skin: Achieve plump, healthy-looking hydrated skin.\n• Acne-Prone Skin: Reduce inflammation to help support clear skin.\n• Blemishes & Congestion: Reduce inflammation and brighten the skin.\n• Sensitive Skin: Keep your skin moisturized with this gentle routine.\n• Mature Skin & Wrinkles: Promote youthful skin and reduce the signs of aging.\n• Pigmentation Problems: Gently exfoliate and brighten skin tone.\n• Oily Skin: Rebalance your skin for a healthy, fresh look.\n\n\nPlease note, Skincare Routine (previously known as \"Skincare Regimen Organizer\") has no connection with DECIEM, The Ordinary or any other skincare brand."

The Run 10k app is perfect for beginner runners and former runners who want to start running again. This app has voice cues that guide you even when your screen is locked. The app tells you when to run and walk and gives audio cues for distance and pace when you use GPS. You can use this app outside, on a track, or in the gym.\n\nFEATURES\n• Apple Watch app—you can leave your phone at home while you workout with our Watch app, or continue to use our Watch app together with the iPhone app.\n• Speaks pace, distance, intervals, and halfway point. \n• Optionally uses GPS for pace and distance. (You can also use this app on a treadmill or indoor track without GPS.)\n• Animated, spoken stretching programs.\n• Tap out your heart rate on the heart icon.  \n• Supports Bluetooth heart rate monitors.\n• Integrates with the Health app.\n\nABOUT the WORKOUTS\n• 13-week training program for beginners.\n• Each workout ranges from 40 to 76 minutes long.\n• Interval training alternates between jogging and walking.\n• Workout intervals gradually become more challenging.\n• Tapers in the last week for your 10k race.\n• 5-minute warmup and 5-minute cooldown, which are optional.\n• Speaks each jog and walk interval, the halfway mark, and 1-minute-left mark.\n• Optionally speaks pace and distance information every mile or km.\n• Automatically checks off each completed workout and records your date, pace, and distance. \n\nCOMING FROM RUN 5K?\nIf you’ve completed our Run 5k app and you're feeling good, you can start on Week 4 or 5 of our Run 10k app to continue your training. If you’re a couch potato, start from Week 1, or check out our Run 5k app first.\n\nAUDIO CUES and NOTIFICATIONS\nIf you’re not getting Notifications in the background, open the Settings app, select Notifications, then scroll down to find Run 10k in the list. Tap on Run 10k and turn on Notification Center, choose an alert style, and turn everything else on (Sound, Badge App Icon, Lock Screen). Check your volume and make sure your ringer switch is not set to silent/vibrate.\n\nHEALTH\nThis app can be integrated with the Health app. Your weight set in the Health app can be used to calculate Calories burned during a workout, and the total Active Calories burned can be saved to Health app after each workout. Sharing this information to the Health app is optional.\n\nGPS and LOCATION\nTo show distance and pace information, Run 10k can use GPS location tracking during a workout. For best results, use this app outside where you can see open sky. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nLegal Disclaimer: This app and any information given by it or by Felt Tip Inc are for educational purposes only.

Then Get Running with the best Couch to 5k App!\n\nWith three enjoyable workouts a week, in nine weeks you will be running continuously for half an hour, even if getting off the couch is a struggle today!\n\nGet Running breaks through the “beginning barrier” with its enormously popular Couch to 5k running plan. In week one’s workouts you'll alternate one minute of running with 90 seconds of walking. With each new week, Get Running’s human voice coach gradually builds up your pace, until you’re running for a whole half-hour!\n\nGet Running is the only Couch to 5K App that:\n\n• Coaches like a human – with hundreds of studio-recorded progress and encouragement prompts.\n• Supports and encourages you – talk with fellow running rookies on the Get Running forum.\n• Lets you share (NEW!) – share Get Running with up to three other runners: you all get your own log and settings!\n• Helps you plan – rest days help you recover, and Get Running knows the best day for your next run.\n• Displays your next move – the unique Run Clock, customised for each workout, gives complete visibility and understanding.\n\nIn addition, Get Running:\n\n• Works with or without music. Or listen to podcasts and audio books.\n• Fits your schedule – just three workouts a week of 20 to 30 minutes.\n• Logs your achievements – with an illuminating visual record of your progress.\n\nThousands of people have changed their lives with Get Running and you will too! Whether you’re running for your health, training for a 5K, or building to conquer a marathon — Get Running!\n\nGet Running's users say:\n\n• Just finished week 9 run 3 and all I can say is this app changed my life. Great job.\n\n• I LOVE your app. I have tried several but Yours is the BEST for me. I am 60 years young this year & a cancer survivor. I have set the goal to run 5 K races. I use your program as my trainer, it is SUPER. Thank You. – Vickie Wheeler by email\n\n• I tried the top selling \"Couch to 5k\" App before I purchased this one, and this one is much nicer to use. The voice reminders are very helpful. I like how it pauses your music instead of talking over it. I highly recommend it over the others.\n\n• Thank you so much for this little gem of an app. I had a look at others like it but this wins hands down. It is so brilliantly simple with a great interface.\n\n• Thank you! This app has changed my life. I was unfit and didn't do any regular exercise. I always blamed my asthma for being the reason I couldn't run for longer than a minute, but now I know it's because I was unfit! I have signed up for a 5k race too! – @amyriddett on Twitter\n\n• Really great app. I'm actually looking forward to running. I listen to podcasts and this app is terrific at pausing the show to make it's announcements. I don't miss anything that was said. Outstanding."

      "label": "If you love working out with Apple Watch, but you need more advanced fitness stats, HealthFit is for you.\n\nBy analyzing the workout data stored in Apple Health, HealthFit provides the kind of indispensable tracking and insights you normally only get from premium subscription services. But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times. You can even log which bike or shoes you use, to monitor usage and flag when it’s time to replace them.\n\nHealthFit finds photos you take during your workouts automatically, bringing your activity feed to life with stunning images you can share on social media.\n\nRUNNING POWER ANALYSIS\n\nHealthFit provides advanced running power analysis with the automatically estimated critical power, the weighted average power, the power distribution chart by 25W Increments and the mean maximal power chart which shows your best average power for time periods of one second up to the length of your run.\n\nMULTISPORT AND INTERVAL WORKOUTS\n\nHealthFit is the only app to export multisport workouts as multisession activities\n\nSTATISTICS: UNCOVER HIDDEN FITNESS INSIGHTS\n\nApple Watch gathers so much fitness data, it can sometimes seem overwhelming. HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio.

The app has been developed by experts to ensure you the best training. \nUse the app as inspiration to look after your body each day and develop good habits early on.\n\nWhy is training important? \nPregnancy and birth are hard on the body and caring for a newborn will present you with awkward lifting and breastfeeding positions, sore nursing shoulders and sleepless nights.\n\nFor many women it is difficult to find the energy to look after their body when they have given birth. \nTraining is an important way to rediscover your body and get back to the activities you were used to before your pregnancy. The idea is to get started as quickly as possible and train correctly and regularly. \n\nWe have therefore chosen the physiotherapist's best exercises for this app - They are easy to get into, strengthen the entire body and can be done anywhere and any time - e.g. on the floor with your baby.\n\nThe exercises will look after your entire body.\n1. The pelvic floor\n2. Breastfeeding and work posture\n4. Curl, bend and wriggle \n5. Core training, buttocks and hip muscles \n6. Relaxation\n\nFunctions:\nThe postnatal app has many different functions to ensure that your training goes smoothly\n- Reminders\n- Videos with exercises \n- Audio files\n- ’My downloads’: Your downloaded videos and audio files for playing offline.\n\nDeveloped by experts\nGynZone has developed the app in collaboration with physiotherapist and PhD Ulla Due."

      "label": "From your physical body to your emotional state, prenatal yoga is a key ingredient to a healthy, happy pregnancy.\n\nPrenatal yoga sounds like a healthy practice to adopt during pregnancy -- and it is. But what specifically can yoga do to help you feel great and stay calm during the most important nine months of your life? Read on for seven important ways yoga can make a positive difference in your pregnancy.\n\nPrenatal yoga classes are very popular, and when paired with a cardiovascular exercise (such as walking), yoga can be an ideal way for moms-to-be to stay in shape. Whether you're a newbie or a veteran, yoga can keep you limber, tone your muscles, and improve your balance and circulation during pregnancy – all with very little impact on your joints.\n\nYoga is also beneficial because you'll learn how to breathe deeply and consciously relax, which will be helpful as you face the physical demands of labor, birth, and new motherhood. Learning to breathe fully is actually one of the first things you'll learn in a yoga class. To use the breathing technique practiced in yoga, known as ujjayi, you take in air slowly through your nose, fill your lungs as you expand your belly, and exhale completely until your stomach compresses.\n\nCan prenatal yoga be the first time I ever do yoga?\nYes! You don’t have to be a yogi before you conceive to jump on the prenatal yoga bandwagon. As long as your doctor has given you the green light to stay physically active during pregnancy, yoga is an ideal activity for all expectant moms: It’s gentle and designed for pregnancy, which means it helps prepare you for the mental aspects of childbirth (and beyond). But remember, it’s always a good idea to check with your doctor before starting any new exercise during pregnancy."

We'll help you find calm in any situation.\n\nWHAT'S INCLUDED?\n- Over 200 meditations to help overcome life's challenges including anxiety, stress, sleep, pain and difficult emotions\n- Mindfulness exercises you can do wherever you are, in categories such as travelling, at work, waking up, eating, and even when you're online\n- Sessions for complete beginners and those with more experience, with lengths from 3-40 minutes\n- A solo timer for more seasoned meditators\n- A range of experienced teachers so you can choose the voice and style that's right for you\n- Kids content for the little people in your life\n- Brand new buddhify Membership available as an optional in-app purchase with a range of additional features for those looking to take their meditation practice further\n\nBuddhify integrates with Apple Health so you can track your meditation using the Mindful Minutes category within the Health app.\n\nBUDDHIFY MEMBERSHIP\nFor those of you who want to deepen your practice even further, you can do that through Buddhify Membership.

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

      "label": "Cardiograph is an application which measures your heart rate. You can save your results for future reference, keep track of multiple people with individual profiles, add notes and locations, and even print out your measurements for sharing or safe keeping.\n\nCardiograph uses your device's built-in camera to take pictures of your fingertip and calculate your heart's rhythm - the same approach used by professional medical equipment!\n\n\"I know you have the disclaimer on the screen but I don't care, Cardiograph saved my life. Your app was key to understanding what was going on and help the doctors understand too.\"\nBob Spadafora - *****\n\n\"Comparing heart rates with family over the holidays is fun.\"\nTxyak – ****\n\n\"Wanna impress a friend with a cool app. This is the one to get.\"\nMattyray – *****\n\n\"After having two heart valve replacements and a by-pass, I feel it is not only smart - but also necessary - to have such a reliable heart rate monitor with me everywhere I go.\"\nDantv – *****\n\n\"I am an EMT and it helps me actually see what is going on. It is by no means definitive like a monitor but it is a great indicator of problems I would not see otherwise.\"\nGranniem – ****\n\n\"I had a pulse oximeter on one hand, medical quality, and my iPhone app in the other and the app was dead-on accurate.\"\nLike it but hate it – *****\n\n\n=== See Cardiograph in action ===\nhttp://macropinch.com/cardiograph \nhttp://youtu.be/isIjcCFYEho\n\n\n• Measure your heart rate\n\nIt's never been easier to know what your heart rate is! Without any external hardware, just using the built-in camera of your smartphone or tablet, you can get accurate readings almost instantly.\n\nKnowing how fast your heart is beating can be very useful when exercising, if you're under stress, if you have a heart-related medical condition, or even just out of curiosity.\n\n\n• Track your results\n\nEvery measurement you take is saved to your personal history, so you can keep track over time. In addition to the date and time of the measurement, you can also save the location at which it was taken (and see them on a map), and even add a quick note to effortlessly organize your history.\n\n\n• Multiple profiles\n\nCardiograph is perfectly tailored to allow multiple people to use the app on a shared device. You can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them has their own individual measurement history.\n\n\n• Export & Print\n\nEach measurement can be exported in full detail to a portable format that you can later send via e-mail, upload on the web or even print right from the app itself (with an AirPrint™ compatible printer).\n\n\n• Clean and intuitive design\n \nInspired by real-life medical equipment, Cardiograph is a pleasure to use. The streamlined and clutter-free design makes it seem instantly familiar, so you can focus on using the app instead of navigating through series of confusing screens.\n\n\n• Built-in user guide\n\nIf you're having trouble with the app, or you want to make the most out of it, you can access the comprehensive help manual right from within the app itself.\n\n\n• Universal application with iCloud® sync\n\nCardiograph is an universal application - it runs on the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod touch.\nInstall Cardiograph on multiple devices with iOS 5.0+, and all your profiles and measurements will be in sync! Manage your profiles and measurements on one device, and the changes are instantly reflected on all the others.\n\n\nPlease note: If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\n\n\nFollow the latest news:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch \nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

With over 220 exercises, 90+  movies and 20 calculators and hundreds of pages of reference material, Navy SEAL Fitness helps you to train like a Navy SEAL.\n\nTo train for these physically demanding tasks, the Navy created The Navy SEAL Physical Fitness Guide.   The authors of this comprehensive guide, physicians and physiologists, were chosen because of their special qualifications in the area of physical fitness and their knowledge of the SEAL community. Their expertise ensured the guide was written with a goal of expanding the individual Navy SEAL's knowledge of attaining and retaining a high level of fitness.\n\nBecause SEALs train for mission related performance, the objective for every workout is elite fitness, validated by the ability to perform every task at the level necessary to accomplish any mission – no matter what.  What does that mean?  It means that training must be comprised of broad and inclusive, constantly varied functional movements that are performed at high intensity in order to prepare for the unknown.\n\nThe Navy SEALS are an elite branch of the U.S. Special Forces whose reputation for outstanding physical fitness is unparalleled. Now everybody that wants to improve his or her health, strength and endurance can take advantage of this information.\n\nTopics Include:\n* Overview of physical fitness \n* Exercise physiology \n* Muscle structure and Function \n* Principles of physical training \n* Specificity of training\n* Determining your training heart rate\n* Energy systems used by exercising muscle\n* Lactic acid and ATP-CP system for anaerobic work\n* Methods of physical training\n* Cardiorespiratory conditioning\n* Determination of work rate\n* Active recovery\n* How to estimate your maximal aerobic capacity\n* Types of aerobic activities\n* Basic workouts \n* Running for fitness\n* Swimming for fitness \n* Strength training\n* Flexibility training\n* Calisthenics\n* Plyometrics\n* Sports related injuries\n* Physical fitness and training recommendations\n* Weight lifting techniques\n* Anatomical terms and diagrams\n\nBonus Nutritional Material!\nNavy Operational Fitness and Fueling Series (NOFFS) designed by the Navy for \"best in class\" fitness and nutrition performance.\n\nSpecial Operations Forces Nutrition Guide designed by the military to meet the physical and mental demands imposed by special operations training and missions."

If you're thinking about starting to run, I can tell you - without hesitation - that app from Bluefin is the best start.\"\n– Mark D Rucker\nCompleted 5K and 10k. Signed up for half-marathon on Oct 23, 2011!\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

The app also maps and stores all your walks for later view.\n\n• Runs in the background allowing you to lock your phone or use other apps while walking\n• Finds and shows your position and route on a map\n• Maps and stores all your walks for later view\n• Keeps track of number of steps, calories burned, distance walked and walking speed\n• Choose “Daily Totals Tracking” to record all your steps during the day\n\niSteps GPS Pedometer is a fun way to help you promote your physical activity. For long-term health it is recommended that we take approx. 10,000 steps a day. For successful weight loss, daily steps should amount to 12,000-15,000.\n\nTo get started using iSteps, set up your personal profile by entering your height in cm or inches, your weight in lbs or kg, and choose how you want your results displayed, either in kcal or kJ and distance in miles or km. Then press the START button and you are ready to GO! \n\nWe recommend that you wear your iPhone or iPod touch by your waist or in your pocket, but you may need to experiment a bit to find the best location for optimal accuracy. \n\nPlease note: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. With the option to turn off “Daily Totals Tracking”, you can save battery when needed."

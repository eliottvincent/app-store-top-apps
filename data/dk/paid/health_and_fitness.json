      "label": "App´en “Mentaliseringsguiden” indeholder indtalte indsovnings- og medtationsøvelser fra bogen “Mentaliseringsguiden\".\n\nDer er tale om 4 forskellige indtalte guidede øvelser, der understøtter evnen til at regulere følelser og finde ro i forskellige situationer i hverdagen.\n \nLydøvelserne er lavet til børn, unge, voksne og professionelle, der har brug for en hurtig hjælp til at finde ro, skabe refleksion eller falde i søvn.\nØvelserne tager afsæt i den mentaliseringsbaserede tankegang. Mentaliseringsbaseret behandling er en evidensbaseret metode til behandling og udvikling af evnen til mentalisering. Mentalisering er en en betegnelse for evnen til at have fokus på egne og andres mentale tilstande. “Mentaliseringsguiden” er en bog af Psykolog Janne Østergaard Hagelquist, der udkom i 2015 og indeholder en lang række redskaber og øvelser til brug ifm. børn, unge og voksne.\n\nØvelserne er enkle at anvende. Appén indeholder en funktion, der giver mulighed for at få beroligende “regnlydtæppe\" som baggrund til de indtalte øvelse.\n\nApp´en indeholder 4 øvelser; Drømmerejse, indsovningsøvelse, ÅBENT og Åndedrætsrummet. Den enkelte øvelse er ledsaget af søde tegninger, og er let at bruge for både børn og voksne: \n\n1) ÅBENT temperaturmåleren er tænkt som en hurtig lydguide til brug i situationer, hvor der er konflikter og intense følelser. Den kan bruges af professionelle, såvel som private, når der er brug for at vurdere, om man har en indstilling præget af et ÅBENT sind, som giver mulighed for konstruktiv og mentaliserende dialog.\n\n2) Indsovningsøvelsen er en guidet indsovningsøvelse, som kan bruges til støtte til at skabe ro til at falde i søvn. Øvelsen er tiltænkt børn, men kan også bruges til unge og voksne. \n\n3) Drømmerejsen kan anvendes til at støtte et barn eller en ung til at finde ro og komme i kontakt med egne ressourcer. Igennem den guidede rejse ledes man til et behageligt sted og føres efter et kort ophold med mulighed for at finde egne  ressourcer tilbage til nuet.\n\n4) Åndedrætsrummet er en meditationsøvelse til at finde ro og pause i en hektisk dagligdag. Øvelsen er kort og med fokus på krop sind og lyde, hvilket også illustreres på figuren, der hører til øvelsen. Ved jævnligt brug er det muligt, at øvelser kan hjælpe en til at komme i kontakt med nuet uden brug af den guidede meditation."

It was orchestrated to prove that health was not only for the rich, but for everyone. No matter where you come from we are a home for you. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Phatt program teaches you about you, your gut , your health and how to maintain a healthy lifestyle for the rest of your life. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhatt consists of three main steps : \r\n\r\n1. To take away the sugar from your diet & to introduce the value of specific Nutrition.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2. To learn about the foods that will enhance your gut health.  This is the section where you will lose the majority of your weight  and within days you will begin to see results.  Your gut will gain strength as you learn to mono-eat and identify the foods that will compliment your gut health. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   3.   Maintenance:  here you are reintroduced to a wider variety of foods that will enable you to live a healthy lifestyle for the rest of your life.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo successfully complete the program you must complete step 3.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThroughout your program you are gifted with support and this App is connected to your own Personal Mentor.   They will guide you daily and make sure that you are accountable on your journey.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe supply you with meal plans and recipes  but for those of you who need certain dietary requirements there are optional swap-outs.  This App allows that to be done easily without any mathematics on your behalf. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe are extremely proud of this App as it has been in the making for several years.  It has been designed to take away the guess work and to support our customers to the best of our ability. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWeight loss is not only a health journey but it is also a mental journey. It is just as important to recognise that your mental health plays a role in weight loss and needs support. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCongratulations on taking the first step of living a healthier life.   By making a difference to your life you will be surprised how it will suddenly make a difference to your whole family. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYour children will see you make healthy choices and your language to them will change.   We all want to be the best example to our little ones. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHealth Wealth and Choice is the mantra that Phatt sings.  We can teach you about health, we can give you a wealth of knowledge but the greatest gift we will give you is choice.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nChoose to live.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGood luck, stay positive and enjoy the change.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt’s your turn to smile"

      "label": "AutoWake is the first haptic smart alarm for your Watch. \n\nIt can wake you up by tapping you on your wrist using your Watch's haptic engine. You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

This app calculates the weights you should use, based on your one rep max, for the 3-week Smolov Jr. and 13-week Full Smolov Squat protocols. The app also makes it easy to keep track of where you are in the cycle.\r\n\r\nThis Russian squat cycle has also been used by many for other lifts such as the bench press, shoulder press and deadlift with big jumps in strength. Smolov isn't for new lifters, but if you have some experience under your belt (like with 5/3/1, starting strength, 20 squat, etc.), then this may be a great lifting protocol for you."

The app has been developed by experts to ensure you the best training. \nUse the app as inspiration to look after your body each day and develop good habits early on.\n\nWhy is training important? \nPregnancy and birth are hard on the body and caring for a newborn will present you with awkward lifting and breastfeeding positions, sore nursing shoulders and sleepless nights.\n\nFor many women it is difficult to find the energy to look after their body when they have given birth. \nTraining is an important way to rediscover your body and get back to the activities you were used to before your pregnancy. The idea is to get started as quickly as possible and train correctly and regularly. \n\nWe have therefore chosen the physiotherapist's best exercises for this app - They are easy to get into, strengthen the entire body and can be done anywhere and any time - e.g. on the floor with your baby.\n\nThe exercises will look after your entire body.\n1. The pelvic floor\n2. Breastfeeding and work posture\n4. Curl, bend and wriggle \n5. Core training, buttocks and hip muscles \n6. Relaxation\n\nFunctions:\nThe postnatal app has many different functions to ensure that your training goes smoothly\n- Reminders\n- Videos with exercises \n- Audio files\n- ’My downloads’: Your downloaded videos and audio files for playing offline.\n\nDeveloped by experts\nGynZone has developed the app in collaboration with physiotherapist and PhD Ulla Due."

      "label": "Want to get fit and feel fantastic? Want to add some fresh air to your exercise? Then Get Running with the best Couch to 5k App!\n\nWith three enjoyable workouts a week, in nine weeks you will be running continuously for half an hour, even if getting off the couch is a struggle today!\n\nGet Running breaks through the “beginning barrier” with its enormously popular Couch to 5k running plan. In week one’s workouts you'll alternate one minute of running with 90 seconds of walking. With each new week, Get Running’s human voice coach gradually builds up your pace, until you’re running for a whole half-hour!\n\nGet Running is the only Couch to 5K App that:\n\n• Coaches like a human – with hundreds of studio-recorded progress and encouragement prompts.\n• Supports and encourages you – talk with fellow running rookies on the Get Running forum.\n• Lets you share (NEW!) – share Get Running with up to three other runners: you all get your own log and settings!\n• Helps you plan – rest days help you recover, and Get Running knows the best day for your next run.\n• Displays your next move – the unique Run Clock, customised for each workout, gives complete visibility and understanding.\n\nIn addition, Get Running:\n\n• Works with or without music. Or listen to podcasts and audio books.\n• Fits your schedule – just three workouts a week of 20 to 30 minutes.\n• Logs your achievements – with an illuminating visual record of your progress.\n\nThousands of people have changed their lives with Get Running and you will too! Whether you’re running for your health, training for a 5K, or building to conquer a marathon — Get Running!\n\nGet Running's users say:\n\n• Just finished week 9 run 3 and all I can say is this app changed my life. Great job.\n\n• I LOVE your app. I have tried several but Yours is the BEST for me. I am 60 years young this year & a cancer survivor. I have set the goal to run 5 K races. I use your program as my trainer, it is SUPER. Thank You. – Vickie Wheeler by email\n\n• I tried the top selling \"Couch to 5k\" App before I purchased this one, and this one is much nicer to use. The voice reminders are very helpful. I like how it pauses your music instead of talking over it. I highly recommend it over the others.\n\n• Thank you so much for this little gem of an app. I had a look at others like it but this wins hands down. It is so brilliantly simple with a great interface.\n\n• Thank you! This app has changed my life. I was unfit and didn't do any regular exercise. I always blamed my asthma for being the reason I couldn't run for longer than a minute, but now I know it's because I was unfit! I have signed up for a 5k race too! – @amyriddett on Twitter\n\n• Really great app. I'm actually looking forward to running. I listen to podcasts and this app is terrific at pausing the show to make it's announcements. I don't miss anything that was said. Outstanding."

Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

Watch the animations just before going for a swim to help you visualise improving your own technique for faster and more efficient swimming.\n\nIf you struggle with any part of your stroke from swallowing water to low sinky legs to developing your catch, then this insightful tool will be invaluable to you.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n- 8 viewing angles including directly overhead and underneath\n- Slow motion, pause and frame by frame forward/rewind*\n- Remove the water from view for extra clarity\n- Control of swimming speed (strokes per minute)\n- Synchronised views across all angles (so you can pause and see that same position from any angle)\n- Two fundamentally different but efficient styles of stroke, select the one that best suits you as an individual\n\n* Hold your finger on the screen to bring up the jog wheel and rotate it to speed up or slow down the animations. Or when paused, rotate the jog wheel to forward and rewind frame by frame\n\nThis extensive app also includes three full articles on using the animations to improve your technique and a full comparison of the two stroke styles on view - 'The Swinger' and 'The Smooth'. Find out why each one is a great stroke technique and how to make it work best for you.\n\nAbout Swim Smooth:\n\nSwim Smooth is an innovative coaching company focusing on improving your individual stroke technique based on your height, build, gender and swimming experience.\n\nWe have coaching bases in Australia and the UK, and in 2011 we were selected by British Triathlon to write their swimming coaching curriculum. All triathlon coaches in the UK now follow our swim coaching methods.\n\nFind out more about us at https://www.swimsmooth.com"

We keep creating the future constantly and in every single second with our thoughts and feelings as well as with our beliefs and perceptions.\n\nWith the morning meditation you will get yourself into a coherent state of alpha or theta brainwaves. In those states you will be far more susceptible for suggestions. Your brain will be recalibrated automatically when you do this meditation of open space and you can gear your new Self-consciously towards the new day.\nDuring your evening meditation you will get into the present moment and linger in the emptiness of quantum space. As the observer you allow the day to pass by as you become an awareness of possibilties. In that state you will create the next day, your future.\n\nUse the meditation for changing your perceptions and beliefs to move into a new state of being. You will do this by marrying a clear intention with a higher emotion. This App will provide you with a range of options in order to get focussed on a specific goal.\nWe are able to influence any condition as well as our outside reality using our mind alone simply by changing our old beliefs and patterns and our perceptions of ourselves and our environment.\n\nThis App contains:\n- Morning meditation\n- Evening meditation\n- Meditation for changing your convictions and beliefs about yourself\n- Capacity to write down your goals\n- Mapping your results daily\n- Evaluation and statistics\n- Background information for changing your beliefs and perceptions\n\nNote: The Meditations are the same as on the CD or MP3-Download \"You are the Placebo #2\".We have split the Meditations in the App for a easier daily use into Morning, Evening and Changing Beliefs-Meditation."

      "label": "If you love working out with Apple Watch, but you need more advanced fitness stats, HealthFit is for you.\n\nBy analyzing the workout data stored in Apple Health, HealthFit provides the kind of indispensable tracking and insights you normally only get from premium subscription services. But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times. You can even log which bike or shoes you use, to monitor usage and flag when it’s time to replace them.\n\nHealthFit finds photos you take during your workouts automatically, bringing your activity feed to life with stunning images you can share on social media.\n\nRUNNING POWER ANALYSIS\n\nHealthFit provides advanced running power analysis with the automatically estimated critical power, the weighted average power, the power distribution chart by 25W Increments and the mean maximal power chart which shows your best average power for time periods of one second up to the length of your run.\n\nMULTISPORT AND INTERVAL WORKOUTS\n\nHealthFit is the only app to export multisport workouts as multisession activities\n\nSTATISTICS: UNCOVER HIDDEN FITNESS INSIGHTS\n\nApple Watch gathers so much fitness data, it can sometimes seem overwhelming. HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio.

White Noise generates sounds over a wide range of frequencies, masking those noise interruptions, so you can not only fall asleep, but stay asleep.\n\nSOUND CATALOG\n\nAir Conditioner, Airplane Travel, Amazon Jungle, Beach Waves Crashing, Blowing Wind, Blue Noise, Boat Swaying in Water, Brown Noise, Camp Fire, Cars Driving, Cat Purring, Chimes Chiming, City Streets, Clothes Dryer, Crickets Chirping, Crowded Room, Dishwasher Rinsing, Extreme Rain Pouring, Frogs at Night, Grandfather Clock, Hair Dryer Blowing, Heartbeat, Heavy Rain Pouring, Light Rain Pouring, Ocean Waves Crashing, Oscillating Fan, Pink Noise, Rain on Car Roof, Rain Storm, Running Shower, Running Water, Stream Water Flowing, Thunder Storm, Tibetan Singing Bowl, Train Ride, Vacuum Cleaner, Violet Noise, Water Dripping, Water Sprinkler, White Noise\n\nAPP FEATURES (FULL VERSION)\n\n• FULL: 50+ perfectly looped sounds with additional free sounds from the White Noise Market at https://whitenoisemarket.com/\n• FULL: Apple TV and Apple Watch App\n• FULL: Over 20 Alarm Sounds that slowly fade in so you wake refreshed.\n• FULL: No Advertisements.

The next day, Lil Wayne may take over.  Get a unique, up-beat playlist every time you run.  \n\n** Keep the perfect pace **\n\nPrefer a consistent pace? No problem. You can easily set a pace for yourself.  You can even include a warmup song if you'd like.\n\n** It's YOUR music. **\n\nA run is a terrible time to have to skip through tons of songs you don't like.  Everyone's got their own taste in workout music.  That's why the app plays YOUR music from YOUR iTunes library.\n\n** It's here to help. **\n\nNeed a speed boost while you're running?  Just press the speed buttons in the app.  Cooling down? Press the down arrow.\n\nGot a song that helps get you going?  Set it as a \"Pump Up Song\" and you can play it when you need it the most.\n\n** It's super smart. **\n\nThe app learns which songs you don't like while running & it stops playing them.  Simple as that.\n\nWant more control?  You can also set a blacklist of songs that you don't ever want the jog.fm app to play.\n\nIf you love a song, you can flag it during or after your run and it'll be played more often.\n\n** It plays nice. **\n\nDo you use other fitness apps like RunKeeper or Nike+ (in \"outdoor\" mode)?  Just launch the other fitness app first, then launch jog.fm.  Works like a charm.\n\nIn Nike+, make sure you go to \"Settings\" and be sure to turn off \"Music Tied to Run Controls\"\n\n\n** Please Note **\n\nThe jog.fm app must remain on top with the screen on while running.  \n\nDo not turn your screen off while running.\n\nThis app is not a streaming service.  It plays music from your iTunes library.\n\nThere is a one-time setup that will take about one minute (depending on the size of your library).  The app needs to analyze your songs to figure out which ones to play.  An internet connection (WiFi recommended) is required for this setup step because the app is powered by the Echo Nest.\n\nThis app is not yet compatible with iTunes Match.  It'll work, but you may find some long gaps between songs.  \n\nThis app is for running or walking.  We are working on adding more workouts soon!\n\nPlease do not run or walk in traffic."

The exercises can be done at home, but also while sitting in the train, plane or office. No special knowledge or means are required for the practice.\n\nGive it a try, and you will see how nidra-relax helps you to go through life much more relaxed and capable to enjoy moment by moment. \nAll the exercises are derived from the yoga nidra method and have been conceived and recorded by a professional yoga teacher. \nYoga nidra is a relaxation and meditation method that encompasses all levels of the human being: it releases muscular tensions, as well as mental and emotional. Therefore yoga nidra can be used as an effective method in stress reduction. \n\nYoga nidra is not a physical yoga practice that requires demanding poses. The only thing you have to do, is to lie down as comfortable as possible on your yoga mat, in the bed, (or while sitting in the train or plane) remain in stillness and follow the clear and simple instructions. \n\nThrough the regular practice of yoga nidra the stress hormones are reduced, the regenerative body functions and the immune system are stimulated. It has been tested by physicians and scientist all over the world, who accredited it as an efficient support in the treatment of psychosomatic diseases. Mainly in afflictions such as sleep disturbances, nervousness, heart and stomach diseases, asthma and migraine   Nidra-relax app has been recommended by the german magazine GEO Special Yoga:\n“An authentic deep relaxation as it is practiced in the classical yoga. With different levels. Nice and simple design and description of the effects. Recommended as an anti-stress meditation.”\n\nFor german instructions please have a look at \"Nidra Relax\", the german version of this app."

      "label": "WHAT IS BRUXAPP?\nBruxApp is the first globally available, research-based smartphone app dedicated to the study and management of Bruxism and its health consequences.\nDesigned by top international experts in a multi-center Bruxism research project and developed in 25 Research Centres across the world. \n\nWHAT CAN IT DO?\nBruxapp is a simple tool used by dentists and patients for several purposes:\n- To help the assessment  of the presence/absence of bruxism-related activities (i.e., teeth clenching or grinding, jaw clenching) and potential consequences.\n- For rating the severity of bruxism, if present.\n- As a biofeedback-based management tool for bruxism.\n- To increase patients’ awareness of bruxism activities so they can avoid or correct negative habits.\n- To make patients aware of the possible clinical consequences of bruxism and try to prevent them.\n- To promote cutting-edge knowledge about bruxism, based on the latest scientific research.\n\nWHY is BruxApp needed? \nBruxism has been increasing in prevalence over recent years. It encompasses motor activities of the jaw muscles, such as jaw or teeth clenching, and teeth grinding, some of which may be associated with clinical signs and symptoms, like tooth wear, failed dental restorations, complications with implant-supported prosthesis, muscle fatigue and temporomandibular joint pain. A correct diagnosis is therefore fundamental to establishing early prevention and management regimens.\n\nSCIENTIFIC RESEARCH\nStudies with BruxApp have been supervised by experts, as part of an ongoing multicenter research project on bruxism epidemiology and management coordinated by Prof. Daniele Manfredini, University of Siena, Italy.\n\nDEVELOPMENT\nThe app was developed by Goran Djukic, program analyst at the Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Council of Research, University of Pisa, Italy.\nBruxApp is currently available in the following languages: English, Italian, , French, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish, Brazilian, Japanese, Hebrew, Chinese, Arabic, Greek, Polish, Lithuanian, Bosnian, Romanian, Turkish, Norwegian, and Croatian, with another 4 language versions soon to be released. \n\nIMPORTANT STATEMENT\nBruxApp is not a game or gadget.  In order for BruxApp to work correctly and be effective, please dedicate 5 minutes of your time to READING the simple instructions CAREFULLY. \n\nThe full compatibility is guaranteed by iPhone 6 and higher ones and iOS 9.3 and higher ones."

      "label": "Join the hundreds of thousands of runners who have used Run 5k to go from a couch potato to a 5k (3.1 miles) runner. This app is great for beginner runners who have never run before or former runners who want to start up again. \n\nThe Run 5k app has been featured on CNN.com, Boston.com’s lifestyle-health section, and in Health Magazine. Get into shape using our 8-week beginner training plan, complete with an animated warmup and cooldown stretching program. This app has voice cues that guide you even when your screen is locked. The app tells you when to run and walk and gives audio cues for distance and pace when you use GPS. You can use this app outside, on a track, or in the gym.\n\nFEATURES\n• Apple Watch app—you can leave your phone at home while you work out with our Watch app, or continue to use our Watch app together with the iPhone app.\n• Speaks pace, distance, intervals, and halfway point. \n• Optionally uses GPS for pace and distance. (You can also use this app on a treadmill or indoor track without GPS.)\n• Animated warmup and cooldown stretching programs with timer and voice cues.\n• Tap out your heart rate on the heart icon.  \n• Supports Bluetooth heart rate monitors.\n• Integrates with the Health app. Set your weight in the Health app to calculate Calories burned, and to save your Active Calories for each workout.\n\nABOUT the WORKOUTS\n• 8-week training program perfect for beginners or former runners.\n• Each workout is about 30 minutes long.\n• Interval training alternates between jogging and walking.\n• Workout intervals gradually become more challenging.\n• 5-minute warmup and 5-minute cooldown, which are skippable.\n• Speaks each jog and walk interval, halfway mark, and 1-minute-left mark.\n• Optionally speaks pace and distance information every 1/2 mile or 1/2 km.\n• Automatically checks off each completed workout and records your date, pace and distance. \n\nAUDIO CUES and NOTIFICATIONS\nIf you’re not getting Notifications in the background, open the Settings app, select Notifications, then scroll down to find Run 5k in the list. Tap on Run 5k and turn on Notification Center, choose an alert style, and turn everything else on (Sound, Badge App Icon, Lock Screen). Check your volume and make sure your ringer switch is not set to silent/vibrate.\n\nHEALTH\nThis app can be integrated with the Health app. Your weight set in the Health app can be used to calculate Calories burned during a workout, and the total Active Calories burned can be saved to Health app after each workout. Sharing this information with the Health app is optional.\n\nGPS and LOCATION\nTo show distance and pace information, Run 10k can use GPS location tracking during a workout. For best results, use this app outside where you can see open sky. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nLegal Disclaimer: This app and any information given by it or by Felt Tip Inc are for educational purposes only. They are not intended nor implied to be a substitute for professional medical advice. You should always consult your healthcare provider before beginning any fitness program.\n\nRun 5k was created by Lucius Kwok, Agnes Chan, and Kasten Searles. Made in NYC."

      "label": "The Healing Your Thoughts App improves your state of health and well being by assisting you to transform your negative thoughts that arise throughout the day. It is important to break the habit of dropping into defeatist thoughts and attitudes and learn how to stop yourself from entering into a negative loop that blocks you from achieving your desired outcomes.\n\nThe Healing Your Thoughts App helps to shift the way you think throughout the day and will help to uplift you during challenging times. You are not denying any feelings you are experiencing. Rather it is a process of rephrasing your thoughts to change your train of thought which will lead you to a positive outcome.\n\nYou can program the app for the interval of when you would like to receive an alert of bells, a Tibetan bowl, or chimes being played. When you hear the alert you will read the message that asks you to reflect on: “What are you thinking about right now?” Your thoughts and words are seeds that when planted into your inner garden will grow into plants that do impact your life. It is important to cultivate a deep and rich inner garden to create true joy and health in your life.\n\nOnce you receive the alert go into the Library and tap on the category “word”, “phrase”, “blessing”, or “photo”. A word, phrase, blessing, or photo will appear that will inspire you to stop your current thinking and transmute/transform any negative thinking into positive thoughts. This will also help to shift your attitude and even create an inner smile.\n\nYou can use the words, phrases, blessings, or photos provided. Or you can upload your own.\n\nThe result will be that you will experience feeling more uplifted. In this way you feed yourself with love and light. This will improve your life, giving you more energy, and help you to be more creative in your life and in your work. You will be able to radiate love and light towards yourself, your loved ones, friends, co-workers, and into the world."

They will be automatically placed in your AM and/or PM routine as recommended.\n\n\n• ADD CUSTOM PRODUCTS\n\nYou can add custom skincare products from other brands by selecting the option in the top-right menu in the Routine section or from the Custom tab in the Products section.\n\n\n• USE YOUR ROUTINE FOR LAYERING ADVICE\n\nThe products are listed in the recommended layering order, along with advice for when and how to use each product.\n\n\n• KEEP TRACK OF USAGE TO AVOID CONFLICTS\n\nEach morning and evening, check each product off your list to keep track of which treatments you have used. This will allow the app to prevent any conflicts by showing you which products should be avoided.\n\n\n• TRACK YOUR SKIN'S PROGRESS\n\nAny time you notice your skin is looking particularly good or bad, you can make a note of it by pressing on the face icon next to the morning or evening routine. You can also add a comment to note down more details for your own record and add photos to track your progress.\n\n\n• ADD PHOTOS\n\nYou can add photos of your skin to your diary tracker and also add photos of custom products.\n\n\n• REMINDERS & TIMERS\n\nYou can set up notifications to remind you about your daily skin regimen. You can also set timers for products which require a specific wait time. Both can be found in the Settings.\n\n\n\n*** Advanced App Customization ***\n\n• RE-ORDER YOUR ROUTINE\n\nIf you don't wish to follow the recommended layering order, you can choose to re-order the products to fully customize your routine by selecting the option from the top right menu (with 3 dots) of the Routine section. You can also change the order of the layer steps, for instance DECIEM recommends oils before moisturizers but some users prefer the other way around.\n\n\n• USE CONFLICTING PRODUCTS\n\nWhen we recommend not using a product due to conflicts with other products or because you've reached the usage limit, you can choose to ignore the warning and use it anyway. You will then have the option to permanently ignore conflicts on that specific product.\n\n\n• SCHEDULE PRODUCTS\n\nYou can choose specific days of the week for a product if you wish. For instance, you may wish to make it so that the \"AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution\" only appears in your routine on Tuesdays and Fridays.\nYou can also choose dates of the month, e.g. the 1st and 15th of every month.\nAnother useful option is to schedule products for every X days, so you could choose every 2 days to alternate.\n\n\n\n*** Recommended for skin concerns... ***\n\n• Dry & Dehydrated Skin: Achieve plump, healthy-looking hydrated skin.\n• Acne-Prone Skin: Reduce inflammation to help support clear skin.\n• Blemishes & Congestion: Reduce inflammation and brighten the skin.\n• Sensitive Skin: Keep your skin moisturized with this gentle routine.\n• Mature Skin & Wrinkles: Promote youthful skin and reduce the signs of aging.\n• Pigmentation Problems: Gently exfoliate and brighten skin tone.\n• Oily Skin: Rebalance your skin for a healthy, fresh look.\n\n\nPlease note, Skincare Routine (previously known as \"Skincare Regimen Organizer\") has no connection with DECIEM, The Ordinary or any other skincare brand."

I love this app so glad I found it \nnauf4l: was planning to buy a 100$ jump rope which counts skips as i always do 5k skips a day. So after a month was considering this when i came across this app after installing 5 apps of the same.Glad i paid about 2$ for this as it is totally worth it. \nFrankWurst: Accurate jump counter based solely on Apple Watch. App integrates into My Health and Activity App seamlessly. Great product.\ntafty：I enjoy the skipping experience with this app. And it syncs well with Apple Watch\n\nContact me\nE-mail:89208242@qq.com\nTwitter: @haozes\nTelegram Group: t.me/yaoyaonow  \n\nDesign by Haozes\nThanks for the translation: 橙子、金小粉、孟金羽、蔡沛森、Adgar, Fabio Carrilho, Tomás Feliú Ribeiro, Francesco Tirsi, Leonard Pitt Diehl, Zhimin Yang, Massimiliano Benini,Radu Ionescu,Andrés Leon,Dikran Jessaijan, Krishna"

      "label": "HealthExport enables you to export data from the Health app to a CSV file!\n\nYou can perform exports manually within the app, or you can automate the export process with Apple Shortcuts. Another option would be to use HealthExport Remote to access your data remotely from your computer.\n\nHealthExport Remote lets you visualize your health data on a customizable dashboard accessible from a browser on your computer. You can also perform remote CSV exports on the website. Health data is automatically synced to the service multiple times per day in the background, so there is no need for opening the app on your phone anymore. The data is end to end encrypted between your phone and your browser, thus nobody except you can read it. Note that HealthExport Remote requires a monthly subscription payment due to monthly fees associated with running the service.\n\nHealth data types are divided into three categories:\n1. Aggregation based types (e.g step count)\n2. Record based types (e.g body mass)\n3. Workouts and workout routes\n\nAggregation based types can be exported with aggregation by minutes, hours, days, months, or years. The export of record based types contains all entries from the Health app.\n\nHealth Export is compatible with the Shortcut app, thus you can integrate your health data into any automated workflow.\n\nI think your privacy is very important, thus I do not collect any of your health data and I do not share your health data with any analytics provider.\n\n-----------------------------\nAggregated data types:\n-----------------------------\nActivity:\n- Apple Watch stand hours\n- Distance cycling\n- Distance downhill snow sports\n- Distance swimming\n- Distance walking / running\n- Exercise time\n- Flights Climbed\n- Stand time\n- Step count\n- Swimming stroke count\n\nEnergy:\n- Active energy burned\n- Basal energy burned\n\nHeart rate:\n- Heart rate\n- Resting heart rate\n- Walking heart rate\n\nNutrition:\n- Caffeine\n- Calcium\n- Carbohydrates\n- Cholesterol\n- Energy consumed\n- Fat saturated\n- Fat total\n- Fiber\n- Iron\n- Potassium\n- Protein\n- Sodium\n- Sugar\n- Vitamin A\n- Vitamin C\n- Vitamin D\n- Water\n\nWheelchair:\n- Distance wheelchair\n- Wheelchair push count\n\n-----------------------------\nRecord based data types:\n-----------------------------\nAudio exposure:\n- Environmental sound levels\n- Headphone sound levels\n\nBlood:\n- Blood glucose\n- Blood pressure (Diastolic)\n- Blood pressure (Systolic)\n- Insulin delivery\n\nBody:\n- 6 minute walk test\n- Alcoholic beverages\n- Body fat percentage\n- Body mass\n- Body mass index\n- Body temperature\n- Handwashing\n- Height\n- Lean body mass\n- Mindfulness\n- Oxygen saturation\n- Respiratory rate\n- Sleep: Time asleep\n- Sleep: Time in bed\n- Tooth brushing\n- VO2 Max\n- Waist circumference\n- Walking steadiness\n- Walking steadiness notification\n\nHeart rate:\n- Event: High heart rate\n- Event: Irregular heart rhythm\n- Event: Low heart rate\n- Heart rate\n- Heart rate variability (SDNN)\n- Resting heart rate\n- Walking heart rate\n\nReproductive health:\n- Basal body temperature\n- Cervical mucus quality\n- Intermenstrual bleeding\n- Menstrual flow\n- Ovulation test result\n- Pregnancy test\n- Progesterone test\n- Sexual activity\n\n-----------------------------\n\nAccessibility should be an important part of every application.

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

You can save your results for future reference, keep track of multiple people with individual profiles, add notes and locations, and even print out your measurements for sharing or safe keeping.\n\nCardiograph uses your device's built-in camera to take pictures of your fingertip and calculate your heart's rhythm - the same approach used by professional medical equipment!\n\n\"I know you have the disclaimer on the screen but I don't care, Cardiograph saved my life. Your app was key to understanding what was going on and help the doctors understand too.\"\nBob Spadafora - *****\n\n\"Comparing heart rates with family over the holidays is fun.\"\nTxyak – ****\n\n\"Wanna impress a friend with a cool app. This is the one to get.\"\nMattyray – *****\n\n\"After having two heart valve replacements and a by-pass, I feel it is not only smart - but also necessary - to have such a reliable heart rate monitor with me everywhere I go.\"\nDantv – *****\n\n\"I am an EMT and it helps me actually see what is going on. It is by no means definitive like a monitor but it is a great indicator of problems I would not see otherwise.\"\nGranniem – ****\n\n\"I had a pulse oximeter on one hand, medical quality, and my iPhone app in the other and the app was dead-on accurate.\"\nLike it but hate it – *****\n\n\n=== See Cardiograph in action ===\nhttp://macropinch.com/cardiograph \nhttp://youtu.be/isIjcCFYEho\n\n\n• Measure your heart rate\n\nIt's never been easier to know what your heart rate is! Without any external hardware, just using the built-in camera of your smartphone or tablet, you can get accurate readings almost instantly.\n\nKnowing how fast your heart is beating can be very useful when exercising, if you're under stress, if you have a heart-related medical condition, or even just out of curiosity.\n\n\n• Track your results\n\nEvery measurement you take is saved to your personal history, so you can keep track over time. In addition to the date and time of the measurement, you can also save the location at which it was taken (and see them on a map), and even add a quick note to effortlessly organize your history.\n\n\n• Multiple profiles\n\nCardiograph is perfectly tailored to allow multiple people to use the app on a shared device. You can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them has their own individual measurement history.\n\n\n• Export & Print\n\nEach measurement can be exported in full detail to a portable format that you can later send via e-mail, upload on the web or even print right from the app itself (with an AirPrint™ compatible printer).\n\n\n• Clean and intuitive design\n \nInspired by real-life medical equipment, Cardiograph is a pleasure to use. The streamlined and clutter-free design makes it seem instantly familiar, so you can focus on using the app instead of navigating through series of confusing screens.\n\n\n• Built-in user guide\n\nIf you're having trouble with the app, or you want to make the most out of it, you can access the comprehensive help manual right from within the app itself.\n\n\n• Universal application with iCloud® sync\n\nCardiograph is an universal application - it runs on the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod touch.\nInstall Cardiograph on multiple devices with iOS 5.0+, and all your profiles and measurements will be in sync! Manage your profiles and measurements on one device, and the changes are instantly reflected on all the others.\n\n\nPlease note: If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\n\n\nFollow the latest news:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch \nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

With over 220 exercises, 90+  movies and 20 calculators and hundreds of pages of reference material, Navy SEAL Fitness helps you to train like a Navy SEAL.\n\nTo train for these physically demanding tasks, the Navy created The Navy SEAL Physical Fitness Guide.   The authors of this comprehensive guide, physicians and physiologists, were chosen because of their special qualifications in the area of physical fitness and their knowledge of the SEAL community. Their expertise ensured the guide was written with a goal of expanding the individual Navy SEAL's knowledge of attaining and retaining a high level of fitness.\n\nBecause SEALs train for mission related performance, the objective for every workout is elite fitness, validated by the ability to perform every task at the level necessary to accomplish any mission – no matter what.  What does that mean?  It means that training must be comprised of broad and inclusive, constantly varied functional movements that are performed at high intensity in order to prepare for the unknown.\n\nThe Navy SEALS are an elite branch of the U.S. Special Forces whose reputation for outstanding physical fitness is unparalleled. Now everybody that wants to improve his or her health, strength and endurance can take advantage of this information.\n\nTopics Include:\n* Overview of physical fitness \n* Exercise physiology \n* Muscle structure and Function \n* Principles of physical training \n* Specificity of training\n* Determining your training heart rate\n* Energy systems used by exercising muscle\n* Lactic acid and ATP-CP system for anaerobic work\n* Methods of physical training\n* Cardiorespiratory conditioning\n* Determination of work rate\n* Active recovery\n* How to estimate your maximal aerobic capacity\n* Types of aerobic activities\n* Basic workouts \n* Running for fitness\n* Swimming for fitness \n* Strength training\n* Flexibility training\n* Calisthenics\n* Plyometrics\n* Sports related injuries\n* Physical fitness and training recommendations\n* Weight lifting techniques\n* Anatomical terms and diagrams\n\nBonus Nutritional Material!\nNavy Operational Fitness and Fueling Series (NOFFS) designed by the Navy for \"best in class\" fitness and nutrition performance.\n\nSpecial Operations Forces Nutrition Guide designed by the military to meet the physical and mental demands imposed by special operations training and missions."

For long-term health it is recommended that we take approx. 10,000 steps a day. For successful weight loss, daily steps should amount to 12,000-15,000.\n\nTo get started using iSteps, set up your personal profile by entering your height in cm or inches, your weight in lbs or kg, and choose how you want your results displayed, either in kcal or kJ and distance in miles or km. Then press the START button and you are ready to GO! \n\nWe recommend that you wear your iPhone or iPod touch by your waist or in your pocket, but you may need to experiment a bit to find the best location for optimal accuracy. \n\nPlease note: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. With the option to turn off “Daily Totals Tracking”, you can save battery when needed."

      "label": "This application is a sidekick to the beastmaker 1000 and 2000. It has been designed to assist the user into gradually getting stronger on a fingerboard. The app does this by way of prewritten workouts which are often general and aim to improve all trainable grips on the board. Some are specific (2000 series only at the moment) which aim to improve, sloper strength, pocket strength and crimp strength. \n\nThere is also a new custom workout program fully adjustable and includes the 1000,2000 and micros, so if you have your own hang regime and different timings then that is all programmable and can be saved.\n\nBoth the workouts and custom timer now record hang contraction time (time spent actually hanging off the board) We recommend most users get up to around 20:00 minutes on this clock whilst doing their workouts.\n\nOn the Workout screen after you've selected your work out it is now possible to adjust set and hang times. Users who are only finger boarding and are having a rest day prior to and after training may wish to do up to 3 sets and 7 hangs. Other users may prefer to go for 2 sets and 6 hangs, this is what we'd consider an average and more suited to people doing additional types of training.\n\nPlease note the grades for the workouts aren't actually meant to relate to anything other than themselves. E.G. 5c is easier than 6a but harder than 5b. If you find 5a hard on the 1000, use a weight removal technique such as putting one foot on a chair in front of the board or using a pulley with weights on. More advice on this and other things are available in the general advice section on the Workout Ratings page.\n\nTo record your hangs press the record button (red circle icon) whilst resting. The Workout Ratings function is much improved and should now be a really useful training aid which records gradual progress and improvement.\n\nFingerboard gains take time, remember to warm up thoroughly and move on to more difficult hangs at a slightly slower pace than you think you should to give pulleys time to catch up with muscles. For example 10% strength gains over a year is brilliant improvement. 5% is still effective training.\n\nBest of luck with the training, happy hanging and we hope this helps with the motivation."

APRENDIZAJE DE LA GRAMÁTICA con reglas bien ilustrativas\n2. ENTRENADOR para reforzar el vocabulario y las reglas\n3. MEMORIZACIÓN DEL VOCABULARIO con ayuda de asociaciones\n4. COMPRENSIÓN AUDITIVA para aprender a entender el lenguaje oral\n5. CHECKPONTS para controlar lo aprendido y subsanar lagunas\n6. ¡PRÁCTICAS INUSUALES! Historias policíacas en inglés adaptado para consolidar los conocimientos\n\nSimpler es ideal para principiantes. Con su ayuda puede aprender inglés desde cero. Asimismo puede hacer una prueba de nivel y empezar a estudiar a partir de cualquier nivel\n\n=====================\n\n¿POR QUÉ SIMPLER ES EL MÉTODO MÁS RÁPIDO Y EFICAZ DE APRENDER INGLÉS?\n\n1. Hemos creado el SISTEMA DE ENSEÑANZA DE LA GRAMÁTICA más claro y sencillo, conveniente a los principiantes. No le hace falta adentrarse en los mínimos detalles de la gramática inglesa, ni leer libros de texto. Descompusimos el inglés en átomos, seleccionamos solo la info más relevante, la reconstituimos y convertimos en estructuras fáciles e inteligibles. Cada regla gramatical del curso autodidacta Simpler es una instrucción corta que enseguida se refuerza con preguntas y prácticas.\n\n2. Hemos creado un SISTEMA sencillo y claro de MEMORIZACIÓN DEL VOCABULARIO INGLÉS. Aparte de la traducción, se visualiza una imagen especial que ilustra el significado de la palabra desconocida. Además, se le muestra un texto asociativo que acompaña la imagen y le permite idear sus propias asociaciones mnemónicas. El curso autodidacta Simpler organiza el repaso del vocabulario en intervalos que fueron calculados con la curva del olvido de Ebbinghaus. ¡Con Simpler su vocabulario de inglés se ampliará notablemente!\n\n3. Es imprescindible poder entender el lenguaje oral en inglés. Para ello, los audios de las frases fueron grabados por hablantes nativos, lo que es especialmente importante para aquellos que empiezan a estudiar inglés desde cero. Asimismo, creamos un apartado especial de audiciones que llamamos PRÁCTICAS. Después de estudiar las reglas gramaticales, se le ofrece una tarea auditiva con el fin de entender frases en inglés.\n\n4. Creamos un sistema de tareas de toda clase que llamamos ENTRENADOR. Incluye una gama de actividades variadas que suponen un entrenamiento de traducción de frases del español al inglés y viceversa. Además, las reglas están pensadas de tal manera que el estudiante pueda aprender a aplicarlas con facilidad. Las lecciones del Simpler no se pasan al olvido, gracias a que el ENTRENADOR incluya también actividades de lecciones anteriores.\n\n5. ¡EXCLUSIVIDAD! Historias policíacas en inglés adaptado. Le harán pensar en inglés, con ellas podrá ampliar su vocabulario y mejorar la destreza oral.\n\n6. ¡La eficacia está en la regularidad! Para mantener su motivación a aprender inglés, hacemos constancia de su TRABAJO A TODO RITMO. ¡Estudie todos los días y los resultados no se harán esperar!\n\n7. ¡Gane ESTRELLAS, desbloquee lecciones, trabaje a destajo y reciba regalos!\n\n==========================\n\nOPCIONES DE USO DEL CURSO AUTODIDACTA DE INGLÉS SIMPLER\n• La suscripción Premium le permite aprender inglés accediendo a todo el funcional de la app.\n• Después de confirmar la compra, el cargo se realizará desde su cuenta iTunes. \n• La suscripción se renovará automáticamente a no ser desactivada 24 horas antes del vencimiento del periodo actual.

And with the spaced repetition, smart reminders, and clever associations, you won’t forget them. \n\n\nYou also get to practice your new vocabulary right away in conversations that recreate real-life situations. Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations.

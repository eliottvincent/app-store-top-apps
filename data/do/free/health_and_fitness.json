Instead, I'm making and eating a limited number of fresh and healthy meals/snacks on a repeat basis.\n\nI made this app because I just wanted a simple way to quickly input my own custom foods (an area that is severely lacking in other free apps).  And I wanted to be able to re-use those foods as they were or to modify the \"serving\" amount.  \n\nInstead of wondering whether this is a small, medium or large apple/tomato/etc., I can add the nutrition of a tomato at 100 grams.  Then I weigh a tomato of any size, select my previously input tomato, and change the serving size to match the weight of this tomato.  The macro / calorie information updates automatically.\n\nI hope you find this app helpful in achieving your goals!"

      "label": "RaceJoy is created specifically for running, cycling and triathlon events with a focus on the participant and spectator experience. Features vary by event and include live phone tracking, progress alerts, results, race information, photos, Send-a-Cheer and much more!\n\nThere are two distinct experiences in RaceJoy:\n-Featured Events\n-Training Days\n\nFeatured Events (shown with the Event Logo):\nThese are events that have contracted with RaceJoy to provide a premium experience for participants and spectators. Features are free and provided by the event or sponsor(s).\n\nFeatures included:\n-Live GPS, phone tracking on the course map.\n-Send-a-Cheer! (fun motivational audio clips).\n-NearMe alerts (spectators and waiting relay teams get an alert when a participant is drawing near).\n-MeetUp tool for seeing where you are in relation to a participant.\n-Automatic Progress Postings to Twitter (with your approval, of course!).\n\nThe following features may be provided by the event:\n-Scored Race Results within moments of crossing the finish line.\n-Essential race information like schedules, FAQs, race news, and more.\n-Your official race photos.\n-Optional Tracking with Progress Alerts: Some events offer BIBTAG tracking in addition to PhoneTrak.  For these events there is no need to carry your phone as this is based on the participant’s BIB/chip as they cross over timing points on the course.\n\nTraining Days\nThis area enables athletes to have their friends and family track their progress live on a map and send motivational cheers during long training runs or rides. All PhoneTrak features are available in Training Days, along with special motivational cheers to help you through those tough moments. Training Days is a free always available area for your long training days.  Based on our privacy policy you must setup a special tracking ID (PIN) with profile name and provide that to friends and family tracking you on your Training Days.\n\nAdd a Race?\nIf you would like a race to offer the full featured experience with official race progress alerts and results, please let the race director know about RaceJoy.\n\nBattery Usage\nRaceJoy’s live phone tracking feature is ONLY activated during the hours of the event. When using Training Days, the athlete turns on/off tracking as needed. Use of this GPS technology running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. You may disable this under settings at anytime during the event to conserve battery life if needed.\n\nFeedback and Support\nWe hope you enjoy using RaceJoy! Please share your experience in the App store to encourage others to try it out. If you have had any issues, or have feedback or ideas, please help us to improve the experience by contacting us at support@racejoy.com.\n\nRaceJoy is created by a small family business and is dedicated to changing the race experience."

Spoiler alert: It doesn't involve skipping meals, eating salads all day, or cutting carbs (unless you're slicing a sandwich).\n\nAnd we'll also cover lots of other fun topics like the psychology of weight loss, mindful eating, joyful movement, the science of metabolism, the 10 types of hunger, self-experimentation, emotional health, decision making, self care, and so much more!\n\nAt the end of your journey, you'll have earned the title of Noom Master and have a set of healthy habits to help you keep the weight off for good and lead a healthier, more fulfilling life.\n\nOn average, Noom users lose 15.5 pounds over 16 weeks.\n\nOur scientifically-proven approach to weight loss and behavior change was created by a team of doctors, psychologists, nutritionists, and personal trainers.\n\nNoom has been featured in the New York Times, Women’s Health, Shape, Forbes, and more.\n\nAnd if you like talking science like we do, you might also recognize some of tried-and-true concepts and approaches that have informed our program like caloric density, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, and more.\n\nSign up today to start your journey toward your healthiest self!\n\nFor CCPA: \"Do Not Sell\" Policy for California Residents, please see https://www.noom.com/ccpa-do-not-sell/"

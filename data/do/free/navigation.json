Navigate your city’s public transit system with accurate real-time predictions, simple trip planning, step-by-step navigation, service disruption notifications, and departure and stop reminders... all presented in a clear, bold interface. Public transport not cooperating? Easily request a ride from Uber, Lyft or VIA, or grab the closest bikeshare.  \n\n10 GREAT THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH TRANSIT:\n1) See real-time arrivals for nearby buses and trains instantly upon launch.\n2) Watch your transit vehicle approaching on a map in real-time\n3) Compare options with powerful A to B trip plans using real-time data.\n4) Launch GO for step-by-step navigation when you’re on an unfamiliar route or want to nap/read/space out.*\n5) Receive departure alarms and stop notifications as well as prompts to pick up the pace in GO.*\n6) Get push notifications if service disruptions will affect your commute.\n7) Plan trips, view transit schedules and get route itineraries—even when you’re offline! \n8) Locate bikeshare stations, see the number of bikes available, pay for passes, and unlock bikes (in select cities). \n9) Check ETA (and price) for nearby Uber, Lyft and VIA rides, and book in two taps.\n10) Easily plan and pay for a trip combining Uber, Lyft, or VIA with transit.

When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

We've also carefully designed FeedFinder so that it can be used one-handed as much as possible so that you can even be adding a review of a breastfeeding place as you breastfeed your little one.\n\nYou can use FeedFinder to find places around you where other mothers have had positive breastfeeding experiences. Every recommended place on the map will have been reviewed by someone who's breastfeeding. You'll be able to see not only how they have rated that place, but also any handy comments that they have added about their experience or the location, like whether they have toys and a menu for toddlers, or where the breastfeeding room is if it's a bit difficult to find.\n\nIf you can't find somewhere near you, or have found a new gem be sure to add the new place to the map. You'll find the process easy and convenient with FeedFinder doing most the hard work, like locating the place on the map, or adding the address details – all you'll need to do is add a star rating and your own comments. \n\nFeedFinder is part of a project by Open Lab Newcastle University, UK.

      "label": "Has it ever happened that you have to meet someone and the person can't explain where he/she is? This app will quickly find the location of another phone by sending a text message request. Most phones manufactured after 2010 can accept this request, no need to install any additional app on the 2nd person's phone. It does not get any easier than this!\n\nHow it is working:\n\n• User A wants to know a User B location.\n\n• User A enters the phone number of User B into the app.\n\n• The app generates a unique URL, and the URL is sent to User B.\n\n• If User B clicks on the link, user A will see the location of user B.\n\nLimitations:\n\n• This is not a spy app. User B must agree to share the location with you.\n\n• If User B has a device without GPS (desktop computer, tablet), the determined location may have a large accuracy margin (up to 5 km).\n\n• In rare situations, when user B is behind the corporate proxy, the app can show the proxy's location, not the user's.\n\nThe user location is determined in three ways:\n\n• E.123, E.164\n• RIR\n• W3C Geolocation API\n\nAuto-renewing subscription:\nTitle: Full Access 1m\nLength: 1 month\nPrice: $1,99 (check the price in the app)\n\nEULA:\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://www.codeesteem.com/apps/phone-location/PrivacyPolicy.pdf"

      "label": "Turn your iPhone and iPad into a Speedometer with Speedometer One! Speedometer One is also suitable for cars, boats, motorcycles, or other types of vehicles.

There are other features that will be useful for you such as Night Mode, HUD screen, and many more.  \n\nHave you ever driven a car and worried that you go over the speed limit? Driving too fast can get you into trouble especially if there are some traffic cops nearby with their speed radar gun. That’s why we add Speed Limit Alert as one of the most important features of our app. You can enable and disable it. We support US and EU style speed limit signs and support different display units. This means that it will make it easier to drive when you visit EU or USA. \n\nAside from tracking your speed, Speedometer one also can track your distance, altitude, average speed, and top speed. \n\n=== FEATURES OF SPEEDOMETER ONE: ===\n\n\t•\tAccurate Speedometer for Cars, Boats, Motorcycle or other types of Vehicles. \n\t•\tChoose your units mph, km/h, or knots. \n\t•\tSupport Night Mode with high contrast on the screen. \n\t•\tSupport Landscape or Portrait Mode.\n\t•\tSpeed Limit Alert: Enable this option first, and \n\t•\tHUD (Head Unit Display) Mode \n\t•\tSupports USA and EU speed limit. \n\t•\tChoose over 44 themes (22 dark and 22 light) through In-App Purchase. \n\nWhen you use the HUD mode, you can put your iPhone on the dashboard near the windshield.

GPS sensor is not always accurate due to the device hardware sensor limitation. When in doubt, always rely on your car’s speedometer.\n\t•\tGPS is most accurate when you are in wide-open spaces. Trees, tall buildings, and other things might affect your GPS accuracy. \n\t•\tProlong use of GPS will affect your battery life. \n\t•\tPlease stay safe.

Geographic or UTM projected coordinates are shown at all times.\n\nPOINT SURVEY\nThe application allows data collection of single points, whose coordinates are got from the GPS, showing the estimated precision by a circle, as is usual in location-based programs.\nThe points are automatically numbered, recording date and time, and can be separated in different layers. User can also enter point codes, choosing them from a quick list.\n\nCONTINUOUS SURVEY\nIt is also possible to perform a continuous survey, recording vertices automatically by an interval of time, distance or height difference.\nAt any time you can view the polyline data, such as minimum and maximum heights, length and area. Vertex information can be displayed as well.\nYou can work with multiple layers, with different names and colors.\n\nRESULTS\nSurvey can be exported to a KML file, that can be sent by email from the app. This file can also be imported by TcpMDT and other CAD and GIS applications.\n\nSETTINGS\nEditing preferences lets you to change the appearance of map, points and lines captured. It also sets parameters for data collection, information displayed in real time and others.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n• Operating System: iOS 7 or higher\n• Integrated GPS\n• Internet access"

And, with the purchase of the OnDeck™ hub(1), you can track and monitor your boat from virtually anywhere.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this app is intended for Garmin chartplotter owners and is not recommended for use as a stand-alone navigational app.\r\n\r\nFEATURES AVAILABLE:\r\n- ONECHART™:\r\n> New Garmin Navionics+™ and premium Garmin Navionics Vision+™ cartography, featuring a Navionics® style appearance, advanced Auto Guidance+™ technology(2) and a one-year subscription to daily updates, is available now for North America and Europe, and coming soon to the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nPurchase our newest-generation charts or legacy BlueChart® g3 charts from your mobile device, and upload them to registered Garmin chartplotters on your vessel. \r\n\r\nYou will get exceptional coverage, clarity and detail with charts that feature integrated Garmin and Navionics data and much more. Plus, the NOAA raster cartography(3) and premium features can be downloaded for free through the ActiveCaptain app. Visit Garmin.com/marinemaps.\r\n\r\n\r\n- PLAN A TRIP: Plan your trip, or e-scout a new fishing spot before you’re on the water.

You can then tap to view street view, share or get directions (via Apple Maps or iMaps+).\n\nAlternatively, drag the yellow peg man from the top left hand corner of the map and release over a road or path to access street view.\n\nStreet view supports zooming in and out, and showing a mini-map overlay. There is also a full screen mode for a more immersive experience.\n\nIf you need a more complete Google Maps experience, look for \"iMaps+ for Google Maps\" on the App Store. iMaps+ provides all the great functionality from iStreets with the addition of directions, traffic, contacts integration and more.\n\n\nNotes:\n\nSubscriptions: iStreets operates as a subscription service. Recurring purchase is required for full functionality. Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be managed, and auto-renewal may be turned off, from iStreets settings or the Apple Settings app. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited if you change your subscription term.\n\nDirections, street view and live traffic details are only available in certain geographical regions.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nTerms of Service: http://apptility.co.uk/imaps_tos.html\n\nApptility Limited is not related to, or affiliated with, Google, Inc.

      "label": "Hudway Go is a simple GPS navigation app for drivers. \nIt keeps it very intuitive and non-distracting, displaying just the outline of the road you’re driving and your next manoeuvre.\n\n***\n\"Hudway is one of the cleverest driving apps we've seen\"\n— CNET\n\n\"Hudway app is unbelievably cool for one special reason: It actually lets you see your directions and route right on your windshield\"\n— USA Today\n\n\"Hudway HUD tool will remind you nothing less than a science fiction movie that you watched recently\"\n— crazyengineers.com\n\n\"HUDWAY turns your windshield into a jet fighter cockpit\"\n— digitaltrends.com\n***\n\nHUDWAY Go helps you drive safer in fog, rain, heavy snow, in dusk and darkness.\n\nCreate a route and place your smartphone on the dashboard — you’ll see the route reflected on your windshield. Keep your eyes on the road and know in advance what’s ahead — a straight run, or a ramp-turn. This is especially handy when driving between cities.\n\nFeatures:\n- Intuitive 3D map, simple navigation\n- Voice Assistance\n- Speed limits\n- Long tap on the map to set the destination\n- Fuel consumption calculation\n- Transit points\n- Search for addresses and POI\n- Choose alternative routes\n- Drive offline right after you start\n- The app will recalculate the route if you leave it\n- Classic GPS map navigation mode\n- Head-up display (HUD) mode\n- Trip info: ETA, speed, distance traveled, directions on the next manoeuvre, and more\n- Based on OpenStreetMap (OSM)\n\nNote: If you face any problems or find any bugs, please email us at support@hudwayapp.com or report the bug right from the app.\n\nWe appreciate your feedback!\n\nAttention!\n1. On a clear day, the device screen brightness is typically insufficient to give a decent reflection for HUD mode. In that situation, you can use the app in standard mode with the phone fixed with some mount, OR stay HUD using our HUDWAY Glass accessory (learn more about it at hudwayglass.com). At night, in dusk, or in dull weather the reflection is normally well-discernible.\n\n2. When driving, make sure that your smartphone or tablet is well fixed in some mount or on some sticky pad, and doesn't prevent you from clearly seeing the road.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nNote about the auto-renewing premium subscription:\n— The auto-renewing subscription is available on yearly basis for USD $2.99\n— Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n— Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n— Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n— Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n— No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period\n— Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication.\n\nIf you want to use HUD during a day-time — there is a special accessory HUDWAY Glass: http://hudwayglass.com\n\nPrivacy Policy\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/privacy\n\nTerms of Use\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/en/terms/"

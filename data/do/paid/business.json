No other app lets you so easily control your iPhone's most valuable data:\n\n1. Update, modify and maintain your contacts easily and conveniently on your computer using Excel, OpenOffice or any other Excel-compatible application.\n2. SA Contacts sends all of your contacts to you from your iPhone in a convenient zip file by email, USB, or through a webpage seen only on your local wifi network! Contact photos are sent, too!\n3. Never again rely on iTunes as your only local source of back up. Nor do you need to share your contacts with Yahoo or other websites in order to have a backup.  SA Contacts' zip file contains ALL of your contacts in a convenient, easy format.\n4. SA Contacts protects you from iTunes sync accidents which can delete your contacts if, for example, you no longer have access to an Exchange server.\n5. Restoring or changing contacts from the spreadsheet is as simple as uploading the file to your phone via USB, email or web. It couldn't be easier.\n6. You can print a hardcopy of your iPhone contacts. \n7. You can now export iPhone contacts to an Excel file which can then be imported to Outlook Contacts directly. \n8. You can also import contacts from an Excel file that has been exported from Outlook to your iPhone.\n9. You can now export/import iPhone contacts to/from a Gmail CSV-format file(UTF-8 encoded or Unicode encoded).\n10. You can upload export files over to Dropbox/GoogleDrive or download import files from Dropbox/GoogleDrive.\n11. You can password protect your export file.\n12. All Contact fields except Ringtones can be exported/imported.\n13. You can organise your contacts into groups easily on a spreadsheet and also assign a contact to multiple groups.\n14. You can remove all iPhone contacts or groups before importing your organized contacts. \n15. SA Contacts can support 30,000+ contact entries.\n16. All column headers and labels in the Excel file are localized.\n17. Export/Import contacts to/from a VCF file.\n18. Backup contacts before import.\n19. Manage groups easily. You can now create, edit, delete groups and add contacts to groups.\n20. Export an Excel file with all photos included - this makes the contacts in your spreadsheet look better.\n21. Import your own file by mapping column headers to contact fields.\n22. Specify your own column headers in export process.\n\nMore detail and up-to-date help guides are available in samapp.com."

But the benefit is considerable. No longer tethered to your laptop, you can move around the room while still holding in your hand an image of what’s on the screen behind you. No more of that weird over-the-shoulder karaoke move when checking to see where you are in the presentation.\"\n\nGo to your next PowerPoint presentation IN STYLE with i-Clickr Remote for iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch!\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Complete control of your PowerPoint presentation including animations.\n* Record your presentation (slides and your voice audio) into a movie as you present.\n* Share PDF version of the presentation with audience via E-Mail.\n* View your slides AND slide notes directly on your iOS device during your presentation.\n* Navigate through your slides with finger swipes and taps.\n* Grab your audience's attention with real-time annotations (Windows only).\n* Help you track your presentation time with onboard clock.\n* Set presentation alarm so that your iOS device will alert you with a silent buzz before your time runs out.\n* Pause and resume presentations.\n* Switch between multiple slideshow.\n* Work with both Windows and Mac Office (see below for the Office versions supported), iWork '09 Keynote on Mac, and OpenOffice on Windows.\n* Easy to set up with zero configuration.\n* No additional cost when using with multiple host computers.\n* NEW: Control presentation from your Apple Watch.\n* NEW: Control external laser pointer.\n\nRequirement:\n\n* On Windows, support all versions of Microsoft PowerPoint (the free Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer is not supported).  Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows (version XP or above) is required at the host PC. \n* On Mac OS X, Office Mac 2004 or above, or iWork '09 Keynote is required.\n* WiFi connection between the host computer and your device, or connection using direct ad hoc network and the iOS’s personal hotspot.  \n* Also support the FREE OpenOffice 3.1 on Windows.\n\nTo download software required at your host computer (that is, the PC/Mac that will run your PowerPoint presentation), visit http://www.senstic.com/iPhone/iClickr/Download.aspx\n\n*** If you have problem getting i-Clickr to work, please contact us at support@senstic.com, and we will help you fix the problem."

You can then email or print those generated reports directly from Project Reno. \n\nGive it a try and take control of your projects with Project Reno! We keep continually adding new amazing features so you get all the tools you need to easily plan and manage your projects.\n\nHere's a summary of the features you'll get:\n\n- Manage projects\n- Filter projects by contact, status, #, or project name\n- Manage project contacts\n- Send the project by email with the options to include costs, total cost only or with no costs\n- Add before and after photos to your projects\n- Break down and categorize project costs (create any category)\n- Change project status to approved, completed, paid or leave it as its default pending status\n- Output filtered project reports to email or AirPrint\n- Share with Twitter, Facebook and Sina Weibo (iOS 6+)\n- Option to Archive Projects"

      "label": "A Bíblia King James de 1611 é descrita como uma das publicações mais importantes da história, e também a mais fiel ao Textus Receptus. O rei James I da Inglaterra reuniu os maiores estudiosos religiosos e linguistas para uma nova tradução da Bíblia, a fim de estabelecer a tradução mais precisa e mais digna até à data. Ele nomeou 54 estudiosos para trabalhar na tradução, e 47 trabalharam em seis grupos em três locais por sete anos.\r\n\r\nApós a conclusão, a Bíblia King James foi impressa pela primeira vez em 1611 por Robert Barker. A Bíblia era muito grande, cerca de 40cm de altura. Por causa do alto custo e valor, foi anunciado para as igrejas que a Bíblia devia ser acorrentada nos púlpitos.\r\n\r\nA Bíblia 1611 foi autorizada para ser lida nas igrejas, razão pela qual foi chamada de Versão Autorizada. Enfim, nós da BV Books estamos felizes em poder apresentar, a Versão Autorizada em português da Bíblia King James."

But the benefit is considerable. No longer tethered to your laptop, you can move around the room while still holding in your hand an image of what’s on the screen behind you. No more of that weird over-the-shoulder karaoke move when checking to see where you are in the presentation.\"\n\nGo to your next PowerPoint presentation IN STYLE with i-Clickr Remote for iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch!\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Complete control of your PowerPoint presentation including animations.\n* Record your presentation (slides and your voice audio) into a movie as you present.\n* Share PDF version of the presentation with audience via E-Mail.\n* View your slides AND slide notes directly on your iOS device during your presentation.\n* Navigate through your slides with finger swipes and taps.\n* Grab your audience's attention with real-time annotations (Windows only).\n* Help you track your presentation time with onboard clock.\n* Set presentation alarm so that your iOS device will alert you with a silent buzz before your time runs out.\n* Pause and resume presentations.\n* Switch between multiple slideshow.\n* Work with both Windows and Mac Office (see below for the Office versions supported), iWork '09 Keynote on Mac, and OpenOffice on Windows.\n* Easy to set up with zero configuration.\n* No additional cost when using with multiple host computers.\n* NEW: Control presentation from your Apple Watch.\n* NEW: Control external laser pointer.\n\nRequirement:\n\n* On Windows, support all versions of Microsoft PowerPoint (the free Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer is not supported).  Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows (version XP or above) is required at the host PC. \n* On Mac OS X, Office Mac 2004 or above, or iWork '09 Keynote is required.\n* WiFi connection between the host computer and your device, or connection using direct ad hoc network and the iOS’s personal hotspot.  \n* Also support the FREE OpenOffice 3.1 on Windows.\n\nTo download software required at your host computer (that is, the PC/Mac that will run your PowerPoint presentation), visit http://www.senstic.com/iPhone/iClickr/Download.aspx\n\n*** If you have problem getting i-Clickr to work, please contact us at support@senstic.com, and we will help you fix the problem."

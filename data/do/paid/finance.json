Charts for most currencies are available for 1-day, 5-days, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, 5-years and 10-years. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Listing -- \nThe exchange rates listing shows a base currency compared to all other currencies, similar to the electronic exchange rate boards seen in \"Change\" shops around the world. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Updates -- \niCurrencyPad updates Exchange Rates on demand, or automatically at pre-defined intervals ranging from 15 seconds to 1 day. Exchange Rates are automatically updated when the app is launched, or auto-updates can be turned off when roaming. An Internet connection is required to update rates, either via cellular network or a Wifi connection. Without a connection, rates can still be accessed and converted using the last data downloaded. \n\n-- Easy to Get Started -- \nA short 20-second tutorial will play when you first launch iCurrencyPad and guide you through the app's features. \n\n-- Languages -- \nThe user interface is offered in 9 languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese and Arabic. Please visit the App Store in your language for a translated description and screenshots.\n\n-- Reviews -- \n\"...iCurrency Pad is a great piece of software powered by a stunning design and usability. It’s beautiful, useful, powerful yet simple and straightforward...\" \n\n-- MacStories (http://bit.ly/94Y9IT)"

No more, no less.\n\nThe fundamental way to calculate almost every field, allows you to quickly and competently answer the most important questions that can be found usually in connection with credit management and financial consulting.\n\nIn order to work very effectively, the app has a unique simulation mode. Your details will be attractively displayed on the one hand in the form of a bar chart, on the other hand the bar chart is used as a control panel to simulate various scenarios. This simulation allows you to vary the most important parameters in small steps, so that \"what if\" scenarios can be simulated playful. For example, increase the duration of a savings plan, a single swipe from left to right across the graph is sufficient. \n\nALL FEATURES AT A GLANCE\n- All calculations are done in real time directly after entering the data.\n- Add extra payments or conditions in the mortgage calculator.\n- Add extra payments in the savings plan calculator.\n- Calculation dialog to calculate the financing requirements.\n- Changing the language / currency within the app.\n- Rapid change between year and month.\n- Calculator function in data entry.\n- Graphical simulation.\n- Results field adjustable.\n- Bar and pie chart for clear presentation of the results.\n- Start month can be assigned.\n- If necessary, additional help texts can be displayed for each input field.\n- Automatic backup of data entered.\n- Comparison between calculation variant A and B.\n- Create PDF / HTML reports, print and email.\n- Direct printing of all reports via AirPrint.\n\nFREE TRIAL\nFirst try, then buy: You can download and test the demo version of MarkMoney free. In contrast to this full version interest payments can only be calculated quarterly there. In the full version interest payments can be calculated, of course, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually. Thus, they are not forced to buy a pig in a poke.\n\nFAST SUPPORT\nUnfortunately, Apple does not allow you to respond to questions in the ratings. So please send us your questions and always contact us directly. Our support will help you and will answer usually within a very short time. We welcome your criticism, ideas and suggestions.

With Bank Card Checker you can be sure that a card number is valid and perform extra checks on the card such as the Bank or financial institution that issued it, what country it was issued in, whether it is a company/corporate or personal card and whether it's a credit/debit/visa/mastercard etc.\n\nThis incredibly easy to use application lets you view Credit or Debit Card Issuer data on your iPhone as well as validating the card number. The App interrogates its internal database of Card Issuer data to tell you the name of the bank or financial institution, the country the card was issued in, whether the card is a consumer or corporate account and the scheme type (VISA Credit, VISA Debit, Mastercard Credit, Maestro etc) .\n\nThe App can determine Card Issuer data from just the first 9 digits of the card number. In order to check that the number is valid then the whole number must be entered. \n\nThe internal database has hundreds of thousands of banks/financial institutions records in it ensuring that more than 99% of the worlds organisations are covered. The App will be updated regularly to ensure that the database stays up to date.\n\nThe App does not store any entered card data and does not connect to the internet to obtain issuer data.\n\nNOTE: The App does not check card expiry dates. This data is not publicly available."

Non financial data, such as the change in mileage and average fuel consumption can also be calculated, and displayed in brief or in detail. \n\nA carbon footprint can also be calculated, depending on the consumption of the vehicle, as well as the mass of carbon dioxide (CO2) it produces (total and average per day and per mile traveled). \n\nCar Manager also allows all these data (costs, fill-ups, vehicle information) to be exported and sent by e-mail directly from your iPhone as a CSV file (comma separated values, which can opened and processed by Excel or any other spreadsheet program), should you feel the need to create your own personalized statistics. \n\nThe application also enables you to manage a directory containing all the information about the service providers for your vehicles: insurance companies, garages, stores, clubs, associations, etc. You can then easily locate them thanks to the Maps interface. \n\nCar Manager also provides you with a Tools section, which allows you to geolocate your current position or your parking spot in a single click, so you can easily go back there later with the integrated GPS visual guiding function (or with Maps directions). This tools section can also help you find various services around your location: gas stations, garages, restaurants, hotels and others. \n\nCar Manager also gives you the opportunity to stay tuned to car news: it comes with a number of RSS feeds (internet information channels) allowing you to be informed of anything related to cars and motorsports. You can of course add any RSS feed you want. \n\nThe application automatically adapts itself to the units of measurement effective in your country: kilometers or miles for distances, liters or gallons for fuel. \n\niOS 7.1 or higher. \nUniversal application with full resolution support for iPad"

      "label": "Account Book is an app which helps you to control your finances. Who doesn't know that feeling of having less and less money in your account at the end of the month eventhough you haven't bought anything special? This is where keeping a household account book comes in handy. But how many actually do this? Sitting down every day and detailing your exact spending only to find that at the end of the month your bank account still shows the same deficit as before. \n\nThis app will help you to order your finances in an easy way. Due to the clear and simple layout, you can enter your daily expenses and incomes in only a few seconds. \n\nInitially, it is advisable to enter your monthly fixed costs (e.g. rent) and income (e.g. salary) to have them calculated as a flat rate by this clever app. This way you don't have to deduct your rent every month or add your salary...but rather this is done for you automatically. This app can automatically deduct or add a fixed amount monthly or annually, so you are spared a lot of work. \n\nSimply enter your flexible expenses each time and add a short commentary if you like. So if, for example, you go shopping simply enter that you spent € 20 at the shops. The date is then automatically added and your expense is booked. \n\nNext time you go shopping, you don't have to type in \"Shopping\" as this item will be suggested to you automatically. Simply add the amount you spent. \n\nOf course, this system works the other way round as well. When you have income, for example you sell your old television on Ebay and earn € 50, you can book that amount in just a few seconds and this way never lose overview of your finances. \n\nSo you don't lose the complete overview however, you can also have graphically displayed in which month you had a positive or negative balance. This way you can oversee the whole year and determine when you spent a lot and on what you spent your money on.  \n\nTo recognize in advance when it could become difficult at the end of a month again, it is displayed to you what percentage of the month still remains and how much money you have at your disposal. This way you know in advance, for example, that you still have half the month to go but only have € 200 to spend. Therefore, start saving! \n\nThis app is an investment which pays for itself on day one and turns into profit after that. \n\nAdditionally, it should be mentioned that studies have proven that people who use (household) account books handle their money more consciously and end up with more money at the end of the month than people who do not. This is mainly explained by those people asking themselves if they really need that € 2 packet of chewing gum or if it is simply a pointless expense which will haunt them at the end of the month."

While it is good to manage perfectly all things in the real world, it is still difficult for the system to automatically do that. As such, people have to directly and manually manage and adjust it.\n\nThat is why people think that maintaining a housekeeping book is very difficult and cumbersome. We made this for such users.\nDo not think that complex functions are difficult. Gradually start maintaining a housekeeping book with Weple Money. We can also do it. We will cheer you on.\nWe hope that a small change will come your way with Weple Money."

We were working on the pro forma balance sheets and cash flows for a new project I'm working on.  They were all asking why I had switched to the iPhone for I used to be a die hard \"brandX phone\" fan. I said that one could do so much more. They said \"yea...sure\" (they were all using \"brandX phones\") until I started using your calculator. We were analyzing different payment and amortization schedules. They were so impressed by how easily we could figure out the amount of interest, principal and remaining loan balance for any certain period or combination of periods that in the end they were saying \"I have to get me one of those\".   Great product.

Within seconds, you will be able to calculate the monthly payment for different types of fixed rate loans such as home mortgage, auto, and credit card.  You can calculate \"what if\" scenarios to determine how additional monthly and yearly payment will help you to pay off your loan earlier and save money in interest.  In addition, you can use Loan Calculator Pro to track all your extra payments at any amount and at any point in the life of your loan.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n* Early Payment Simulation\nSee how much interest you will save and how early you will pay off your loan by entering extra payment amounts per month and/or per year.\n\n* Extra Payment Tracking\n- Loan Calculator Pro will let you track all of your extra payments in variable amounts throughout the life of the loan.  For example, it will let you track an extra $100 in principle on the first payment, an extra $300 on the 5th payment, and an extra $1000 one the 10th payment, etc.  This way, the application will still be useful long after you have purchased your property and will let your know exactly where you are with all your loan payments.\n\n* Fast Calculations\n- Loan Calculator Pro is designed to be fast.  Calculations are done instantly after you enter each amount field.\n\n* Large Numeric Keypad\n- The large keypad allows for easier, faster, and more accurate entry of numeric amounts.\n\n* Amortization Table\n- A complete payment schedule allows you to view the amount, interest, principal, and remaining balance for each and every payment of the loan.\n\n* Bookmark of Payments\n- You can bookmark the current payment you are at in the amortization table and the application automatically scroll to the memorized payment the next time.\n\n* Saved Loans\n- Loan Calculator Pro lets you save and organize all your various loans in a list so you do not have to enter the information over each time.  It will also remember and opens up the last saved loan you worked on.\n\n* Loan List Reordering\n- You can reorder the loans from the saved list in any order you choose.\n\n* Email Export\n- Export loan information and payment schedule via email.\n\n* Passcode Security\n- Passcode protection to keep your loan information private.\n\n* Backup / Restore\n- Backup your data to your computer for safekeeping.  Then restore it to your iOS device when you need to via the iTunes file sharing interface.\n\n* Intuitive User Interface\n- Special attention was given to the user interface to ensure that it is clean, intuitive, and easy to use."

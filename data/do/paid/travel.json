In map view, you can tap any wifi icon where wireless information is available, and use the button to copy the password to the clipboard. The map is available offline so you don’t need an Internet connection to use WiFox when you’re traveling.\n\n*Click Copy to easily paste passwords into wireless network settings.\n\n*Users can also add passwords they find from airports around the world. Those passwords are then sent to foXnoMad for verification and approval before they are added to the map.\n\n*In ‘List View’ you can update passwords for airports already added (when you’ve noticed some changes). As you travel you can also rate the wireless hotspot information to let us know if the details worked for you or not. Based on traveler feedback, the connection information is updated, verified, or removed.\n\n*WiFox icons indicate how fresh, reliable, and highly rated a given airport wireless network’s information is.\n\n*WiFox is updated continuously with information travelers, pilots, and other users send through the WiFox app, foXnoMad website, and foXnoMad Facebook and Twitter accounts. WiFox currently has wireless Internet information for over 700 airports around the world.\n\n*The map is updated automatically upon opening the app (when you have Internet access) or by clicking the ‘Update’ button on the map or refresh icon on the List View.\n\n*WiFox also protects users on free (open) wifi networks by telling you the proper network name, so you don't unintentionally connect to a rogue or malicious access point.\n\nWiFox Premium subscriptions unlock the following features:\n\n* Automatic notifications of the highest rated password, with network connection information, as soon as you land. WiFox Premium detects the airport you're at and displays the most relevant wifi network name and password so you can get online as soon as you step off the plane.\n\n* View password ratings to see which passwords work best throughout an airport so you can connect to the strongest and most reliable connection.\n\n* Be able to add your own password ratings within WiFox. Premium user priority ratings ensure the best wifi passwords are always displayed.\n\nAfter a 30-day free trial period a $24.99/year purchase will be applied to your iTunes account following confirmation of a Premium upgrade. Subscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can cancel anytime with your iTunes account settings. Any unused portion of a free trial will be forfeited if you purchase a subscription.

      "label": "A simple and easy to use odometer. GPS Odometer only does one thing, and does it well: measure distance traveled. Includes run in background capability. Ideal for almost anything that requires measuring outdoor distance traveled such as walking, running, driving, boating, or hiking.  Note that GPS does not work well under a roof.  For best results, use outdoors.\n\nBenefits of the paid version:\n- Landscape and splitscreen support.\n- Ability to have multiple trips.  Each trip can be stopped and started independently.\n- Receive notifications while the application is closed at distance intervals of your choosing.\n- Custom units readout.  For example, you want to know how many calories you have burned.  You can customize this to include anything that has a linear relationship with distance traveled.  This can be different for each trip.\n- No advertisements.\n- Export trips via email and optionally restore later.\n\nDisplays:\n- Distance\n- Time elapsed\n- Speed (average or current)\n- Displacement (straight line distance from your starting point) This can be hidden.\n\nDistance units include:\n- Kilometers\n- Miles\n- Nautical miles\n- Meters\n- Feet\n\nSpeed units include:\n- Kilometers per hour\n- Miles per hour\n- Nautical miles per hour\n- Meters per second\n- Feet per second\n\nOther features:\n- Large font adjustable display.\n- Accurate to within 1 percent when compared to most car odometers under normal driving conditions.\n- Includes a lock to help prevent accidental reset of your trip. After unlocked, it locks back in a few seconds, or you can lock it yourself.\n- Approximates distance traveled in some GPS dead spots such as driving through a tunnel by adding the as-a-bird flies distance to your trip.\n\nPlease also note:\n- GPS Odometer does run in the background if you leave it running.  Be sure to pause the trip when you are finished or battery life will be negatively affected.  The timer stops when the trip is paused.\n- To change the display, tap the unlock button and notice the three green boxes that temporarily appear. Each button adjusts a different part of the display.\n- You can change the language to English in the application settings.\n\nPlease visit the web page for more details."

No Login. \n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Francés, the most popular route across Spain. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 900 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 900+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

      "label": "GPS Log is a location-first way to record your adventures. Whether you're backpacking overseas, or exploring your local neighborhood, GPS Log gives you everything you need to capture your travels, share your favorite places with your friends, and find your way back again!\n\nHow it works:\n\n1. GPS Log gets your location from your device in seconds.\n2. You add photos, text, and tags (if you like).\n3. Later, browse the list of saved log entries or search by text and tags.\n4. Easily view logged locations on a map and get directions to return.\n5. Connect with your friends by sharing single records (what we call spikes), trip maps and lifetime travel maps using our own website Geospike, and on social media.\n\nTry 'GPS Log' risk free with the 'GPS Log LITE' version. \n\nTraveling around the world and want to remember where you went? Or, going to a new coffee shop in your neighborhood? Use GPS Log to record all your adventures, great and small.\n\nGPS Log works with no data connection, great when you're far from civilization, or roaming. GPS Log preserves your battery life. Unlike some tracking tools, with GPS Log you power it up when you want to log a location - then you power it down immediately. Saving your precious battery.\n\nLog the cities you visit, rate the restaurants in your city, geotag your photographs, remember where you parked your car, or where you went out. Record the mountain, river, or run you conquered, and much much more. With GPS Log, you can log just about anything.\n\nNOTE: GPS Log works best on devices with actual GPS receivers such as the iPhone, and iPads with Cellular Data.  Locations obtained on other devices may be less accurate.\n\nIf you experience any issues using GPS Log, PLEASE use the links on GPS Log's Settings screen to contact us by email. When issues are left as reviews, we are unable to contact you to help."

      "label": "eCurrency is far more than an easy to use currency converter and handy calculator.

Just start the application and type in the amount you want to convert and eCurrency converts instantly. Tap on one of the flags to change the currency you want to convert to. A built-in calculator allows for math calculations. The current exchange rate and rate change compared to the previous day is conveniently displayed in the main interface.\n\n==Favorites Support==\neCurrency supports over 200 currencies.

Street View coverage is displayed in blue.\n\n\nEASY TO USE\nWalking through panoramas has never been easier using the interactive, expandable mini map that also displays your viewing angle and field of view. Virtually traveling abroad is even more immersive and fun with Live Panorama mode: Turn around in the panorama simply by rotating the device.\n\n\nAPPLE WATCH APP\nStreets is the only app capable of displaying 360° Street View panoramas on the Apple Watch. Just turn your wrist or pan to turn around in any direction. Use the digital crown to zoom. Streets for Apple Watch automatically syncs favorites and recent searches with your iPhone.\n\n\nOPEN FROM MAPS & OTHER APPS \n“Open location in Streets” displays nearby panoramas from websites, from „Maps“ or „Contacts“, or from many other apps that support sharing of locations and addresses. If you’re already using our location finder app Where To?, you’ll also be able to take advantage of a tight, bidirectional integration.\n\n\nDRAG & DROP\nOn iPad or Mac, drag a pin location from the Maps app, a contact, or a textual address into the Streets app to find nearby panoramas. Even geotagged photos can be dropped in Streets to find 360° spherical images near the photo location.\n\n\nCOMMUNICATIVE\nShare Street View panoramas using drag-and-drop (on iPad) or the share sheet. Handoff and AirDrop let you easily transfer the currently viewed panorama between multiple devices. Mark panoramas as favorites that are automatically synced between devices. Rename favorites and organize them in folders.\n\n\n2000+ GALLERY PLACES \nMore than 2000 hand-picked “Gallery Places” show spectacular places such as museums, castles, national parks, ski slopes and even underwater attractions. Geysers in Yellowstone national park, old masterpieces in Amsterdam’s van Gogh museum or NASA’s rocket launch pad in Cape Kennedy are just a few of the breathtaking places waiting to be explored. Gallery places also include background information such as descriptions and links.\n\n\n\nMORE FEATURES\n- Supports iPad Pro, Split View and Slide Over\n- Supports keyboard navigation (with Bluetooth or Smart Keyboard)\n- Spotlight search also finds Streets panoramas\n- Siri can create reminders with a link to the currently displayed panorama\n- Supports the “Shortcuts” app\n\n\nWHAT OTHERS SAY\n\n“I highly recommend Streets 3.“\n- John Voorhees, MacStories\n\n“it’s hard to imagine Cupertino doing it better than Streets 3”\n4.5/5 mice\n- J.R. Bookwalter, Macworld\n\n“If you haven't migrated to Google Maps on iOS because you're OK with Apple Maps but you miss Google Street View, here's a pretty easy solution.“\n- Mel Martin, Engadget\n\n“Thankfully, with Streets, you can continue using Maps and still be able to quickly pull up Street View without ever feeling like you’ve left the app.“\n- Jordan Khan, 9to5Mac\n\n\nTwitter & Facebook\nCheck us out on Twitter: @futuretap\nand Facebook: http://facebook.com/streetviewapp"

      "label": "This App is based on content licensed from Mayo Clinic and helps travelers safeguard their health before, during and after travel. This App is developed by experienced travel medicine consultants from Mayo Clinic focusing on your health during travel and provides tips for preventing and handling illnesses while traveling. Providers refer their patients to this App so that travelers have the information when they need.\n\nThe App is easy to use:\n\n1. Find your destination by browsing or searching from the home screen.\n2. When you find your destination country, press “Add This to My Trips” \n3. Get a list of recommended vaccines by pressing “Health and Vaccinations”. (If you have not received the recommended vaccines for this trip, contact your healthcare provider). This section also tells you if you need to take medicine for malaria prevention (an infection transmitted by mosquitoes that attacks and breaks down red blood cells in your body).\n4. “Packing List” recommends things you should carry with you for that trip (touching the radial buttons marks those items complete). You can modify this list and add new items.\n5. “To Do” section reminds you of important travel and health related preparations you need to make before your trip. Add or delete items based on your needs.\n6. Save your travel documents and health related information in “My Stuff” section.\n\nDetails of App features:\n\nCustomized recommendations for travel health based on your travel itinerary.  Recommendations on safe travel for sick travelers.\n\nLicensed Mayo Clinic's content for \"Health\" section provides information on symptoms and prevention strategies for a broad range of travel related illnesses including Jet Lag and Sleep, Motion and Altitude Sickness, Travel Diarrhea, insect transmitted illnesses and many more. \n\nLatest safety alerts are a touch away. Navigate to Travel Alerts and Warnings issued by US Department of State (links provided in the app). While in this section, enroll in Smart Travel Enrollment Program (STEP), a free service to allow U.S. citizens/Nationals traveling abroad to enroll with the local U.S. Embassy.\n\nThe app provides simple exercises that can be performed with limited leg space on board aircraft. How? Well, we've got pictures to show you how. Stay fit while on board aircraft and prevent the dreaded blood clots in the legs.\n\nWhat if you lose your passport while traveling? We've got you covered. Store all your travel documents in \"My Stuff\" section. \n\nThe app lets you store Immunization records, your doctor’s contact information, list of allergies, medication information (pictures of pills, dosages, frequency) and your health insurance information.  This information can be life saving in case you lose your luggage and medications kept in it (Trust us, it happens more frequently than you think).\n\nStore unlimited customized items with pictures in the “My Stuff” Custom Item section of the App.  It is up to your imagination as you can use the packing list as your shopping list.  All information is stored on your device, making it available when needed and eliminating cloud-based document storage risk.\n\nUpon return, archive the trip and you can use your customized lists for your next destination (a great feature for frequent fliers).\n  \nFriendly reminder: Keep in mind that this app is not a replacement for consultation with a Travel Medicine Doctor or your primary healthcare provider. Your medical condition may warrant precautions that your Doctor may tell you.  So pay a visit before travel.\n\nThis is the only App that has information on Hajj and Umrah."

Scan the boarding pass and email it to colleagues, family, or friends so they have your updated flight information.\n\nNote that although most airlines follow the barcoded boarding pass standard (we have successfully tested dozens of airlines, around the world), some airlines don't exactly follow the standard.  As we identify them them, we continue update the app to support them.  If you find a Boarding pass that doesn't properly decode, contact our support with a clear photo of your boarding pass, and we will add support for that airline.\n\n-- Please note that this app does not change a paper boarding pass to a mobile boarding pass.  Not all airlines support mobile boarding passes at all stations; please refer to your airline for more information on obtaining mobile boarding passes.  This application presents the information encoded in a barcoded boarding pass for your inspection. --"

Experience complete freedom and get value for your money! Use Cuba-Junky’s Casa Particular Directory app as your simple and user friendly ‘Yellow Pages’ while planning, traveling and exploring!\n\nWhy you need this app when you plan to visit Cuba \n- Cuba friendly and explorer friendly (simple, practical and cheap!)\n- Several updates a week with new casas and features \n- Even more casas in the app than on our website\n - Direct contact with the casa through the app\n - Save yourself  $5 per night by using the app to contact the owners directly  \n\nWhat are casas particulares? \nCuba’s version of B&Bs offer the island’s best lodging values for anyone who likes doing things authentically, or in this case: the Cuban way. You can find hundreds of casas in this app. They are rooms, suites, or sometimes entire apartments. The Cuba-Junky casa directory app is current, convenient, and easy to use. It provides casa photos, phone numbers, email addresses, Facebook and website links—all for about US $5!  \n\nOnline, offline and more \nBut there is more. The casa particular directory app is very frequently updated at no extra charge. And you can access other types of info through the app, such as the weather forecast, or use it to contact your casa.\n\n  No commission: save $5 per night! \nBy using this app and contacting a casa directly, you often save the $5 per night commission that the owner normally charges for bookings made through a third party. Casa owners pay no commission or other costs to Cuba Junky. Say this to the casa owner and get that discount!\n\n  Some free Cuba advice?\n Cuba-Junky’s advice is: make a reservation for your first night in Cuba and after that just “go with the flow.” Using your Cuba-Junky casa particular app, it will be easy to find casas while in Cuba, or to call ahead to a casa in the next town you plan to visit. You can talk to the owner directly, find out what’s available, and at what price.   \n\nWhy does this app cost about $5?  \nJust because Cuba Junky have to keep it running. We charge no hidden $5 per night commission. We just love Cuba. If you do too, go and enjoy it, and while you’ re at it, help us keep Cuban locals in the lead! ¡Gracias amigos!"

Why strain your eyes to see a distant statue from a tour bus, or get rushed through your favorite sight? See NYC the way it was meant to be seen: on foot.\n\nSixteen sights are included in the tour, covering about 3.5 miles. Rain? Take a break and resume later. It's like having your own personal tour guide, at a fraction of the price.\n\nTwo Buck Tours include narration (in English), maps with GPS, directions, photos, and interesting information about each sight. Good for tourists and locals of all ages. No schedules, no crowds, no worries."

L'appli fonctionne en effet hors ligne (offline), ce qui vous permet de l'utiliser sans jamais consommer votre forfait téléphonique (autrement dit, l'appli fonctionnera même si vous êtes en mode avion !).\nLa carte compte plusieurs centaines de points d'intérêt triés sur le volet. Vous avez en outre la possibilité de créer une liste de favoris, et même d'ajouter vos propres points d'intérêt sur la carte !\n\nL'appli BPVNY, c'est aussi :\n\n- Des articles sur toutes les choses à savoir avant de partir et une fois sur place\n- Les plans officiels du métro et du bus (accessibles d'une simple touche !)\n- Des plannings-types pour vous aider à prévoir et organiser vos activités\n- Un éditeur de planning (avec la possibilité de créer et sauvegarder plusieurs plannings)\n- La liste des réservations à ne pas oublier avant de partir (avec les liens vers les différents portails de réservation)\n- Un calculateur de pourboires (pour le taxi, le resto...)\n- Un calculateur de taxes (pour le shopping)\n- Un outil de conversion € - $\n- Des checklists pour être sûr de ne rien oublier avant le départ (avec la possibilité de créer ses propres checklists)\n- Un guide de conversation français-anglais\n- Une affiche I love BPVNY (pour faire un clin d’œil à la communauté BPVNY !)\n\nNaturellement, l'appli continuera de s'enrichir au fil de l'eau et proposera toujours plus de services pour répondre aux besoins du plus grand nombre.\nN'hésitez donc pas à me faire part de vos remarques et suggestions d'amélioration !\n\nAlex les bons plans\n\nAuteur : Alexandre Vendé\nDéveloppeurs : Corentin Larroque, Romain Benmansour, Harold Fritsch & Clément Tissier"

      "label": "MetroBuddy is your subway ride's best friend. In cities like New York where you have to swipe your transit card to unlock the turnstile, forgetting your balance and being greeted by an \"insufficient funds\" message can be annoying, and delay your journey.\n\nMetroBuddy lets you enter your current MetroCard balance, and update it each time you swipe. Never lose time at the MetroCard reader again, your balance will always be available on your phone! The app also calculates how many rides you have left, based on your fare. Use the History tab to review the changes you made to your balance.\n\nMetroBuddy also provides Siri shortcuts to record a swipe and check your balance. This enables you to build powerful automation for your commute, such as recording a swipe, starting your favorite playlist, and checking the next train departure.\n\nIf you are using iOS 14 or later, you can add a widget to your home screen or your widget center to view your balance even faster.\n\nWe are proud to be working on making MetroBuddy as inclusive as possible. You can change your fare if you have a more affordable one. The app is also fully compatible with iOS assistive technologies such as VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, and VoiceControl. Turnstiles are not fully accessible, but MetroBuddy is.\n\nDo not hesitate to reach out with feedback and/or questions by e-mail at hi@alexisonline.dev.\n\nPlease note that MetroBuddy is a hobby app and is not affiliated with New York's MTA in any way."

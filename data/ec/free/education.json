Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

We will continue in the hopes that there will soon be peace for our children and children all around the world!\n\nDrawing Academy from Bini Games is a unique app where kids are inspired to learn by drawing. In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain. As they draw, children process information in multiple ways, such as with their eyes and body, as well as emotionally. We created the Drawing Academy app with all this in mind.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- 150 step-by step drawing tutorials in 10 thematic sets with different complexity levels for kids aged 2 to 6\n- “ABC\" and \"Numbers” packs to get children interested in learning letters and numbers through drawing with pictures they make themselves\n- a huge variety of tools, including pencils, crayons, stickers, patterns, and paints\n- tracing and free-drawing mechanics to help prepare your child’s hand for writing with step-by-step motor-skill refinement, from the moment they first scribble to their finalized masterpieces\n- activities that form a customized age-based learning program, taking your child’s interests into account\n- unique easy-to-follow tracing exercises that guide your child’s creativity without limitations and stimulating free drawing\n\nDrawing Academy isn’t just another coloring book!\n\nNote: only part of the content in the screenshots is available in the free version of the application. To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy. Just download and go!\n\nA free 7-day trial period is available to you, or you can subscribe right after download.\n\nAfter your free trial, your subscription will automatically start unless you adjust your subscription settings at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n\nWe provide different subscription options for your convenience: monthly and annual subscription.\n\nIf you change your mind at any point, cancellation is easy through your iTunes settings.\n\nPayment for subscriptions will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nYour subscription automatically renews unless you turn the renewal feature off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n\nYou will be charged for renewal within 24 hours of the end of the current period.\n\nYou can cancel your subscription anytime through your Account Settings without any cancellation fees.\n\nYou can use your subscription on any device registered with your Apple ID.\n\nIf you need help, have questions, or just want to say, “hi!”, get in touch at feedback@bini.games.\n\nhttps://binibambini.com/terms-of-use/\n\nhttp://binibambini.com/privacy\n\nMore about Bini Games:\n\nBini Games is a group of enthusiastic professionals including designers, artists, animators, programmers, and musicians, who love to create digital games for children.\n\nAll our games are safe and do not collect any personal information."

Our apps have zero ads and no flashy features, thus providing a safe and non-intrusive learning experience. We use ABA therapy-inspired positive reinforcement that rewards kids with fun games and stickers for trying.

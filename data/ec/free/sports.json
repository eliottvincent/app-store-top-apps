      "label": "NOTE: Application is designed to track only ONE team stats during the game and not both teams! \n\nWe all have seen assistant coaches around the world using sheets of paper and scribbling down the game statistics for their team while sitting next to the coach. The same assistant coaches then had to spend an hour or more compiling those scribbled data into a Box Score which they could analyze further. Basketball Stats PRO app for iPhone scraps both the paper and the grueling process of stats compiling and delivers an easy to use stats tracker, which allows coaches, assistant coaches, scouts, parents or basketball fans to track stats of their team right from their phone.\n\nAll the inputted stats are instantly compiled to show the current stats of your team, this will allow coaching staff to have all the stats updated and ready at any given time during or after the game. Inputting stats is a very easy process, since you have buttons that represent each player in the roster and all the stats categories. You just tap on a player and the stat and it will automatically get added to the game. For two and three point shots (hit or missed) you also tap on the area of the court where the shot was taken from. You can view the complete Box Score with just one tap and send it via email to anyone around the world. \n\nAll the inputted statistics are written to a local database, thus you can view stats of a given player for not just one game, but all the games where the player has been involved in. You will soon realize that this stats app can really help you with efficient stats input and analysis after the game.\n\nApp Features:\n\n** Easy and intuitive way to input stats in the app\n** Compiled stats and box scores ready after each new stat entry\n** Play by Play view, with editing and emailing options\n** Box Score with email sending capabilities\n** Detailed compiled statistics for all players and games where they played\n** Send games to others via email or to other nearby iOS devices with Basketball Stats installed with multipeer connectivity\n** Search for Players and Games\n\nLet Basketball Stats PRO for iPhone take your stats tracking to the next level!\n\nYou can have up to 15 players selected/active for each game (number of inputted players is unlimited)"

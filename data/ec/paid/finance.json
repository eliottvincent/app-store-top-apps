Professional! Highly Recommended... finally the currency application I have been waiting for so long...\"\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ \"...I tried all other similar apps, and I am proud to announce that this app is simply the best of them all..\"\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ \"Smart, intuitive and flexible!... slick interface with great functionality which further impresses with its great selection of currencies and immediate updates. Good job! Highly recommend!\"\n\nFeatures:\n\n-- Simple Interface -- \niCurrencyPad was designed to be fast and easy to use. Just select the currencies to convert and tap in the amount to convert. A convenient calculator allows for basic math calculations, showing the results as the values are tapped. Swipe across the display to swap the left and right currencies, or swipe up and down to select different currencies. Tap and hold to copy/paste. \n\n-- Favorite Currencies -- \nWhile iCurrencyPad offers exchange rates for 160+ currencies from around the world, you may be interested in only a few currencies. To reduce clutter on the screen, iCurrencyPad allows you to select and sort your Favorite Currencies, so only those currencies that interest you appear on the screen, thereby making the application easier and faster to use. \n\n-- Charts -- \nDetailed charts show the history of exchange rates for any two currencies. Tap on the chart for the exchange rate on any particular day. Tap with two fingers to show the change in rates between any two dates. Rotate the device for a larger chart in landscape view. Charts for most currencies are available for 1-day, 5-days, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, 5-years and 10-years. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Listing -- \nThe exchange rates listing shows a base currency compared to all other currencies, similar to the electronic exchange rate boards seen in \"Change\" shops around the world. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Updates -- \niCurrencyPad updates Exchange Rates on demand, or automatically at pre-defined intervals ranging from 15 seconds to 1 day. Exchange Rates are automatically updated when the app is launched, or auto-updates can be turned off when roaming. An Internet connection is required to update rates, either via cellular network or a Wifi connection. Without a connection, rates can still be accessed and converted using the last data downloaded. \n\n-- Easy to Get Started -- \nA short 20-second tutorial will play when you first launch iCurrencyPad and guide you through the app's features. \n\n-- Languages -- \nThe user interface is offered in 9 languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese and Arabic. Please visit the App Store in your language for a translated description and screenshots.\n\n-- Reviews -- \n\"...iCurrency Pad is a great piece of software powered by a stunning design and usability. It’s beautiful, useful, powerful yet simple and straightforward...\" \n\n-- MacStories (http://bit.ly/94Y9IT)"

We were working on the pro forma balance sheets and cash flows for a new project I'm working on.  They were all asking why I had switched to the iPhone for I used to be a die hard \"brandX phone\" fan. I said that one could do so much more. They said \"yea...sure\" (they were all using \"brandX phones\") until I started using your calculator. We were analyzing different payment and amortization schedules. They were so impressed by how easily we could figure out the amount of interest, principal and remaining loan balance for any certain period or combination of periods that in the end they were saying \"I have to get me one of those\".   Great product. Thanks.\""

      "label": "Loan Calculator Pro is an easy to use financial calculator.  Within seconds, you will be able to calculate the monthly payment for different types of fixed rate loans such as home mortgage, auto, and credit card.  You can calculate \"what if\" scenarios to determine how additional monthly and yearly payment will help you to pay off your loan earlier and save money in interest.  In addition, you can use Loan Calculator Pro to track all your extra payments at any amount and at any point in the life of your loan.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n* Early Payment Simulation\nSee how much interest you will save and how early you will pay off your loan by entering extra payment amounts per month and/or per year.\n\n* Extra Payment Tracking\n- Loan Calculator Pro will let you track all of your extra payments in variable amounts throughout the life of the loan.  For example, it will let you track an extra $100 in principle on the first payment, an extra $300 on the 5th payment, and an extra $1000 one the 10th payment, etc.  This way, the application will still be useful long after you have purchased your property and will let your know exactly where you are with all your loan payments.\n\n* Fast Calculations\n- Loan Calculator Pro is designed to be fast.  Calculations are done instantly after you enter each amount field.\n\n* Large Numeric Keypad\n- The large keypad allows for easier, faster, and more accurate entry of numeric amounts.\n\n* Amortization Table\n- A complete payment schedule allows you to view the amount, interest, principal, and remaining balance for each and every payment of the loan.\n\n* Bookmark of Payments\n- You can bookmark the current payment you are at in the amortization table and the application automatically scroll to the memorized payment the next time.\n\n* Saved Loans\n- Loan Calculator Pro lets you save and organize all your various loans in a list so you do not have to enter the information over each time.  It will also remember and opens up the last saved loan you worked on.\n\n* Loan List Reordering\n- You can reorder the loans from the saved list in any order you choose.\n\n* Email Export\n- Export loan information and payment schedule via email.\n\n* Passcode Security\n- Passcode protection to keep your loan information private.\n\n* Backup / Restore\n- Backup your data to your computer for safekeeping.  Then restore it to your iOS device when you need to via the iTunes file sharing interface.\n\n* Intuitive User Interface\n- Special attention was given to the user interface to ensure that it is clean, intuitive, and easy to use."

      "label": "Account Book is an app which helps you to control your finances. Who doesn't know that feeling of having less and less money in your account at the end of the month eventhough you haven't bought anything special? This is where keeping a household account book comes in handy. But how many actually do this? Sitting down every day and detailing your exact spending only to find that at the end of the month your bank account still shows the same deficit as before. \n\nThis app will help you to order your finances in an easy way. Due to the clear and simple layout, you can enter your daily expenses and incomes in only a few seconds. \n\nInitially, it is advisable to enter your monthly fixed costs (e.g. rent) and income (e.g. salary) to have them calculated as a flat rate by this clever app. This way you don't have to deduct your rent every month or add your salary...but rather this is done for you automatically. This app can automatically deduct or add a fixed amount monthly or annually, so you are spared a lot of work. \n\nSimply enter your flexible expenses each time and add a short commentary if you like. So if, for example, you go shopping simply enter that you spent € 20 at the shops. The date is then automatically added and your expense is booked. \n\nNext time you go shopping, you don't have to type in \"Shopping\" as this item will be suggested to you automatically. Simply add the amount you spent. \n\nOf course, this system works the other way round as well. When you have income, for example you sell your old television on Ebay and earn € 50, you can book that amount in just a few seconds and this way never lose overview of your finances. \n\nSo you don't lose the complete overview however, you can also have graphically displayed in which month you had a positive or negative balance. This way you can oversee the whole year and determine when you spent a lot and on what you spent your money on.  \n\nTo recognize in advance when it could become difficult at the end of a month again, it is displayed to you what percentage of the month still remains and how much money you have at your disposal. This way you know in advance, for example, that you still have half the month to go but only have € 200 to spend. Therefore, start saving! \n\nThis app is an investment which pays for itself on day one and turns into profit after that. \n\nAdditionally, it should be mentioned that studies have proven that people who use (household) account books handle their money more consciously and end up with more money at the end of the month than people who do not. This is mainly explained by those people asking themselves if they really need that € 2 packet of chewing gum or if it is simply a pointless expense which will haunt them at the end of the month."

But, once you need to start validating them,  a large canvas on paper isn’t the most practical  tool to carry with you. Also, there is no clear path to go from a Business Model to a Financial plan.\n\nSo, we adapted it to fit mobile devices and added new layers to help you go beyond design:\n\n> Financials: For helping you access your business model viability.\n\n> Goals: For keeping track of your ambitions.\n\n> Next Steps: For tracking what you need to do to reach your goals\n\nThe app provides a practical way to organize your goals and tasks in each business model block. This will help you to keep focus on specific areas when working on a task or experiment. Also, it will be easier to see which parts of your business you are moving forward and what it's being left behind.  \n\nDESIGN A BETTER BUSINESS MODEL:\n\nAdd your \"sticky notes\" to the business model canvas and benefit from automatic charts that will provide better visuals for showcasing your business ideas to others.\n\nEVALUATE KEY METRICS:\n\nThe built-in Customer Lifetime Value Simulator helps to understand the value of your customers and how much you can spend on customer acquisition to be sustainable. \n\nYou can also generate Profit & Loss projections painlessly from you business model data to make a long term analysis of your margins.\n\nGET READY FOR ACTION:\n\nAchieve you most Important goals with the powerful OKR - Objectives and Key Results methodology, used by fast growing startups and companies.\n\nEXECUTE, THE AGILE WAY:\n\nCreate lists of tasks to move your business forward or experiments to validate you business model assumptions. Reflect on the results and adapt your goals and business model, all with the same tool. \n\nTO DO WHAT YOU LOVE, YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY START!\n\nWe live in an amazing era. Technology  like artificial intelligence, blockchain and crypto-currencies is disrupting current business models. Business model innovation is an imperative. \n\nIf you have the courage to build your business, instead of dreaming about it, this app is for you. \"The true entrepreneur is a doer, not a dreamer\":\n\nDownload MetaCanvas today, the app for agile entrepreneurs."

It takes advantage of price correlation between various Forex pairs. Currency strength is measured for 8 currencies (USD, JPY, EUR, GBP, AUD, NZD, CHF & CAD) and is reported on a scale of 0 (weakest) to 10 (strongest). \n\nCurrency strength data provides the trader with important insights into the forces at play causing a move on a particular Forex pair. For example, if GBP/USD suddenly trends upwards following an economic news announcement (e.g. US Non-Farm Payroll), the currency strength values would immediately indicate whether the move was due to generalized GBP strength or USD weakness.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\nStreaming currency strength data feed - fast updates, low latency. Accurate and reliable\n\n8 currencies and 4 currency strength time-frames. Currency strength resolution down to 1 min on lower time-frames.\n\nBar Chart. Multiple time-frames, history viewer feature, real-time max/min highlighting.\n\nLine Chart. For real-time and historical data. Multiple time-frames, zoom. Customizable currencies, gridlines etc.\n\nDark Mode support (requires IOS13+)\n\nMultiple bar chart color themes.\n\nAdjustable chart Time-Zone. Match the time-zone to your Forex charts.\n\nBuilt-in Help / User Guide. Detailed description of all features.\n\nPriority Support. Contact us directly from within the App.\n\nAn optional Data Booster Pack option adds 2 extra time-frames: M15 and H1\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.currencystrengthmeter.net/privacy/\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.currencystrengthmeter.net/terms/"

Additionally it validates the card number.\n\nDo you run a shop or office where you need to take orders that are paid for by credit card over the phone? Need to check that the card information a customer is giving you is valid? With Bank Card Checker you can be sure that a card number is valid and perform extra checks on the card such as the Bank or financial institution that issued it, what country it was issued in, whether it is a company/corporate or personal card and whether it's a credit/debit/visa/mastercard etc.\n\nThis incredibly easy to use application lets you view Credit or Debit Card Issuer data on your iPhone as well as validating the card number. The App interrogates its internal database of Card Issuer data to tell you the name of the bank or financial institution, the country the card was issued in, whether the card is a consumer or corporate account and the scheme type (VISA Credit, VISA Debit, Mastercard Credit, Maestro etc) .\n\nThe App can determine Card Issuer data from just the first 9 digits of the card number. In order to check that the number is valid then the whole number must be entered. \n\nThe internal database has hundreds of thousands of banks/financial institutions records in it ensuring that more than 99% of the worlds organisations are covered. The App will be updated regularly to ensure that the database stays up to date.\n\nThe App does not store any entered card data and does not connect to the internet to obtain issuer data.\n\nNOTE: The App does not check card expiry dates.

      "label": "Lingvist is the language learning app built by scientists and language experts that teaches vocabulary better than anyone else in the world. The depth of our courses combined with the latest research in machine learning gets you using a language with high proficiency, fast.\n\nGET LEVEL PLACED FOR FREE - TRY LINGVIST\n\nLEARN 10 LANGUAGES: English, German, French, Dutch, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Estonian and Russian.\n\n=====\n\nWHY LINGVIST?\n\nFOLLOW CONVERSATIONS QUICKLY\nLearn the vocabulary that appears most often in a language first, allowing you to accelerate your learning.\n\nREAD, WRITE, SPEAK, AND LISTEN\nPerfect your pronunciation using sophisticated speech recognition technology or type your answers. Every sentence has audio to ensure you hone your listening skills.\n\nFOR SERIOUS LEARNERS\nYour learning efficiency is our focus. Enjoy a clean UI with no advertising, no unnecessary clicks, and no distractions.\n\nREMEMBER A LANGUAGE FOREVER\nUsing scientifically proven spaced repetition methodology, the vocabulary gets fixed in your long-term memory over time. You can even see your progress on increasing the intervals in the app.\n\nLEARN GRAMMAR IN CONTEXT OR AS A FOCUS\nAcquire grammar passively (inductive learning) like a native with our bite-sized sentences, or practice conjugating French verbs in our French course.\n\nSPECIALIST VOCABULARY FOR YOU\nSubmit your own words, images, or text and Lingvist will automatically gather vocabulary related to the theme for you to learn. Whether it’s Harry Potter in German, French nuclear physics, or Spanish colors, you can learn the words most important to you (available in some courses).\n\nMOTIVATIONAL STATISTICS\nPacked with data on your learning progress, you’ll be able to chart your path to success.\n\nA MUST-HAVE TOOL IN YOUR BAG\nDo you live in your target country, use a tutor or language school, or even read books, listen to podcasts, or watch content in your target language? Lingvist works best when used in parallel with other learning methods. It’s the difference between passing your test or acing it.\n\nLEARN BY DOING\nYou will learn vocabulary or conjugations (available in some courses) by “guessing” the answer. Getting it wrong is one of the fastest ways to learn, and your brain will start to remember very quickly.\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe playlist feature lets you listen to bite-sized sentences in hands-free mode.\n\nPERSONALIZED SETTINGS\nEvery learner is different. Personalize your learning to suit you, with various settings allowing you to learn with extra slow speech, strict diacritics, and even grammar tables.\n\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING PLAN\nWe'll serve you new words that are most relevant to you. As we measure your memory curves, we ask you to repeat words at the optimal time – just before you forget them. This way, you'll always know what to learn next.\n\nLANGUAGE LEARNING MADE EASY\nWhether you are planning on spending this summer in Italy and need to learn Italian, or your next adventure is taking up a course in Germany and you need an app to learn German, we have you covered. Our language learning techniques will help you to get fluent in over 9 languages.\n\n=====\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to the full learning materials for all languages we offer. Each subscription will be automatically renewed unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current payment period. When a subscription is canceled, access to the app's courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nVisit our blog to get tips, tricks, and interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Lingvist blog: https://lingvist.com/blog/\n\nFollow us to get interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/theLingvist\n▸▸ Instagram: instagram.com/thelingvist/\n▸▸ Twitter: https://twitter.com/lingvist\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://lingvist.com/privacy-policy/\nTerms of Use: https://lingvist.com/tos/"

It is the smartest way to perfect your English, and learn every word that matters while enjoying the process!\r\n\r\nWordUp helps you to build a MAP of your KNOWLEDGE. Every word you know, and every word you don't. All 25,000 useful English words are ranked in the order of IMPORTANCE, and USEFULNESS, based on how often they are used in real-world spoken English (extracted from thousands of movies, and TV shows).\r\n\r\nBy creating your Knowledge Map in WordUp, you constantly discover the most valuable next word to learn that you don't know yet, and focus on learning them in that order. It's the smartest way to spend your time learning!\r\n\r\nTo actually learn the words that you discover in your Knowledge Map, WordUp gives you everything you need, and more! From word definitions and pictures to tens of entertaining examples from movies, quotes, news, and more. So you get a good feel of how to use each word in context. There are also translations in more than 30 languages including French, Spanish, German, Arabic, Turkish, Persian, ...\r\n\r\nThe daily reviews then kick in. Like flashcards, the words will come back with games and challenges until you master them. It's called Spaced Repetition, and it's scientifically proven to help memorise them forever!\r\n\r\nWordUp is unlike any vocabulary builder app you've seen before. It is not another dictionary app, although it can be used as an English dictionary too. \r\n\r\nWordUp's novel approach to language learning and expanding your vocabulary will leave you feeling confident and empowered. Whether you are new to English, are preparing for an English exam (IELTS, TOEFL, etc), or are a native English speaker, you will find WordUp helpful and entertaining. Just give it a try and see for yourself!"

Содержит твердозвучащие слоги (гласные А, О, У, Э) и мягкозвучащие слоги (гласные Е, Ё, И, Ю, Я).\n\nЧитаю сам:\n√ эффективная методика обучения чтению;\n√ нравится детям;\n√ красивые иллюстрации;\n√ нравится родителям.\n\nСлова в игре поделены на склады. Эффективность складовой методики обучения чтению детей с раннего возраста оценена педагогами и родителями, чьи дети научились читать играя, без видимых усилий. Ребенок учит звуки (не буквы) и склады русского языка, учится читать по складам, составляя слова из карточек с буквами и слогами. Правильное составление слова сопровождается анимацией, которая делает обучение чтению более увлекательным и не похожим на урок или занятие. С первого запуска игры малыш может играть и учиться читать самостоятельно.\n\nПриложение поможет многим уже начавшим читать детям уйти от постоянных ошибок в чтении, особенно детям, имеющим логопедические проблемы. На этой методике основаны знаменитые кубики Зайцева.\n\nИгра состоит из знакомых и малознакомых детям слов, которые они запомнят благодаря весёлой анимации. Таким образом, попутно с чтением развивается словарный запас и кругозор ребёнка. \n\nЧерез каждые 4 собранных слова в игре по умолчанию включена проверка чтения, которую родители могут отключать и включать по своему усмотрению.\n\nСкачайте игру бесплатно и узнайте, как научиться читать легко!"

      "label": "The “Travel Phrasebook” App has many useful foreign phrases and words (e.g., “Thank you!”, “How much?” or “A table for two, please!”). \n\nWhen you tap a phrase, the app speaks it aloud. There is no guessing as to how to pronounce the words. And if the app is talking too quickly for you, simply tap the snail/turtle icon to hear the words more slowly. Listen to pronunciation recorded by native speaker and then record and play back your own voice to practice your foreign language speaking skills!\n\nWhen traveling to foreign countries, make sure you bring the app with you! Ideally you listen to a phrase and repeat it, but if your accent is terrible, you can play the voice on the app to local people (e.g., a waiter or store clerk). Language barrier while travelling abroad will no longer exist!\n\n--- FEATURES ---\n\n1. Many useful foreign phrases & words\n2. Pronunciation recorded by native speaker\n3. Voice recording & playback\n4. No Internet connection required\n5. Instant search by keywords\n6. Customizable font size\n\nWelcome to download the “Travel Phrasebook” app!

You might even wish they were as attentive to their homework or preschool as they are with games. \n\nThey can't help it. Play is an integral part of development for 2,3,4-year-olds. But what we can do instead is to help them absorb valuable information through fun games. \n\nWe combined 500+ fun and educational baby games in one app to help you and your kids navigate through the assortment of activities and puzzles. \n\nYour toddlers & preschoolers will be able to:\n ► Identify shapes, sizes, and colors by playing toddler puzzles that let you sort objects;\n ► Learn about domestic and wild animals by taking care of them in our baby games;\n ► Learn about healthy food; \n ► Learn English alphabet (ABC), numbers and phonics with our new, finger-tracing feature. \n\nOnce you notice that your kid is engaged in our educational games, that's when you know that the learning process has begun. \n\nWe also need to mention our ABC puzzles, where kids find themselves motivated to learn more about the letters and words surrounding them. \n\nThe games feature:\n ► Phonics - Recognize the letters of the English alphabet and link them to the sounds\n ► Letters and words - Get a head start into learning how to read \n ► Letter tracing - Learn how to write letters \n ► Number tracing - Learn how to write numbers\n\n\nYou might even find yourself enjoying a few of these puzzles.. \n\nLearning from books and papers is not easy at a preschool age. Let your toddler, boy or girl,  relax with fun and educational activities; their absorbent brain will soak up all the new knowledge on its own.   \n\nOur apps are developed and tested by child development experts. \n\nSafety and convenience. No supervision needed: \n ► Parental Gate - Code protected sections so that your child doesn’t accidentally change settings or make unwanted purchases; \n ► Offline - playable without an internet connection;\n ► Timely hints - so your child doesn't feel frustrated or lost in the app; \n ► Ads free - no annoying interruptions.\n\nApp's 500+ learning games provide safe and useful screen time for your 2-4 year old boys and girls.\n\nWho says learning can't be fun?"

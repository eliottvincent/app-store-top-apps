It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

You can even see your progress on increasing the intervals in the app.\n\nLEARN GRAMMAR IN CONTEXT OR AS A FOCUS\nAcquire grammar passively (inductive learning) like a native with our bite-sized sentences, or practice conjugating French verbs in our French course.\n\nSPECIALIST VOCABULARY FOR YOU\nSubmit your own words, images, or text and Lingvist will automatically gather vocabulary related to the theme for you to learn. Whether it’s Harry Potter in German, French nuclear physics, or Spanish colors, you can learn the words most important to you (available in some courses).\n\nMOTIVATIONAL STATISTICS\nPacked with data on your learning progress, you’ll be able to chart your path to success.\n\nA MUST-HAVE TOOL IN YOUR BAG\nDo you live in your target country, use a tutor or language school, or even read books, listen to podcasts, or watch content in your target language? Lingvist works best when used in parallel with other learning methods. It’s the difference between passing your test or acing it.\n\nLEARN BY DOING\nYou will learn vocabulary or conjugations (available in some courses) by “guessing” the answer. Getting it wrong is one of the fastest ways to learn, and your brain will start to remember very quickly.\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe playlist feature lets you listen to bite-sized sentences in hands-free mode.\n\nPERSONALIZED SETTINGS\nEvery learner is different. Personalize your learning to suit you, with various settings allowing you to learn with extra slow speech, strict diacritics, and even grammar tables.\n\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING PLAN\nWe'll serve you new words that are most relevant to you. As we measure your memory curves, we ask you to repeat words at the optimal time – just before you forget them. This way, you'll always know what to learn next.\n\nLANGUAGE LEARNING MADE EASY\nWhether you are planning on spending this summer in Italy and need to learn Italian, or your next adventure is taking up a course in Germany and you need an app to learn German, we have you covered. Our language learning techniques will help you to get fluent in over 9 languages.\n\n=====\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to the full learning materials for all languages we offer.

It is the smartest way to perfect your English, and learn every word that matters while enjoying the process!\r\n\r\nWordUp helps you to build a MAP of your KNOWLEDGE. Every word you know, and every word you don't. All 25,000 useful English words are ranked in the order of IMPORTANCE, and USEFULNESS, based on how often they are used in real-world spoken English (extracted from thousands of movies, and TV shows).\r\n\r\nBy creating your Knowledge Map in WordUp, you constantly discover the most valuable next word to learn that you don't know yet, and focus on learning them in that order. It's the smartest way to spend your time learning!\r\n\r\nTo actually learn the words that you discover in your Knowledge Map, WordUp gives you everything you need, and more! From word definitions and pictures to tens of entertaining examples from movies, quotes, news, and more. So you get a good feel of how to use each word in context. There are also translations in more than 30 languages including French, Spanish, German, Arabic, Turkish, Persian, ...\r\n\r\nThe daily reviews then kick in. Like flashcards, the words will come back with games and challenges until you master them. It's called Spaced Repetition, and it's scientifically proven to help memorise them forever!\r\n\r\nWordUp is unlike any vocabulary builder app you've seen before. It is not another dictionary app, although it can be used as an English dictionary too. \r\n\r\nWordUp's novel approach to language learning and expanding your vocabulary will leave you feeling confident and empowered. Whether you are new to English, are preparing for an English exam (IELTS, TOEFL, etc), or are a native English speaker, you will find WordUp helpful and entertaining. Just give it a try and see for yourself!"

Далеко не всем легко дается домашнее задание, поэтому мы, как родители, решили создать решебник, который будет надежной опорой для вас и вашего ребенка в решении задач и прочих заботах, связанных со школьными заданиями.\n\nПриложение Skysmart Решения устроено таким образом, чтобы любой школьник мог найти GDZ по нужному предмету в считанные секунды. Тогда как многие приложения и сайты для учебы предлагают скачать ГДЗ, наш решебник поможет найти ГДЗ по фото учебника – примеры по математике, задачи по математике, их решения и найти готовые задания по английскому.\n\nРЕШЕНИЯ ДЛЯ ВСЕХ КЛАССОВ\n\nВ этом году Skysmart Решения появились и в начальной школе. Теперь ГДЗ по математике, по геометрии, ГДЗ по русскому и ГДЗ по английскому доступны без дополнительного скачивания для учеников всех классов — с 1 по 11. \n\nБОЛЬШИНСТВО ШКОЛЬНЫХ УЧЕБНИКОВ\n\nВ решебник постоянно добавляются популярные учебники и предметы. Сейчас в приложении есть такие топовые авторы: \n\nМатематика: Мерзляк, Виленкин, Никольский, Дорофеев\nАлгебра: Мерзляк, Макарычев, Алимов, Мордкович, Миндюк, Виленкин\nРусский: Ладыженская, Бархударов, Разумовская, Гольцова, Баранов, Рыбченкова\nГеометрия: Атанасян, Бутузов, Мерзляк, Погорелов\nАнглийский: Ваулина, Афанасьева, Биболетова, Вербицкая, Кузовлев\n\nПРОСТОЙ И ПОНЯТНЫЙ ИНТЕРФЕЙС\n\nРешебник Skysmart Решения — это новый подход к учебе и образованию в целом. Мы хотели, чтобы школьники могли пользоваться им без особых усилий.\n\n· Никаких лишних настроек. Все, что нужно — это смартфон и учебник\n· Делайте фото задания прямо в приложении\n· Алгоритм найдет ГДЗ по фото в течение нескольких секунд\n· Помощник поможет найти решение заданий школьной программы\n\nНЕ ПРОСТО СБОРНИК ОТВЕТОВ\n\nSkysmart Решения поможет не только найти правильные ответы, но и поспособствует закреплению знаний.\n\n· Наш решебник поможет понять, почему конкретное решение правильно, и почему предложения строятся так, а не иначе\n· Ваш ребенок научится решать примеры по математике\n· Ребенок станет допускать меньше орфографических ошибок\n· Ваш школьник подтянет свои знания английского языка.\n\nПолитика конфиденциальности — https://go.skysmart.ru/edu-privacy-policy-ios\nПользовательское соглашение — https://go.skysmart.ru/edu-terms-of-use\nРазработчик приложения: https://resh.skysmart.ru/"

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

The depth of our courses combined with the latest research in machine learning gets you using a language with high proficiency, fast.\n\nGET LEVEL PLACED FOR FREE - TRY LINGVIST\n\nLEARN 10 LANGUAGES: English, German, French, Dutch, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Estonian and Russian.\n\n=====\n\nWHY LINGVIST?\n\nFOLLOW CONVERSATIONS QUICKLY\nLearn the vocabulary that appears most often in a language first, allowing you to accelerate your learning.\n\nREAD, WRITE, SPEAK, AND LISTEN\nPerfect your pronunciation using sophisticated speech recognition technology or type your answers. Every sentence has audio to ensure you hone your listening skills.\n\nFOR SERIOUS LEARNERS\nYour learning efficiency is our focus. Enjoy a clean UI with no advertising, no unnecessary clicks, and no distractions.\n\nREMEMBER A LANGUAGE FOREVER\nUsing scientifically proven spaced repetition methodology, the vocabulary gets fixed in your long-term memory over time. You can even see your progress on increasing the intervals in the app.\n\nLEARN GRAMMAR IN CONTEXT OR AS A FOCUS\nAcquire grammar passively (inductive learning) like a native with our bite-sized sentences, or practice conjugating French verbs in our French course.\n\nSPECIALIST VOCABULARY FOR YOU\nSubmit your own words, images, or text and Lingvist will automatically gather vocabulary related to the theme for you to learn. Whether it’s Harry Potter in German, French nuclear physics, or Spanish colors, you can learn the words most important to you (available in some courses).\n\nMOTIVATIONAL STATISTICS\nPacked with data on your learning progress, you’ll be able to chart your path to success.\n\nA MUST-HAVE TOOL IN YOUR BAG\nDo you live in your target country, use a tutor or language school, or even read books, listen to podcasts, or watch content in your target language? Lingvist works best when used in parallel with other learning methods. It’s the difference between passing your test or acing it.\n\nLEARN BY DOING\nYou will learn vocabulary or conjugations (available in some courses) by “guessing” the answer. Getting it wrong is one of the fastest ways to learn, and your brain will start to remember very quickly.\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe playlist feature lets you listen to bite-sized sentences in hands-free mode.\n\nPERSONALIZED SETTINGS\nEvery learner is different. Personalize your learning to suit you, with various settings allowing you to learn with extra slow speech, strict diacritics, and even grammar tables.\n\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING PLAN\nWe'll serve you new words that are most relevant to you. As we measure your memory curves, we ask you to repeat words at the optimal time – just before you forget them. This way, you'll always know what to learn next.\n\nLANGUAGE LEARNING MADE EASY\nWhether you are planning on spending this summer in Italy and need to learn Italian, or your next adventure is taking up a course in Germany and you need an app to learn German, we have you covered. Our language learning techniques will help you to get fluent in over 9 languages.\n\n=====\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to the full learning materials for all languages we offer. Each subscription will be automatically renewed unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current payment period.

Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

All you need is a good connection and time to spare.\n\nTalk to native speakers\nThe app also includes Skyeng Talks - 15-minute classes with native speakers.

We call these interactive mobile rallies “Bounds”, essentially a collection of diverse tasks, e.g., taking pictures, dancing, playing a game etc., linked to a specific location. \n\nThe program quite literally augments our reality by enhancing peoples’ real-life interaction whilst using their smart phones and tablets. Apart from the altruistic goal of helping people to discover “their environment by learning more about its history, politics and culture”, the free app is payable for corporate clients, who can use Actionbound for team-building events and the likes.\n\nActionbound is an interactive app-based game approach for smart phones and tablets: Players are invited to accomplish tasks, which can be defined through the so-called Bound-Creator on the website actionbound.com, in order to playfully discover their environment by learning more about its history, politics and culture. In contrast to a geo-cache or a scavenger hunt Actionbound requires the players to create their own content."

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

Human Design is a new science that gives you your unique roadmap to becoming that real version of self and from there, everything flows. There is a reason why following other people's plans and advice doesn't 100% work for you - because you were designed differently than them.

You’ll be speaking English in no time without having to memorize lists of words and out-of-context grammar rules. \n\n\n\nIMMERSE IN REAL ENGLISH\n\nYou’ll make your way through an interactive and engaging story that takes place in New York. Lively, colorful, and sometimes surprising characters: an eccentric old lady will help you find a place to live, and a greedy hot-dog vendor who will try to short-change… They (and many more) speak different accents and will help you master street talk. There’s a new surprise around every corner, but Let Me Speak will help you talk your way out of any situation.\n\nEverything is in modern, everyday English with a full audio voiceover by native speakers from the United States. So you’ll learn real-world English and practice American pronunciation from the get-go. Each conversation takes no more than 3 minutes and will fit into even the busiest of schedules.\n\n\n\n\nIMPROVE YOUR VOCABULARY\n\nYou’ll learn 6,000 of the most common words everyone needs to travel, work, and communicate in a foreign language. Each new word comes with a translation and a memorable illustration.\nYou’ll learn new words every day. And with the spaced repetition, smart reminders, and clever associations, you won’t forget them. \n\n\nYou also get to practice your new vocabulary right away in conversations that recreate real-life situations. Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations. Built-in games will challenge your skill and speed – you can even compete with other users around the world in real-time!"

It utilises multiple senses for learning: you will learn Spanish, English or another language of your choice by listening, reading, looking at pictures, writing and speaking. \n\nWordDive also optimises learning pace and study items individually for you.

Students preparing for matriculation exams have also improved their results with WordDive. In other words, just set your goal – whether it's the basics or higher level skills – and WordDive can help you. \n\nOur courses are based on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), which is a widely known skill level scale for foreign languages. With WordDive, you can keep track of your progress and collect trophies in real time.

Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

      "label": "Lingvist is the language learning app built by scientists and language experts that teaches vocabulary better than anyone else in the world. The depth of our courses combined with the latest research in machine learning gets you using a language with high proficiency, fast.\n\nGET LEVEL PLACED FOR FREE - TRY LINGVIST\n\nLEARN 10 LANGUAGES: English, German, French, Dutch, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Estonian, Japanese and Russian.\n\n=====\n\nWHY LINGVIST?\n\nFOLLOW CONVERSATIONS QUICKLY\nLearn the vocabulary that appears most often in a language first, allowing you to accelerate your learning.\n\nREAD, WRITE, SPEAK, AND LISTEN\nPerfect your pronunciation using sophisticated speech recognition technology or type your answers. Every sentence has audio to ensure you hone your listening skills.\n\nFOR SERIOUS LEARNERS\nYour learning efficiency is our focus. Enjoy a clean UI with no advertising, no unnecessary clicks, and no distractions.\n\nREMEMBER A LANGUAGE FOREVER\nUsing scientifically proven spaced repetition methodology, the vocabulary gets fixed in your long-term memory over time. You can even see your progress on increasing the intervals in the app.\n\nLEARN GRAMMAR IN CONTEXT OR AS A FOCUS\nAcquire grammar passively (inductive learning) like a native with our bite-sized sentences, or practice conjugating French verbs in our French course.\n\nSPECIALIST VOCABULARY FOR YOU\nSubmit your own words, images, or text and Lingvist will automatically gather vocabulary related to the theme for you to learn. Whether it’s Harry Potter in German or Spanish colors, you can learn the words most important to you (available in some courses).\n\nMOTIVATIONAL STATISTICS\nPacked with data on your learning progress, you’ll be able to chart your path to success.\n\nA MUST-HAVE TOOL IN YOUR BAG\nDo you live in your target country, use a tutor or language school, or even read books, listen to podcasts, or watch content in your target language? Lingvist works best when used in parallel with other learning methods. It’s the difference between passing your test or acing it.\n\nLEARN BY DOING\nYou will learn vocabulary or conjugations (available in some courses) by “guessing” the answer. Getting it wrong is one of the fastest ways to learn, and your brain will start to remember very quickly.\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe playlist feature lets you listen to bite-sized sentences in hands-free mode.\n\nPERSONALIZED SETTINGS\nEvery learner is different. Personalize your learning to suit you, with various settings allowing you to learn with extra slow speech, strict diacritics, and even grammar tables.\n\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING PLAN\nWe'll serve you new words that are most relevant to you. As we measure your memory curves, we ask you to repeat words at the optimal time – just before you forget them. This way, you'll always know what to learn next.\n\nLANGUAGE LEARNING MADE EASY\nWhether you are planning on spending this summer in Italy and need to learn Italian, or your next adventure is taking up a course in Germany and you need an app to learn German, we have you covered. Our language learning techniques will help you to get fluent in over 9 languages.\n\n=====\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to the full learning materials for all languages we offer. Each subscription will be automatically renewed unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current payment period. When a subscription is canceled, access to the app's courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nVisit our blog to get tips, tricks, and interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Lingvist blog: https://lingvist.com/blog/\n\nFollow us to get interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/theLingvist\n▸▸ Instagram: instagram.com/thelingvist/\n▸▸ Twitter: https://twitter.com/lingvist\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://lingvist.com/privacy-policy/\nTerms of Use: https://lingvist.com/tos/"

This software is developed by Kazunori Asada (Ph.D. medical science and Ph.D. media design), based on the research in color science.\n\nAbout 5% of men have difficulty distinguishing red and green, or recognizing dark red. Such color deficiency can be classified into three major categories: protanope / Protanomal, Deuteranope / Deuteranomal and Tritanope / Tritanomal.\n\nColor deficiencies are the inability to tell differences between some colors other people can easily distinguish. People with different types of color vision deficiency perceive colors differently. For example, individuals diagnosed as Protan or Deutan cannot perceive differences between red and green, and pink and cyan.\n\nThese color visions are predictable by calculating working of the cone cells that perceives the color to some degree.\n\n\"Chromatic Vision Simulator\" makes simulated images of each color vision type from built-in Camera or Photos and shows you how people with specific types of color vision sees the world in real-time."

      "label": "The N-Back Challenge provides a special type of cognitive training, “dual n-back,” that helps you raise your IQ in just a few minutes per day. Sounds implausible? The N-Back Challenge is based on a decade’s worth of scientific studies, published in top peer-reviewed journals, including Nature. (For more details, see https://nbackchallenge.com/science.) \n\nThe catch? It’s no fun at all! Indeed, the training is designed to be maximally exhausting. If you are determined enough to make it through 20 sessions, however, science suggests that you stand to reap powerful benefits. \n\nIntelligence is the ultimate cognitive ability: You need it to learn, reason, solve novel problems, and see connections. Higher IQs have been linked to improved academic achievement, professional success, and even better health. Since it will take you just 7 hours, in total, to complete the N-Back Challenge, not much more than the length of a single school day, it may prove to be the best investment of time you’ve ever made!\n\n\n\nSCIENTIFICALLY SOUND: Not only has the dual n-back paradigm been validated in top peer-reviewed journals, but our two founders – both PhDs, one with a focus on neuroscience, the other with a focus on higher education – have taken particular care to thoroughly align the app with the prevailing scientific research.\n\nTRACK YOUR PROGRESS: In order to help you stay motivated, the N-Back Challenge allows you to visually monitor your progress over time, build up “streaks,” and compare yourself against other learners across various stats.\n\n\n\nCOMPETE AGAINST YOUR FRIENDS: Perhaps the most powerful way of making sure you remain motivated to complete the Challenge is to tackle it together with friends or colleagues. To make it more fun, we’ve provided leaderboards that allow you to compete based on who has completed the most sessions, racked up the longest streak, and more. \n\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR EXPERIENCE: The N-Back Challenge allows you to choose between different voices across multiple languages, turn on notifications, and customize their timing and style. There are advanced settings for turning on instant button feedback, controlling the n-back level, and tweaking the game speed. And if you are too busy to complete one session every day, you may switch to the Weekly Habit, which gives you a full week to complete each session.\n\n\n\nARE YOU…\n\n… A PARENT? Give your children an edge at school or university by nudging them to complete the N-Back Challenge. Indeed, why not tackle the Challenge together as a family?  \n\n… A GRANDCHILD? Help your grandparents (and other older relatives) fight cognitive decline by introducing them to dual n-back. (See https://nbackchallenge.com/decline.) \n\n… A KNOWLEDGE WORKER? Share the N-Back Challenge with your HR department. Dual n-back may well be the single most cost-effective way of making knowledge workers more productive. (See https://nbackchallenge.com/work.)  \n\n… A TEACHER? Prepare your students for a world of rapid technological change by using dual n-back to hone their problem-solving skills. You can have a big impact, with a minimal investment of time! (See https://nbackchallenge.com/class.)\n\n\n\nHOW IT WORKS: The N-Back Challenge is free as long as you stick to the program. When you miss or delay a session, we ask you to support us with a “coffee,” which you can buy in-app or earn — for example, by using the Share link in the Settings to invite friends. (Each of you will receive a free coffee.) You can also unlock unlimited free breaks by buying us a “pizza.” \n\nCUSTOMER SUPPORT: Do you have any questions or suggestions? Feel an inexplicable urge to vent your frustrations about the difficulty of dual n-back? Like to say hello? We’re happy to hear from you! Just drop us a note at support@nbackchallenge.com.\n\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES: To learn more about dual n-back and the N-Back Challenge, browse our repository of articles at https://nbackchallenge.com/articles."

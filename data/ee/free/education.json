The depth of our courses combined with the latest research in machine learning gets you using a language with high proficiency, fast.\n\nGET LEVEL PLACED FOR FREE - TRY LINGVIST\n\nLEARN 10 LANGUAGES: English, German, French, Dutch, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Estonian and Russian.\n\n=====\n\nWHY LINGVIST?\n\nFOLLOW CONVERSATIONS QUICKLY\nLearn the vocabulary that appears most often in a language first, allowing you to accelerate your learning.\n\nREAD, WRITE, SPEAK, AND LISTEN\nPerfect your pronunciation using sophisticated speech recognition technology or type your answers. Every sentence has audio to ensure you hone your listening skills.\n\nFOR SERIOUS LEARNERS\nYour learning efficiency is our focus. Enjoy a clean UI with no advertising, no unnecessary clicks, and no distractions.\n\nREMEMBER A LANGUAGE FOREVER\nUsing scientifically proven spaced repetition methodology, the vocabulary gets fixed in your long-term memory over time. You can even see your progress on increasing the intervals in the app.\n\nLEARN GRAMMAR IN CONTEXT OR AS A FOCUS\nAcquire grammar passively (inductive learning) like a native with our bite-sized sentences, or practice conjugating French verbs in our French course.\n\nSPECIALIST VOCABULARY FOR YOU\nSubmit your own words, images, or text and Lingvist will automatically gather vocabulary related to the theme for you to learn. Whether it’s Harry Potter in German, French nuclear physics, or Spanish colors, you can learn the words most important to you (available in some courses).\n\nMOTIVATIONAL STATISTICS\nPacked with data on your learning progress, you’ll be able to chart your path to success.\n\nA MUST-HAVE TOOL IN YOUR BAG\nDo you live in your target country, use a tutor or language school, or even read books, listen to podcasts, or watch content in your target language? Lingvist works best when used in parallel with other learning methods. It’s the difference between passing your test or acing it.\n\nLEARN BY DOING\nYou will learn vocabulary or conjugations (available in some courses) by “guessing” the answer. Getting it wrong is one of the fastest ways to learn, and your brain will start to remember very quickly.\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe playlist feature lets you listen to bite-sized sentences in hands-free mode.\n\nPERSONALIZED SETTINGS\nEvery learner is different. Personalize your learning to suit you, with various settings allowing you to learn with extra slow speech, strict diacritics, and even grammar tables.\n\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING PLAN\nWe'll serve you new words that are most relevant to you. As we measure your memory curves, we ask you to repeat words at the optimal time – just before you forget them. This way, you'll always know what to learn next.\n\nLANGUAGE LEARNING MADE EASY\nWhether you are planning on spending this summer in Italy and need to learn Italian, or your next adventure is taking up a course in Germany and you need an app to learn German, we have you covered. Our language learning techniques will help you to get fluent in over 9 languages.\n\n=====\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to the full learning materials for all languages we offer. Each subscription will be automatically renewed unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current payment period. When a subscription is canceled, access to the app's courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nVisit our blog to get tips, tricks, and interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Lingvist blog: https://lingvist.com/blog/\n\nFollow us to get interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/theLingvist\n▸▸ Instagram: instagram.com/thelingvist/\n▸▸ Twitter: https://twitter.com/lingvist\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://lingvist.com/privacy-policy/\nTerms of Use: https://lingvist.com/tos/"

      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

You'll always have Mendeleev's Periodic Table and Solubility table handy. And even the calculator of molar masses!\n\nThe app can find the equations of chemical reactions even if the right or left part is unknown, it helps you with organic and inorganic chemistry. The discovered reactions will be displayed in a usual and ionic form. Organic chemistry formulas are drawn as images by the app.\n\nConvenient interactive Periodic Table. Tap a chemical element in the table to find more information about it. Use a search button to find an element by name or symbol.\n\nThe calculator of molar masses. Enter a chemical compound correctly and it will show molar masses and percentages of elements.\n\nThe table of solubility of substances is added in the app as well as Acid strength chart. Now your textbooks become waste!\n\nThe best solver of chemical equations for iPhone and iPad.\n\nAdd new shiny Widgets to the desktop and learn information about chemical elements from Periodic Table subconsciously. It's a fun way to learn and remember chemical elements data.\n\nAll these tables and charts are available in the free Chemistry app:\n* Periodic table\n* Atoms in Augmented Reality\n* Chemical reactions search\n* Offline access to information about chemical elements\n* Solubility table\n* Molar mass calculator\n* Electronegativity of elements\n* Molecular weights of organic substances\n* Reactivity series\n* Acid strengths chart\n* Acids, anions, salts list\n* Standard electrode potential\n* Widgets to easily remember the periodic table and chemical elements\n\nThe chemistry falls into to number of the most important sciences and is one of the main school objects. Its studying begins with the Periodic Table. Interactive approach to a training material is more effective than classical. As in it technologies which became the family for the modern pupils are used.\n\nThe periodic table of elements is one of the most important tools in chemistry. The periodic table is essential for understanding the structure and behavior of atoms and molecules. It also provides a useful framework for predicting the properties of new and unknown elements.\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\nTerms of Use: http://getchemistry.io/terms-and-conditions/ios/\nPrivacy policy: http://getchemistry.io/privacy-policy/ios/"

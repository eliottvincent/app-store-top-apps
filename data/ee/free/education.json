The depth of our courses combined with the latest research in machine learning gets you using a language with high proficiency, fast.\n\nGET LEVEL PLACED FOR FREE - TRY LINGVIST\n\nLEARN 10 LANGUAGES: English, German, French, Dutch, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Estonian, Japanese and Russian.\n\n=====\n\nWHY LINGVIST?\n\nFOLLOW CONVERSATIONS QUICKLY\nLearn the vocabulary that appears most often in a language first, allowing you to accelerate your learning.\n\nREAD, WRITE, SPEAK, AND LISTEN\nPerfect your pronunciation using sophisticated speech recognition technology or type your answers. Every sentence has audio to ensure you hone your listening skills.\n\nFOR SERIOUS LEARNERS\nYour learning efficiency is our focus. Enjoy a clean UI with no advertising, no unnecessary clicks, and no distractions.\n\nREMEMBER A LANGUAGE FOREVER\nUsing scientifically proven spaced repetition methodology, the vocabulary gets fixed in your long-term memory over time. You can even see your progress on increasing the intervals in the app.\n\nLEARN GRAMMAR IN CONTEXT OR AS A FOCUS\nAcquire grammar passively (inductive learning) like a native with our bite-sized sentences, or practice conjugating French verbs in our French course.\n\nSPECIALIST VOCABULARY FOR YOU\nSubmit your own words, images, or text and Lingvist will automatically gather vocabulary related to the theme for you to learn. Whether it’s Harry Potter in German or Spanish colors, you can learn the words most important to you (available in some courses).\n\nMOTIVATIONAL STATISTICS\nPacked with data on your learning progress, you’ll be able to chart your path to success.\n\nA MUST-HAVE TOOL IN YOUR BAG\nDo you live in your target country, use a tutor or language school, or even read books, listen to podcasts, or watch content in your target language? Lingvist works best when used in parallel with other learning methods. It’s the difference between passing your test or acing it.\n\nLEARN BY DOING\nYou will learn vocabulary or conjugations (available in some courses) by “guessing” the answer. Getting it wrong is one of the fastest ways to learn, and your brain will start to remember very quickly.\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe playlist feature lets you listen to bite-sized sentences in hands-free mode.\n\nPERSONALIZED SETTINGS\nEvery learner is different. Personalize your learning to suit you, with various settings allowing you to learn with extra slow speech, strict diacritics, and even grammar tables.\n\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING PLAN\nWe'll serve you new words that are most relevant to you. As we measure your memory curves, we ask you to repeat words at the optimal time – just before you forget them. This way, you'll always know what to learn next.\n\nLANGUAGE LEARNING MADE EASY\nWhether you are planning on spending this summer in Italy and need to learn Italian, or your next adventure is taking up a course in Germany and you need an app to learn German, we have you covered. Our language learning techniques will help you to get fluent in over 9 languages.\n\n=====\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to the full learning materials for all languages we offer. Each subscription will be automatically renewed unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current payment period. When a subscription is canceled, access to the app's courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nVisit our blog to get tips, tricks, and interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Lingvist blog: https://lingvist.com/blog/\n\nFollow us to get interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/theLingvist\n▸▸ Instagram: instagram.com/thelingvist/\n▸▸ Twitter: https://twitter.com/lingvist\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://lingvist.com/privacy-policy/\nTerms of Use: https://lingvist.com/tos/"

You’ll be speaking English in no time without having to memorize lists of words and out-of-context grammar rules. \n\n\n\nIMMERSE IN REAL ENGLISH\n\nYou’ll make your way through an interactive and engaging story that takes place in New York. Lively, colorful, and sometimes surprising characters: an eccentric old lady will help you find a place to live, and a greedy hot-dog vendor who will try to short-change… They (and many more) speak different accents and will help you master street talk. There’s a new surprise around every corner, but Let Me Speak will help you talk your way out of any situation.\n\nEverything is in modern, everyday English with a full audio voiceover by native speakers from the United States. So you’ll learn real-world English and practice American pronunciation from the get-go. Each conversation takes no more than 3 minutes and will fit into even the busiest of schedules.\n\n\n\n\nIMPROVE YOUR VOCABULARY\n\nYou’ll learn 6,000 of the most common words everyone needs to travel, work, and communicate in a foreign language. Each new word comes with a translation and a memorable illustration.\nYou’ll learn new words every day. And with the spaced repetition, smart reminders, and clever associations, you won’t forget them. \n\n\nYou also get to practice your new vocabulary right away in conversations that recreate real-life situations. Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations.

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

ПО ПЕСНЯМ!\n- БЫСТРЫЙ результат на 3-й день занятий;\n- ПОДАРОК – аудио курс о секретах языка!\n\nПОДХОД К ОБУЧЕНИЮ\n\n1) Сначала, тренируем органы слуха и речи:\n    - Учим слышать английскую речь;\n    - Учим говорить правильно и красиво;\nМы предоставим для обучения диктора с ярким и стильным произношением. Его выбрали такие компании как: Cisco, Costa Coffee, eBay, Microsoft, Twitter, Western Union (для презентации своих продуктов на международном уровне). Именно с ним ты будешь ставить и свое произношение!\n\n2) Потом, подготовим мозг к запоминанию и воспроизведению информации на английском языке:\n    - Ты быстро освоишь технику на простом, но крайне необходимом: алфавит, цифры, дни недели, цвета…\nИзучив этот материал тебе будет легко:\n    - правильно диктовать свой e-mail, Ф.И.О. (при регистрации в отеле, в аэропорту…);\n    - покупать товары/услуги (торговаться), договариваться о скидках и о стоимости поездки на такси;\n    - у тебя не будет паники если в аэропорту объявят посадку на самолет, но изменится номер выхода на посадку.\n\n3) И в третьих, погрузим в английскую среду естественным образом:\n    - ты будешь легко запоминать фразы (именно фразы) любой сложности.\nТ.к. на предыдущих двух этапах ты подготовил(а) свой мозг, речевой и слуховой аппараты для английской речи. Ты сможешь не задумываясь и с легкостью произносить нужные фразы. Твой английский будет беглым, таким же как у носителя языка!\n\n\nБЛИЖАЙШИЙ РЕЗУЛЬТАТ\n\nУже на 3-ий день занятий ты будешь понимать на слух слова в песнях, которые раньше ты знал(а), но не мог(ла) их распознать. Результат удивит тебя своим эффективным воздействием. Его сложно описать, но это будет так, как если человек с плохим зрением наденет очки или контактные линзы.\n\nКогда приступишь к изучению фраз, ты будешь произносить выученные без напряжения, легко и бегло так, как если бы ты прожил(а) в англоговорящей стране более 5 лет (и это не преувеличение). \n\nСредняя скорость усвоения – 50 ФРАЗ в неделю. Хочется подчеркнуть, что это именно ФРАЗЫ (готовые смысловые предложения). Это то, как мы говорим в обычной жизни. Именно фразы являются единицей измерения владения речью, а не количество выученных слов (ведь слова еще нужно в правильной последовательности и в правильном их сочетании друг с другом составить в фразу). А ты уже сразу будешь осваивать фразы! 50 ФРАЗ в неделю это отличный результат. Для сравнения, когда я готовил своих друзей к загранпоездке, то на мое удивление им в отпуске потребовалось всего 36 фраз.\n\nЕсли вам понравился подход к обучению приложения DiveEng.pro, то вы можете оформить платную автовозобновляемую подписку.\nСумма будет списана с вашего аккаунта iTunes после подтверждения покупки.\nПодписка автоматически возобновляется, если автоматическое продление не будет выключено как минимум за 24 часа до окончания срока действия текущей подписки.\nВы можете управлять подпиской и отключить автоматическое обновление, зайдя в настройки своей учетной записи пользователя iTunes после покупки.\n\nБолее подробно об условиях использования (terms of use) и политике конфиденциальности (privacy policy) можно узнать здесь:\nhttp://www.diveeng.pro/assets/mlicenseagreement.pdf\nhttp://www.diveeng.pro/assets/mprivacypolicy.pdf\n\n\nМы в соц. сетях:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DiveEng.pro\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DiveEngPro\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+DiveengProOfficial/about\nВКонтакте: https://vk.com/diveeng_pro\nОдноклассники: http://ok.ru/group/54999219306520\nYoutube: http://www.youtube.com/c/DiveengProOfficial\n\nОбратная связь: info@diveeng.pro\nВеб-сайт: www.diveeng.pro"

Kui kõik kollid on oma kodus, saab laps hambaarsti käest Suukooli kingituse.\n\n*Lapsevanem, kui paned lapsele hambaarsti visiidi aega, siis veendu, et hambaarstil on Suukooli kingitus olemas.  \n\nMida saab teha Suukooli äpis?\n  • Loo omanäoline kasutaja igale pereliikmele\n  • Õpi õigeid hambapesu võtteid\n  • Hoia pilk peal hambapesukalendril\n  • Õpi Suukollidelt, kuidas suutervise eest õigesti hoolt kanda\n  • Saa meeldetuletusi, millal hambaid pesta, hambaarsti külastada ja kulunud hambahari välja vahetada\n\n\n\nИнтересное, веселое и обучающее приложение для чистки зубов поможет сформировать привычку чистить зубы два раза в день. Создайте учетную запись для каждого члена семьи, чтобы сделать ежедневную чистку зубов более увлекательной. В процессе вы познакомитесь с забавными Зубными Троллями, которые научат вас правильно заботиться зубах. Если ребенок открывает приложение во время утренней и вечерней чистки и чистит зубы с обучающим видео или песней Чистых зубов, он освобождает зубы от Зубных Троллей. Когда все Тролли будут отправлены  в своё логово, ребенок получит подарок от Suukool во время визита к зубному врачу.\n\n* Родитель, когда будете бронировать время визита к врачу, убедитесь, что у него есть подарок от Suukool.\n\nЧто можно сделать в приложении Suukool?\n    •  Создайте уникального пользователя для каждого члена семьи\n    •  Научитесь правильной технике чистки\n    •  Следите за календарем чистки зубов\n    •  Учитесь у Зубных Троллей, как правильно заботиться о здоровье зубов\n    •  Получайте напоминания о необходимости почистить зубы, обратиться к стоматологу и заменить зубную щетку."

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

On the ‘Multikey Map’ you can also find events and places nearby to socialize and practice languages there.\n\n You can find language practice partners, learn and practice languages on mobile from anywhere, at any time.\n\nThe purpose of the app is to easily find a language partner both locally and globally. The algorithm will filter for your interests and your location: a map updated in real-time will show anyone nearby willing to talk at that moment.\n\nThe creators of this project invite businesses and service networks to join the platform (multikey.app@gmail.com). We also invite NGO-s that unite retired seniors, people with special needs, stay-at-home parents with small children - everyone who is currently not on the labour market and has free time, to both discover and share languages with those who are ready and willing to study."

WordDive has users in over 150 countries, and according to a customer survey conducted in 2017, 96% of WordDive users recommend it. Start now. You will get hooked!\n\nHow does WordDive work?\n\nLearning with WordDive is based on the WordDive Method, created by dozens of language learning experts, engineers, psychologists and user interface developers. It utilises multiple senses for learning: you will learn Spanish, English or another language of your choice by listening, reading, looking at pictures, writing and speaking. \n\nWordDive also optimises learning pace and study items individually for you. This means you will really remember the words and grammar you have learned permanently. Permanent learning frees you to have fluent conversations in your new language. Words will come out naturally, and you won't have to struggle to remember a specific word.\n\nWho can benefit from WordDive?\n\nWordDive is suitable for anyone: child or adult, beginner or advanced. Whether you want to learn the basics of Spanish or French for a trip abroad or hone your English skills for work, WordDive is the right choice. Students preparing for matriculation exams have also improved their results with WordDive. In other words, just set your goal – whether it's the basics or higher level skills – and WordDive can help you. \n\nOur courses are based on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), which is a widely known skill level scale for foreign languages. With WordDive, you can keep track of your progress and collect trophies in real time. WordDive will also remember your progress – when you change to another iOS device or a computer, you can pick up from where you left off.\n\nPlease note\n\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to all of this app’s courses and features.\n\nPayment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.

      "label": "Did you know that memory loss is not an inevitable consequence of growing older?\n\nThe key to maintaining function is neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is the mechanism by which the brain adapts both structurally and functionally to its environment and occurs throughout life, from early childhood to later in life and even in those with neurodegenerative disorders. In the case of EpicMem© we’ve created a simple and fun game that will stimulate areas of the brain involved in a type of memory known as Episodic Memory.\n\nScientists believe being mentally active can increase the threshold from which your brain function declines later in life, that’s to say the starting point from which you deteriorate. The structural and function changes (neuroplasticity) can provide alternate pathways for memories to be formed and retrieved and this is often referred to as cognitive reserve/resilience.\n\nIn summary, the extent to which your memory declines in later life can depend on how much cognitive reserve you have. Changes in memory are preceded by neuronal loss long before symptoms become evident, and so building memory reserve early on and through-out your life is of crucial importance to maintaining function later on.\n\nEpicMem© is a simple and fun game designed by a neuroscientist. It trains Episodic Memory using Paired Associated Learning, a classical memory paradigm used in memory research, neuropsychological tests and brain-training.\n\nEpisodic Memory typically declines with age, but this is even more pronounced in people with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), where deficits in Episodic Memory are the first noticeable sign of AD.\n \nEveryday disruptions in Episodic Memory could have you misplacing your keys, missing appointments, forgetting to take your medication or leaving the cooker on. Poor memory can have an enormous effect on your wellbeing and quality of life. Thus, EpicMem© was designed to focus on training Episodic Memory.\n\nA recent survey showed 2 in 3 people think that dementia may be part of normal ageing, and not a medical condition. Yet making positive lifestyle changes and staying mentally active can be as enjoyable in the immediate as it is worthwhile to your quality of life in the future.\n\nEpicMem’s simple format makes it accessible to all age groups and is particularly likely to appeal to those who enjoy playing memory card games and doing jigsaw puzzles or did so as a child. The Educational App Store recommendations “People of any age can play EpicMem-Brain Training. The puzzle is simple enough for all ages to understand and its presentation is neither aimed at young or old. “\n\nThey also state it can benefit parents in that… “Many games have violence or quick reactions at their heart. EpicMem-Brain Training entertains and occupies without recourse to either of these, which makes it a pleasant alternative to have available on a phone for long journeys and other times when children look for something to occupy themselves.”\n\nThere is a lot of research ongoing in the field of brain training and a growing body of evidence to support certain types of training as safe and affordable ways to maintain mental function."

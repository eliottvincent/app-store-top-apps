It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom.

      "label": "Lingvist is the language learning app built by scientists and language experts that teaches vocabulary better than anyone else in the world. The depth of our courses combined with the latest research in machine learning gets you using a language with high proficiency, fast.\n\nGET LEVEL PLACED FOR FREE - TRY LINGVIST\n\nLEARN 10 LANGUAGES: English, German, French, Dutch, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Estonian, Japanese and Russian.\n\n=====\n\nWHY LINGVIST?\n\nFOLLOW CONVERSATIONS QUICKLY\nLearn the vocabulary that appears most often in a language first, allowing you to accelerate your learning.\n\nREAD, WRITE, SPEAK, AND LISTEN\nPerfect your pronunciation using sophisticated speech recognition technology or type your answers. Every sentence has audio to ensure you hone your listening skills.\n\nFOR SERIOUS LEARNERS\nYour learning efficiency is our focus. Enjoy a clean UI with no advertising, no unnecessary clicks, and no distractions.\n\nREMEMBER A LANGUAGE FOREVER\nUsing scientifically proven spaced repetition methodology, the vocabulary gets fixed in your long-term memory over time. You can even see your progress on increasing the intervals in the app.\n\nLEARN GRAMMAR IN CONTEXT OR AS A FOCUS\nAcquire grammar passively (inductive learning) like a native with our bite-sized sentences, or practice conjugating French verbs in our French course.\n\nSPECIALIST VOCABULARY FOR YOU\nSubmit your own words, images, or text and Lingvist will automatically gather vocabulary related to the theme for you to learn. Whether it’s Harry Potter in German or Spanish colors, you can learn the words most important to you (available in some courses).\n\nMOTIVATIONAL STATISTICS\nPacked with data on your learning progress, you’ll be able to chart your path to success.\n\nA MUST-HAVE TOOL IN YOUR BAG\nDo you live in your target country, use a tutor or language school, or even read books, listen to podcasts, or watch content in your target language? Lingvist works best when used in parallel with other learning methods. It’s the difference between passing your test or acing it.\n\nLEARN BY DOING\nYou will learn vocabulary or conjugations (available in some courses) by “guessing” the answer. Getting it wrong is one of the fastest ways to learn, and your brain will start to remember very quickly.\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe playlist feature lets you listen to bite-sized sentences in hands-free mode.\n\nPERSONALIZED SETTINGS\nEvery learner is different. Personalize your learning to suit you, with various settings allowing you to learn with extra slow speech, strict diacritics, and even grammar tables.\n\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING PLAN\nWe'll serve you new words that are most relevant to you. As we measure your memory curves, we ask you to repeat words at the optimal time – just before you forget them. This way, you'll always know what to learn next.\n\nLANGUAGE LEARNING MADE EASY\nWhether you are planning on spending this summer in Italy and need to learn Italian, or your next adventure is taking up a course in Germany and you need an app to learn German, we have you covered. Our language learning techniques will help you to get fluent in over 9 languages.\n\n=====\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to the full learning materials for all languages we offer. Each subscription will be automatically renewed unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current payment period. When a subscription is canceled, access to the app's courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nVisit our blog to get tips, tricks, and interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Lingvist blog: https://lingvist.com/blog/\n\nFollow us to get interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/theLingvist\n▸▸ Instagram: instagram.com/thelingvist/\n▸▸ Twitter: https://twitter.com/lingvist\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://lingvist.com/privacy-policy/\nTerms of Use: https://lingvist.com/tos/"

Over 1 million bright minds saved more than 14 million ideas in their personal library so far.\n\nIt's like your social media feed, if your social media feed had things that mattered :-)\n\nKnowledge in Deepstash comes in the form of ideas, represented as little cards you can read at a glance. Ideas are short notes that condense profound thoughts into simple sentences. They could be: the best ideas from a book or article, inspiring quotes, practical tips on any topic. Each idea belongs to a topic, from #marketing to #leadership and #philosophy, which you can follow.\n\nIdeas are created by Deepstash members, called stashers. Whenever a stasher reads a book article or listens to a podcast and they find a concept, a thought or quote that is worth saving, remembering and sharing, they will add an idea about it in Deepstash.\n\nA daily source of inspiring & life changing stories and ideas. Read articles, learn skills, get productivity tips and discover life hacks. The magic of Deepstash is that everything you do builds your knowledge library: be it contributing  your own ideas or collecting idea cards from other stashers. Fuel your curiosity and get smarter daily.\n\nPERSONALIZED CONTENT & FEEDS\n\nChoose a few topics of interest (more than 4,000 topics to choose from) and then just use Deepstash at your leisure. As you read and save ideas, we learn what you like and find the best stories, articles, books, podcasts and other top content to show you every day. You don’t even have to work for it.\n\nThe more you save ideas the better we learn what articles and topics you love. We refresh your recommendations multiple times a day so you never run out of fresh ideas.\n\nBUILD AND ORGANIZE YOUR KNOWLEDGE\n\nYou can save ideas in your own profile and build your own library of facts, skills, quotes, information and ideas that matter to you and which you can use at any time.\n\nSearch and filter your ideas and organize your knowledge into personalized stashes, which are basically collections of insights stocked up and ready to go for when you need them: a Powerpoint presentation, a new job interview, a date, a project at work, or negotiating your rent with the landlord.\n\nSHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE\n\nAdd your own ideas and stash them in your knowledge library so you always have them at hand.\n\nShare your own or other ideas you find with your friends and colleagues on Whatsapp or Facebook or send it to your followers on Twitter, Instagram, Linkedin or Quora. The Deepstash bite-sized idea format is great for this. \n\nShare a link to ideas or just an image.

А может планируешь смотреть фильмы или читать в оригинале?\n\nНе важно, собираешься ли ты учить свои первые английские слова, или хочешь пополнить словарный запас - у нас найдётся English для каждого! От тебя требуется лишь немного времени на изучение, а мы сами создадим карточки для запоминания и приправим их определениями с примерами использования (заботливо переведёнными на русский), чтобы у тебя была возможность не только учить язык, но и применять его на практике.\n\nДобавляй, понимай и запоминай новую лексику.\n\nДля того, чтобы учить английские слова или словосочетания, просто выбери список и отправляйся на изучение по карточкам. Если тебе нужен английский для начинающих, у нас есть отдельная категория, а если хочешь прокачать словарный запас, начни с наиболее интересной тебе подборки. Мы стараемся регулярно добавлять списки на самые разные темы, чтобы изучение у каждого пользователя проходило с удовольствием.\n\nЕсли ты хочешь добавить своё слово, начни вводить его и выбери из выпадающего списка. Далее ты увидишь переводы этого слова, отсортированные по частям речи и частоте использования - просто нажимай на нужный(-е). Вот и всё: твой словарь пополнен!\n\nА чтобы пополнить не только словарь, но и активный словарный запас, обязательно нужно знать, как это слово используют носители языка. Нажав на слово из своего словаря, ты можешь прослушать его произношение, а также увидеть, в каких частях речи и в каком значении его можно встретить. Там же ты найдёшь примеры употребления. Если не хочешь заранее знать перевод примера или определения, в настройках можно включить отображение перевода по нажатию.\n\nЗакрепить это слово в памяти и внедрить его в свой словарный запас помогут упражнения и интервальное повторение. Упражнения, кстати, можно настроить и выбрать разные наборы для изучения и для повторения. Ах да, «WordiarY» напомнит тебе, когда придёт время повторить, чтобы изучение не прошло зря.\n\nА теперь вкратце о том, что мы предлагаем:\n- определения и примеры употребления из живого английского языка;\n- перевод определений и примеров для 10000+ слов (маст-хэв для понимания);\n- списки слов для изучения на различные темы как для опытных пользователей, так и для начинающих;\n- актуальные варианты перевода при добавлении слова;\n- настраиваемые упражнения для изучения и повторения (карточки слов, выбор правильного перевода, конструктор слова, аудирование);\n- интервальное повторение на основе кривой забывания Эббингауза;\n- обилие настроек (акцент и пол озвучки, частотность переводов, результаты обучения, возможность скрыть перевод и т.д.); \n- кастомизация карточек и интерфейса.\n\nНу что, «WordiarY» уже ждёт тебя!\nОсталось только нажать кнопку «Загрузить».\n\nТакже ты можешь написать, какой функции не хватает в приложении, или что нуждается в доработке:\nhttps://t.me/wordiary\n\nLet’s learn English together, fellows!"

Use several filters to enhance your photo, making it easier to trace.\n\n- Make real one-of-a-kind artwork you can hang on your wall! Send unique greetings on social media! Friends and family will love to see your animated drawings!\n\n- Show off your skills! Record a video while you draw and share it on your favorite social network. Your friends will be amazed! Choose from time-lapse and regular speeds, and include a narrative if you want to. \n\n- Great for face painting or artistic makeup!\n\n- Great for school projects! Need to draw an image from a book on a poster? Trace it!\n\n- Kick-start your painting or portrait! Transfer your idea from a photo to your drawing canvas to get the proportions right.\n\n- Match the Composition! Transfer your plan from a sketch to the scrapbook page or photo wall! \n\n- Challenge yourself to sketch the essence of the image before the timer runs out! Focus on composition and structure. Freehand the fine details afterward, or disable Quick Sketch and trace them directly. (Disabling requires a one-time purchase.)\n\nSeveral tools make it really easy to trace your image:\n\n- Light Table - lock your screen, turn up the brightness, and trace the image from your screen directly!\n\n- Handheld Mode -- On supported devices, Augmented Reality keeps your tracing image steady while you hold your device at a comfortable angle. (demo video https://youtu.be/YJeK5Sjdi1Q). Requires iOS 11.3 or later on iPhone 6s/6s Plus or iPad Pro and later. Works best on stable horizontal and vertical surfaces with good light and some visible surface detail.\n\n- Lock the camera focus to keep the image steady while you trace.\n\n- Lock the canvas area to keep your layout and alignment while you zoom in to get a close look at your work in progress.\n\n- Several Filter modes enhance your image, increasing contrast to give you a better result.\n\n- Use the flashlight to light up your drawing. (requires Full Version)\n\n- Use the selfie camera and draw on your face. (requires Full Version)\n\n\nOther features make it fun and easy to share your creations with your friends.\n\n- Video recording in Time Lapse mode to make things smaller and faster and cooler. You can enable normal-speed and audio on the Settings screen.\n\n- The recorded video or snapshot includes a small thumbnail of the tracing image (with an option to turn that off).\n\n- Your videos and snapshots are stored automatically and available to share later from within the app, the Files app, or iTunes.\n\n- Sharing your videos and photos is easy with a preview screen and saved photos/videos!\n\n- Interrupted while recording your drawing? No problem - Combine multiple videos to create a single video for sharing! Use the Edit feature on the Saved Files screen: select two movies and tap Join.\n\n\nTracing Projector is Enhanced For 3D Touch! Start right away from the camera or photo album from the home screen! Force-touch on the tracing image to peek at your progress while you draw!\n\n\nNotes:\n- For best results, stabilize your device above your drawing surface. A stack of books, drinking glass, or tripod works best.\n- The app requires access to your camera in order to present its overlay for drawing.\n- The app requires access to your photos in order to load an image to trace and to save the video of your drawing.\n- The app optionally uses your microphone when recording a video while you draw."

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

      "label": "Развивающее приложение «Учим буквы весело» предлагает самым умным малышам познакомиться с буквами русского алфавита.\nОно поможет ребенку легко и с интересом освоить азбуку и научит составлять небольшие слова.\n\n«Учим буквы весело» – это: \n• Забавные персонажи!\n• Смешная анимация!\n• Весёлые стихи!\n• Интересные задания!\n• Играем и изучаем буквы!\n• Весёлая азбука!\n• Русский алфавит!\n• Умные раскраски! \n• Отсутствие рекламы!\n\nПриложение разбито на 3 блока. \nВсе уровни озвучены диктором, а задания проходят в форме интересной игры.\n\nВ первом блоке малыш знакомится с буквами от А до Я.  Каждая буква представлена так, что ребенок с лёгкостью ее запоминает. В этом ему помогут яркие анимированные иллюстрации и озвученное диктором стихотворение. Рисунки «оживают» при нажатии на них. Учим алфавит вместе со смешными животными.\n\nВторой блок состоит из упражнений на закрепление полученных знаний. Например, малыш открывает пару из буквы и изображения, начинающегося на эту букву. В следующих заданиях представлены картинки и буквы, из которых надо подумать и найти верную. Также есть развивающие задания на составление слов из изученных букв.\n\nВ третий блок детской игры добавлены умные раскраски со знакомыми персонажами. Каждую картинку нужно раскрашивать, используя буквы русского алфавита. Попробуйте сами поиграть в эту увлекательную игру вместе с малышом. \n\nБлагодаря тому, что мы вместе с Вами и Вашим ребенком в форме увлекательной игры учим буквы, учимся читать, учим слова, готовим ребенка к школе, у Вашего малыша развивается наглядно-образное мышление, внимание, тонкая моторика.\n\nОбучающая игра \"Учим буквы весело!\" предназначена для детей дошкольного возраста.\n\nПри разработке развивающих приложений мы учитываем рекомендации педагогов дошкольного образования и логопедов. В настройках Вы можете самостоятельно переключать произношение букв на звуки для удобства обучения чтению. Тем не менее, мы уверены, что дети должны знать,  как правильно произносятся все буквы русского алфавита. \n\nВ бесплатной версии доступна часть контента. Если Вам понравилось приложение, можете купить полную версию. \n\nМы любим детей, поэтому сами пишем добрые стихи и рисуем смешные картинки.  \nУ нас самый профессиональный диктор! \nМы благодарны Вам за выбор нашей игры! \nСпасибо за добрые отзывы!\n\nЕсли вдруг у Вас появились замечания, то напишите нам на почту support@catdonut.com, и мы обязательно Вам ответим!\n\nИгра на русском языке. \n\nСоветуем также обратить внимание и на другие наши развивающие детские приложения. Мы не только вместе учим весело буквы, звуки, алфавит, но также цифры, фигуры, цвета, простые математические действия. Мы создаем обучающие и развивающие игры для вас и ваших детей.\n\nМы открыты для всех Ваших пожеланий! Пишите Ваши предложения на support@catdonut.com."

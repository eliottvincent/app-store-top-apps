The power to transform the world around you into creative assets to build your projects is in the palm of your hands. The creation of graphic design elements is now just a camera click away.\n\nRemove Background from Images\nTake your photo inspiration and transform the background to use in your design projects.

All the information you need can be easily surfaced through a widget that you designed. You don't have to clutter your screen with the information you don't want, it's just what you want, how you want it.\n\n• It's simple to make a widget •\n\nYou don't need to be a professional designer, you just need to know what you want. Once you figure that out, it's a matter of letting your creativity flow. Just add an element, pick a data source, throw on some effects, and put it where you want. Then repeat to add another element. After a while, you'll have a perfect widget, and all you need to do is to assign it to a widget slot and drop it on your home screen. There it is, marvelous! \n\nThe Widgy editor only has two parts. The preview and the layer list. When editing a layer, you get a couple of different sections that let you tweak the appearance and data of that layer. Each section has several special things you can do to the layer. The Preview will always show you a live display of exactly how the widget will look on your home screen, so you don't have to constantly go back and forth between the editor and home screen.\n\n• Everything you need •\n\nWidgy provides all the different elements that you would ever need to make your widget perfect. Along with that, there are all the data sources you could ever need, everything from system info to weather. And with all these data sources, there are several ways to display the data, whether it's a text, a nice chart, or something else.\n\n• There's no limits •\n\nThis isn't an app full of templates, everything is 100% customizable and interchangeable. It's your widget, and you choose how to make it. The only limit is your imagination. \n\n• Sharing and discovering is easy •\n\nYou can privately share widgets with your friends or publicly with all  Widgy users, all with a couple of taps. You can share your widget as a URL, QR Code, JSON data, a file, or you can publish it to be shown in the Explore section for all the Widgy users to see. \n\nOther than the Explore section, Reddit (r/Widgy) and Discord communities have produced thousands of Widgy widgets so far. So if you just want to browse widgets or if you need some inspiration you can get that too!\n\nNOTE: Widgy optionally integrates with Apple Health. This integration is used to display your data if you select one of those widget types. Permission for Widgy to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.\n\nAs with Health, all other permissions for Widgy are optional and are there just to show you the data you want to be displayed.\n\nWidgets for screenshots designed by SCOSeanKly.\nSome of the icons packs in screenshots designed by bulldog5278."

NCS+ helps you to succeed in any colour design. \n\nWith NCS - Natural Colour System®©, developed by world-renowned colour experts, it has never been easier to find the right colour for your project. \n\n\nEXPLORE COLOUR THEMES \n\nIn NCS+, you have access to all of the standardized NCS colours, and can explore all of the NCS Colour products, including Trend collections, the NCS Index, NCS Exterior and NCS Inspire. \n\n\nFIND YOUR COLOUR \n\nSearch for colours in the new and innovative search panel, either through an NCS Notation (or parts of it) or filter for colours based on their hue and/or nuance. \n\n\nMATCH A SURFACE \n\nUsing the built-in support for the Colourpin II / SE colour readers, you can easily scan any surface and find the closest matching NCS colour with the click of a button. You can also see how much the scanned surface differs from the closest matching colours with the built-in rating function and its corresponding delta E 2000 value. \n\n\nNAVIGATE THE NCS COLOUR SPACE \n\nThe new and improved NCS Navigator brings unparallelled ease of navigating in the NCS System, through the NCS Circle selecting the prefered hue, and the NCS Triangle to select the correct nuance. The innovative beehive allows you to fine-tune your selection by modifying the selected colour in either chromaticness, blackness or whiteness, giving you exactly the colour you want. \n\n\nCOMBINE COLOURS \n\nThrough the smartness of the NCS System, you can combine colours of your choice based on colour similarities such as nuance-, hue-, blackness-, chromaticness-, whiteness and NCS lightness similarity. Basing your combination colours on these properties are one of the most certain ways of creating colour combinations that harmonize. \n\n\nCOLOUR SAMPLE REFERENCES \n\nWith unprecedented on-screen colour accuracy, you can now bring up any standard NCS colour on your mobile device. On each colour, you can also find out in which collections they are available, buy a physical sample in different sizes from the NCS Colour web shop or any NCS reseller as well as find translation values into other systems such as RGB, HEX, CMYK and Lab values. \n\n\nSAVE, SHARE AND INSPIRE\n\nSave your favourite colours into mood boards, upload images or take photos of your project to provide addional context to the board. You can then share the boards with friends or colleagues to inspire and collaborate."

First, specify what you want to draw; e.g., “a floating castle”. Then you can add additional features to your drawing such as “evening” and “full moon”. Then you can decide on the drawing style; e.g. “digital art”. Finally, add something like “trending on artstation” to inform the ai to generate beautiful art. So your final description is “a floating castle, evening, full moon, digital art, artstation”. You can try variations of the description and include more details about the style.\n\n\nTerms of Use : https://labml.ai/promptart_terms.html\nPrivacy Policy : https://labml.ai/promptart_privacy.html"

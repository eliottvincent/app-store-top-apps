      "label": "With Widgy, your home and lock screens becomes YOUR screens. You can make any kind of widget imaginable that perfectly matches the rest of your aesthetics. All the information you need can be easily surfaced through a widget that you designed. You don't have to clutter your screen with the information you don't want, it's just what you want, how you want it.\n\n• It's simple to make a widget •\n\nYou don't need to be a professional designer, you just need to know what you want. Once you figure that out, it's a matter of letting your creativity flow. Just add an element, pick a data source, throw on some effects, and put it where you want. Then repeat to add another element. After a while, you'll have a perfect widget, and all you need to do is to assign it to a widget slot and drop it on your home screen. There it is, marvelous! \n\nThe Widgy editor only has two parts. The preview and the layer list. When editing a layer, you get a couple of different sections that let you tweak the appearance and data of that layer. Each section has several special things you can do to the layer. The Preview will always show you a live display of exactly how the widget will look on your home screen, so you don't have to constantly go back and forth between the editor and home screen.\n\n• Everything you need •\n\nWidgy provides all the different elements that you would ever need to make your widget perfect. Along with that, there are all the data sources you could ever need, everything from system info to weather. And with all these data sources, there are several ways to display the data, whether it's a text, a nice chart, or something else.\n\n• There's no limits •\n\nThis isn't an app full of templates, everything is 100% customizable and interchangeable. It's your widget, and you choose how to make it. The only limit is your imagination. \n\n• Sharing and discovering is easy •\n\nYou can privately share widgets with your friends or publicly with all  Widgy users, all with a couple of taps. You can share your widget as a URL, QR Code, JSON data, a file, or you can publish it to be shown in the Explore section for all the Widgy users to see. \n\nOther than the Explore section, Reddit (r/Widgy) and Discord communities have produced thousands of Widgy widgets so far. So if you just want to browse widgets or if you need some inspiration you can get that too!\n\nNOTE: Widgy optionally integrates with Apple Health. This integration is used to display your data if you select one of those widget types. Permission for Widgy to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.\n\nAs with Health, all other permissions for Widgy are optional and are there just to show you the data you want to be displayed.\n\nWidgets for screenshots designed by SCOSeanKly.\nSome of the icons packs in screenshots designed by bulldog5278."

      "label": "A simple tool for background removal that makes your pictures look free from imperfections does exist. Background Eraser is designed to help you delete the background that ruins your image. Use the app in different ways. You can make a transparent background, remove the existing one and add something else, or even erase the background to boost your sales with seamlessly looking product images. Whichever goal you have, Background Eraser has everything you need to transform your picture.\n\nHere is a short overview of all tools you get from downloading the app:\n\n• Cutout tool. This is the very essence of the app. We made sure the entire background removal mechanism works in a convenient and fast way. Just select the unneeded area that you want to erase and make it transparent in one simple click.\n• White and solid background. Minimalism is truly timeless. You can delete the existing background and add white background or the one with any solid color instead.\n• Background templates. In case you need not only to remove the background but also to change it into something better, we prepared the background gallery with various templates so that you can pick the one that fits your picture most.\n• Shadows & Outlines. Apart from the background cut-out, you can also add shadows to the necessary object or outline it. Adjust shadow intensity, the thickness of the outline, and the degree of the object opacity easily. Highlight important aspects to help the image look outstanding.\n• Stickers & Fonts. Looking for something less boring than just a minimalistic background? We added stickers and a variety of fonts to choose from so you can adorn your image and make it stand out. \n\nSimple yet efficient — this is the best way to describe Background Eraser. Besides, the app is perfect not only for social media lovers but for retailers as well. In case you sell products via popular marketplaces such as Amazon, Shopify, or any other online store, you can easily create great product images in just a few simple steps. Use all tools it offers to remove far from a perfect background and make the image look truly flawless."

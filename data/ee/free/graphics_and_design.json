      "label": "With Widgy, your home and lock screens becomes YOUR screens. You can make any kind of widget imaginable that perfectly matches the rest of your aesthetics. All the information you need can be easily surfaced through a widget that you designed. You don't have to clutter your screen with the information you don't want, it's just what you want, how you want it.\n\n• It's simple to make a widget •\n\nYou don't need to be a professional designer, you just need to know what you want. Once you figure that out, it's a matter of letting your creativity flow. Just add an element, pick a data source, throw on some effects, and put it where you want. Then repeat to add another element. After a while, you'll have a perfect widget, and all you need to do is to assign it to a widget slot and drop it on your home screen. There it is, marvelous! \n\nThe Widgy editor only has two parts. The preview and the layer list. When editing a layer, you get a couple of different sections that let you tweak the appearance and data of that layer. Each section has several special things you can do to the layer. The Preview will always show you a live display of exactly how the widget will look on your home screen, so you don't have to constantly go back and forth between the editor and home screen.\n\n• Everything you need •\n\nWidgy provides all the different elements that you would ever need to make your widget perfect. Along with that, there are all the data sources you could ever need, everything from system info to weather. And with all these data sources, there are several ways to display the data, whether it's a text, a nice chart, or something else.\n\n• There's no limits •\n\nThis isn't an app full of templates, everything is 100% customizable and interchangeable. It's your widget, and you choose how to make it. The only limit is your imagination. \n\n• Sharing and discovering is easy •\n\nYou can privately share widgets with your friends or publicly with all  Widgy users, all with a couple of taps. You can share your widget as a URL, QR Code, JSON data, a file, or you can publish it to be shown in the Explore section for all the Widgy users to see. \n\nOther than the Explore section, Reddit (r/Widgy) and Discord communities have produced thousands of Widgy widgets so far. So if you just want to browse widgets or if you need some inspiration you can get that too!\n\nNOTE: Widgy optionally integrates with Apple Health. This integration is used to display your data if you select one of those widget types. Permission for Widgy to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.\n\nAs with Health, all other permissions for Widgy are optional and are there just to show you the data you want to be displayed.\n\nWidgets for screenshots designed by SCOSeanKly.\nSome of the icons packs in screenshots designed by bulldog5278."

Using the built-in brushes and canvases, you can depict any picture, limited only by your own imagination. At the same time, you can copy the image in reality, applying a stencil to a blank sheet of paper.\n\nSelect the required image. It can be loaded from the device memory, as well as download the basic stencils available inside the application. The program will automatically position the sketch on the canvas, while giving you the opportunity to change the image parameters. The picture can be rotated, enlarged or made transparent using the corresponding sliders located at the bottom of the screen.\n\nPainter Eye: Canvas Creator has rich set of sketching features. You can change the color and drawing style of the sketch, turn it into a monochrome copy, or convert fresh photos into a stencil. Pictures of any quality can be placed on the entire space of the canvas and sequentially draw complex elements. You can even turn his own portrait into a sketch, having previously loaded it from the smartphone's memory.\n\nTerms of Use - https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nPrivacy Policy - https://www.appodeal.com/home/privacy-policy/"

      "label": "Low-resolution photos? Pixelated digital images? AI-generated art that's just too small? SuperLux is the luxurious choice for AI image upscaling. We kept SuperLux incredibly simple so you don't have to pay for complex photo-editing tools or have any extra technical knowledge. \n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Select an image from your camera roll - whether it's AI-generated art, an old scanned photo, or a cropped screenshot, SuperLux has you covered. No ads, no gimmicks. The first screen in the app will be your photo library.\n\n2. Choose the resolution - we offer Super (up to 3x your resolution) and Ultra (up to 12x your resolution.) Super's great for digital use. The file sizes will be smaller so you don't have to worry about long processing times or load times if you're using the image on a website. Ultra resolution is a big image and it's perfect for print or online instances where the image needs to be massive! This will take some time to process and download since the file sizes can be large. Depending on what you select, our AI enlarger will automatically improve the photo. The results are incredible!\n\n3. Adjust the aspect ratio - watch as your image magically transforms with different aspect ratios. We offer 14 different aspect ratios for you to choose from and automatically resize your image within the frame. Not happy with our AI image resizing? You can crop, move the image around, or zoom in. Incredible resolutions means the possibilities are endless!\n\n4. Save or share your image - this step is simple and, like the rest of the app, has absolutely no gimmicks!\n\nSo why use SuperLux over the other tools out there?\n\n- We're inexpensive - we're not an in-depth image editing app so we're not priced like one. We do one thing - upscale images - and we do it really well. If you're looking for an app that does more than just improve an image's resolution or change the aspect ratio, we're likely not the best choice. But if you just want higher resolution images and you don't want to spend much money, try SuperLux!\n\n- We're luxurious - what does it even mean to be an upscale image upscaling app? Using our app will feel like flying first class. We don't serve you ads - so you won't have to learn about a new iPhone game just to get an enhanced image. We're free to try - so you can see if we're worth the money. We don't throw in all the bells and whistles you don't want or need. And we're really attractive - our app is well-designed and we care about your experience\n\n- We are the perfect tool for AI art aficionados - SuperLux is an offshoot of Creator: AI Generated Art. With Creator, we made a simple, intuitive tool for exploring the remarkable world of AI generated art. Often times that art comes in aspect ratios like 512 x 512 - so while it looks great on small screens, it looks pixelated when you view it on a desktop or try to print it. Our tool is perfect for AI generated art and images. With SuperLux, you can take the 512 x 512 image and turn it into something you can hang on your wall.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Step into the luxurious world of SuperLux - the upscale upscaling app for the discerning image connoisseur.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.superlux.pro/privacy-policy\nEnd-User License Agreement: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nTerms of Use: https://www.superlux.pro/terms-conditions"

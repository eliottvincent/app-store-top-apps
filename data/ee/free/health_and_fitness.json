Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level. The Oral-B app is your digital coach to help you brush correctly as recommended by Dental Professionals.\r\n\r\nBrush for a Clean that Wows\r\n3D Teeth Tracking and A.I.

You can also view high-pressure dentition maps to learn where you need to apply less pressure and view trends based on your recorded brushing history – all easily filtered by week, month, and year. \r\n\r\nTrack Your Gum Bleeding\r\nThe unique Gum Guard[3] technology helps improve your brushing while protecting your gums. It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

But not all beers, wines or shots are equal.\n\nDrinkControl helps you be better informed about the drinks you consume and the amount of alcohol/calories they contain. Whether it's to reduce alcohol intake on the advise of a doctor, goal of spending less or losing weight, tracking drinks will help you with moderation or cutting down.\n\nNow, that’s a sobering thought! \n\nFeatures: \n- Easily and quickly track your drinks and alcohol expenses\n- Track and see your drinking history in calendar\n- Mark your dry/sober days and streaks\n- Compare your alcohol use with moderate/low-risk drinking guidelines from leading health institutions\n- Sync alcohol units (standard drinks) and alcohol calories consumed with Apple Health\n- Get statistics and charts on alcohol use, sober days, money spent and calories in alcohol\n- Get your personal infographic on drinks consumed\n\nPremium features include:\n- Set and customize drink tracking reminders/notifications\n- Get statistics and charts for last/calendar month/week, quarter or year and previous time periods\n- Look back in the history, create an infographic for whole month/year\n- Add your favourite types of drinks and serving sizes\n- Export data to .csv file for use in Excel/Numbers\n- Choose your favourite app icon\n- Back up your data to iCloud or Dropbox\n\nTerms, Conditions and Privacy: \nhttps://drinkcontrolapp.com/privacy.htm"

Taking drugs always involves risks - however, if you do decide to take drugs, KnowDrugs can help you to take appropriate measures to reduce potential harms.\n\nDRUG INFORMATION & EDUCATION\n\nCheck the profiles of more than 200 drugs for educational purposes: Stimulants like MDMA and Amphetamine, depressants such as Alcohol and Benzodiazepines or psychedelics like 2C-B, LSD and DMT.\n\nKnowDrugs provides you with drug education harm reduction advice, focusing on MDMA / Molly / Ecstasy and other psychoactive substances. Knowing about the wanted and unwanted effects of drugs, their duration, interactions and risks helps you to make more informed decisions, reduce risks and reflect upon your drug habits and consumption behaviour.\n\nDRUG CHECKING, PILL WARNINGS & DRUG ALERTS\n\nSearch for drug name, substance or location, to find drug alerts from nearby and learn about their ingredients and dosage strength to avoid overdose and particularly dangerous cuts (e.g. PMA).\n\nDrug checking or pill testing is a way to reduce the harm from drug consumption by allowing users to find out the content and purity of substances that they intend to consume. This empowers users to make safer choices: to avoid more dangerous substances and combination and to use smaller quantities.\n\nIf you don't have access to professional drug testing services, looking up recent drug testing results can still help you make a more informed decision about your consumption.\n\nHARM REDUCTION & RESPONSIBLE DRUG USE\n\nHarm reduction aims to minimize the harms associated with recreational substance use. The harm reduction approach follows from the idea that substance use is a high-risk activity that innately entails the possibility of injury, addiction, and death. Therefore, the best strategy one can employ (outside of avoiding use entirely) is to take appropriate measures to mitigate its potential harms.\n\nKnowDrugs highlights the harm-potential of more than 200 substances and demonstrates strategies on how to reduce the harms associated with the consumption of drugs.\n\nKNOWDRUGS CAN ALSO HELP YOU  TO:\n\n- learn how to spot and react in case of an emergency, take care of someone experiencing a bad trip at a party or festival\n- find a free and confidential counselling service which accepts you and your personal choices, and helps you develop the right strategies and competencies if you want to change something about your consumption behaviour.\n\nNote: Always check in with your doctor in addition to using the app and before making any medical decisions.

During fasting, as your glycogen depletes, your body switches to ketosis, which is referred to as the body's \"fat-burning\" mode. This is an effective way to burn fat.\n\nIS IT SAFE?\nYes.

When you focus your energy on the things you want: achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting + good you are creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen. \n- They open you up to possibility.

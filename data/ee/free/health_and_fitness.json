      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

Conceived in conjunction with Yale University's Center for Emotional Intelligence and based on the work of Dr Marc Brackett, How We Feel helps people find the right word to describe how they feel while tracking their sleep, exercise, and health trends using HealthKit in order to spot patterns over time.\n\nFounded as a science-based nonprofit, How We Feel is made possible by donations from people who are passionate about bringing mental wellbeing to the widest possible audience. Our data privacy terms are clear and easy-to-understand: all of your data is kept on your device unless you opt-in to send an anonymized version of your check-ins to be used in research to help more people.\n\nWhether you are downloading this app in order to build better relationships, make your emotions to work for you, not against you, improve how you handle stress and anxiety or simply to feel better, How We Feel will help you identify patterns through daily HealthKit tracking and find emotional regulation strategies that will work for you. The How We Feel friends feature allows you to share how you feel with the people you trust most in real time, strengthening your most important relationships.\n\nFilled with step-by-step video strategies you can do in as little as one minute on themes like \"Change Your Thinking\" to help you address negative thought patterns with cognitive strategies; \"Move Your Body\" to express and release emotions through movement strategies;\"Be Mindful\" to gain perspective and minimize the negative impact of misunderstood emotions with mindfulness strategies; \"Reach Out\" to build intimacy and trust, two important tools for emotional wellbeing, with social strategies."

The better you understand how well you are sleeping the more you are able to make changes in your routines to benefit your rest.  \n\nMy goal is to provide every Apple Watch owner with a free automatic sleep tracker that is simple and clear to understand.  For each night you get a straightforward report of how long you slept and how restful you were during the night.\n\nAUTOMATIC MODE:\n \nSimply wear your Apple Watch overnight and each morning Sleep++ will analyze your sleep and give you a report about how long and restfully you slept.  \n\nMANUAL MODE:\n\nIf you want to have more precise control over the start/end time of each night recorded you can also use manual sleep tracking.  This is also useful if your nightly routine makes it difficult for Sleep++ to determine when you went to bed. \n\n1) Wear your Apple Watch while you sleep.\n2) Tell Sleep++ when you start sleeping.\n3) Tell Sleep++ when you wake up.\n\nNOTES:\n\nSleep++ integrates with the Health App providing you a safe and private way to share your activity data with Sleep++.  This data is used for automatic sleep tracking.  You can also optionally have Sleep++ save your Sleep Analysis into your Health database after each night."

Benefit from the most popular, healthy, and effective weight-loss method, trusted by hundreds of millions adopters worldwide!\n\nPerfect for establishing a basic eating discipline, Simple is ideal for keeping yourself in good shape during self-isolation, with our educational and motivational content on staying mindful about your eating habits.\n\nPopularized by celebrities like Hugh Jackman and Beyoncé, intermittent fasting is the most ancient eating pattern known to humans. It's trusted in most religions, but anyone can use its benefits.\n\nUnlike popular new fads, intermittent fasting makes your body work precisely as it was designed by mother nature. It helps lose and control your weight and reinstating normal processes in your body that you’ve lost due to frequent eating.\n\nEven shorter fasting periods (12 hours or more) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and lower the risk of metabolic diseases.\n\nJust remember: IF is not a diet, fad or quick fix. It does not tell you what you can’t eat but instead asks that you eat within a specific window of time each day. This is a simple lifestyle change that will jump-start weight loss and better health by enabling your metabolic system to work as it was designed.\n\nBut many people are deterred from trying IF because they think it’s difficult and they don't know how to start. \n\nThat’s where Simple comes in. You don't have to know anything about Fasting.\n\nBecause we are not just a fasting tracker, our mission is not to offer you just an Intermittent Fasting tool. We provide you health, weight loss, and cognitive power instead. \n\nWe'll adjust your customized program, teach you what IF is, give a lot of different content, lifehacks, and advice to make IF adoption mindful and easy.\n\nYou’ll get daily support, customized guidance, expert advice, true motivation, and easy life hacks that will help you succeed. Simple will keep track of your eating habits to help you adjust your customized fasting program as needed. We will provide you with personalized insights on how to get the most out of intermittent fasting. \n\n- Customized tips and hacks delivered daily\n- Smart and flexible tracking. Start/end your fasts with one quick click\n- A step-by-step guide to intermittent fasting\n- Custom fasting protocols\n- Easy-to-use meal journal for mindful eating\n\nSimple Fasting protocols:\n- 16-Hour (16:8) Intermittent Fast\n- Circadian Rhythm Fasting\n- 18:6\n- 20:4\n- 14:10 \n- OMAD - one meal a day\n\nHEALTH APP INTEGRATION:\nSimple integrates the following data from the Health app (HealthKit) to keep track of your body status:\n\n- Steps\n- Weight\n- Water\n- Sleep\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\nGet a Simple PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION and enjoy full access to all features and content.\n\nIf you choose a Simple PREMIUM subscription in the app, payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.

      "label": "Injuries are far too common in many sports. For an athlete, being injured can be devastating, and even end a promising career. However, injuries can be prevented. Numerous scientific studies have proven that structured warm-up exercises can reduce the risk of injuries by over 50%!\nGet Set – Train smarter was created to coincide with the 2014 and 2016 Youth Olympic Games in Nanjing, China, and in Lillehammer, Norway, and is the result of a collaboration between the International Olympic Committee, the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center, several Norwegian and international sports federations, and Making Waves AS,\nThe target group is not only the young talents and their coaches, but anyone engaged in physical activity. Get Set – Train smarter was created to help prevent sports injuries by providing the most effective and evidence-based workout routines for your needs.\nAll exercises are presented through videos, supported by short descriptions on how to perform the exercise correctly. Exercises are presented with variations as well as 3 levels to make them more difficult and challenging as you progress. The Get Set exercises are designed to be carried out with a minimum of equipment, to make them safe and easy to implement wherever you are.\nUnder “Sport”, you will find your sport among the 40 summer and 15 winter sports, and as another option you can find injury prevention exercises targeting specific body parts. In other words, for each of the 55 sports, the exercise program is tailored to the injury risk profile of the sport. Likewise, under “Body”, you will find exercises developed to prevent problems with the shoulder, back, groin, hamstring, knee, and ankle.\nYou can download all the exercise programs as PDF files with small pictures and short descriptions to help you remember. The PDF can be printed or shared electronically with your teammates, coaches, friends and family.\nGet Set is available on iOS in 9 languages (English, French, Spanish, Russian, German, Norwegian, Chinese, Korean and Finnish), and is accessible for free. The first time you view an exercise, the app will download the video to your device. For this we recommend using a wifi connection, to be sure external charges are not applied. Once you have downloaded the exercise videos on your mobile phone, they are stored on your device, allowing you to benefit from Get Set wherever you are."

Taking drugs always involves risks - however, if you do decide to take drugs, KnowDrugs can help you to take appropriate measures to reduce potential harms.\n\nDRUG INFORMATION & EDUCATION\n\nCheck the profiles of more than 200 drugs for educational purposes: Stimulants like MDMA and Amphetamine, depressants such as Alcohol and Benzodiazepines or psychedelics like 2C-B, LSD and DMT.\n\nKnowDrugs provides you with drug education harm reduction advice, focusing on MDMA / Molly / Ecstasy and other psychoactive substances. Knowing about the wanted and unwanted effects of drugs, their duration, interactions and risks helps you to make more informed decisions, reduce risks and reflect upon your drug habits and consumption behaviour.\n\nDRUG CHECKING, PILL WARNINGS & DRUG ALERTS\n\nSearch for drug name, substance or location, to find drug alerts from nearby and learn about their ingredients and dosage strength to avoid overdose and particularly dangerous cuts (e.g. PMA).\n\nDrug checking or pill testing is a way to reduce the harm from drug consumption by allowing users to find out the content and purity of substances that they intend to consume. This empowers users to make safer choices: to avoid more dangerous substances and combination and to use smaller quantities.\n\nIf you don't have access to professional drug testing services, looking up recent drug testing results can still help you make a more informed decision about your consumption.\n\nHARM REDUCTION & RESPONSIBLE DRUG USE\n\nHarm reduction aims to minimize the harms associated with recreational substance use. The harm reduction approach follows from the idea that substance use is a high-risk activity that innately entails the possibility of injury, addiction, and death. Therefore, the best strategy one can employ (outside of avoiding use entirely) is to take appropriate measures to mitigate its potential harms.\n\nKnowDrugs highlights the harm-potential of more than 200 substances and demonstrates strategies on how to reduce the harms associated with the consumption of drugs.\n\nKNOWDRUGS CAN ALSO HELP YOU  TO:\n\n- learn how to spot and react in case of an emergency, take care of someone experiencing a bad trip at a party or festival\n- find a free and confidential counselling service which accepts you and your personal choices, and helps you develop the right strategies and competencies if you want to change something about your consumption behaviour.\n\nNote: Always check in with your doctor in addition to using the app and before making any medical decisions.

It helps you create that mind muscle connection by removing the need to count your reps.\n\nIt's simple and easy to use. Set your goal rep and start your workout, it taps you when It's time to stop. Alternatively, you can set it to tap you every five reps so you don't need to interact with your device at all till your workout is done.

Since it's designed to tap you can use it in the gym even when there's loud music. \n\nIt counts any exercise with prominent hand movements such as squats, deadlifts, rows, shoulder press, bench press, etc. and even most movements where your hand is stationary, like push-ups, pull-ups, leg raises etc. \n\nRep Up is designed for Apple Watch, taking advantage of features like Workout Tracking, Taptic Engine and a powerful processor allowed us to build a truly meaningful experience. You can use Rep Up with iPhone as well but you'll need an armband.\n\nMain Features\n⋅ Designed for Apple Watch. \n⋅ Fifteen free workouts on watch and phone.\n⋅ Automatically taps you when you reach your goal rep.\n⋅ Detects when you've stopped and auto resets.\n⋅ Tap every five reps setting (no user interaction required).\n⋅ Fully Usable in gyms with loud music. \n⋅ Workout Tracking for watch and integration with the Health App.\n⋅ Works with iPhone (Armband required).\n\nNote the watch app requires Apple Watch Series 1 or higher and watchOS 5 or later."

The Japanese version, “Nensho!”, has reached over 100,000 downloads and has gained recognition among the otaku community for being the first moé-themed app to break into the iTunes Top 10 ranking and have a fully localized release.\n\n======================================\n\nHow does it work?\n\n======================================\n\nAt its core, “Burn your fat with me!!” is a Japanese visual novel game akin to the “Phoenix Wright” or “Professor Layton” series. But instead of building a case or solving puzzles, the player advances the story by clearing fitness goals, such as performing 50 sit-ups in three minutes.\n\n======================================\n\nWhat else is in it?\n\n======================================\n\n• Training Mode: It’s important to train regularly if you want to be able to clear some of the more difficult trials. In Training Mode you choose your exercise, target reps, and time limit, then train while Mayu counts your repetitions and cheers you on. Using Training Mode (Timed only) will also earn you Moévation Points which can be used to unlock bonus content like new episodes.\n\n\n\n• Voice Collection: As you progress the story, you will unlock “training voices”, the lines Mayu will say during your workout to encourage (and sometimes scold) you. The Voice Collection menu lets you preview unlocked training voices as well as switch them on and off.\n\n======================================\n\nSpecifications\n\n======================================\n\nTested with iPhones4, 4S, iPhone5, 5S, iPhone6; iPod touch 4; and iPads 2 and 3\n\nCompatible with iOS 7.0+;\n\nDeveloped and produced by Creative Freaks\n\nMusic by SENTIVE\n\n\n\nFor updates and more information:\n\nWebsite: http://nensho.net/nensho/index_en.html\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/BurnYourFatWithMe\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CreativeFreaks\n\n\n\n©2012 Creative Freaks"

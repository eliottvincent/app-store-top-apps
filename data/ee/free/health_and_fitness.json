This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features.

It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

      "label": "- WHAT IS LOÓNA?\nloóna is the first app that lets you quickly disconnect from a long stressful day and get in the right mood for sleep.\n\n- SO, IT'S ANOTHER SLEEP APP, RIGHT?\n Not exactly. loóna isn’t a list of direct go-to-sleep techniques, but rather a mood-altering app that helps you to stay calm during the day and prepares you emotionally for going to sleep in the evening.\n\n- WHY IS BEDTIME MOOD IMPORTANT?\nNegative emotions we accumulate during the day are processed and consolidated by our brain during sleep making them more difficult to disassociate from when faced again in the future. Moreover, feeling angry, anxious, down, or, the opposite, excited, and elated, is likely to affect latencies to sleep onset and REM-sleep. People mistake it for the symptoms of a sleep disorder, but in reality, they just may be in the wrong mood for sleep.\n\n- HOW DOES LOÓNA WORK?\nFrom the wake up and during the busy day Loóna will support your emotional states with playlists and immersive stories. Each night you’ll have a recommended sleepscape. A sleepscape is a guided session that combines activity-based relaxation, storytelling, and sounds in a unique way. Complete it to shut the frantic world out, reset your mind, and create the perfect mood for sleep.\n\nLoóna saves your sleepscape sessions to your Apple Health app.\n\nThe upgrade to loóna PLUS provides access to the entire collection of sleepscapes. Our subscription options are: 1-month subscription for $12.99, 1-year subscription with a 7 day trial for $39.99 (price may vary by location).\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nTerms of service: http://loona.app/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://loona.app/privacy"

      "label": "Agapé is a relationship wellness app that makes it easy for you to feel and show love! Each day we prompt you to answer a question that sparks meaningful conversation.\n\nEach question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! Plus you’re only able to see your partner’s response, once you have both responded. \n\nAlthough Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of couples that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationship.\n\nIn addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

      "label": "LESS - Alcohol Tracker\n\nLess is a simple, elegant, intuitive tool to help people who drink alcohol do so more mindfully, and make space for more drink-free days. From the creators of ZERO, the top rated fasting app, Less makes it easy to track your alcohol intake so you can stay aware of how much you drink and when. It’s a science-based approach to taking control of your consumption. As the saying goes, “What gets measured gets managed.”\n\nThis app is a judgment-free zone. It’s designed to help anyone who wants to moderate alcohol consumption, no matter what the reason. Whether you’re trying to sail through social situations without overdoing it, overwhelmed by the ocean of work functions involving alcohol, or seeking to chart a course toward better health, Less is your companion to navigate these stormy waters.\n\n**This is v1 of “the drinking buddy that helps you drink less.” We’re rapidly iterating and improving, so we welcome feedback to help make Less as upbeat, engaging, and helpful as possible.**\n\nMEET LES AND LESLIE\n\nChoose to experience the journey toward mindful consumption as either Les or Leslie. You’re the captain of this ship, and every decision is yours. As you log drinks, your daily intake affects the weather while your weekly intake affects your speed. Stay under your daily limit to keep the skies sunny. Stay under your weekly limit to keep the wind at your back. If you exceed your limits, you’ll run into stormy weather and slow your progress.\n\nTRACK YOUR JOURNEY\n\nSET LIMITS. Our algorithm will recommend a weekly limit, but you can customize that limit up or down to work at your own pace. \n\nLOG DRINKS WITH A TAP. Quickly and easily log each drink from the homescreen, or use the widget to add drinks without opening the app for a more discrete tracking experience. \n\nBUILD STREAKS. Less tracks how many drink-free days you rack up in a row so you can visualize your progress. \n\nREVIEW YOUR WEEK. See when you drank and how much. Use this information to inform your choices moving forward.\n\nREVIEW YOUR MONTH. The calendar view lets you see your entire consumption history so you can see the big picture of your alcohol intake.\n\nCHART YOUR PROGRESS. Less transforms your inputs into easy-to understand graphs so you can see how your habits evolve over time.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\n\nWith Less, you can…\n\n...Adjust your weekly limits up or down depending on your goals.\n\n...View and edit your history. If you forgot to log a drink, or logged one incorrectly, you can adjust the number from the “past days” screen. \n\n...View key statistics like your 7-day rolling average, your 28-day rolling average, and total drink-free days since joining.\n\n...See how much drinking is costing you. Less estimates how much money you spend on alcohol. \n\n...See how alcohol impacts your health. Less estimates how many calories you consume from alcohol.\n\n...Compare streaks. Track drink-free days and weeks within your limit. Compare your current streak to your longest one. \n\nLEARN MORE IN OUR TIPS TAB\n\nDig deep with articles, podcasts, and snackable advice, curated by our team of experts. Read studies from trusted sources about the benefits of drinking less. Listen to podcasts from the top minds in nutrition. Find mocktail recipes to help you drink thoughtfully without sacrificing your social life. \n\nBecome part of a global community of people taking this journey toward more mindful drinking habits and drink-free days. \n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\nTerms of Service: www.lessdrinks.com/terms-of-use\nPrivacy Policy: www.lessdrinks.com/privacy-policy"

And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.\"\n\n- Quartz\n\n\"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\"\n\n- Wired\n\n\"Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\"\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms"

Taking drugs always involves risks - however, if you do decide to take drugs, KnowDrugs can help you to take appropriate measures to reduce potential harms.\n\nDRUG INFORMATION & EDUCATION\n\nCheck the profiles of more than 200 drugs for educational purposes: Stimulants like MDMA and Amphetamine, depressants such as Alcohol and Benzodiazepines or psychedelics like 2C-B, LSD and DMT.\n\nKnowDrugs provides you with drug education harm reduction advice, focusing on MDMA / Molly / Ecstasy and other psychoactive substances. Knowing about the wanted and unwanted effects of drugs, their duration, interactions and risks helps you to make more informed decisions, reduce risks and reflect upon your drug habits and consumption behaviour.\n\nDRUG CHECKING, PILL WARNINGS & DRUG ALERTS\n\nSearch for drug name, substance or location, to find drug alerts from nearby and learn about their ingredients and dosage strength to avoid overdose and particularly dangerous cuts (e.g. PMA).\n\nDrug checking or pill testing is a way to reduce the harm from drug consumption by allowing users to find out the content and purity of substances that they intend to consume. This empowers users to make safer choices: to avoid more dangerous substances and combination and to use smaller quantities.\n\nIf you don't have access to professional drug testing services, looking up recent drug testing results can still help you make a more informed decision about your consumption.\n\nHARM REDUCTION & RESPONSIBLE DRUG USE\n\nHarm reduction aims to minimize the harms associated with recreational substance use. The harm reduction approach follows from the idea that substance use is a high-risk activity that innately entails the possibility of injury, addiction, and death. Therefore, the best strategy one can employ (outside of avoiding use entirely) is to take appropriate measures to mitigate its potential harms.\n\nKnowDrugs highlights the harm-potential of more than 200 substances and demonstrates strategies on how to reduce the harms associated with the consumption of drugs.\n\nKNOWDRUGS CAN ALSO HELP YOU  TO:\n\n- learn how to spot and react in case of an emergency, take care of someone experiencing a bad trip at a party or festival\n- find a free and confidential counselling service which accepts you and your personal choices, and helps you develop the right strategies and competencies if you want to change something about your consumption behaviour.\n\nNote: Always check in with your doctor in addition to using the app and before making any medical decisions. This app is not a replacement for professional medical and/or psychological help."

      "label": "EarMachine is an app that makes it easy to listen to the sounds that you want to hear. Those sounds can be picked up by the microphone in your phone or earbuds, and can be played from your music library! EarMachine is helpful in situations ranging from talking in noisy restaurants to watching television at home. \n\nThis work is funded by the National Institutes of Health (of the United States of America). \n\nFeatures:\n\nSimple Interface, Complex Processing\nWith a simple interface, EarMachine, allows you to adjust more that 150 signal processing parameters with a simple swipe of your finger on a wheel. The mapping from wheel position to parameter values is the result of a large-scale analysis of the hearing status of more than 10,000 people. \n\nEarShare: An intelligent recommendation engine\nEar Machine also contains a recommendation engine called EarShare. This engine will listen to the sounds around you and use that information to recommend wheel positions. The recommendations are based on both large-scale analyses of hearing abilities as well as your usage of the app. EarShare will give better recommendations the more you use the app.\n\nListen to whatever sounds you want. \nEar Machine allows you to choose whether you want to listen to the microphone in your iOS device, or the one in your earbuds (iOS 7 only). You can also use Ear Machine to listen to songs/podcasts in your music library. \n\nState of the Art Signal Processing\nThe signal processing in Ear Machine is similar to what is used in most hearing instruments. A wide-dynamic range multiband compressor ensures that quiet sounds are amplified,  while protecting you from sounds that are already loud. A multiband limiter provides further protection from loud sounds. An expander makes sure that very quiet sounds (e.g., refrigerator hum) are not annoying. You can even use Ear Machine as a sound level meter (works best with phone microphone)."

In 3 workouts of 30 minutes or less per week, N2R will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25 minutes straight.\n\nNone to Run is a gradual running plan designed for people like you.\n\nHere’s how the N2R differs from most beginner plans:\n\n• Focuses on running time. NOT distance or pace. This makes running more enjoyable.\n• Unlike most beginner plans, N2R Includes simple strength and mobility workouts. No equipment required.\n• Progresses conservatively to enhance enjoyment and decrease the chances of getting injured.\n\nIf you can't currently run for more than 5-minutes straight without stopping to catch your breath, you're in the right place.\n\nThe None to Run 12-Week Plan will take you from ground zero, to running comfortably for 25-minutes straight.\n\nThousands of people have already used the None to Run plan to finally become the runner they’ve always wanted to be. It’s your turn.\n\nN2R FEEDBACK:\n\n\"Couch to 5k, moved too fast for me, and I found this program when seeking something different.\"\n\n“A gentle, safe way to become a runner.”\n\n“A beginning running program, designed to build consistency and keep you from being injured. By the end of 12-weeks, you're running 25-minutes straight.”\n\n“Perfect program to ease you into training.”\n\n\"I tried the Couch to 5K program twice and failed. I’m now on the last week of the None to Run program, and I actually look forward to running now.\"\n\nThe N2R app provides the best experience to successfully follow and complete the 12-Week None to Run plan.\n\nTOP FEATURES\n\n• The entire 12-week None to Run plan, with spoken audio cues telling you when to run and when to walk. No time consuming and confusing programming of intervals required!\n• Once you've completed the None to Run plan, use the Run to Race 5K plan to start working on your speed and get you \"race ready\".\n• There's also a Run to Race 10K plan\n• Play music or podcasts using the app of your choice!  The app will temporarily lower the volume during alerts.\n• Track and store all of your workouts. All workout data is stored securely in Apple Health.\n• Runs in the background with the screen locked so you can conserve battery life.\n• Standalone Apple Watch app. Leave your phone at home!\n• Bluetooth heart rate monitor support for Apple Watch or iPhone.\n• Automatically start the watch app when you start a run on your phone.\n• Fill your Activity Rings.\n• Show off your stats on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram using share cards.\n• NO annoying ads!\n• Open runs (when you just feel like working out without using a specific plan).\n• Custom run/walk interval workouts (when you want to create your intervals).\n• Analyze your pace and stats over time.\n• iOS 14 Home Screen Widgets!\n \nSTRENGTH & MOBILITY ROUTINES\n\n• Running is stressful on the body. Especially when you’re just getting started. Beginner runners generally do not have the lower body strength needed to cope with the demands of running.\n• N2R includes carefully designed strength and mobility routines (with video demos) to help you get strong and reduce the chances of getting injured!\n\nSUBSCRIPTION PRICING & TERMS\n \nNone to Run is free to download and use. The free version provides access to the first week of all training programs. To gain unlimited access to the entire training program and all the features of the app you may choose between a monthly or yearly auto-renewing subscription option.\n\nPayment will be charged to your credit card through your iTunes account at the confirmation of the purchase. Subscription renews automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours prior to the end of the subscription period.\n\nSubscriptions can be managed and auto-renewal turned off in Account Settings in the App Store app.\n \nPrivacy Policy: https://www.nonetorun.com/privacy-policy\nTerms of Service: https://www.nonetorun.com/terms-and-conditions-app\n\nEmail support@nonetorun.com with any questions!"

You are able to play various mini-games such as the memory game and football, or complete the obstacle course, separate unhealthy foods from healthy options and so on.\r\n\r\nThe appealing graphics, engaging storyline and the simple language used in the game makes it easier for all players to understand it. The aim of the game is to provide general health and wellbeing information and psychoeducation. That in turn, has the potential to induce positive behavioral change. Therefore, it is recommended for the users to play the game for about a month for the learnt behaviors to internalize.\r\n\r\nThe game is co-designed with stakeholders from various cultural backgrounds. We use evidence-based content to monitor and support players' health behaviors and mental well-being through a game environment. Based on research, it is expected that users may be more empowered to change their health behaviors if the intervention is delivered in a fun and intuitive way (through a game environment). Please contact us (hero@triumf.health) to access our research findings showing the positive effect of the game on player’s mental well-being and quality of life. \r\nThe application contains no ads and is not linked with any third party solutions."

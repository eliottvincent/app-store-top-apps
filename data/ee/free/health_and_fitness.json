      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

You will get a cool sidekick who is always by your side and helps you with different tips and tricks on how to take better care of yourself. Your sidekick also helps you better understand your emotions and worries, and helps you become a master problem solver. You can go on daily missions with your sidekick to help Triumfland's citizens to become healthier and happier. You are able to play various mini-games such as the memory game and football, or complete the obstacle course, separate unhealthy foods from healthy options and so on.\r\n\r\nThe appealing graphics, engaging storyline and the simple language used in the game makes it easier for all players to understand it. The aim of the game is to provide general health and wellbeing information and psychoeducation. That in turn, has the potential to induce positive behavioral change. Therefore, it is recommended for the users to play the game for about a month for the learnt behaviors to internalize.\r\n\r\nThe game is co-designed with stakeholders from various cultural backgrounds. We use evidence-based content to monitor and support players' health behaviors and mental well-being through a game environment. Based on research, it is expected that users may be more empowered to change their health behaviors if the intervention is delivered in a fun and intuitive way (through a game environment). Please contact us (hero@triumf.health) to access our research findings showing the positive effect of the game on player’s mental well-being and quality of life. \r\nThe application contains no ads and is not linked with any third party solutions."

Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level.

It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

For each night you get a straightforward report of how long you slept and how restful you were during the night.\n\nAUTOMATIC MODE:\n \nSimply wear your Apple Watch overnight and each morning Sleep++ will analyze your sleep and give you a report about how long and restfully you slept.  \n\nMANUAL MODE:\n\nIf you want to have more precise control over the start/end time of each night recorded you can also use manual sleep tracking.  This is also useful if your nightly routine makes it difficult for Sleep++ to determine when you went to bed. \n\n1) Wear your Apple Watch while you sleep.\n2) Tell Sleep++ when you start sleeping.\n3) Tell Sleep++ when you wake up.\n\nNOTES:\n\nSleep++ integrates with the Health App providing you a safe and private way to share your activity data with Sleep++.  This data is used for automatic sleep tracking.  You can also optionally have Sleep++ save your Sleep Analysis into your Health database after each night."

      "label": "Life Cycle automatically keeps track of your time and presents your life sorted into slices. It shows you your daily activities, places you go, and who you spend time with. Life Cycle weekly journal provides personalized insights and clarity to your week passed. Start each week with a look back. Remember where you’ve been and vision where you’re going.\n\nWhether you’re just curious of how your time is spent or looking to make a change, Life Cycle is your daily companion, providing you with all the information and insights you need. What’s more - it uses only 1% of your phone’s battery while it seamlessly does the work.\n\nFREE FEATURES\n\n• Automatic - Life Cycle works in the background, recording and sorting what you do as you go about your daily business.\n• Less than 1% battery - Life Cycle uses less than 1% of your battery per day as it runs in the background.\n• Weekly journal - Weekly insight to activities, accompanied by photos tied to moments passed.\n• From a day to a year - view your life day by day, week by week, month by month or even year by year.\n• Apple Health - Fully integrated. Imports all activities, mindfulness and sleep data.\n• Friends - Connect with your friends on Facebook and see who you’re spending time with, what you’re doing and where.\n• Sleep Cycle connection - For accurate sleep data, connect with Sleep Cycle alarm clock through Apple Health.

Compare trends over the weeks, months or years.\n\nBATTERY CONSUMPTION\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Life Cycle does not use the GPS in the background, but instead relies on cell tower and Wi-Fi locations. As a result, it consumes less than 1% of your battery per day, when the app runs in the background.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n• Life Cycle needs to run in the background to be able to record your data. It only uses 1% of your battery per day when doing so.\n• You need to carry your phone with you, for Life Cycle to accurately record and interpret your activities.\n• Wi-Fi should be enabled on your phone for tracking to work.\n\nShould you choose to subscribe to Life Cycle Premium, the purchase will be charged to your iTunes account. You can manage or cancel your auto-renewable subscription by entering the user settings in iTunes after the purchase. The subscription will be auto-renewed 24 hours before the subscription period ends, with the same kind of subscription you already bought, to the same price. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nTerms of service: https://www.northcube.com/terms-service-life-cycle/\nPrivacy policy: https://www.northcube.com/privacy-policy-for-life-cycle/"

      "label": "Agapé is a relationship wellness app that makes it easy for you to feel and show love! Each day we prompt you to answer a question that sparks meaningful conversation.\n\nEach question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! Plus you’re only able to see your partner’s response, once you have both responded. \n\nAlthough Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of couples that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationship.\n\nIn addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

It’s designed to help anyone who wants to moderate alcohol consumption, no matter what the reason. Whether you’re trying to sail through social situations without overdoing it, overwhelmed by the ocean of work functions involving alcohol, or seeking to chart a course toward better health, Less is your companion to navigate these stormy waters.\n\n**This is v1 of “the drinking buddy that helps you drink less.” We’re rapidly iterating and improving, so we welcome feedback to help make Less as upbeat, engaging, and helpful as possible.**\n\nMEET LES AND LESLIE\n\nChoose to experience the journey toward mindful consumption as either Les or Leslie. You’re the captain of this ship, and every decision is yours. As you log drinks, your daily intake affects the weather while your weekly intake affects your speed. Stay under your daily limit to keep the skies sunny. Stay under your weekly limit to keep the wind at your back. If you exceed your limits, you’ll run into stormy weather and slow your progress.\n\nTRACK YOUR JOURNEY\n\nSET LIMITS. Our algorithm will recommend a weekly limit, but you can customize that limit up or down to work at your own pace. \n\nLOG DRINKS WITH A TAP. Quickly and easily log each drink from the homescreen, or use the widget to add drinks without opening the app for a more discrete tracking experience. \n\nBUILD STREAKS. Less tracks how many drink-free days you rack up in a row so you can visualize your progress. \n\nREVIEW YOUR WEEK. See when you drank and how much. Use this information to inform your choices moving forward.\n\nREVIEW YOUR MONTH. The calendar view lets you see your entire consumption history so you can see the big picture of your alcohol intake.\n\nCHART YOUR PROGRESS. Less transforms your inputs into easy-to understand graphs so you can see how your habits evolve over time.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\n\nWith Less, you can…\n\n...Adjust your weekly limits up or down depending on your goals.\n\n...View and edit your history. If you forgot to log a drink, or logged one incorrectly, you can adjust the number from the “past days” screen. \n\n...View key statistics like your 7-day rolling average, your 28-day rolling average, and total drink-free days since joining.\n\n...See how much drinking is costing you. Less estimates how much money you spend on alcohol. \n\n...See how alcohol impacts your health. Less estimates how many calories you consume from alcohol.\n\n...Compare streaks. Track drink-free days and weeks within your limit. Compare your current streak to your longest one. \n\nLEARN MORE IN OUR TIPS TAB\n\nDig deep with articles, podcasts, and snackable advice, curated by our team of experts. Read studies from trusted sources about the benefits of drinking less. Listen to podcasts from the top minds in nutrition. Find mocktail recipes to help you drink thoughtfully without sacrificing your social life. \n\nBecome part of a global community of people taking this journey toward more mindful drinking habits and drink-free days. \n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\nTerms of Service: www.lessdrinks.com/terms-of-use\nPrivacy Policy: www.lessdrinks.com/privacy-policy"

The How We Feel friends feature allows you to share how you feel with the people you trust most in real time, strengthening your most important relationships.\n\nFilled with step-by-step video strategies you can do in as little as one minute on themes like \"Change Your Thinking\" to help you address negative thought patterns with cognitive strategies; \"Move Your Body\" to express and release emotions through movement strategies;\"Be Mindful\" to gain perspective and minimize the negative impact of misunderstood emotions with mindfulness strategies; \"Reach Out\" to build intimacy and trust, two important tools for emotional wellbeing, with social strategies."

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

      "label": "Мы разработали приложение специально для тех, кто хочет привести свое тело в отличную форму, занимаясь прямо у себя дома. Упражнения доступны для людей с любой физической подготовкой, и для их выполнения вам не понадобится дополнительное фитнес-оборудование. Программа составлена профессиональными тренерами по фитнесу на основе научных исследований и рекомендаций. Ежедневные занятия помогут вам значительно улучшить свою физическую форму и состояние здоровья в целом.\n\nПочему это приложение подойдет для каждого?\n\n • Программа тренировок позволяет включить их даже в самый загруженный график – перед началом занятия вы сможете увидеть количество упражнений и их продолжительность\n\n • Все упражнения рассчитаны на работу с собственным весом – вам не придется тратиться на покупку дорогостоящего оборудования или абонемент в тренажерный зал\n\n • Видеоролики и подробное описание упражнений гарантируют правильное выполнение упражнений\n\n • Советы от фитнес-тренеров помогут вам быстрее добиться желаемого результата\n\nКак только вы установите приложение, вам будет доступна первая тренировка. План упражнений составлен таким образом, что на каждый день у вас будет появляться новая программа. После того, как вы выполните все задания из первого дня, на следующий день вам будет открыт доступ к новым заданиям.\n \nУчитывая особенности человеческого организма, каждая последующая тренировка будет более интенсивной, чем предыдущая – ведь тело быстро адаптируется к одинаковой нагрузке, а значит, для достижения результата с каждым днем сложность занятий должна будет возрастать. Всего несколько минут ежедневных занятий – и ваше тело станет сильным, а мышцы всегда будут в тонусе.\n\nПрограмма одной тренировки включает в себя упражнения на разные группы мышц. Также есть возможность включить в свои занятия разминку и растяжку. Придерживаясь поставленного плана, вы сможете уже за месяц значительно улучшить свое тело и убрать лишний вес.\nДля того, чтобы ваши тренировки проходили без ошибок, для каждого упражнения мы загрузили видеоролик с подробным описанием правильной техники.\n\nСпециально для тех, кто хочет составить свою собственную программу тренировок, доступен полный список упражнений. В приложении доступны занятия по четырем категориям – ноги, руки, пресс и все тело. Каждое упражнение можно просмотреть отдельно – для этого вам будут доступны видеоролик и краткая инструкция по выполнению.\n\nВ приложении есть возможность настройки уведомлений – так вы точно не забудете потренироваться, ведь напоминания будут приходить ежедневно!\n\nПоскольку одной из важных составляющих здорового образа жизни является контроль водного баланса в организме, приложение поможет понять, сколько воды вам необходимо выпивать ежедневно. Введите в настройках ваш пол, возраст и вес, после чего нужный объем воды автоматически появится у вас на экране. Вам останется лишь отмечать в приложении каждый выпитый стакан воды – так в течение дня вы в любой момент сможете понять, достаточно ли жидкости вы употребляете.\n\nС нашим приложением вы сможете добиться колоссальных результатов всего за месяц регулярных тренировок! Работая над своим телом, вы прокачаете его до тех результатов, о которых вы всегда мечтали. Пришло время выбрать новый путь в жизни – стать бодрее, красивее и, самое главное, здоровее!\n\n\nУсловия подписки: \n• 999 р.

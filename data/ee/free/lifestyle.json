      "label": "I Am Sober is more than just a free sobriety counter app.\n\nAlong with tracking your sober days, it helps you build new habits and provides ongoing motivation by connecting you to a wide network of people all striving for the same goal: staying sober one day at a time.\n\nThrough our growing sober community you can learn from others and contribute by sharing insights and tactics that have worked for you.\n\n**The I Am Sober app features:**\n\n• Sober day tracker\nTo visualize how long you’ve been sober.\n\n• Remember why you quit\nAdd reasons and photos to help you remember why you want to quit your addiction and stay sober.\n\n• Daily pledge tracker\nTake a pledge every day. Sobriety is a 24-hour struggle, so start your day off by making a pledge to stay sober. Then you can review how your day went and log notes at the end of the day.\n\n• Sobriety calculator\nView how much money & time you’ve saved by being sober.\n\n• Analyze triggers\nRecap each day and find patterns that made your day easier or more challenging than the last.\n\n• Share your story\nEither with others or for yourself, take photos and journal your progress directly in the app. Then choose to share it or save it as a reminder for yourself.\n\n• Milestone tracker\nTrack and celebrate your milestones from 1 day, to 1 week, to 1 month and beyond. Compare experiences with others on their sober journey. Read how they felt at this milestone and what you can expect. If you’re struggling, share your story and invite others to offer help or advice.\n\n• Withdrawal timeline\nWhen you create an account and declare your addiction, you can instantly see a withdrawal timeline to get an idea of what to expect for your next few days (and weeks). What’s more, you can contribute to it. See how many others saw an increase in their restfulness vs those that saw an increase in anxiety. Prepare yourself for what’s to come in recovery.\n\n• Customize your experience\nYou set the time, your sober birthday, the category of motivation you need, the addictions you’re trying to break, even the end-of-day summaries. Make the app customized to your lifestyle and tailored to your needs.\n\n**Sober Plus subscriptions**\n\nI Am Sober is free to use, but you can support development of the app with a subscription to Sober Plus. With Sober Plus, you'll get access to these premium features:\n\n• Create a group\nStay accountable together and track your sobriety privately. Groups are great for complimenting your real-world group like Alcoholics Anonymous, NA, SA, SMART Recovery, or your rehab center.\n\n• Locked access\nKeep your trackers private with a lock that you can access via TouchID or FaceID.\n\n• Data Backups\nSave your progress in the cloud and restore your trackers if you get a new device.\n\n• More tracking\nTrack more addictions and get access to more communities. Even if your addiction is specific like Wine, Online Shopping, or Skin Picking, you’ll find a variety of communities of people who are all trying to get sober from alcohol, drugs, eating disorders, self-harm, and more.\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. I Am Sober Plus automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and the cost of the renewal will be identified. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\n\nTerms of service: https://iamsober.com/terms-of-service/\nPrivacy policy: https://iamsober.com/privacy-policy/"

And now, we’ve been named one of Apple’s 2021 Apps of the Year for connection.\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behavior. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATING, FRIENDS & NETWORKING\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes:\n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.\n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date.\n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes).\nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store.\n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms\n\nBumble Inc. is the parent company of Bumble, along with Badoo and Fruitz"

You can set up several virtual fences, make them big or small, and move them easily across the map.\n\n\n\n*** Find Mode ***\n\n\n\nPinpoint your dog’s location in close range.

You have an overview of all information and control your vehicle via the app.\n\nMERCEDES ME: ALL FUNCTIONS AT A GLANCE\n\nALWAYS INFORMED: The Vehicle Status informs you about the mileage, range, current fuel level or data from your last journey, for example. Use the app to conveniently check your tyre pressure, the status of the doors, windows, sliding sunroof/soft-top and boot, or the current locking status. You can also pinpoint the location of your vehicle and receive warning messages regarding unlocked doors, for example.\n\nCONVENIENT VEHICLE CONTROL: With the Mercedes me App, you can remotely lock and unlock or open and close the doors, windows, and sliding sunroof. Start the auxiliary heating/ventilation or program this for your departure time. In electric vehicles, you can also activate pre-entry climate control and temper the vehicle immediately or for a defined departure time.\n\nCONVENIENT ROUTE PLANNING: Plan your route at your leisure and conveniently send addresses to your Mercedes via the app. This means you can get in and drive off straight away.\n\nSAFETY IN AN EMERGENCY: The Mercedes me App notifies you of attempted theft, an attempt to tow away the vehicle and parking damage. If a vehicle alarm has been tripped, you can turn it off via the app. The Geofencing service sends you a notification as soon as the vehicle enters or leaves an area defined by you. In addition, you can configure Speedfencing and Valet Protect in the app, and receive push notifications in the event of their violations.\n\nFUEL-SAVING DRIVING: The Mercedes me App shows you your vehicle's individual fuel consumption. It also compares your fuel consumption with that of other drivers of the same vehicle model. The ECO display informs you about the sustainability of your driving style.\n\nSIMPLY ELECTRIC: The Mercedes me App lets you display your vehicle's range on a map and search for charging stations near you. The app also allows you to start the charging process at a public charging station.\n\nDiscover the full convenience of the new Mercedes me Apps: They offer you ideal support for making your mobile everyday life easier and more flexible.\n\nLet the app help you. The Mercedes me Service App gives you a timely reminder of your next service appointment, which is easy to book from your smartphone. Also in the app: practical How-To videos in which you can find out more about your Mercedes-Benz and perform simple maintenance tasks yourself if you choose.\n\nExpand your mobile options with the Mercedes me Store App. Easily find and buy innovative digital products available for your Mercedes. Keep track of the remaining terms of your Mercedes me connect services and on-demand features, and renew these as desired directly from your smartphone.\n\nPlease note: Mercedes me connect services and on-demand features only work with Mercedes-Benz vehicles that are equipped with the Mercedes me connect Communication Module. The range of functions depends on the particular vehicle equipment and your booked services. Your authorised Mercedes-Benz dealer will be happy to advise you. Use requires an active, free-of-charge Mercedes me account. The functions can be restricted temporarily if there is insufficient data transmission bandwidth. Continuous use of the GPS function in the background may shorten your battery life."

      "label": "With IKEA Home smart app and DIRIGERA hub, it's easy to create smarter everyday moments with lighting, speakers, blinds and air quality products. \r\n\r\nPicture yourself waking up as your smart lights gently rise. Your favorite songs play on the speakers and you still haven't gotten out of bed. How lovely, right? Smart products like lighting, speakers, blinds and air purifiers can make a lovely addition to your everyday life. When you improve the IQ of your home, life itself runs a bit smoother.\r\n\r\nThe magic happens when you combine two or more smart products from IKEA, tell them what to do in the app and save it as a 'Scene'.\r\n\r\nA great scene is one you will use often. Think about waking up and going to bed, cooking and eating, date night and family time, or leaving and coming home. All everyday moments when we can support you with the best lighting, sound that suits your mood, and cleaner air.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to control, we think of everyone, from young to old and even visitors. So while the app gives you total control to customize your smart home, our range of remotes make it easy for everyone to live with and use a smart home.\r\n\r\nIn control \r\n• You can control products individually or in groups. You can turn whole rooms on and off or the whole home, all at once.\r\n• Dim and change light colours, adjust blinds, speaker volume, and much more.\r\n• Set the scenes you need and trigger them with schedules, a shortcut button or use the app.\r\n\r\nEasy to use\r\n• The home screen gives a fast overview of your whole home. Quickly control products, access rooms, or start/stop scenes. This is also where you add new products, rooms, and scenes. \r\n\r\nOrganized and personal\r\n• Organizing your smart products in rooms gives fast access to the products you want to control.\r\n• Personalize the app with your choice of icons, names and colours for rooms and products\r\n• Create personal scenes, for example your own combination of cosy lighting and your favorite music. \r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n• Connect to Apple Home, Amazon Alexa or Google Home to use a voice assistant."

Like the profiles that catch your eye, get a Crush and most importantly, get together!\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nWhen you cross paths with another happn user, their profile appears on your app.\nDid someone catch your eye? Like them secretly. We promise, the person will never know, unless they Like you back. Do you want to stand out? Send them a FlashNote. Now you can send a message before you even get a Crush. And if the Like is mutual, then the Crush is yours! Now you can chat or set up a video call, and we’re counting on you to make that first message memorable.

      "label": "Alcohol addiction among men and women is on the rise. With Alcohol being so readily available, it is no surprise that not many men realize that this is a problem and can be highly addicting. Alcohol Addiction Calendar can help you put an end to your Alcohol addiction by holding you accountable, offering solutions, words of encouragement, and science based facts that will help you get past your addiction to Alcohol.\n\nFeatures:\n1. Use our sobriety counter to track your progress down to the second.\n2. Create your own reasons to quit alcohol, or use one of our scientifically based facts about quitting.\n3. Change the look and feel of the app with our skins section to personalize the app to what you want.\n4. Add reasons why you would like to see yourself succeed and stop the alcohol abuse.\n5. Our special panic button will help you send a text to a friend that may be able to help you and be an accountability partner.\n6. Our badge system allows you to be rewarded.\n7. Our distractions section will help you take your mind off of the alcohol abuse and introduce you to something more positive and soothing. \n8. Alcohol Addiction Calendar automatically calculates how much money you have saved since you quit drinking.\n9. Our motivational quotes and testimonials will ensure that you are not alone on this process to shake alcohol dependence.\n\nDrinking Alcohol overloads your serotonin receptors and decreases your motivation to meet new people. This can destroy your life if you let it. Don't let Alcohol addiction get the best of you. Get the help you deserve by downloading this free app.\n\nTop 7 reasons to quit drinking alcohol:\n\n1. Your immune system will thank you\n\nWithout the negative impacts of alcohol, your immune system will grow stronger. Liquor and other alcohol can wear away linings in the mouth and throat too, making pathogens able to take over more easily. First, it produces an overall nutritional deficiency, depriving the body of valuable immune-boosting nutrients. Second, alcohol, like sugar, consumed in excess can reduce the ability of white cells to kill germs. High doses of alcohol suppress the ability of the white blood cells to multiply, inhibit the action of killer white cells on cancer cells, and lessen the ability of macrophages to produce tumor necrosis factors.\n\n2. No more hangovers\n\nAs you age, your body starts to become less efficient at breaking down hangover causing toxins. For those who have experienced a terrible hangover, we don't really need to say anymore here. It is simply not worth it.\n\n3. You will save plenty of money\n\nAccording to EventBrite, the average partier spends $81 (USD) on a night out drinking and on average, they go out twice a week. Doing some simple math here, that means that you will be saving almost $8500 a year if you cut out the drinking. Invest the money or buy yourself something cool!\n\n4. Your problems actually make sense\n\nWhen you're drunk, little problems become big problems for no reason. When you're sober, you actually have to face reality and you wont be worried about petty things anymore.\n\n5. You will actually remember things\n\nHave you ever gone out for a night of drinking and didn't remember the night? Or maybe even didn't remember bits and pieces? Well that will not happen anymore if you stop drinking.\n\n6. No more losing friends over drunken mistakes\n\nA lot of bad decisions go out the window when you stop getting drunk, and as a result of making fewer poor decisions, your friends will like you more.\n\n7. It's interesting to go out sober\n\nIf you usually went out to get all boozed up with friends, it can be hard to turn back the habit. But you'll realize with time that you don't need booze to have fun. It is a hard habit to kick, but you will become more comfortable with yourself as you progress.\n\nTry this free one-of-a-kind app that will help you quit alcohol. You are NOT a slave to your addiction. All of our free features are plenty to help you quit drinking alcohol. Download for FREE!"

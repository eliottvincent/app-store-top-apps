Lisaks heale muusikale mahub saatepäeva palju meelelahutuslikku: soovisaated, üllatuskõned, põnevad mängud ja harivad rubriigid.\nElmari saatejuhid on heatujulised, siirad ja sõbralikud ning täpselt samamoodi on seda raadio Elmar kuulajad. Nii et kui tahad head tuju, siis on Elmar parim valik!\nLisaks reaalajas kuulamisele pakub raadio Elmar rakendus ka mugavat ja praktilist järelkuulamise võimalust, tänu millele saate kuulata oma lemmiksaateid, -rubriike ja intervjuusid endale sobival ajal, telefoni allalaadituna või allalaadimata. Hetkel on järelkuulamiseks saadaval kõik populaarse „Tähetee“ saated, kuid uusi ja huvitavaid saatelõike hakkame järelkuulamiseks lisama iganädalaselt. Rakendus sisaldab ka põhjalikku raadio Elmar saatekava."

A must-have tool for musicians.\n\n• Simple to use with all the essential features.\n• Extremely accurate (can be tuned to an accuracy of ±0.1 cents).\n• Tone generator that can generate reference tones over a note-range of 3 octaves.\n• Ability to set the frequency of A₄ (for tunings where A₄ is not 440 hertz).\n• Option to set detection latency - By setting a lower latency value, pitch detection will be faster. This works great for cases like vocal practice. By using a higher latency, pitch detection will not respond to momentary unintended sounds and noise (works great for instrument tuning)."

The exercises in this app will help you improve in this aspect.\n\nIn the first levels we will begin with ideas of two or three melodic sounds with simple rhythms. Gradually more notes will be included and more complex rhythms will be used. You must listen to each musical phrase and reproduce it immediately.\n\nWhatever the musical instrument that you play or the branch of musical activity to which you are focused on (execution, composition, direction, arrangements, etc.), you will find positive results while working on these exercises.\n\nAt the beginning of each level, you will hear 4 beats that indicate when the exercise begins. After those 4 beats, you will see an animation of the next 4 beats IN RED, you will hear a combination of sounds and you will see animations of them. Immediately after that, when the beats numbers appear IN GREEN, you should repeat what you heard, clicking on each button.\n\nThis app has been created to improve MUSICAL MEMORY and is suitable for every musician, music students and people of all ages."

You can fiddle with more detailed adjustments if you’re that way inclined, like equalisers and noise control for headphones – everything is there to help create your perfect fit. \n\nOur app supports these products:\nActon III Bluetooth\nStanmore III Bluetooth\nWoburn III Bluetooth\nEmberton II\nWillen\nMotif A.N.C.\nMode II\nMonitor II A.N.C.\nActon II Bluetooth\nStanmore II Bluetooth\nWoburn II Bluetooth"

      "label": "A chromatic tuner and pitch pipe used by over a million musicians.\n\nPitched Tuner and Pitch Pipe has been designed by musicians to help you quickly and easily tune your instrument using the microphone on your device.\nIt works well for a wide range of instruments: Ukulele, violin, mandolin, flute, guitars, voice, and more.  Even very low bass strings can be tuned. Simple controls and clear visuals make it great for beginners.  Responsive and precise algorithms provide professional level accuracy for more advanced players.\n\nHands free tuning means you can tune all of your strings without ever having to touch the screen - you don't want to have to reach for your ukulele tuner in between tuning each string, and now you don't have to.\n\nThis tuner app has two modes: \n - Instrument tuner\n - Chromatic tuner \n\nThe instrument tuner shows you the target notes for the instrument and tuning that you have selected - this is particularly useful for stringed instruments.  For example a guitar tuner would show the notes EADGBE if you chose standard guitar tuning, or DADGBE if you chose drop D tuning.  Or a violin tuner would show GDAE.  You can then just play each string and the tuner will identify whether you are in tune.  Pitched Tuner has built in tunings for many common instruments including banjo, bass 4, 5 and 6 string, cello, double bass, guitar including 7 string, ukulele, viola and violin.  If your instrument or your preferred tuning aren't included then you can easily create your own in the app.  Please email us if you want your tuning added to the built in ones.\n\nThe chromatic tuner displays the note that is closest to what is currently being played.  If you play an A, it shows an A.  This is useful for instruments with lots of notes (piano tuning for example).  Some stringed players might also prefer this mode - particularly if you play instruments with several common tunings such as the guitar (it's personal preference!).  It means you can quickly tune your guitar from standard to drop D without having to touch the app (assuming it's already visible on your screen).\n\nPitched Tuner displays a traditional tuner needle and dial. It clearly shows the frequency being played as well as the nearest note and error in cents (one cent is one hundredth of a semitone). The dial then allows you to easily track small changes in pitch. A separate volume indicator tells you how clearly the microphone is picking up your instrument sound.\n\nOther features include:\n-\tVary the reference tuning pitch away from the common 440Hz.  \n-\tAble to adjust for non-concert pitch instruments, for example the B-flat trumpet. \n-\tChoice of light or dark themes \n-\tAdjust the volume sensitivity of the app for quieter instruments and noisy environments.\n\nThis tuning app also works as a pitch pipe and can sound a reference note to tune your instrument by ear (which is always a good skill to practice), or use as a target note when you are re-stringing your guitar/violin/etc.  You can choose from a pure sine sound, which is precise but quiet, or a simulated piano, guitar or clarinet.\n\nWe hope you find Pitched Tuner useful.  You can always contact us at support@stonekick.com"

      "label": "The guitar tuner app used by professional guitar makers, guitar repair shops and musicians around the world. \n\nThe app listen and analyze the sound in real time from the built-in mic, headset, guitar clip on or from any other external microphone. It is so accurate that it will be your best friend for guitar intonation!\n\nBecause Pro Guitar Tuner is chromatic you can tune most types of stringed instruments. \n\nHigh-quality samples of real instruments are also accessible (i.e. tune by ear if preferred!). A massive library of different tunings for guitar, bass, balalaika, violin, ukulele and more makes it easy to find more qualities and characteristics from your instrument. \n\nThe interface:\nTo make it more intuitive, we give you information about the current pitch in many different ways:\n\n*Cents for the current pitch\n*A red/green light indicating the closest pitch\n*A note wheel corresponding to the chromatic scale\n*A fretboard with the current tuning setting displayed\n\nStandard guitar is set as default but the guitar tuner can be used to tune many different instruments, such as: \n*Guitars - Standard, 4-string, 5-string, 7-string, 8-string\n, 9-string, 10-string, 11-string, 12-string, and 13-string guitar\n*Bass guitars - Standard, 5-string bass and 6-string bass\n*Ukuleles - std (Soprano), Pocket, Concert, Tenor, Baritone, Bass, and Contrabass\n*Banjo - 4-string, 5-string, 6-string\n*Mandolin family - Mandolin (Soprano), Piccolo, Mandola (alto), Octave Mandolin (tenor), Mandocello (Baritone), Mandobass, Irish Bouzouki, Cittern, and Greek Bouzouki\n*Violin family - Violin, Viola, Cello (violoncello), Double bass and 5-string Double bass\n*Balalaika family - Prima, Piccolo, Secunda, Alto, Tenor, Bass and Contrabass\n\nAfter you have selected an instrument you choose a specific tuning. The app provides you with over 200 custom tunings.\n\nThe tuning options are divided into groups to make them easier to find. For guitar, the categories are:\n*General tunings\n*Raised tunings\n*Lowered tunings\n*Dropped tunings\n*Double dropped tunings\n*Major open tunings\n*Minor open tunings (cross-note)\n*Modal tunings\n*Miscellaneous tunings\n\nIf you have certain tunings that you often use, you can save them as favorites. This gives you easy access to them under favorite tunings.\n\nIn the app, you can choose to subscribe to Pro Guitar Tuner Premium. It´s  a monthly subscription that gives you the following features: \n\n*No Ads\n*All Tunings\n*All Instruments\n*Extra Settings\n\nIf you choose to purchase a monthly subscription, after your confirmation, the subscription will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can cancel anytime with your iTunes account settings. Any unused portion of a free trial will be forfeited if you purchase a subscription.

      "label": "EON Connect is a smart device application for control of up to four JBL EON 600-series speakers, using EON 600’s built-in Bluetooth functionality. The EON Connect app enables you to optimize the performance of each speaker through exclusive access to additional DSP parameters, including three fully adjustable parametric equalizers, plus  Hi and Lo Shelf filters. In addition you can set speaker delay for compensating speaker positions and control output mixing. Plus, quickly apply speaker settings across other EON 600-series speakers through preset creation and recall. You can also update each speaker’s firmware to the latest version directly from the EON Connect application. \n\nJBL engineers purposely designed the JBL EON 600 speaker line to provide a fully professional, easy to use, and built-to-last portable loudspeaker system for today’s working musicians and sound providers. Featuring JBL’s advanced waveguide technology, JBL designed and manufactured transducers, the latest technologies in cabinet materials and wireless DSP control via Bluetooth, the JBL EON 600-series delivers the extraordinary quality of a high-end studio monitor in a powerful portable PA.\n\nNOTE: Due to improvements in the application infrastructure, users of the app before version 1.34 may need to create new settings. Version 2.0 is built on a new, improved code base for better performance. Users should reset their EON Speakers before using this version of the app. If a speaker is still linked to the old app, it may not be able to connect to the new app."

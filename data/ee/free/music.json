And it’s the easiest way to manage multiple Bluetooth connections. But that’s just the beginning.\n\nSHARE THE MUSIC\nMUSIC SHARE lets you listen together. Now two pairs of Bose® wireless headphones can share the experience - listen together, at the same time, while one of you DJ’s. New PARTY MODE lets you sync two SoundLink® speakers for double the audio…ideal for listening in two different places, and new STEREO MODE immerses you in music by separating the sound into Left and Right channels across two paired speakers for that amazing stereo experience.\n\nGET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR HEADPHONES\nCONTROLLABLE NOISE CANCELLATION on our QC®30 headphones lets you decide how much of the world to let in by adjusting the level of noise cancellation right in the app. And the built-in HEART RATE MONITOR for our SoundSport® Pulse headphones displays your heart rate clearly in the app.\n \nAND SO MUCH MORE\nFrom viewing product details to personalizing settings, get the most out of your Bose wireless products. It even downloads the latest software in the background and only installs it when you’re ready. See how our simple app can make all the difference.\n \n * NOTE * \nBose Connect works with Bose Frames, QC®35, SoundSport® wireless, SoundSport® Pulse wireless, SoundSport® Free wireless, QuietControl™ 30, SoundLink® wireless II, ProFlight® headphones, and SoundWear Companion speaker, SoundLink® Color II, SoundLink® Revolve, SoundLink® Revolve+, SoundLink® Micro, and S1 Pro® speakers   \nSome features may not be available for all products.\nThe Bluetooth® word mark and logos are registered trademarks owned by Bluetooth SIG, Inc. and any use of such marks by Bose Corporation is under license.\n\nhttps://www.bose.com/en_us/legal/california_privacy_notice_of_collection.html\n\nhttps://worldwide.bose.com/privacypolicy"

      "label": "A chromatic tuner and pitch pipe used by over a million musicians.\n\nPitched Tuner and Pitch Pipe has been designed by musicians to help you quickly and easily tune your instrument using the microphone on your device.\nIt works well for a wide range of instruments: Ukulele, violin, mandolin, flute, guitars, voice, and more.  Even very low bass strings can be tuned. Simple controls and clear visuals make it great for beginners.  Responsive and precise algorithms provide professional level accuracy for more advanced players.\n\nHands free tuning means you can tune all of your strings without ever having to touch the screen - you don't want to have to reach for your ukulele tuner in between tuning each string, and now you don't have to.\n\nThis tuner app has two modes: \n - Instrument tuner\n - Chromatic tuner \n\nThe instrument tuner shows you the target notes for the instrument and tuning that you have selected - this is particularly useful for stringed instruments.  For example a guitar tuner would show the notes EADGBE if you chose standard guitar tuning, or DADGBE if you chose drop D tuning.  Or a violin tuner would show GDAE.  You can then just play each string and the tuner will identify whether you are in tune.  Pitched Tuner has built in tunings for many common instruments including banjo, bass 4, 5 and 6 string, cello, double bass, guitar including 7 string, ukulele, viola and violin.  If your instrument or your preferred tuning aren't included then you can easily create your own in the app.  Please email us if you want your tuning added to the built in ones.\n\nThe chromatic tuner displays the note that is closest to what is currently being played.  If you play an A, it shows an A.  This is useful for instruments with lots of notes (piano tuning for example).  Some stringed players might also prefer this mode - particularly if you play instruments with several common tunings such as the guitar (it's personal preference!).  It means you can quickly tune your guitar from standard to drop D without having to touch the app (assuming it's already visible on your screen).\n\nPitched Tuner displays a traditional tuner needle and dial. It clearly shows the frequency being played as well as the nearest note and error in cents (one cent is one hundredth of a semitone). The dial then allows you to easily track small changes in pitch. A separate volume indicator tells you how clearly the microphone is picking up your instrument sound.\n\nOther features include:\n-\tVary the reference tuning pitch away from the common 440Hz.  \n-\tAble to adjust for non-concert pitch instruments, for example the B-flat trumpet. \n-\tChoice of light or dark themes \n-\tAdjust the volume sensitivity of the app for quieter instruments and noisy environments.\n\nThis tuning app also works as a pitch pipe and can sound a reference note to tune your instrument by ear (which is always a good skill to practice), or use as a target note when you are re-stringing your guitar/violin/etc.  You can choose from a pure sine sound, which is precise but quiet, or a simulated piano, guitar or clarinet.\n\nWe hope you find Pitched Tuner useful.  You can always contact us at support@stonekick.com"

Start playing along to your favorite songs immediately.\n\nThe best drum app in the App Store just got better. Here's the long awaited sequel to Drum Kit. It's the closest thing to becoming a drummer without actually having a real kit. You can just tap to create your own beats, or you can play along to dozens of popular songs. It's super easy to use.\n\nThe kit is a classic 4-piece kit with bass drum, snare, floor tom, hi-hat, crash cymbal, and ride cymbal. The hi-hat plays open, closed, and pedal sounds depending on where you tap. The drums animate and the bass drum pedal moves when touched. Drum Kit simulates the most realistic drum playing experience on the App Store.\n\nDrum Kit is designed to be as responsive as possible and uses professionally recorded, high quality sounds. It is completely multi-touch and has very low latency. Use it to crank out some beats on the train or play a fill after a punchline. The photorealistic drums and animations make it feel like you're playing a real kit. \n\nFeatures:\n- customize your kit by moving drums around\n- play along to the MIDI version of many popular songs\n- record up to 1 minute of video\n- save video to the camera roll\n- share video\n- save and play back songs\n\nPlug into headphones or speakers for a much richer sound experience."

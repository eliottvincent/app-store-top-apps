      "label": "The guitar tuner app used by professional guitar makers, guitar repair shops and musicians around the world. \n\nThe app listen and analyze the sound in real time from the built-in mic, headset, guitar clip on or from any other external microphone. It is so accurate that it will be your best friend for guitar intonation!\n\nBecause Pro Guitar Tuner is chromatic you can tune most types of stringed instruments. \n\nHigh-quality samples of real instruments are also accessible (i.e. tune by ear if preferred!). A massive library of different tunings for guitar, bass, balalaika, violin, ukulele and more makes it easy to find more qualities and characteristics from your instrument. \n\nThe interface:\nTo make it more intuitive, we give you information about the current pitch in many different ways:\n\n*Cents for the current pitch\n*A red/green light indicating the closest pitch\n*A note wheel corresponding to the chromatic scale\n*A fretboard with the current tuning setting displayed\n\nStandard guitar is set as default but the guitar tuner can be used to tune many different instruments, such as: \n*Guitars - Standard, 4-string, 5-string, 7-string, 8-string\n, 9-string, 10-string, 11-string, 12-string, and 13-string guitar\n*Bass guitars - Standard, 5-string bass and 6-string bass\n*Ukuleles - std (Soprano), Pocket, Concert, Tenor, Baritone, Bass, and Contrabass\n*Banjo - 4-string, 5-string, 6-string\n*Mandolin family - Mandolin (Soprano), Piccolo, Mandola (alto), Octave Mandolin (tenor), Mandocello (Baritone), Mandobass, Irish Bouzouki, Cittern, and Greek Bouzouki\n*Violin family - Violin, Viola, Cello (violoncello), Double bass and 5-string Double bass\n*Balalaika family - Prima, Piccolo, Secunda, Alto, Tenor, Bass and Contrabass\n\nAfter you have selected an instrument you choose a specific tuning. The app provides you with over 200 custom tunings.\n\nThe tuning options are divided into groups to make them easier to find. For guitar, the categories are:\n*General tunings\n*Raised tunings\n*Lowered tunings\n*Dropped tunings\n*Double dropped tunings\n*Major open tunings\n*Minor open tunings (cross-note)\n*Modal tunings\n*Miscellaneous tunings\n\nIf you have certain tunings that you often use, you can save them as favorites. This gives you easy access to them under favorite tunings.\n\nIn the app, you can choose to subscribe to Pro Guitar Tuner Premium. It´s  a monthly subscription that gives you the following features: \n\n*No Ads\n*All Tunings\n*All Instruments\n*Extra Settings\n\nIf you choose to purchase a monthly subscription, after your confirmation, the subscription will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period.

The easiest way to get started with real music production.\n\n*** Apple Design Award ***\n*** Best of App Store ***\n*** Editor’s Choice ***\n\nWHY PEOPLE LOVE AUXY\n“Auxy is my favorite way to get what is going on in my brain into a musical format. It is simple on the surface but with tremendous depth if you need it.” - RAC\n\n“The automation is terrific. I am doing things with Auxy I would not easily do in my studio. The design is insanely smart and forward-thinking.” - Madeon\n\n“It is wild bro, you gotta get this!” - Majid Jordan\n\nCREATE AND MIX LOOPS\nBuild melodies and drum loops by drawing notes. Arrange your loops with scenes to explore ideas or make full-length tracks.\n\nDISCOVER GREAT SOUNDS\nBrowse thousands of high quality synth patches, sampled instruments and one-shot samples. You can import samples to the drum machine and build your own melodic instruments.\n\nADD EFFECTS AND AUTOMATION\nAdd studio-grade effects like reverb, delay, distortion and chorus. Fine-tune sounds to find the perfect mix. Create modulation and transitions with powerful automation.\n\nSHARE AND COLLABORATE\nUpload your tracks to SoundCloud or export them as audio or video files. Quickly share links to your projects if you want to collaborate with other producers.\n\nEXPORT TO YOUR FAVORITE DAW\nYou can export projects to Ableton Live, Bitwig Studio or Studio One, which makes Auxy a great sketchpad for producers on the go. You can also bounce projects as separate audio and MIDI files, which can be imported into any popular music-making app.\n\nJAM WITH FRIENDS\nAuxy supports Ableton Link, which lets you jam in sync with other apps and devices connected to the same Wi-Fi.\n\nTRY IT FREE\nAuxy is free to download and evaluate with a limited set of sounds. You also get a 7-day free trial to evaluate all the sounds and features before you start a subscription.\n\nMADE IN SWEDEN\nAuxy is built by a small and independent team in Sweden. Our mission is to put a studio in everyone's pocket and push music forward as an artform.\n\nTHANK YOU AUSTIN HAGA\nThe music in the preview video is made by Austin Haga.

The new Setup Assistant helps you to get started in three simple steps, making the entry into the PurePlay world easy and convenient.\nThe PureControl ANC app offers extensive control over various sound modes, touch control mapping, locating services and much more for the PurePlay Z5 earbuds. \nLDX™ AUDIO - The Lypertek Definition Expander (LDX™) provides a fully programmed and easy to select sound profile specifically designed for each PureControl ANC compatible earbud - taking the already impressively tuned sound to a new level, with added impact, energy and width for those who desire more.\n7-BAND EQ - The 7-band EQ gives you the freedom to fully customise the sound to your taste, offering carefully developed presets and two CUSTOM presets to store your own setups.\nSOUND MODES - Easily switch between ANC, AMBIENT and NORMAL sound modes with the push of a button:\n• ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) uses built-in microphones to reduce the level of outside noise. It is most effective at reducing low frequency sounds such as street traffic, train or aeroplane rumble.\n• AMBIENT sound mode allows you to hear the world around you without removing your earbuds. Talk to people, listen out for travel updates or just be more aware of your surroundings\n• In NORMAL mode both ANC and AMBIENT are deactivated. This will also achieve maximum playback time and battery life.\n• AUTO-AMBIENT™ reduces the need to interact with your earbud controls - automatically activating AMBIENT sound mode when you stop or pause audio playback. Effortlessly become aware of your surroundings, and then resume playback to switch back to your preferred listening mode. This feature can easily be switched on or off via the app.\nFULLY CUSTOMIZABLE CONTROLS - Easily customise the touch-controls to make using your PurePlay earbuds as comfortable as possible, and be extra safe with the ability to remove single touch controls - reducing the chance of accidental presses.\nFIND MY EARBUDS - Never lose your earbud(s) again. With the Find My Earbuds feature the PureControl ANC app tells you where your PurePlay true wireless earphones have been disconnected the last time and shows the location on the map.\nAdditionally the PureControl ANC app will inform you about the latest firmware updates and guide you through the update procedure.\n\n+++\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The PureControl ANC app is only compatible with the PurePlay Z5 earbuds. For other PurePlay series earbuds please download the PureControl app.\n+++"

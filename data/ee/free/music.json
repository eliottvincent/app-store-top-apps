      "label": "Music League is a game that lets you share and discover music by competing to determine the best songs for a particular theme!\n\nIf you want to discover new music, you will. You can share the songs you’re passionate about, and you can decide which of your friends has the best taste in music. \n\nYou and your friends can play to win, play to reminisce or play to discover new tunes by looking at music in a new way.  \n\nMusic League players will submit a song for each round's \"theme\".  Every round presents a new way to think about your music and a reason to share the songs you love, the songs you always thought deserved more love, or the songs you find that perfectly fit the theme.  \n\nSample themes could include: \n- Best cover song\n- Beach Songs\n- Song I learned from TikTok\n- Best song of 2022 so far\n- Best song you've seen performed live\n- Songs to sing in the shower\n- Instrumentals\n \nGameplay:\n- Players submit a song that matches a theme\n- The app will create an anonymous, shuffled Spotify playlist (an Spotify account is required.  A free account works, but note that Spotify will add songs to any playlist with less than 15 songs)\n- Players vote for which songs they like best or that fits the theme best\n- Players can comment on songs as they vote\n- When the votes are in, you are able to see who submitted which songs and all of the comments that were left\n- A champion is crowned for each round… updating the leaderboard along the way\n- An overall champion for each Music League is named after the last round\n- You’ll also see who gave you the most love…and the least!\n \nFeatures:\nMusic League is always evolving. Features have been added along the way and more will be coming."

      "label": "Tune musical instruments (guitar, violin, viola, bass, piano, cello, flute and many more) with this simple chromatic tuner. Tuner T1 also comes with a handy Tone Generator that plays any musical note as a ​reference for tuning. A must-have tool for musicians.\n\n• Simple to use with all the essential features.\n• Extremely accurate (can be tuned to an accuracy of ±0.1 cents).\n• Tone generator that can generate reference tones over a note-range of 3 octaves.\n• Ability to set the frequency of A₄ (for tunings where A₄ is not 440 hertz).\n• Option to set detection latency - By setting a lower latency value, pitch detection will be faster. This works great for cases like vocal practice. By using a higher latency, pitch detection will not respond to momentary unintended sounds and noise (works great for instrument tuning)."

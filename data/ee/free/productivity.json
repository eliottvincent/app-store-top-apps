Back up and sync your pictures, videos, documents, and other files to cloud storage and access them from any device, anywhere. With advanced sharing features, it’s easy to share and send photos or files to family, friends, and co-workers.\n\nFeatures:\n• Automatically upload videos and photos from your camera roll to cloud photo storage—all in the background—for easy video sharing and photo sharing.\n• Access any file in your account—even offline—and preview over 175 different file types with no special software required.\n• Easily send large files by copying and pasting a link you can give to anyone, even if they don’t have a Dropbox account.\n• Scan documents, receipts, IDs, photos, and more using your mobile device and transform them into high-quality PDFs, so you can view and send anywhere.\n• Sync folders on your PC or Mac to Dropbox with computer backup, and recover older versions or restore deleted files with version history and file recovery.\n\nSign up now for your free Dropbox Plus trial. You’ll get 2 TB (2,000 GB) of storage space—that’s enough room to save files from all your linked devices. We’ve also introduced some new features as part of your Plus plan: Dropbox Passwords to store and sync passwords across all your devices and Dropbox Vault to secure and organize your most sensitive documents. And with Dropbox Rewind, you can roll back any file, folder, or your entire account, up to 30 days.\n\nExisting Plus customers can upgrade to Dropbox Professional. With 3 TB (3,000GB), you can store all your stuff—from work projects to personal photos—and have space to spare. You and your clients can comment on most file types without leaving Dropbox. And you can protect your work with a watermark, add shared link controls, or rewind your account up to 180 days.\n\nBefore starting a trial or completing payment, you’ll see the plan price. This amount will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and on renewal and will vary by plan and country. Dropbox subscriptions renew monthly or yearly, depending on your plan. Your account will be charged for renewal 24 hours before the end of your current billing period. To avoid auto-renewal, turn it off in at least 24 hours before your subscription renews. You can turn off auto-renewal anytime from your iTunes account settings.

      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n\nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\n\nMulti factor authentication (MFA)provides a second layer of security. When enabled, during login after entering your password, you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The OTP codes have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The OTP doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n\nGetting started with passwordless\n\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nGetting started with autofill\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n\nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\n\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain organization resources. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each."

There is nothing superfluous in the VK Mail app, such as ads. Just what you need for comfortable work with emails. \n\nSmart sorting. VK Mail automatically sorts newsletters, notifications from social nets, news and emails to yourself into folders. Everything is neatly organized and easy to find. \n\nCustom filters. Set your own filters for a clean and orderly inbox. You can set them so that emails from the selected senders are moved straight to dedicated folders or trash and are marked as read. \n\nThe unsubscribe wizard. All your newsletters are collected on one page to make it easy to unsubscribe from the ones you don't need. Go to your account settings, select \"Manage Newsletters\" and unsubscribe from those newsletters which you don't read. \n\nReliable protection. Powerful spam filters and email login confirmation via SMS, PIN, Touch ID or Face ID. You can choose an access protection method in the app settings and settings for personal data. \n\nAll email accounts in one place. If you already have an account with Mail.ru, Gmail, Yahoo, Yandex or another service, connect them in the VK Mail app and switch between them in a couple of taps. To add an account, tap “”Account” and “+”. \n\nQuick swipe actions. You can work with emails without even opening them! Swipe the message from left to right and select an action for this gesture: delete the message, mark it as read or move to spam. \n\nSending large files. You can attach an entire movie or all photos from your vacation to an email: VK Mail can send files up to 2GB without compressing them and turning them into links. \n\nCool themes from VK. Themes from VK will help you express your style and give your inbox an appealing look without distracting attention from emails. And there is also a dark theme to make reading emails at night more comfortable. You can choose a design in the account settings. \n\nCatchy address. Come up with a terse and expressive name with the domain @vk.com, and your email will be easy to remember — both for you and your recipients. \n\nDownload VK Mail, configure it as you like, and use it as a single email client for accounts from any services: Gmail, Yandex, Rambler, Mail.ru and many others."

Zero-log policy, traffic encryption, IP and DNS masking. These all mean that third parties are not able to monitor you any longer, and that your privacy is reliably secured from obtrusive website and ISP surveillance.\n\n+70 LOCATIONS\nOur high-speed VPN servers in 70+ locations all over the globe, as well as our enhanced KeepSolid Wise technology, allow you to freely surf the web without giving out a single piece of your personal information, including your current location. Don’t let websites discriminate you based on the way you surf the internet or the place you browse it from.\n\nTOTAL SECURITY\nWe offers a variety of VPN protocols, each with unique capabilities and strengths. Just choose the one you would like to try. For instance:\nOpenVPN - an extremely secure and highly configurable protocol that uses a wide range of encryption algorithms (including AES-256).\nIKEv2 - a secure and easy-to-setup protocol that can effectively change networks and re-establish VPN connection if it was temporarily lost. It provides a significantly higher connection speed and a better performance.\n\nWe offer three recurring subscription options: \n- 1 Month, 3 months, 1 Year\n- Subscriptions will auto-renew unless canceled.\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n- No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n- Your account will be charged for renewal for the amount of your current subscription within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. All costs for subscriptions are mentioned above.\n\nPrivacy policies : https://luni.app/support/vpn_privacy\nTerms of use : https://luni.app/support/vpn_terms\n\nDisclaimer: We have had reports that our VPN service might be blocked in the countries listed below:\n- China\n- UAE\n- Saudi Arabia\n- Iraq\n- Iran\n- Turkmenistan\n- Turkey\n\nWhile we can’t say that it’s totally impossible to connect in the mentioned locations, there are a few challenges to overcome."

      "label": "LastPass Authenticator offers effortless two-factor authentication for your LastPass account and other supported apps. With one-tap verification and secure cloud backup, LastPass Authenticator gives you all the security, without any of the frustration. \n\nADD MORE SECURITY \nSafeguard your LastPass account by requiring two-factor authentication codes when signing in. Two-factor authentication improves your digital security by protecting your account with an additional login step. Even if your password is compromised, your account can’t be accessed without the two-factor authentication code. \n\nYou can even mark a device as “trusted”, so you won’t be prompted for codes on that device while your account remains protected by two-factor authentication. \n\nTURNING IT ON \nTo turn on LastPass Authenticator for your LastPass account: \n\n1. Download LastPass Authenticator to your mobile device. \n2. Log in to LastPass on your computer and launch “Account Settings” from your vault. \n3. In “Multifactor Options”, edit LastPass Authenticator and view the barcode. \n4. Scan the barcode with the LastPass Authenticator app. \n5. Set your preferences and save your changes. \n\nLastPass Authenticator can also be turned on for any service or app that supports Google Authenticator or TOTP-based two-factor authentication.\n\nLOGGING IN \nTo login to your LastPass account or other supported vendor service: \n1. Open the app to generate a 6-digit, 30-second code OR approve/deny an automated push notification \n2. Alternatively, send SMS code \n3. Enter the code into the login prompt on your device OR hit approve/deny request \n\nFEATURES \n- Generates 6-digit codes every 30 seconds \n- Push notifications for one-tap approval\n- Free encrypted backup to restore your tokens on a new/reinstalled device \n- Support for SMS codes \n- Automated set-up via QR code \n- Support for LastPass accounts \n- Support for other TOTP-compatible services and apps (including any that support Google Authenticator) \n- Add multiple accounts"

Services are provided as-is, and are subject to change or discontinuation at any time. This functionality does have privacy implications. Please see this app's online documentation and http://Live.RaceRender.com before enabling its use. Use of Live Streaming service requires an Internet connection, and is therefore subject to your wireless carrier and/or Internet provider's data rates.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

A row with 1 player is treated as a bye. Example: The clipboard\n\nMia, Dean, Tyler, Luca\nDenise, Michael, Marvin, Lena\nLouis\n\nwill be parsed as \n\n1. Mia and Dean vs. Tyler and Luca\n2. Denise and Michael vs. Marvin and Lena\n\nLouis gets a bye. Please avoid any typos as the app compares the names with known players.\n\nNote: On saving the table or rounds as HTML, the app also copies the unformatted data to the clipboard.

It is possible to associate a referee and a score on the objectives, with the combination of one or more secondary objectives of the action type; it will also be possible to indicate the presence of a window of engagement, validity and visibility.\n\nSigns: each objective created automatically generates a sign. Waypoints and Recons generate a sign with a QR code or a numeric code. The team will be able to acquire the score by scanning or by returning the code to the device. Infiltration and exfiltration signs can be generated, which sanction the start and end of the game for each team. The signs are generated in a printable PDF.\nInterdiction patrols: you can assign a number and a name to the interdiction patrols, with the list of players that make it up. For the patrol, as for the objectives, it is possible to define a referee.\n\nScores: scores can be associated to each objective (engagement, conquest, defenders eliminated, out-of-window penalties, highlanders, operators not in pairs etc…). Scores are divided into positive and negative, self-calculating scores that occur under certain conditions, and scores awarded by referees to assign game penalties.\nReferees: management of a registry of referees in order to assign them objectives or interdiction patrols, and to be able to contact them by phone call or text message directly from the app. Referees can also be secondary admins of the tournament.\nMap: visualization of the topographic map with realtime position of objectives, referees and teams in play.\nMonitoring and ranking: when the tournament has started the referees can enter the results of the engagements via the app, with the effective duration of the window and any penalties.

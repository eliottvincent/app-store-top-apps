      "label": "tonybet™ Official App of Online Casino and Sportsbook\nThere are not so many names bigger than tonybet in the European betting market and lots of people tune in to wager on sports and casino games every day. It's easy to see why the platform is so popular, given its many great markets, approval from the gaming commission, lots of bonuses, and country-specific payment methods. What's more, you can use your phone to access all the bookie's features and enjoy mobile wagering.\nYou can browse the markets and games right now without creating an account. Expect to see all popular disciplines and titles, but also many obscure ones and even eSports. If you're a live bettor, the sportsbook caters to your needs and offers loads of in-play sports betting options. To help you decide whether you want to sign up, we’ve prepared this review.\nThis is one of the most user-friendly betting apps out there, from the aesthetic to responsiveness. All markets are listed on the left side of the page, while the main categories sit at the very top of the app. Right now, you can’t download the app, even though it's in development. You can simply open the web browser and scroll through your wagering choices on your mobile device, sign in or sign up, and place your single and accumulator bets.\ntonybet has a ton of betting games and lottery products to choose from, including your local leagues, provincial lottery events, and the biggest meetings. Even though the choice is massive, it doesn't feel overwhelming – when you pick a sport or games lottery, you just see a neat table with all the info you need to know to place your bet. This is heaven for players who seek out different markets.\nSome people prefer to watch international games, while others are interested in small matches that don't have a big following. Whether your choice might be, expect to see dozens of sports betting options, including live props, in the app.\nOne of the strongest sides of this and some other offshore sportsbooks is the best odds on national gaming events. They offer handicaps that have low juice. Parlay and accumulator odds are above average, while other markets are fair. Both fixed sports betting odds and live lines are on offer for the majority of events.\nThis betting app offers a welcome bonus for new players and has plenty of promotions for regulars. But first things first, this is how you get your sign up bonus and withdraw your winnings:\n1.   The minimum deposit amount is €/$10.\n2.   Receive a 100% match first deposit bonus up to €/$100.\n3.   Play through your bonus five times by placing single bets on matches with betting odds of 1.5 or higher.\n4.   Get rid of the wagering requirement and withdraw your winnings.\nThe best options for getting prize cash and free bets can change from time to time, so it's a good idea to come and check them for yourself. Right now, the biggest deal for legal sports betting loyal players can get is the Forecast:\n1.   To get the best bonus, you should deposit at least €/$20 in the last 5 days.\n2.   Select the outcomes of proposed single game options and press the ‘Make Forecast’ button.\n3.   If you get 10 outcomes correctly, you will get €/$1,000 as free bets.\n4.   Guess 9 outcomes and receive €/$100.\n5.   Get €/$50 for getting the right 8 outcomes.\nWe suggest you keep an eye on their deals because new short-term offers pop up all the time. Besides, they can have bonus codes that you need to enter before depositing money.\n\nBets with tonybet are not affiliated with or provided by Apple. \ntonybet is a sponsor of major international sporting events. Install the tonybet app and win with us!\n#BeGambleAware - https://www.begambleaware.org"

You receive sweet spot run training guidance that will train you to improve your performance and continually build on those gains for weeks, months, and even years at a time.\n\nThrough a combination of advanced sensor technology and an automated training ecosystem, you will be given your personalized & optimal training routine, stride-by-stride guidance during every run, and in-depth insights that help all runners, from beginners to Olympic champions, regularly push their running performance to the next level.\n\nHow to start with Stryd:\n\nNew to Stryd? This app requires the Stryd pod in order to use the app.\nAlready have Stryd? You can sign in with your Stryd account, pair your pod, and get started with the app.\n\nPerfect Pacing During Every Run:\n\nStryd accounts for your speed, slope, run form, fatigue, and wind to deliver perfect, precise, and painless pacing. This is accomplished with the Stryd pod. The pod is filled with motion & environmental sensors that comprehensively determine your running effort in nearly every running condition. With this info, you can evenly pace every run, which means you get the performance enhancing benefits from each training session — without undue fatigue.\n\nSweet Spot Training Every Day:\n\nStryd learns who you are as a runner and then prescribes daily training that is personalized to your current fitness. Next, you can import these workouts on your sportswatch and receive stride-by-stride guidance so you run at the right performance-enhancing intensity from start to finish. You stay in the training sweet spot, where you are perfectly balancing stress and rest, so that you receive the maximal benefits from each session and continue to improve.\n\nAutomated Insights That Keep You Improving:\n\nStryd analyzes and compares your similar training sessions against each other to let you know how your fitness is trending. You will know how much your recent training is paying off if you are moving in the right direction. If there is an opportunity to do better, you can quickly identify if you need to update your routine so you can keep the improvements coming.\n\nContinually Beat Your Race Times:\n\nStryd plans your perfect race for you. Stryd can account for the unique layout of your race course, the weather, the altitude, your skillset, and your overall fitness to prescribe a race plan that will ensure you perform at your peak capability. You will step up to the starting line with confidence knowing that you will run your best race possible.\n\n-----\n\nNote that, Stryd uses GPS in the background to track your running distance and pace, and continued use of GPS running in the background can decrease battery life. Stryd also integrates with the Health app in order to get access to the heart rate data from Apple Watch.\n\nAdditionally, Stryd integrates with Apple Health. This allows Stryd to automatically update your weight, access your heart rate data, and save activity data to your Health app."

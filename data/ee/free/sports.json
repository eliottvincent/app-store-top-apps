Record GPS sessions with your phone or Apple Watch, and/or clip on a WOO,  and play the games you love not on the couch, but in the great outdoors, being active. Available games include Kite - Big Air, where riders battle for highest jump, Kite - Freestyle, where landing freestyle tricks with a low kite ups your score, and Kite - Freeride (100% free!), where riders can post GPS session.\n\nEvery game puts your riding on the global stage. Post a session to share, compare, and compete with riders worldwide. Everyone from local first-timers to international pros are posting their sessions, progressing their riding and sharing the stoke. Join the WOO community and see how you stack up on the leaderboards!\n\nThe WOO Sports App is available for iPhone 4S and higher, running iOS 8 and higher.  You can record and post a Freeride GPS session with your Apple Watch, with no WOO sensor or PRO subscription needed - it is 100% free!  To post a Big Air, Big Air Analytics or Freestyle session, a WOO sensor needs to be recording during your session. The WOO 1.0 sensor supports the Kite - Big Air game only, the WOO 2.0 sensor supports all games except Freeride, the WOO 3.0 sensor supports all games except Freeride and includes an integration with your Apple Watch to show live jumps.\n\nOrder your WOO 3.0 at http://shop.woosports.com/\n\nWOO PRO\nWOO PRO is a Membership that expands what’s possible with WOO. With the 3.0 and your iPhone or Apple Watch at the foundation, WOO PRO takes the platform in new directions, to help you improve your technique, feel safer on the water, and feel more connected to the community, all while keeping games as the driving force for what makes WOO so dang addicting.  With Analytics, Live, Safety, Crew and Games, WOO PRO is a great addition to your WOO experience.\n\n\nThe WOO PRO Membership is available with a monthly or annual subscription.\n\n\nPayment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. Your subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current subscription period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current subscription period. Automatic renewals will cost the same price you were originally charged for the subscription. You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings on the App Store after purchase. Read our terms of service and privacy policy for more information.\n\nhttps://woosports.com/terms-conditions \nhttps://woosports.com/privacy-policy/\n\n\n==============================\nNote: To post a GPS session or Analytics+ session with the WOO PRO Membership, GPS is required. iPads and iPods will not be able to record with WOO Sports. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nNote: This app integrates with Health Kit and the Apple Health app."

The SIGMA RIDE app is an important addition to the SIGMA GPS bike computer and the perfect companion for navigation and for achieving your personal goals! Reach and surpass your training goals. Track your speed, the distance you have travelled, your current and upcoming altitudes, the calories you´ve burned. The SIGMA RIDE app gives you an overview of all of your training, shows you your statistics, and motivates you to pursue a fitter, healthier lifestyle. Share your experiences and successes with friends and family using your social networks.\n\n\nBe there live!\nRecord your bike data with your SIGMA bike computer and analyse them right away with the LIVE screen. Have the computer display your route and current GPS position to you on the map. Distance travelled, training time elapsed, and metres of altitude uphill are also displayed, including an altitude profile. You can set your individual training views easily while you're riding or use one of the preprogrammed views.\n\n\nE-Mobility\nYou ride an e-bike? No problem: the SIGMA RIDE app is e-bike-ready. Your battery level and e-bike assist modes can be displayed on your smartphone. They can also be shown as an easy-to-read heat map, which presents data in colour and offers a better overview.\n\n\nAn eye on everything\nLook at the precise details of every tour in the activity screen. Filter according to sport types and share your activities with your friends and the community via e-mail or on platforms such as Strava, komoot, Training Peaks, Facebook, and Twitter. Record your progress and see where you have improved. Ride data such as speed can be displayed as a heat map. Various coloured fields provide a quick overview of your performance and make it easy to detect outlying values. You can also record weather data and your subjective perception of the ride.\n\n\nOff to an adventure by using track navigation and the Search & Go function\nWith \"Search & Go Navigation\", you can quickly find any location and navigate there. To do this, you can either enter an address in the SIGMA RIDE app on your smartphone or click on any point on the map. Start the created track directly on your bike computer or save it in the SIGMA RIDE app.\nYou can also import tracks from the SIGMA DATA CENTER or from portals such as komoot and Strava via the SIGMA RIDE app. The selected track can be started immediately or it can be saved on the bike computer and cycled offline at a later time.\n\n\nAlways up-to-date: \nFirmware updates for your bike computer are easy with the SIGMA RIDE app, which informs you whenever a new update is available. Then simply follow the instructions on your phone.\n\n\nCompatible devices:\n- SIGMA ROX 11.1 EVO\n- SIGMA ROX 4.0\n- SIGMA ROX 2.0\n- VDO R4 GPS\n- VDO R5 GPS"

      "label": "CrewNerd turns your cell phone into an on-the-water training tool in any rowing shell, canoe, kayak or dragon boat - with no wiring! With a waterproof case, you can get real-time data during your workout and even relay it to your coach.\n\nUsing the accelerometer in your device, CrewNerd is able to accurately calculate your stroke rate as well as how much bounce (vertical movement) and stern check you are producing. Speed, pace and distance are calculated via GPS.\n\nNOTE: CrewNerd Lite works exactly like the full version but is limited to 100 strokes or 5 minutes of use each time you run the application. In CrewNerd Lite, you also have the option of eliminating the trial mode restrictions by purchasing a 30-day subscription which can be renewed indefinitely.\n\n• Configurable display\n\nIn landscape mode there are up to six configurable data fields, and in portrait mode there are up to ten. Choose from the following:\n• Stroke rate\n• Elapsed time\n• Distance\n• Speed or pace\n• Average speed or pace\n• Heart rate\n• Stroke count\n• Interval count\n• Meters per stroke\n• Total distance\n• Projected time and distance\n• Check\n• Bounce\n• Course (direction)\n• Time of day\n\nSet the top line to be double-height to make the most important data stand out. In portrait mode, the top two lines can both be made double-height.\n\n• Custom workouts\n\nSelect from one of the provided workouts, or create your own based on distance, time or strokes. An auto-start feature starts the timer when the first stroke is taken, or you can set a “countdown” of 15 or 30 seconds before the timer starts to allow you to build up speed before starting a piece.\n\n• Custom courses\n\nCreate custom by plotting your start and finish lines on a map. The application will start the timer automatically when you cross the start line and stop when you reach the finish.

Bowling Ball Arsenal\n7. Notes\n8. Score Calculator\n9. Spare Names\n\n---\n\n1. Angles & Targeting\n\nPlan & visualize a shot from the start of your approach to your target, helping you become more accurate and consistent.⁠ Add overlays, such as entry angle, focal point, distance markers, and save favorite shots.\n\nVideo mode can apply all the above to previously recorded videos, or use camera more when practicing, with up to 30sec delay, for continuous action replay of every shot.\n\n---\n\n2. Axis Tilt & Rotation\n\nTake a photo or video of your ball with a PAP (Positive Axis Point) marker and position it in the guide for your approximate axis tilt and rotation.  Great for working on control & consistency.⁠\n\n---\n\n3. Ball Speed & RPM\n\nIn simple mode use the start/stop button to calculate ball speed in real time.Advanced mode can load in a video for more accuracy, and rev-rate calculation.⁠\n\n---\n\n4. Observation Trainer\n\nWhen we let go of the ball, many of us immediately look up to see the end result at the pins. We don't see the journey the ball takes to, and through, the pins, so don’t see differences between pocket hits that do and don’t carry. ⁠\n⁠\nPractice ANYWHERE with the Observation Trainer and learn to focus on four key points of every shot that give you the info you need to make better decisions and start striking more.\n\n---\n\n5. Pattern Library\n\nInstant access to details & diagrams of hundreds of oil patterns, or enter your own custom patterns. Load any pattern into Angles & Targeting to plot your shot directly over it and plan how you'll attack the lanes.\n\n---\n\n6. Bowling Ball Arsenal\n\nSearchable library of over 1,500 balls and a way to manage your own arsenal. Organise balls into separate bags and keep track of information such as surface, layout, important dates and more. When looking for something new, use the Ball Library to find exactly what you want, with filters for brand, cover & core types, RG, Diff and more.\n\n---\n\n7. Notes\n\nKeep track of information about your game and equipment. Create general notes, or add notes from within most of the other tools, such as for oil patterns, your bowling balls, Speed & RPM readings, Observation Trainer scores and more.\n\n---\n\n8. Score Calculator\n\nWhether earning how scoring works, teaching youth bowlers how to score, or just giving your brain a rest at a Triple-X fun night, there's lots of reasons the Score Calculator can come in handy!\n\n---\n\n9. Spare Names\n\nJust for fun, tap the pins to see nicknames of common spares you probably don’t want to be leaving!\n\n---\n\n\n\"Every bowler should have Tenpin Toolkit on every device they own.  It’s an incredible information source and provides so many things to help you learn, get better and challenge yourself.\"\n\nTim Mack\nUSBC Hall of Famer & Storm Director of Global Relations\n\n---\n\n\"A brilliant app with tools to help you develop and learn different skills. The observation trainer is a great way to train your eyes to start watching your ball go down the lane\"\n\nVerity Crawley\nPWBA Professional & SCAD Team Coach\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\nPremium features can be unlocked with an in-app subscription.

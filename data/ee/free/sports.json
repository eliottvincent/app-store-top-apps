      "label": "tonybet™ Official App of Online Casino and Sportsbook\nThere are not so many names bigger than tonybet in the European betting market and lots of people tune in to wager on sports and casino games every day. It's easy to see why the platform is so popular, given its many great markets, approval from the gaming commission, lots of bonuses, and country-specific payment methods. What's more, you can use your phone to access all the bookie's features and enjoy mobile wagering.\nYou can browse the markets and games right now without creating an account. Expect to see all popular disciplines and titles, but also many obscure ones and even eSports. If you're a live bettor, the sportsbook caters to your needs and offers loads of in-play sports betting options. To help you decide whether you want to sign up, we’ve prepared this review.\nThis is one of the most user-friendly betting apps out there, from the aesthetic to responsiveness. All markets are listed on the left side of the page, while the main categories sit at the very top of the app. Right now, you can’t download the app, even though it's in development. You can simply open the web browser and scroll through your wagering choices on your mobile device, sign in or sign up, and place your single and accumulator bets.\ntonybet has a ton of betting games and lottery products to choose from, including your local leagues, provincial lottery events, and the biggest meetings. Even though the choice is massive, it doesn't feel overwhelming – when you pick a sport or games lottery, you just see a neat table with all the info you need to know to place your bet. This is heaven for players who seek out different markets.\nSome people prefer to watch international games, while others are interested in small matches that don't have a big following. Whether your choice might be, expect to see dozens of sports betting options, including live props, in the app.\nOne of the strongest sides of this and some other offshore sportsbooks is the best odds on national gaming events. They offer handicaps that have low juice. Parlay and accumulator odds are above average, while other markets are fair. Both fixed sports betting odds and live lines are on offer for the majority of events.\nThis betting app offers a welcome bonus for new players and has plenty of promotions for regulars. But first things first, this is how you get your sign up bonus and withdraw your winnings:\n1.   The minimum deposit amount is €/$10.\n2.   Receive a 100% match first deposit bonus up to €/$100.\n3.   Play through your bonus five times by placing single bets on matches with betting odds of 1.5 or higher.\n4.   Get rid of the wagering requirement and withdraw your winnings.\nThe best options for getting prize cash and free bets can change from time to time, so it's a good idea to come and check them for yourself. Right now, the biggest deal for legal sports betting loyal players can get is the Forecast:\n1.   To get the best bonus, you should deposit at least €/$20 in the last 5 days.\n2.   Select the outcomes of proposed single game options and press the ‘Make Forecast’ button.\n3.   If you get 10 outcomes correctly, you will get €/$1,000 as free bets.\n4.   Guess 9 outcomes and receive €/$100.\n5.   Get €/$50 for getting the right 8 outcomes.\nWe suggest you keep an eye on their deals because new short-term offers pop up all the time. Besides, they can have bonus codes that you need to enter before depositing money.\n\nBets with tonybet are not affiliated with or provided by Apple. \ntonybet is a sponsor of major international sporting events. Install the tonybet app and win with us!\n#BeGambleAware - https://www.begambleaware.org"

In contrast to other apps on the market, we have speciallized in creating a tournament generator that can handle low, high or uneven number of players.\n\nTHE SCORING SYSTEM\nBased on a predetermined number of points per game (e.g. 21 points) the team that takes the most number of points will be the winner of the match. This also means that being the winner or loser of the match is irrelevant. The reason for this is that each point counts in your individual results. As a player you should always aim to get as many points as possible, it will not be the same to win 20 to 1 than 11 to 10.\n\nHOW TO WIN IN AMERICANO\nTo become the winner of the Padel Americano you have to not only rely on your technical and tactical skills, but also a high level of adaption and coordination with your different teammates throughout the tournament.\n\n\nTerms of Use (EULA):\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

      "label": "CarTest is a tool app that measures acceleration performance of cars, motorcycles.\nYou can easily measure times such as 0-60 mph, 0-1/4 mile by CarTest.\nIt is useful for not only measuring full throttle performance but also knowing the usual acceleration on public road for safe driving.\nPlease use it with safety first. Please comply with the law when using it on public roads.\n\n(How to use)\n1. Fix the iPhone (or iPad with GPS) with CarTest installed on the dashboard of your car so that it does not sway. If your iPhone doesn't fall while accelerating, you can just put it on the dashboard or center console. When using it on a motorcycle, install it on the handlebar or fuel tank.\n2. Tap the Start button (or Start / Repeat button). If the car is stopping, “In Prep\" is displayed, and if the car is moving or the device isn’t capturing GPS signal, \"Waiting for Stop\" is displayed. (If the device isn’t capturing GPS signal, \"GPS\" mark to the left of the CarTest logo shows in thin gray.)\n3. When the message “Ready Go!\" Is displayed, start at your own timing. You will be notified by sound at the same time as the display. When your car starts, measurement starts and \"Measurement Started\" is displayed. The screen becomes a green image during measurement.\n4. If your car decelerate during measurement, the measurement will finish and \"Finished\" will be displayed.\n5. If the Start / Repeat button was tapped, when the speed drops near a stop, \"Waiting for Stop\" is displayed to prepare for the next measurement.\n\n(Button function)\nStop: The measurement will end immediately.\nStart: Makes the measurement only once.\nStart Repeat: Repeats the measurement. It is convenient for repeated measurement in urban areas where there are many signals.\nshare: A window opens to share the displayed result.\n▲newer: After displaying the past result with ▼older button, tap this button to return to the newer results.\n▼older: Displays past results from the stored history.\nkm/h / mph: Selects the unit of speed\n↑ / ↓: Page scroll. These buttons are enable when there are other results behind while viewing history.\n\n(Measurement range)\nkm/h: From 0-20 km/h to unlimited every 20 km/h. 0-400 m. 0-1 km.\nmph: From 0-10 mph to unlimited every 10 mph. 0-1/4 mile. 0-1 km.\n\n(Large speed display on the screen)\nYou can turn it on and off by tapping the Stop button twice in the stopping state (when neither the Start button nor the Start / Repeat button is tapped).\n\n(Sensitivity setting of start sensing)\nIn the stopping state, tap buttons “Stop → ▲newer → ▼older → ▲newer → ▲newer\" to open the setting window at the top of the screen. You can select 5 levels of sensitivity. Adjust if there are many false start sensing or if the response is slow. Probably no adjustment is necessary.\n\n(Note)\n1000 cases of measurement history are stored even if you quit CarTest.\nWhen you uninstall and reinstall CarTest, the stored measurement history will be deleted.\nDark mode compatible.\nNo advertisement in the app.\nCarTest does not work on iPads without GPS.\nIf the GPS signal is weak, the operation may become unstable.\nThe developer assumes no responsibility for any accident, violation, loss or claims by third parties which may arise from the use of this app.\n\n   CarTest - Performance Tester\n   Ⓒ 2020 Takao Ichimura"

      "label": "DragRacing is an app that measures times in a drag racing machine on road without measurement facilities.\nThe app measures times with GPS at 60 Foot, 330 Foot, 660 Foot, 1000 Foot, 1/4 mile and 1/2 mile.\nIt is a very useful app for test run or training of drag racing!\nPlease use it with safety first. Please comply with the law when using it on public roads.\n\n(How to use)\n1. Fix the iPhone (or iPad with GPS) with DragRacing installed on the dashboard of your car so that it does not sway. If your iPhone doesn't fall while accelerating, you can just put it on the dashboard or center console.\n2. Tap the Start button (or Start / Repeat button). If the car is stopping, “In Prep\" is displayed, and if the car is moving or the device isn’t capturing GPS signal, \"Waiting for Stop\" is displayed. (If the device isn’t capturing GPS signal, \"GPS\" mark to the left of the DragRacing logo shows in thin gray.)\n3. When the message “Ready Go!\" Is displayed, start at your own timing. You will be notified by sound at the same time as the display. When your car starts, measurement starts and \"Measurement Started\" is displayed. The screen becomes a green image during measurement.\n4. If your car decelerate during measurement, the measurement will finish and \"Finished\" will be displayed.\n5. If the Start / Repeat button was tapped, when the speed drops near a stop, \"Waiting for Stop\" is displayed to prepare for the next measurement.\n\n(Button function)\nStop: The measurement will end immediately.\nStart: Makes the measurement only once.\nStart Repeat: Repeats the measurement. It is convenient for repeated measurement in urban areas where there are many signals.\nshare: A window opens to share the displayed result.\n▲newer: After displaying the past result with ▼older button, tap this button to return to the newer results.\n▼older: Displays past results from the stored history.\nkm/h / mph: Selects the unit of speed\n\n(Measurement item)\n- Timing at 60 Foot and 330 Foot\n- Timing and speed at 660 Foot, 1000 Foot, 1/4 mile and 1/2 mile*\n- Timing at 60 mph and 100 km/h*\n- Max speed\n   (* Functionality expansion in-app purchase)\n\n(Large speed display on the screen)\nYou can turn it on and off by tapping the Stop button twice in the stopping state (when neither the Start button nor the Start / Repeat button is tapped).\n\n(Sensitivity setting of start sensing)\nIn the stopping state, tap buttons “Stop → ▲newer → ▼older → ▲newer → ▲newer\" to open the setting window at the top of the screen. You can select 5 levels of sensitivity. Adjust if there are many false start sensing or if the response is slow. Probably no adjustment is necessary.\n\n(Note)\n- 1000 cases of measurement history are stored.\n- When you uninstall and reinstall DragRacing, the stored measurement history will be deleted.\n- Dark mode compatible.\n- No advertisement in the app.\n- The app does not work on iPads without GPS.\n- If the GPS signal is weak, the operation may become unstable.\n- The developer assumes no responsibility for any accident, violation, loss or claims by third parties which may arise from the use of this app.\n\n   Drag Racing Timing: DragRacing\n   Ⓒ 2021 Takao Ichimura"

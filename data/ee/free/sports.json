      "label": "The APP of Dolomiti Superski is supposed to be a real online ski guide for those who want to discover the world’s largest ski carousel and is supported by all the operating systems of the most common smart phones. It has new graphics and a modern navigation: horizontal movements (swipe) allow users to switch from one of the 12 ski areas of Dolomiti Superski to the next in numerical order, while vertical movements (scroll) lead to various menu options, functions and services within the chosen ski area. If the GPS function of the device is activated, when the APP is launched, the system will lead to a contents page for the Dolomiti Superski ski area in which the user is located. One can login through the \"MyDolomiti\" community, after having registered (free of charge) to use the services. The APP offers useful information such as the open/closed status of individual lifts and slopes in real time, opening hours of the lifts, breaks, weather forecasts, points of interest such as ski schools, ski rentals, infopoints, Pick-up Box, as well as descriptions and contacts. \r\nThe user will also find other interesting and popular functions, such as the Performance Check, Tracking option to record the route taken while skiing, Routing which will navigate you to a predetermined point on the slopes. By reaching certain goals with the \"Tracking\" function, the user will be assigned interesting Badges - a great way to challenge yourself! And finally, you get to play too since the registered members of the APP-community can also have fun with the APP's game functions, creating their network of friends, who must also be registered members and in possession of a Dolomiti Superski ski pass and challenging each other throughout the ski season.\r\nDiscover the new APP’s full potential watching the video tutorials."

      "label": "tonybet™ Official App of Online Casino and Sportsbook\nThere are not so many names bigger than tonybet in the European betting market and lots of people tune in to wager on sports and casino games every day. It's easy to see why the platform is so popular, given its many great markets, approval from the gaming commission, lots of bonuses, and country-specific payment methods. What's more, you can use your phone to access all the bookie's features and enjoy mobile wagering.\nYou can browse the markets and games right now without creating an account. Expect to see all popular disciplines and titles, but also many obscure ones and even eSports. If you're a live bettor, the sportsbook caters to your needs and offers loads of in-play sports betting options. To help you decide whether you want to sign up, we’ve prepared this review.\nThis is one of the most user-friendly betting apps out there, from the aesthetic to responsiveness. All markets are listed on the left side of the page, while the main categories sit at the very top of the app. Right now, you can’t download the app, even though it's in development. You can simply open the web browser and scroll through your wagering choices on your mobile device, sign in or sign up, and place your single and accumulator bets.\ntonybet has a ton of betting games and lottery products to choose from, including your local leagues, provincial lottery events, and the biggest meetings. Even though the choice is massive, it doesn't feel overwhelming – when you pick a sport or games lottery, you just see a neat table with all the info you need to know to place your bet. This is heaven for players who seek out different markets.\nSome people prefer to watch international games, while others are interested in small matches that don't have a big following. Whether your choice might be, expect to see dozens of sports betting options, including live props, in the app.\nOne of the strongest sides of this and some other offshore sportsbooks is the best odds on national gaming events. They offer handicaps that have low juice. Parlay and accumulator odds are above average, while other markets are fair. Both fixed sports betting odds and live lines are on offer for the majority of events.\nThis betting app offers a welcome bonus for new players and has plenty of promotions for regulars. But first things first, this is how you get your sign up bonus and withdraw your winnings:\n1.   The minimum deposit amount is €/$10.\n2.   Receive a 100% match first deposit bonus up to €/$100.\n3.   Play through your bonus five times by placing single bets on matches with betting odds of 1.5 or higher.\n4.   Get rid of the wagering requirement and withdraw your winnings.\nThe best options for getting prize cash and free bets can change from time to time, so it's a good idea to come and check them for yourself. Right now, the biggest deal for legal sports betting loyal players can get is the Forecast:\n1.   To get the best bonus, you should deposit at least €/$20 in the last 5 days.\n2.   Select the outcomes of proposed single game options and press the ‘Make Forecast’ button.\n3.   If you get 10 outcomes correctly, you will get €/$1,000 as free bets.\n4.   Guess 9 outcomes and receive €/$100.\n5.   Get €/$50 for getting the right 8 outcomes.\nWe suggest you keep an eye on their deals because new short-term offers pop up all the time. Besides, they can have bonus codes that you need to enter before depositing money.\n\nBets with tonybet are not affiliated with or provided by Apple. \ntonybet is a sponsor of major international sporting events. Install the tonybet app and win with us!\n#BeGambleAware - https://www.begambleaware.org"

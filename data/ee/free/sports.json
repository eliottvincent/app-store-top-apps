It has new graphics and a modern navigation: horizontal movements (swipe) allow users to switch from one of the 12 ski areas of Dolomiti Superski to the next in numerical order, while vertical movements (scroll) lead to various menu options, functions and services within the chosen ski area. If the GPS function of the device is activated, when the APP is launched, the system will lead to a contents page for the Dolomiti Superski ski area in which the user is located. One can login through the \"MyDolomiti\" community, after having registered (free of charge) to use the services. The APP offers useful information such as the open/closed status of individual lifts and slopes in real time, opening hours of the lifts, breaks, weather forecasts, points of interest such as ski schools, ski rentals, infopoints, Pick-up Box, as well as descriptions and contacts. \r\nThe user will also find other interesting and popular functions, such as the Performance Check, Tracking option to record the route taken while skiing, Routing which will navigate you to a predetermined point on the slopes. By reaching certain goals with the \"Tracking\" function, the user will be assigned interesting Badges - a great way to challenge yourself! And finally, you get to play too since the registered members of the APP-community can also have fun with the APP's game functions, creating their network of friends, who must also be registered members and in possession of a Dolomiti Superski ski pass and challenging each other throughout the ski season.\r\nDiscover the new APP’s full potential watching the video tutorials."

An interval timer, which is easy to set up and use. It features a nice plain design, with no unnecessary controls. \n\nAdjust Number of Sets, Action and Break duration to your needs and you are ready to go!\n\nOn the iOS an extra switch control allows you to prevent the screen from dimming.\n\nSIT remembers the last 5 configurations you have used. Swipe left across the Settings screen to switch to another configuration.\n\nSIT can run in the background, while you are playing music, watching videos or doing anything else on your iOS device.\n\nSIT Watch features the same simplicity as the iOS app while offering the same functionality, plus it will measure your heartbeat during the workout sessions. The recordings will be available in the Apple's Health app.\n\nSIT Watch runs independently of the phone, so no need to have your phone around during your workouts (although you will need your phone during the very first time you launch SIT watch).\n\nSIT lets you avoid any tedious set up and focus on your training!"

Even if you have conventional sonar technology, FishHunter gives you access to shallow and vegetative areas you could not reach by boat."

Abonnementet er månedsbasert og fornyes automatisk 24 timer før fristen utløper. Du styrer selv abonnementet og betaling gjennom Apples iTunes AppStore. NB! Dersom du abonnerer på Livetiming Medley Reader skal du ikke trenge et eget abonnement på denne versjonen. Du må da sørge for å starte den gamle Livetiming Medley Reader jevnlig, for å sikre at det hentes ned korrekt lisensinformasjon.\n\nInformasjon om applikasjonen publiseres på facebook under kortnavnet ltmreader (https://www.facebook.com/ltmreader)\n\nVerktøyet er utviklet uavhengig av Norges Svømmeforbund som en \"fan\" app for livetiming\n\nBetingelser og vilkår: https://spark.adobe.com/page/ssJcNwlDIxQzF/\n\nNB! Det forekommer fra tid til annen feil i data grunlaget fra livetiming og det kan gi noen uventede opplevelser.

      "label": "tonybet™ Official App of Online Casino and Sportsbook\nThere are not so many names bigger than tonybet in the European betting market and lots of people tune in to wager on sports and casino games every day. It's easy to see why the platform is so popular, given its many great markets, approval from the gaming commission, lots of bonuses, and country-specific payment methods. What's more, you can use your phone to access all the bookie's features and enjoy mobile wagering.\nYou can browse the markets and games right now without creating an account. Expect to see all popular disciplines and titles, but also many obscure ones and even eSports. If you're a live bettor, the sportsbook caters to your needs and offers loads of in-play sports betting options. To help you decide whether you want to sign up, we’ve prepared this review.\nThis is one of the most user-friendly betting apps out there, from the aesthetic to responsiveness. All markets are listed on the left side of the page, while the main categories sit at the very top of the app. Right now, you can’t download the app, even though it's in development. You can simply open the web browser and scroll through your wagering choices on your mobile device, sign in or sign up, and place your single and accumulator bets.\ntonybet has a ton of betting games and lottery products to choose from, including your local leagues, provincial lottery events, and the biggest meetings. Even though the choice is massive, it doesn't feel overwhelming – when you pick a sport or games lottery, you just see a neat table with all the info you need to know to place your bet. This is heaven for players who seek out different markets.\nSome people prefer to watch international games, while others are interested in small matches that don't have a big following. Whether your choice might be, expect to see dozens of sports betting options, including live props, in the app.\nOne of the strongest sides of this and some other offshore sportsbooks is the best odds on national gaming events. They offer handicaps that have low juice. Parlay and accumulator odds are above average, while other markets are fair. Both fixed sports betting odds and live lines are on offer for the majority of events.\nThis betting app offers a welcome bonus for new players and has plenty of promotions for regulars. But first things first, this is how you get your sign up bonus and withdraw your winnings:\n1.   The minimum deposit amount is €/$10.\n2.   Receive a 100% match first deposit bonus up to €/$100.\n3.   Play through your bonus five times by placing single bets on matches with betting odds of 1.5 or higher.\n4.   Get rid of the wagering requirement and withdraw your winnings.\nThe best options for getting prize cash and free bets can change from time to time, so it's a good idea to come and check them for yourself. Right now, the biggest deal for legal sports betting loyal players can get is the Forecast:\n1.   To get the best bonus, you should deposit at least €/$20 in the last 5 days.\n2.   Select the outcomes of proposed single game options and press the ‘Make Forecast’ button.\n3.   If you get 10 outcomes correctly, you will get €/$1,000 as free bets.\n4.   Guess 9 outcomes and receive €/$100.\n5.   Get €/$50 for getting the right 8 outcomes.\nWe suggest you keep an eye on their deals because new short-term offers pop up all the time. Besides, they can have bonus codes that you need to enter before depositing money.\n\nBets with tonybet are not affiliated with or provided by Apple. \ntonybet is a sponsor of major international sporting events. Install the tonybet app and win with us!\n#BeGambleAware - https://www.begambleaware.org"

I have worked really hard to provide an app that is both powerful and aesthetically pleasing. The scanner and automatic information detection make Cardstock the easiest way to digitize your collection, the value lookup is the quickest and most accurate way to estimate the true value of your cards, and the ability to share beautiful images of your cards is unrivaled.

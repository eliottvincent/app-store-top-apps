      "label": "The partner that makes you a better player. Master the game like a Pro!\n\nThe use of this application is associated with the purchase of the football training ball SenseBall.\n\nSenseBall is the football (soccer) ball with string developed by CogiTraining, the revolutionary football training method implemented in football clubs and Federations around the world such as the Belgian FA, AC Milan, RSC Anderlecht and FC Metz.\n\nRecommended by professional football players, SenseBall is especially aimed at young players between 6 and 20 years of age. Practising with SenseBall allows improving their football skills and becoming two-footed. SenseBall also improves the performance of all sportspeople for whom high-speed and precision of leg movements are essential (basketball, tennis, skiing, handball…).\n\nThe principle of SenseBall is based on the concept of bilateral activity. Thanks to its specific design, online exercise videos and didactical program, a player practising SenseBall will make an average of 500,000 touches of the ball in a season.\n\nIn a training session, a player uses his left foot as many times as his right and moves through space in a balanced way left/right and backwards/forwards. Whether done individually or in a group (and so rhythmically), the football training ball SenseBall enables developing specific football skills, reacting quicker and gaining in rhythm.\n\nSENSEBALL PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS\n> Improved brain timing : the key to a healthier lifestyle and better learning\n> Perfect ambidextrous performance (two-footed player)\n> Better mastery and control of the ball thanks to repetition (myelin)\n> Greater precision in moving with and touches to the ball\n> Improved perception and coordination\n> Improved attention and concentration (rhythm influences cognitive aptitude)\n> Improved group work and learning (team building)\n> Develops autonomous, self-regulated learning\n> Increases sensitivity to acoustic signals (sonification, the sound of the touch of the ball)\n> Forms the correct body positions for football\n> Prevents the development of postural problems (fewer chronic injuries)\n> Trains players’ kinesthetic ability (millions of touches of the ball)\n> Retrieval models and structures help the brain to learn better and more quickly\n> Improvement of each gesture and movement by visualizing it better (have a clear image of the movement in the brain before putting it into practice)"

      "label": "Play tennis more effectively with fresh, lively strings! \n\nUse \"stringster for tennis\" to analyze the condition and the tension (stringster PLUS) of your strings based on their sound. \n\nWHAT YOU USE IT FOR: \n\n- to monitor your string wear out over time \n- to recognize the appropriate time to restring your racket\n- to check your stringer’s performance\n\nTHE BENEFITS FOR YOU:\n\nPlaying your tennis racket with fresh, \"lively\" strings has decisive advantages:\n\n-\tmore feel for the ball and more controlled strokes\n-\thigher repulsion power\n-\tbetter shock absorption on ball impact reduces the \"tennis elbow\" risk\n\nWhen the strings wear out, feel and control of the ball get lost. This will make your game more insecure. The fun of the game and the performance suffer. \n\nAPP USAGE AND PLUS MEMBERSHIP:\nFree of charge: Monitor the change in the string condition of up to 2 tennis racquets over the course of time. Select them from over 200 current tennis racquet models. And set up an unlimited number of new strings for these two rackets if the old ones are worn out or broken. \n\nstringster PLUS: Monitor the change in the string condition of an unlimited number of tennis racquets. Beyond that access the information on their tension levels in kg or lbs - based on the individual data of over 400 current tennis string models. Including measurement of freely combinable hybrid setups.\n\nStringster PLUS is available for subscription as either monthly, seasonal or yearly auto-renewable subscriptions. Payment will be charged to your App Store account upon the expiration of a free trial period. Subscription automatically renews unless the subscription is canceled or auto-renew turned off at least 24 hours before the expiration of the free trial period or the current subscription period. Subscription may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to App Store account settings after purchase. \n\nTerms of Use (EULA): https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.stringster.net/about-stringster/privacy-protection/"

      "label": "RunCline provides incline information entered manually in the app and transmits it automatically over Bluetooth. Alternatively, it can read incline directly from your smart treadmill. It will also connect to an external foot pod and/or heart rate monitor and re-transmit the collected metrics over Bluetooth. What's the purpose? You can pair the phone or tablet running RunCline with Zwift and get incline, power, speed, cadence and heart rate. RunCline will also display all metrics on screen for you to view during your running. What's even better? Some smart-er treadmills can also be controlled by RunCline to make them track incline from Zwift on PC or Mac. \n\nAs of version 1.6.7, RunCline can also pair with the Apple Watch to get heart rate and display some running metrics. The heart rate feature is using the HealthKit to transmit live heart rate values to RunCline and store them in Apple Health.\n\nRequirements: You need to pair a Bluetooth compliant foot pod and/or supported smart treadmill to RunCline to use the app. Otherwise, you can select the VirtualPod in the list of Foot Pods to use RunCline as a source of speed and incline for Swift.\n\nPairing screen:\n* Select one foot pod in range or smart treadmill (required)\n* Select one heart rate monitor in range (optional)\n* The \"Searching\" button will display \"Start\" once the foot pod device or smart treadmill is paired. If the Start button does not appear within 5 seconds, you may need to activate your foot pod by running or walking.\n\nRunCline screen. The running metrics from the foot pod, smart treadmill and/or heart rate monitor will be displayed on screen and re-transmitted to Zwift over Bluetooth. All running metrics are also saved to a .FIT file that can be emailed or exported after the run.\n\na) Select \"Live\" to display live metrics or \"10-second\" to get average metrics from the past 10 seconds.\nb) Use the + and - buttons to select the incline (if no smart treadmill connected).\nc) You can click the Volume Up and Down buttons on your phone or tablet to get spoken metric values.\n\nRuncline can be used to run outside. It will provide audio cues at every kilometer or mile. If you are running with power, it can provide audio cues to keep you within your power target. You can define workouts by pace, distance or power. RunCline will notify you at the beginning of each interval. Once your workout is completed, the log report includes detailed results of your run with a summary of all running metrics from your foot pod and more. \n\nList of supported foot pods:\n* Stryd\n* Zwift RunPod\n* MilestonePod\n* Runn from NPE\n* Garmin foot pods with >CABLE from NPE\n* Garmin watches like Fenix 6 with Virtual Run\n\nList of supported Smart Treadmills:\n* Bodycraft T1000\n* Bowflex BXT128, BXT116, BXT216\n* CareFitness Marathon 22\n* Decathlon Run, RoadRunner i/B, EZRun\n* Domyos-TC and Intense Run\n* FitnessFocus (i-Running)\n* FitShow\n* FlowFitness DTM2000, T3i\n* Horizon T202, Omega Z, 7.x AT, Paragon X\n* JTX Sprint 9 (i-Console)\n* Kettler S2, S4, S6, S8, S10\n* LifeFitness F3, T3 and T5 with Track Connect\n* NoblePro\n* NordicTrack C850S, C970 Pro, S20, S25, S30, T7, T10, Z1300i\n* Polar (i-Console)\n* Pro-Form 525i, 545i, 575i, 995i, Carbon XL, Pro 1500, Pro 2000, Sport 6.0\n* REEBOK GT50, GT60, SL8.0, Jet 300\n* SpiritFitness XT285, 385, 485, 685, CT800\n* Sole S77, F63, F65, F80, F85 and TT8\n* Taurus T10.3\n* Technogym MyRun\n* TrueFitness PS800\n* TRX3500\n* Tunturi T90\n* Woodway 4Front\n* XTERRA TRX3500, 4500\n* Treadmills with GEM Retro module\n\nFeedback is more than welcomed and will contribute to make RunCline better for everyone."

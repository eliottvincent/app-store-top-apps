Silver and Gold upgrade prices are listed in the app as they vary depending on your country and currency. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMost aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes. This specifically excludes activities that might endanger yourself or the lives of others.

Think of it as a digital SIM card. Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\n.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM. The advantage is that you no longer need a fiddly, easily lost old-school plastic SIM card that you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIMs are a true technological revolution and we bring them right into your eSIM-compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or paying for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your existing phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store over time.  Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find a regularly updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link:\nhttps://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who travels - it doesn't matter whether you're on a boat, a plane, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries. We’re here to provide you with instant connectivity and solve your travel connectivity problems.\n\n\nWhy use Airalo?\n* No more huge data roaming fees\n* Installation in just a couple of minutes\n* Easy top-ups, wherever you are\n* Keep your existing number while traveling \n* No more fiddling with pins and paperclips to change SIMs\n* No need to carry a bulky WiFi dongle around\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n* Step 1: Install the Airalo app\n\n* Step 2: Find an eSIM for your destination\n(Airalo has eSIMs for over 190+ countries and regions and we're working 24/7 to expand our coverage.)\n\n* Step 3: Purchase & install your eSIM\nThere are three ways to install your eSIM; most can be installed directly, if this isn’t possible you can use a QR code or install it manually. \n\n* Step 4: Enjoy connectivity whenever you are!\n\nWhy do we love eSIM?\n\n* You aren’t disconnected during transit. With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fiddly hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things simpler for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top-up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees.\n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device. That gives you the freedom to purchase your eSIMs ahead of time and simply activate them on arrival.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n---\n\nVisit airalo.com for more information.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/privacy-policy\nTerms & Conditions: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/terms-conditions"

В планах: расширить функционал приложения, улучшить сайт, добавить выгодные партнерские программы и другие улучшения, которые помогут вам легко найти и вызвать комфортное такси.\n\nСитимобил — удобный сервис, чтобы заказать такси, арендовать самокат или получить другую нужную услугу. \n\nВсе это просто, удобно и выгодно!\n\nПеред заказом вы cможете выбрать подходящий тариф. В приложении есть несколько вариантов:\n\n«Эконом» — для тех, кто любит поездки по доступным ценам.\n«Комфорт» и «Комфорт+» подойдут тем, кто ценит в путешествиях по городу удобство.\n«Бизнес» —  тариф для тех, кто выбирает машины премиум-класса и часто выезжает на деловые встречи.\n«Минивэн» — всегда кстати для тех, кому нужно много места. Например, для большой семьи или дружной компании.\n«Доставка» — для тех, кому нужно передать посылку от двери до двери. Да, с нашей помощью можно не только заказать такси! \n\nВ интерфейсе приложения вы обязательно найдете и «Ситимобил для бизнеса» — это внутренний сервис для корпоративных клиентов и предпринимателей.\n\nА для тех, кто любит прокатиться с ветерком и мимо пробок, — Ситимобил приготовил прокат самокатов. Как их найти? Иконку самоката вы увидите сразу в приложении, рядом со значком шашечек такси на карте. После нажатия на иконку появятся зоны аренды, куда вы можете подойти и взять самокат напрокат. \n\nКстати, аренда электросамокатов есть не только в Москве и Питере, но и в Сочи! \n\nНо если вы выбираете каршеринг — у Ситимобил есть предложение. Скачайте Ситидрайв (Youdrive) — приложение для аренды авто рядом с вами. Пока прокат авто работает в Москве, Питере и Сочи, но мы постоянно расширяем свою географию! \n\nХотите знать о своих возможностях с Ситимобил больше? Без проблем!\n\nВы можете вызвать машину в несколько кликов, если заранее знаете адрес назначения. А если пока не решили, куда хотите отправиться, то вам пригодится функция «Скажу адрес водителю». С ней любые координаты можно сообщить, когда вы уже сядете в автомобиль. \n\nВсе локации, которые вы часто посещаете, можно добавить в «Избранные адреса». Тогда не придется тратить время и вбивать адрес вручную.\n\nЕсли вы активный пользователь, то можете получить кешбэк до 20% в Ситибонусах после каждой поездки или доставки. Ситибонусы — условные единицы, которыми можно оплачивать до 100% от стоимости заказа.\n\nХотите запланировать автопутешествие заранее? Не проблема, просто укажите удобное время подачи машины, и водитель выполнит ваше пожелание. \n\nВы можете заказать авто с детским креслом или перевезти питомца — для водителей партнеров это не проблема. Достаточно просто выбрать нужную опцию в приложении. \n\nСмело выбирайте любые направления для поездок с Ситимобил. В приложении вы легко можете заказать поездку в Шереметьево, Внуково или Домодедово или вызвать машину прямо из аэропорта.\n\nЗаказы через Ситимобил можно делать в Москве, Казани, Лобне, Красногорске, Омске, Ногинске, Нижнем Новгороде, Санкт-Петербурге, Екатеринбурге, Ярославле, Самаре, Саратове, Энгельсе, Краснодаре, Тольятти, Новосибирске, Зеленограде, Одинцово, Мытищах, Ивантеевке, Пушкино и других городах. Мы работаем более чем в 48 городах России и планируем расширять свою географию.\n\nОплачивайте поездки, доставку или другие услуги любым удобным способом: наличными, картой или Apple Pay.\n\nЗаказывайте доставку еды от Delivery Club из ваших любимых ресторанов.\n\nА еще мы всегда на связи! Даже если у вас нет доступа к приложению, просто позвоните нам, наша служба поддержки поможет вам сделать заказ без приложения. Если у вас возникнут вопросы — задавайте их в чате приложения. Наша поддержка доступна 24/7.\n\nМы хотим развиваться, поэтому просим вас оставлять отзывы: о водителях, сервисе и о том, что не устроило в поездке.\nСвязь по почте: apps@city-mobil.ru \n\nСитимобил — информационный сервис заказа такси и иных услуг, оказываемых партнерами.

And you can buy cheap air tickets. How do you like the idea?\n- You can subscribe to notifications about the cheapest air ticket, the most convenient one or the most direct flight (yes, this is possible as well). This way you can keep track of changes in the cost of plane tickets. As soon as the price changes, we will send you a notification.\n- But these are not all of the subscriptions! You can also subscribe to the search for air tickets from your city and catch cheap tickets for a plane that flies in the most unexpected direction. What a surprise!\n- We also have a \"Price Schedule\" - it helps you buy a cheap ticket if you are not tied to the departure date.\n- And the \"Price Map\" - in case you have not yet decided on your destination. The map shows both domestic and international flights.\n- We save the passengers' passport information so that next time booking a flight won't take much time.\n- It's so comfortable to plan weekend trips with us, to fly on Saturday morning and to go back on Sunday evening.\n- And maybe you want to see around during the stopover - we will tell you which option is the most convenient if you want to see another city during the trip (also this type of air tickets is cheaper).\n- Our developers made app filters for any occasion, including for tickets with luggage and filtering for aircraft models.\n- If you don't want to search for flights on exact dates, you can choose one or several months and we will find plane tickets in a given range.\n\nBy the way, it's not only plane tickets search. We can also search for:\n\n- Accommodation with recommendations according to your interests: business trip, family, romantic, good for instagram and so on.\n- Guided and self-guided tours.\n- Cars and transfers to get from the airport to the hotel. And wherever else you want to go\n\nDownload the Aviasales app now to start traveling and buy tickets.\n\n*** The application from aviasales.com allows you to find the lowest possible cost of an air ticket. We do not sell anything, we help you find flights online with the best conditions."

The app offers single tickets, multi-tickets, and season tickets for regular travellers. Starting or continuing your journey in the capital region is easy! You can buy a handy HSL single ticket for your journey.\n\nWe will send your ticket to both the app and your email. You can pay for your journey using online banking, a payment card, MobilePay, Siirto or Epassi. If you have bought your tickets as a logged-in customer, you can always find the tickets you have bought in the app. This means that you can buy your ticket on your computer at home and still travel with that same ticket on your phone.\n\nWHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SIT?\n\nYou can conveniently reserve a seat using the coach map when buying a ticket. You can also buy the seat next to you and enjoy the extra space. If you want to add a touch of luxury to your journey, you can travel in Ekstra Class or the restaurant car’s upstairs section, which offers the best view. You can also buy a ticket for your travel companion, bicycle, or pet.\n\nPLANS CAN CHANGE\n\nSometimes things don’t go as planned. In the VR Matkalla app, you can also make changes after buying the ticket. You can easily change your seat and departure time yourself. If needed, the change can be made to the tickets of the whole travel party. If you’ve bought cancellation insurance, you can also cancel your journey in the app for free if plans change.\n\nWHERE ARE WE AT?\n\nWith the VR Matkalla app, you will get real-time updates about your journey, so you will always know what is happening. You will be informed about things like your train’s departure, the movement of the train, changed timetables, transfers, and your train’s arrival. You can also view your train’s services and accessibility information in the app. If we have to cancel your train journey, we will suggest new journeys in the app for you to choose from.\n\nYOU WILL ALWAYS KNOW YOUR BENEFITS\n\nFor those who download the app, we offer tasty benefits that you can use in the train’s restaurant car. In addition, we will also tell you about changing benefits that will make your journey even better. You can find our tips and benefits in the Messages section of the VR Matkalla app.\n\nWe continuously develop our app. You can now also check the carbon footprint of the journeys you’ve taken in the past 12 months. Did you know that the carbon dioxide emissions of a train are 98% lower than those of a car?"

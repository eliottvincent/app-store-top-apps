Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMost aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes. This specifically excludes activities that might endanger yourself or the lives of others. Under no circumstances will the developer of this app be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation or its use contrary to this agreement.\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.flightradar24.com/terms-and-conditions"

Think of it as a digital SIM card. Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\n.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM. The advantage is that you no longer need a fiddly, easily lost old-school plastic SIM card that you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIMs are a true technological revolution and we bring them right into your eSIM-compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or paying for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your existing phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store over time.  Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find a regularly updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link:\nhttps://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who travels - it doesn't matter whether you're on a boat, a plane, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries.

With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fiddly hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things simpler for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top-up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees.\n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device. That gives you the freedom to purchase your eSIMs ahead of time and simply activate them on arrival.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n---\n\nVisit airalo.com for more information.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/privacy-policy\nTerms & Conditions: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/terms-conditions"

Save hundreds of dollars compared to other travel sites.\n\nDiscover extraordinary travel deals, set fare alerts, and uncover great hotel rates.\n\nWe’re so good, United Airlines actually sued us for it!\n\n• Find flights other search engines won’t show you -- including HIDDEN-CITY flights and arbitrary round-trips\n• Filter flights by duration, number of layovers, takeoff/landing time and more\n• Our powerful search engine pulls in the best deals to save you from having to google flights and check multiple sites\n• Monitor prices for trips you have in the hopper and let us alert you when the best deal is available\n• Book hotels as well, including last-minute hotels and special deals\n• Filter hotels, read reviews and view traveler ratings\n• We now offer car rental as well, so you can use one app as your complete trip planner\n• Our new Stories feature lets you book activities for your vacation - take a brewery tour, rent a kayak, or buy tickets in advance and get your guide to museums and exhibits\n\nThe fine print: a HIDDEN-CITY flight is a flight where you get off at the layover rather than the final destination. For example, a flight from New York to San Francisco might be $300, but a similar flight from New York to Seattle with a layover in San Francisco might be $200. If you’re going to San Francisco we’ll show you both flights, and if you choose the cheaper one, you get off the plane at the layover (San Francisco) rather than going to the final destination (Seattle).\n\nThis is perfectly legal and the savings can be significant, but if you’ve never traveled like this before, you should read our HIDDEN-CITY FAQ at http://skiplagged.com/faq\n\nWe’ll always show you all the options, so YOU can pick the deal you want!"

And you can buy cheap air tickets. How do you like the idea?\n- You can subscribe to notifications about the cheapest air ticket, the most convenient one or the most direct flight (yes, this is possible as well). This way you can keep track of changes in the cost of plane tickets. As soon as the price changes, we will send you a notification.\n- But these are not all of the subscriptions! You can also subscribe to the search for air tickets from your city and catch cheap tickets for a plane that flies in the most unexpected direction. What a surprise!\n- We also have a \"Price Schedule\" - it helps you buy a cheap ticket if you are not tied to the departure date.\n- And the \"Price Map\" - in case you have not yet decided on your destination. The map shows both domestic and international flights.\n- We save the passengers' passport information so that next time booking a flight won't take much time.\n- It's so comfortable to plan weekend trips with us, to fly on Saturday morning and to go back on Sunday evening.\n- And maybe you want to see around during the stopover - we will tell you which option is the most convenient if you want to see another city during the trip (also this type of air tickets is cheaper).\n- Our developers made app filters for any occasion, including for tickets with luggage and filtering for aircraft models.\n- If you don't want to search for flights on exact dates, you can choose one or several months and we will find plane tickets in a given range.\n\nBy the way, it's not only plane tickets search. We can also search for:\n\n- Accommodation with recommendations according to your interests: business trip, family, romantic, good for instagram and so on.\n- Guided and self-guided tours.\n- Cars and transfers to get from the airport to the hotel. And wherever else you want to go\n\nDownload the Aviasales app now to start traveling and buy tickets.\n\n*** The application from aviasales.com allows you to find the lowest possible cost of an air ticket. We do not sell anything, we help you find flights online with the best conditions."

      "label": "The Praamid.ee mobile app provides a quick and convenient solution for planning a trip between mainland Estonia and larger islands on the Virtsu-Kuivastu and Rohuküla-Heltermaa routes. The mobile app enables you to buy and change tickets, see the timetables of our ferries and manage your account.\n\nYou can pay for tickets with a credit card, mobile payment or a bank link (you will need a mobile-ID or a password card for this). Contractual business customers also have the option of paying from their customer account. When purchasing the ticket, make sure your smart device has sufficient data connection.\n\nThe Praamid.ee app allows you to use an ID-card, mobile-ID, Facebook or a Google account to identify yourself. By creating an account in the app, your purchased tickets and purchase history will be saved. The process of purchasing tickets will be even quicker and more convenient if you save information of your vehicles and family members who get discount on the app.\n\nVehicle tickets purchased via Praamid.ee will first be checked at the port with an automatic licence plate recognition system. For this purpose, when you are purchasing the ticket, please make sure you enter the correct licence plate number of the vehicle you will be travelling with. This will ensure the most convenient entry to the port area. If the licence plate number of your vehicle has not been automatically recognised, please call on the number marked on the barrier, scan the QR-code of your ticket in the self-service kiosk or enter the code manually. There is no need to print out the ticket as you can scan the QR code from your smart device screen, if necessary.\n\nFor more detailed instructions on the use of the Praamid.ee mobile app please visit www.praamid.ee. We gladly expect your feedback on the app on info@praamid.ee.\n\n\nPraamid.ee mobiilirakendus annab võimaluse kiirelt ja mugavalt plaanida reisi Eesti mandriosa ja suursaarte vahel Virtsu-Kuivastu ja Rohuküla-Heltermaa liinil. Mobiilirakenduse kaudu saad pileteid osta ja muuta, vaadata parvlaevade graafikuid ja hallata oma kontot.\n\nPileti eest saad maksta krediitkaardi või mobiilimaksega või pangalingi kaudu (vajalik mobiil-ID või paroolikaart). Lepingulistel äriklientidel on võimalik piletite eest tasuda ka kliendikonto arvelt. Ostu tehes veendu, et Sinu nutiseadmel on püsiv andmeside ühendus.\n\nEnda tuvastamiseks saad Praamid.ee rakenduses kasutada nii ID-kaarti, mobiil-ID-d, Facebooki kui ka Google’i kontot. Luues endale rakenduses kasutajakonto, salvestatakse sinna Sinu ostetud piletid ja ostuajalugu. Piletite ostmise teeb kiiremaks ja mugavamaks see, kui salvestad oma kontol enda sõidukite ja soodustusi saavate pereliikmete andmed.\n\nSadamas kontrollitakse Praamid.ee mobiilirakendusest ostetud sõidukipileteid kõigepealt automaatse numbrituvastusega. Selleks sisesta piletit ostes kindlasti reisil kasutatava sõiduki õige number, nii pääsed sadama alale kõige mugavamalt. Kui Sinu auto numbrit ei suudeta automaatselt tuvastada, helista läbipääsuks tõkkepuul olevale telefoninumbrile, skaneeri iseteeninduskioskis pileti QR-kood või sisesta kood käsitsi. Sa ei pea pileteid välja trükkima, vaid saad vajaduse korral QR-koodi skaneerida ka oma nutiseadme ekraanilt.\n\nTäpsemad juhised Praamid.ee mobiilirakenduse kohta leiad veebilehelt www.praamid.ee ja tagasisidet rakenduse kohta ootame aadressil info@praamid.ee."

The author of the application has visited them all and now want to share his experience. This is an interactive guide to all the lighthouses and the most interesting navigation signs, which is always with you. The application is primarily aimed at tourists and travelers and contains information that will be most useful for them: how to get to a particular object, what time of day this sign is lighting, a detailed historical reference. If a museum is operating at the lighthouse, then its working hours, contact information and a small description of the exhibition are indicated. I would also like to note that the entire functionality of the application (except the map) works without an Internet connection, which will be useful for tourists who are abroad. There is no advertising, statistics collection in the application and it is not monetized in any way."

      "label": "“Rīgas satiksme” mobilā lietotne ir radīta, lai padarītu sabiedriskā transporta biļešu iegādi ērtāku un pieejamāku. Lietotne ir paredzēta koda biļešu iegādei tiešsaistes režīmā un izmantošanai tramvajos, trolejbusos un autobusos. Iekāpjot transporta līdzeklī, tālrunī iegādātā biļete jāaktivizē, skenējot kvadrātkodu, kas izvietots vairākās vietās pa visu transporta līdzekļa salonu, vai jāievada identifikācijas numurs, kas ir redzams zem kvadrātkoda. Katram transporta līdzeklim ir atšķirīgs kvadrātkods un identifikācijas numurs. Gadījumā, ja transportā iekāpj kontrolieris, jāatver lietotne un jāuzrāda reģistrētā biļete kontrolierim. Biļetes jāizmanto trīs mēnešu laikā no iegādes brīža. Lai iegādātos brauciena biļetes, tālrunim nepieciešams interneta pieslēgums.\nMums ir svarīgs Jūsu viedoklis! Lai varētu pilnveidot sistēmu un pēc iespējas pielāgot to klientu vajadzībām, aicinām dalīties savā lietotnes lietošanas pieredzē mūsu tīmekļa vietnē www.rigassatiksme.lv sadaļā “Sazinies ar mums”. Vairāk patīkamu braucienu!"

The app offers single tickets, multi-tickets, and season tickets for regular travellers. Starting or continuing your journey in the capital region is easy! You can buy a handy HSL single ticket for your journey.\n\nWe will send your ticket to both the app and your email. You can pay for your journey using online banking, a payment card, MobilePay, Siirto or Epassi. If you have bought your tickets as a logged-in customer, you can always find the tickets you have bought in the app. This means that you can buy your ticket on your computer at home and still travel with that same ticket on your phone.\n\nWHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SIT?\n\nYou can conveniently reserve a seat using the coach map when buying a ticket. You can also buy the seat next to you and enjoy the extra space. If you want to add a touch of luxury to your journey, you can travel in Ekstra Class or the restaurant car’s upstairs section, which offers the best view. You can also buy a ticket for your travel companion, bicycle, or pet.\n\nPLANS CAN CHANGE\n\nSometimes things don’t go as planned. In the VR Matkalla app, you can also make changes after buying the ticket. You can easily change your seat and departure time yourself. If needed, the change can be made to the tickets of the whole travel party. If you’ve bought cancellation insurance, you can also cancel your journey in the app for free if plans change.\n\nWHERE ARE WE AT?\n\nWith the VR Matkalla app, you will get real-time updates about your journey, so you will always know what is happening. You will be informed about things like your train’s departure, the movement of the train, changed timetables, transfers, and your train’s arrival. You can also view your train’s services and accessibility information in the app. If we have to cancel your train journey, we will suggest new journeys in the app for you to choose from.\n\nYOU WILL ALWAYS KNOW YOUR BENEFITS\n\nFor those who download the app, we offer tasty benefits that you can use in the train’s restaurant car. In addition, we will also tell you about changing benefits that will make your journey even better. You can find our tips and benefits in the Messages section of the VR Matkalla app.\n\nWe continuously develop our app. You can now also check the carbon footprint of the journeys you’ve taken in the past 12 months. Did you know that the carbon dioxide emissions of a train are 98% lower than those of a car?"

В планах: расширить функционал приложения, улучшить сайт, добавить выгодные партнерские программы и другие улучшения, которые помогут вам легко найти и вызвать комфортное такси.\n\nСитимобил — удобный сервис, чтобы заказать такси, арендовать самокат или получить другую нужную услугу. \n\nВсе это просто, удобно и выгодно!\n\nПеред заказом вы cможете выбрать подходящий тариф. В приложении есть несколько вариантов:\n\n«Эконом» — для тех, кто любит поездки по доступным ценам.\n«Комфорт» и «Комфорт+» подойдут тем, кто ценит в путешествиях по городу удобство.\n«Бизнес» —  тариф для тех, кто выбирает машины премиум-класса и часто выезжает на деловые встречи.\n«Минивэн» — всегда кстати для тех, кому нужно много места. Например, для большой семьи или дружной компании.\n«Доставка» — для тех, кому нужно передать посылку от двери до двери. Да, с нашей помощью можно не только заказать такси! \n\nВ интерфейсе приложения вы обязательно найдете и «Ситимобил для бизнеса» — это внутренний сервис для корпоративных клиентов и предпринимателей.\n\nА для тех, кто любит прокатиться с ветерком и мимо пробок, — Ситимобил приготовил прокат самокатов. Как их найти? Иконку самоката вы увидите сразу в приложении, рядом со значком шашечек такси на карте. После нажатия на иконку появятся зоны аренды, куда вы можете подойти и взять самокат напрокат. \n\nКстати, аренда электросамокатов есть не только в Москве и Питере, но и в Сочи! \n\nНо если вы выбираете каршеринг — у Ситимобил есть предложение. Скачайте Ситидрайв (Youdrive) — приложение для аренды авто рядом с вами. Пока прокат авто работает в Москве, Питере и Сочи, но мы постоянно расширяем свою географию! \n\nХотите знать о своих возможностях с Ситимобил больше? Без проблем!\n\nВы можете вызвать машину в несколько кликов, если заранее знаете адрес назначения. А если пока не решили, куда хотите отправиться, то вам пригодится функция «Скажу адрес водителю». С ней любые координаты можно сообщить, когда вы уже сядете в автомобиль. \n\nВсе локации, которые вы часто посещаете, можно добавить в «Избранные адреса». Тогда не придется тратить время и вбивать адрес вручную.\n\nЕсли вы активный пользователь, то можете получить кешбэк до 20% в Ситибонусах после каждой поездки или доставки. Ситибонусы — условные единицы, которыми можно оплачивать до 100% от стоимости заказа.\n\nХотите запланировать автопутешествие заранее? Не проблема, просто укажите удобное время подачи машины, и водитель выполнит ваше пожелание. \n\nВы можете заказать авто с детским креслом или перевезти питомца — для водителей партнеров это не проблема. Достаточно просто выбрать нужную опцию в приложении. \n\nСмело выбирайте любые направления для поездок с Ситимобил. В приложении вы легко можете заказать поездку в Шереметьево, Внуково или Домодедово или вызвать машину прямо из аэропорта.\n\nЗаказы через Ситимобил можно делать в Москве, Казани, Лобне, Красногорске, Омске, Ногинске, Нижнем Новгороде, Санкт-Петербурге, Екатеринбурге, Ярославле, Самаре, Саратове, Энгельсе, Краснодаре, Тольятти, Новосибирске, Зеленограде, Одинцово, Мытищах, Ивантеевке, Пушкино и других городах. Мы работаем более чем в 48 городах России и планируем расширять свою географию.\n\nОплачивайте поездки, доставку или другие услуги любым удобным способом: наличными, картой или Apple Pay.\n\nЗаказывайте доставку еды от Delivery Club из ваших любимых ресторанов.\n\nА еще мы всегда на связи! Даже если у вас нет доступа к приложению, просто позвоните нам, наша служба поддержки поможет вам сделать заказ без приложения. Если у вас возникнут вопросы — задавайте их в чате приложения. Наша поддержка доступна 24/7.\n\nМы хотим развиваться, поэтому просим вас оставлять отзывы: о водителях, сервисе и о том, что не устроило в поездке.\nСвязь по почте: apps@city-mobil.ru \n\nСитимобил — информационный сервис заказа такси и иных услуг, оказываемых партнерами.

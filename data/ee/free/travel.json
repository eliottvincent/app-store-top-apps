Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes. This specifically excludes activities that might endanger yourself or the lives of others. Under no circumstances will the developer of this app be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation or its use contrary to this agreement.\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.flightradar24.com/terms-and-conditions"

Save hundreds of dollars compared to other travel sites.\n\nDiscover extraordinary travel deals, set fare alerts, and uncover great hotel rates.\n\nWe’re so good, United Airlines actually sued us for it!\n\n• Find flights other search engines won’t show you -- including HIDDEN-CITY flights and arbitrary round-trips\n• Filter flights by duration, number of layovers, takeoff/landing time and more\n• Our powerful search engine pulls in the best deals to save you from having to google flights and check multiple sites\n• Monitor prices for trips you have in the hopper and let us alert you when the best deal is available\n• Book hotels as well, including last-minute hotels and special deals\n• Filter hotels, read reviews and view traveler ratings\n• We now offer car rental as well, so you can use one app as your complete trip planner\n• Our new Stories feature lets you book activities for your vacation - take a brewery tour, rent a kayak, or buy tickets in advance and get your guide to museums and exhibits\n\nThe fine print: a HIDDEN-CITY flight is a flight where you get off at the layover rather than the final destination. For example, a flight from New York to San Francisco might be $300, but a similar flight from New York to Seattle with a layover in San Francisco might be $200. If you’re going to San Francisco we’ll show you both flights, and if you choose the cheaper one, you get off the plane at the layover (San Francisco) rather than going to the final destination (Seattle).\n\nThis is perfectly legal and the savings can be significant, but if you’ve never traveled like this before, you should read our HIDDEN-CITY FAQ at http://skiplagged.com/faq\n\nWe’ll always show you all the options, so YOU can pick the deal you want!"

Think of it as a digital SIM card. Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\n.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM. The advantage is that you no longer need a fiddly, easily lost old-school plastic SIM card that you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIMs are a true technological revolution and we bring them right into your eSIM-compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or paying for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your existing phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store over time.  Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find a regularly updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link:\nhttps://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who travels - it doesn't matter whether you're on a boat, a plane, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries. We’re here to provide you with instant connectivity and solve your travel connectivity problems.\n\n\nWhy use Airalo?\n* No more huge data roaming fees\n* Installation in just a couple of minutes\n* Easy top-ups, wherever you are\n* Keep your existing number while traveling \n* No more fiddling with pins and paperclips to change SIMs\n* No need to carry a bulky WiFi dongle around\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n* Step 1: Install the Airalo app\n\n* Step 2: Find an eSIM for your destination\n(Airalo has eSIMs for over 190+ countries and regions and we're working 24/7 to expand our coverage.)\n\n* Step 3: Purchase & install your eSIM\nThere are three ways to install your eSIM; most can be installed directly, if this isn’t possible you can use a QR code or install it manually. \n\n* Step 4: Enjoy connectivity whenever you are!\n\nWhy do we love eSIM?\n\n* You aren’t disconnected during transit. With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fiddly hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things simpler for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top-up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees.\n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device. That gives you the freedom to purchase your eSIMs ahead of time and simply activate them on arrival.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n---\n\nVisit airalo.com for more information.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/privacy-policy\nTerms & Conditions: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/terms-conditions"

And you can buy cheap air tickets. How do you like the idea?\n- You can subscribe to notifications about the cheapest air ticket, the most convenient one or the most direct flight (yes, this is possible as well). This way you can keep track of changes in the cost of plane tickets. As soon as the price changes, we will send you a notification.\n- But these are not all of the subscriptions! You can also subscribe to the search for air tickets from your city and catch cheap tickets for a plane that flies in the most unexpected direction. What a surprise!\n- We also have a \"Price Schedule\" - it helps you buy a cheap ticket if you are not tied to the departure date.\n- And the \"Price Map\" - in case you have not yet decided on your destination. The map shows both domestic and international flights.\n- We save the passengers' passport information so that next time booking a flight won't take much time.\n- It's so comfortable to plan weekend trips with us, to fly on Saturday morning and to go back on Sunday evening.\n- And maybe you want to see around during the stopover - we will tell you which option is the most convenient if you want to see another city during the trip (also this type of air tickets is cheaper).\n- Our developers made app filters for any occasion, including for tickets with luggage and filtering for aircraft models.\n- If you don't want to search for flights on exact dates, you can choose one or several months and we will find plane tickets in a given range.\n\nBy the way, it's not only plane tickets search. We can also search for:\n\n- Accommodation with recommendations according to your interests: business trip, family, romantic, good for instagram and so on.\n- Guided and self-guided tours.\n- Cars and transfers to get from the airport to the hotel. And wherever else you want to go\n\nDownload the Aviasales app now to start traveling and buy tickets.\n\n*** The application from aviasales.com allows you to find the lowest possible cost of an air ticket. We do not sell anything, we help you find flights online with the best conditions."

      "label": "- In DOT Tickets app, you can easily buy commuter cards and tickets for journeys on Zealand, Lolland, Falster and Møn.\n\n- With a commuter card you get unlimited access 24 hours a day to journeys by bus (including the harbour bus), S-train, DSB Long-distance and Regional trains, local railway and Øresundstog in Zealand, Lolland, Falster and Møn. If your commuter card is valid in one or more zones in Greater Copenhagen, you will be offered a Metro add-on allowing you to travel by metro. If you have opted out of the Metro add-on and wish to travel by metro a given day, you can purchase a Supplementary ticket for Commuter Card to gain access to the metro. A commuter card is valid for a period min. 30 days and max. 60 days. A commuter card is a personal card and only valid for the person registered on the commuter card.\n\n- Select your journey by entering your place of departure and arrival, either in the form of a stop, address or place. You can also enter the zones you wish to travel from and to on the map. To allow DOT Tickets to find your position, you have to enable the GPS of your device. Accepting localization (GPS) is voluntary, but it is required if you wish to use the fast purchase buttons, and it helps you to see your location on the map with the validity area on your ticket. If you wish to purchase a commuter card between 2 and 8 coherent zones, you may select the zones by tapping on the interactive map.\n\nDOT Tickets app is developed by Din Offentlige Transport (DOT) and is owned by DOT. DOT ensures the collaboration between DSB, Movia and Metroselskabet to help create a better and more cohesive public transport system on Zealand, Lolland, Falster and Møn.\n\nYou can purchase these tickets in DOT Tickets app:\n• Tickets with 2-8 zones\n• Tickets for more than 8 zones between a departure and arrival zone\n• Commuter cards\n• Commuter card Metro add-on\n• Commuter card DSB 1’ Regional Train add-on\n• Bicycle ticket (Short, medium and long)\n• Supplementary Ticket for Commuter Card (1 zone)\n• DSB 1’ Regional Trains supplementary ticket\n• City Pass Small for zone 1-4 (24, 48, 72, 96 or 120 hours)\n• City Pass Large for zone 1-99 (24, 48, 72, 96 or 120 hours)\n• City Pass X-Large for zone 1-299 (24 hours)\n• City Pass West for zone 101-199 (24 hours)\n• City Pass South for zone 201-299 (24 hours)\n\nPayment is made by MobilePay or payment card. You can save your payment card details and access them via Touch ID, Face ID or a PIN code chosen by you. In that way, you do not have to enter all card details every time you make a purchase. The payment card details are stored with DIBS.\n\nThe following cards are accepted for payment:\n- Visa/Dankort\n- MasterCard\n- Visa\n- Visa Electron\n- Maestro\n\nAbout Supplementary Ticket for Commuter Card (1 zone): \n• Supplementary Ticket for Commuter Card is only valid with a valid commuter card\n• Select the zone by tapping the map. The zone must be adjacent to the validity area on your commuter card.  \n• If you need more zones than 1, you are required to buy a regular ticket with the number of zones and validity area that you need.\n\nNOTE:\nRemember to buy your mobile ticket before you start your journey."

Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMost aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes.

Add a data pack to your dual SIM iPhone or iPad and never worry about staying connected while on your adventures.\n\nSay 'alo' to freedom!\n\nWhat is an eSIM?\n* An eSIM is embedded SIM technology. Think of it as a digital SIM card. Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM-compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM for whatever local carriers exist in the country you’re currently in, but without this old-school plastic SIM card you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIM is a true technological revolution and we bring it right into your eSIM compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or pay for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your own phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store for your convenience. Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find an updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link: https://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who wants to get connected during their travels - it doesn't matter whether you're a seafarer, flight crew, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries -  We are here to provide you with instant connectivity and solve your travel connectivity problems.\n\nWhy use Airalo?\n* No more enormous roaming data fees\n* Installation in 2 minutes or less\n* Easy top-ups, wherever you are\n* Keep your number as you travel\n* No more fumbling to change SIMs\n* No need to carry a bulky Wi-Fi dongle around\n\nHow does it work?\n* Step 1: Install the Airalo app\n* Step 2: Find an eSIM for your destination\n(Airalo has eSIMs for over 190+ countries and regions and we're working 24/7 to expand our coverage.)\n* Step 3: Purchase & install your eSIM You can install your eSIM directly or by scanning a QR code or manually inserting an activation code provided. You can also manage and top-up your eSIMs with your Airalo account.\n* Step 4: Enjoy connectivity whenever you are!\n\nWhy do we love eSIM?\n* You aren’t disconnected during transit. With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fragile, tiny hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things easier for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees. \n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device.

For example, a flight from New York to San Francisco might be $300, but a similar flight from New York to Seattle with a layover in San Francisco might be $200. If you’re going to San Francisco we’ll show you both flights, and if you choose the cheaper one, you get off the plane at the layover (San Francisco) rather than going to the final destination (Seattle).\n\nThis is perfectly legal and the savings can be significant, but if you’ve never traveled like this before, you should read our HIDDEN-CITY FAQ at http://skiplagged.com/faq\n\nWe’ll always show you all the options, so YOU can pick the deal you want!"

      "label": "The Praamid.ee mobile app provides a quick and convenient solution for planning a trip between mainland Estonia and larger islands on the Virtsu-Kuivastu and Rohuküla-Heltermaa routes. The mobile app enables you to buy and change tickets, see the timetables of our ferries and manage your account.\n\nYou can pay for tickets with a credit card, mobile payment or a bank link (you will need a mobile-ID or a password card for this). Contractual business customers also have the option of paying from their customer account. When purchasing the ticket, make sure your smart device has sufficient data connection.\n\nThe Praamid.ee app allows you to use an ID-card, mobile-ID, Facebook or a Google account to identify yourself. By creating an account in the app, your purchased tickets and purchase history will be saved. The process of purchasing tickets will be even quicker and more convenient if you save information of your vehicles and family members who get discount on the app.\n\nVehicle tickets purchased via Praamid.ee will first be checked at the port with an automatic licence plate recognition system. For this purpose, when you are purchasing the ticket, please make sure you enter the correct licence plate number of the vehicle you will be travelling with. This will ensure the most convenient entry to the port area. If the licence plate number of your vehicle has not been automatically recognised, please call on the number marked on the barrier, scan the QR-code of your ticket in the self-service kiosk or enter the code manually. There is no need to print out the ticket as you can scan the QR code from your smart device screen, if necessary.\n\nFor more detailed instructions on the use of the Praamid.ee mobile app please visit www.praamid.ee. We gladly expect your feedback on the app on info@praamid.ee.\n\n\nPraamid.ee mobiilirakendus annab võimaluse kiirelt ja mugavalt plaanida reisi Eesti mandriosa ja suursaarte vahel Virtsu-Kuivastu ja Rohuküla-Heltermaa liinil. Mobiilirakenduse kaudu saad pileteid osta ja muuta, vaadata parvlaevade graafikuid ja hallata oma kontot.\n\nPileti eest saad maksta krediitkaardi või mobiilimaksega või pangalingi kaudu (vajalik mobiil-ID või paroolikaart). Lepingulistel äriklientidel on võimalik piletite eest tasuda ka kliendikonto arvelt. Ostu tehes veendu, et Sinu nutiseadmel on püsiv andmeside ühendus.\n\nEnda tuvastamiseks saad Praamid.ee rakenduses kasutada nii ID-kaarti, mobiil-ID-d, Facebooki kui ka Google’i kontot. Luues endale rakenduses kasutajakonto, salvestatakse sinna Sinu ostetud piletid ja ostuajalugu. Piletite ostmise teeb kiiremaks ja mugavamaks see, kui salvestad oma kontol enda sõidukite ja soodustusi saavate pereliikmete andmed.\n\nSadamas kontrollitakse Praamid.ee mobiilirakendusest ostetud sõidukipileteid kõigepealt automaatse numbrituvastusega. Selleks sisesta piletit ostes kindlasti reisil kasutatava sõiduki õige number, nii pääsed sadama alale kõige mugavamalt. Kui Sinu auto numbrit ei suudeta automaatselt tuvastada, helista läbipääsuks tõkkepuul olevale telefoninumbrile, skaneeri iseteeninduskioskis pileti QR-kood või sisesta kood käsitsi. Sa ei pea pileteid välja trükkima, vaid saad vajaduse korral QR-koodi skaneerida ka oma nutiseadme ekraanilt.\n\nTäpsemad juhised Praamid.ee mobiilirakenduse kohta leiad veebilehelt www.praamid.ee ja tagasisidet rakenduse kohta ootame aadressil info@praamid.ee."

Want to have quicker access to your ticket during ticket inspection? Want to be able to find your way better at the station and have reliable map information? We have good news for you! SBB Mobile can do it all. And much more. \n \nThe heart of the app is the new navigation bar with the following menu points and content.  \n\nPlan  \n• Plan your journey with a simple timetable search via the touch timetable or use your current position as the origin or destination, locating it on the map.  \n• Buy your ticket for the whole of Switzerland in just two clicks. Your travelcards on the SwissPass are applied. \n• Travel particularly affordably with supersaver tickets or Saver Day Passes. \n\nTrips \n• Save your trip and we will provide you with all the information you need during your journey under ‘Single Trips’: everything from departure and arrival times, platform information and service disruptions to train formations and walking routes.  \n• Set up your personal commuter route under ‘Commuting’ and receive push notifications about rail service disruptions. \n• The app accompanies you from door to door as you travel and you will receive information about delays, disruption and interchange times via push notification.  \n\nEasyRide \n• Check in, hop on and head off – across the entire GA Travelcard network. \n• EasyRide calculates the right ticket for your journey on the basis of the routes you travelled and charges you the relevant amount subsequently. \n \nTickets & Travelcards  \n• Show your public transport travelcards digitally with SwissPass Mobile. \n• It also gives you an overview of your valid and expired tickets and travelcards on the SwissPass. \n\nShop & Services  \n• Buy regional transport tickets and Day Passes for the GA Travelcard area of validity quickly and easily without searching the timetable.  \n• In the ‘Services’ section, you can find lots of useful links about travel. \n\nProfile  \n•  Straightforward access to your personal settings and our customer support.  \n\nContact us. \nIf you have any questions, feel free to get in touch: \n \nhttps://www.sbb.ch/en/timetable/mobile-apps/sbb-mobile/contact.html \n \nData security and authorisations. \nWhat permissions does SBB Mobile need and why? \n \nLocation \nFor connections from your current location, the GPS function must be activated so that SBB Mobile can find the nearest stop. This also applies if you want to have the nearest stop displayed in the timetable. \n \nCalendar and e-mail \nYou can save connections in your own calendar and send them by e-mail (to friends, an external calendar). SBB Mobile requires read and write permissions to be able to import your desired connection into the calendar. \n \nAccess to the camera \nSBB Mobile requires access to your camera to take pictures directly in the app for your personalised touch timetable.  \n\nInternet access \nSBB Mobile requires internet access to search the timetable as well as for ticket purchases. \n \nMemory \nTo support offline functions, e.g. station/stop list, connections (history) and purchased tickets, SBB Mobile requires access to your device’s memory (saving app-specific settings)."

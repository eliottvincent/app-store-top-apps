      "label": "Google Family Link is a parental controls app that helps you keep your family safer online. We know that every family’s relationship with technology is unique, so we designed tools like Family Link that give you the flexibility to choose the right balance for your family, and help them create healthy digital habits. Family Link’s easy to use tools allow you to understand how your child is spending time on their device, see their device location, manage privacy settings, and more.\n\n\nWith Family Link, you can:\n\nEstablish Digital Ground Rules\n• Set screen time limits — Family Link lets you set downtime for your child’s device and time limits for apps, so you can help them find a healthy balance.\n• Guide them to age-appropriate content — Approve or block apps your child wants to download. Family Link also allows you to choose the right YouTube experience for your child: a supervised experience on YouTube, or YouTube Kids.\n\nManage and secure your child’s account \n• Protect their privacy — Permissions management in Family Link allow you to make meaningful choices about your child’s data. View and manage permissions for websites and extensions accessed through Chrome as well as apps downloaded on your child’s device. \n• Secure their account — Family Link gives you access to manage your child's account and data settings. As a parent, you can help change or reset your child’s password if they forget it, edit their personal information or even delete their account if you feel necessary.\n\nStay connected on the go\n• See where they are — It’s helpful to be able to find your family when they’re on the go. With Family Link, you can locate your children on one map, as long as they’re carrying their device.\n• Get notifications and alerts — Family Link delivers critical notifications including when your child arrives or leaves a certain location.  You can also ring devices and view the device’s remaining battery life.\n\n\nImportant Information\n\n• Family Link’s tools vary depending on your child’s device. See a list of compatible devices at https://families.google/familylink/device-compatibility/\n• While Family Link helps you manage your child's purchases and downloads from Google Play, they will not need approval to install app updates (including updates that expand permissions), apps you have previously approved, or apps that have been shared in Family Library. In addition, purchase approvals will apply only when your child makes a purchase through Google Play’s billing system and will not apply to purchases made through alternate billing systems. Parents should regularly review their child’s installed apps and app permissions in Family Link.\n• You should carefully review the apps on your child’s supervised device and disable those you don’t want them to use. Note that you may not be able to disable some pre-installed apps such as Play, Google, etc.\n• To see the location of your child or teen’s device, the device must be powered on, recently active, and connected to the internet through data or wifi.\n• Family Link parental controls are only available for supervised Google accounts. With supervised Google Accounts, children get access to Google products like Search, Chrome, and Gmail, and parents can set up basic digital ground rules to supervise them.\n• While Family Link provides tools to manage your child’s online experience and keep them safer online, it does not make the internet safe. Family Link can not determine the content on the internet, but it can give parents the opportunity to make decisions about how their child spends time on their device, and determine what path to online safety looks best for your family."

Eesti Energia mobiiliäppi saavad kasutada kõik Eesti Energia era- ja ärikliendid ja Elektrilevi üldteenuse kliendid.\n\nTarbi teadlikult\n \nÄpp võimaldab tunnise täpsusega vaadata tarbitud energia hulka. Näiteks olles mõnel eelneval õhtul sauna teinud, saad tagantjärele hinnata, kui palju kasvas majapidamise energiatarve elektrikerise töötamise ajal. Veelgi põhjalikumaks analüüsiks võid omavahel võrrelda ka pikemaid ajaperioode (nädal, kuu ja aasta). Näiteks saad siis aimu, kuidas on leibkonna suurenemine mõjutanud elektritarbimist. \n\nVähenda oma arveid\n\nÄpis kuvatavad järgmise päeva elektri börsihinnad aitavad Sul energiakuludelt kokku hoida, ajatades näiteks kodumasinad tööle siis, kui energia hind on kõige soodsam. Planeerides oma tarbimist lähtuvalt reaalsetest elektri börsihindadest, mõjutad otseselt oma elektriarvet. Mida suurem leibkond ja elamine, seda käegakatsutavam on säästliku tarbimise tulemus.\n\nMuutuva paketi puhul saad äpist enim kasu, kui oled valinud hinnaarvestuse, mis toimub tunnipõhiselt. \n\nNutikad meeldetuletused\n\nHoiame Sind kursis elektritarbimist puudutava infoga: kõrge või madal börsihind, maksetähtaja lähenemine, tarbimise suurenemine või arve saabumine.\n\nHoia silm peal lepingul ja arvetel\n\nLisaks tarbimisinfole näed mobiiliäpist ka oma elektrilepinguga seotud andmeid (pakett, hind jm), elektriarveid ning saad vajadusel arveid mugavalt tasuda.\n\nSinu äri nutikas abimees\n\nÄppi saad kasutada ka ärikliendina, et hoida pilku peal kõigi oma ettevõtete elektritarbimisel.\n\nMobiiliäppi esimest korda kasutades või pärast uuenduste tegemist tuleb sisse logida kas oma isikukoodi ja viitenumbriga või mobiil-ID-ga.

Edaspidi ei ole äppi avades sisselogimine vajalik – olete automaatselt sisselogitud. \n\n\n[ENG] Your consumption information, electricity contract, bills and Eesti Energia contact details are easy to access from anywhere using the mobile app. The Eesti Energia mobile app can be used by all residential and business customers of Eesti Energia and universal service customers of Elektrilevi.\n\nConsume smartly\n\nThe app allows you to view your consumption volumes with hourly precision. For example, if you have heated the sauna the previous evening, you can assess the effect of the electric sauna heater on your household’s electricity consumption. You can also compare longer periods (week, month and year) for a more thorough analysis.\n\nReduce your bills\n\nThe next day’s electricity exchange prices displayed by the app help you save energy expenses, for example by timing your household appliances to function at those times with the lowest prices. By planning your consumption on the basis of actual exchange prices of electricity, you can directly influence your electricity bill. The larger your household and house, the more tangible the results of economical electricity consumption.\nThe app delivers the greatest benefit in regard to the Exchange Package if you select the hourly price calculation.\n\nSmart reminders\n\nWe will keep you up to date with electricity consumption information: high or low exchange prices, due dates for payments, increases in consumption or the arrival of a bill.\n\nKeep an eye on your contract and bills\n\nIn addition to consumption information, the mobile app shows you the details of your electricity contract (package, price, etc.) and your electricity bills, which you can also conveniently pay.\n\nA smart wizard for your business\n\nYou can also use the app as a business customer, to keep an eye on the electricity consumption at all your businesses.\n\nWhen using the mobile app for the first time and after updates, you have to log in using your personal ID code and reference number or Mobile ID. Business customers can only log in to the app using Mobile ID. Later you will be logged in automatically when you open the app."

      "label": "Get the people-first browser that’s backed by a non-profit. \n\nIt’s a new era in tech. Don’t settle for a browser produced by giant, profit-driven, data-hoarding tech companies. Firefox is the obvious choice for independent, ethical tech that respects your privacy and gives you more ways than ever to tailor your internet experience exactly the way you want it. Download Firefox now for iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\nFirefox is backed by the non-profit Mozilla Foundation, whose mission is to ensure the internet remains a global public resource, open and accessible to everyone. When you make Firefox your go-to, everyday browser, you’re also joining a unique (serious nerd cred) community that’s actively helping to diversify the way people experience the internet.  \n\nFirefox is extremely private for a reason — and the reason is you. \nWe want you to have an amazing experience every time you use Firefox. We know feeling safe and secure are foundational for enjoying your time online. Since version 1 in 2004, we’ve taken privacy seriously, because we’ve always been in the business of valuing people first, over everything. When you care more about people than profits, privacy naturally becomes a top priority.\n\nDIFFERENT DEVICES.  SAME TRAIN OF THOUGHT\nNow you can search for things on your laptop, then pick up the exact same search on your phone and vice versa. Your Firefox homepage displays the most recent searches you’ve done on other devices so you can easily get back to what you were doing or thinking about. \n\nLIMITED-EDITION WALLPAPERS\nIntroducing limited-edition wallpapers from independent creators. Stick with one you love or switch it up anytime to make Firefox match your mood. \n\n\nSTREAMLINED HOME SCREEN\nPick up right where you left off. See all your open tabs intuitively grouped and displayed along with your recent bookmarks, top sites and popular articles recommended by Pocket.\n\nPRIVACY CONTROL IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES\nFirefox gives you greater privacy protection while you’re on the web. By default, Firefox blocks trackers and scripts such as social media trackers, cross-site cookie trackers, cryptominers and fingerprinters. In addition to Apple’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention, setting Firefox’s Enhanced Tracking Protection to strict blocks tracking content in all windows. Also, you can easily choose to search in private browsing mode. And when you close private browsing mode, your browsing history and any cookies are automatically erased from your device.\n\nGET FIREFOX ON  ALL YOUR DEVICES\nAdd Firefox across your devices for secure, seamless browsing. In addition to synced tabs and searches, Firefox makes password management easy by remembering your passwords across devices.\n\nFIND IT FAST WITH FIREFOX’S SEARCH BAR\nGet search suggestions in the search bar and quickly access the sites you visit most. Type in your search question and get suggested and previously searched results across your favorite search engines.\n\nORGANIZE YOUR TABS THE WAY YOU LIKE\nCreate as many tabs as you like without losing track. Firefox displays your open tabs as thumbnails and numbered tabs, making it easy to find what you want quickly.\n\nSHARE ANYTHING IN A FEW TAPS\nThe Firefox web browser makes it easy to share links to web pages or specific items on a page with easy, quick access to your most recently used apps.\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT FIREFOX WEB BROWSER:\n- Read about Firefox permissions: http://mzl.la/Permissions\n- Learn more about what’s up at Mozilla: https://blog.mozilla.org\n\nABOUT MOZILLA\nMozilla exists to build the Internet as a public resource accessible to all because we believe open and free is better than closed and controlled. We build products like Firefox to promote choice and transparency and give people more control over their lives online.

Short of connecting a $1,500 DSLR camera to your computer, nothing will come close. With Camo there’s no need for any extra hardware or drivers.\n\nJoanna Stern, The Wall St. Journal – “how I do all my live TV hits”\nMacWorld US – “full-featured, easy-to-use, and delightful”\n9to5Mac – “an easy way to seriously improve your video call quality” \nWIRED – “there are a number of apps which let you use your iOS device’s camera as your webcam, but the best one is Camo”\nMacWorld UK – “an easy way to beef up the video quality on your calls”\nTechAdvisor – “slick, it’s flawless in performance and more secure than its counterparts too”\n\nWith over 10 million users helped over the last decade, Reincubate is one of the UK’s most-loved software companies.\n\n— PRO-QUALITY VIDEO WITH BOKEH —\n\nCamo makes the most of the incredible cameras in your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, and can do shallow depth of field “portrait mode” bokeh effects on newer iPhones.\n\n— POWERFUL ADJUSTMENTS AND FILTERS —\n\nUse any lens on your device: ultra-wide, wide-angle, telephoto, or selfie. Zoom, pan, rotate, recolor, and fine-tune focus and exposure.\n\n— EASY TO USE / PLUG AND PLAY —\n\nWe don’t believe in drivers or jargon, and you won’t need any extra hardware.

Camo ensures you’ve always got a preview of your video, even when your video meeting software doesn’t.\n\n— A ONE-APP HOME STUDIO —\n\nGo the extra mile with a custom video overlay to show off your brand or personality, or choose one from Camo Studio’s overlay gallery. Also, you can easily record video directly in Camo Studio – no third-party apps required.\n\n— COMPATIBLE WITH OVER 40 APPS —\n\nCamo works perfectly with Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Chrome, OBS Studio, Streamlabs, Skype, Twitch, Panopto, ScreenFlow, Final Cut Pro X, and dozens of other video recording and streaming products.\n\n— SECURITY AND PRIVACY FIRST —\n\nCamo doesn’t know what you’re using it for, and doesn’t capture or transmit your video feed. It simply routes it from your iPhone to your computer. Your data is your business, not ours.\n\n— NOT ONLY BUT ALSO! —\n\n- Super low latency, high speed pro-quality video in many resolutions, including 1080p HD, 720p, and 360p\n- Powerful presets to save and quickly switch to your favourite adjustments and settings\n- Native support for iPadOS as well as your iPhone, and beautiful Dark Mode support throughout\n- Faster than a webcam: Camo offloads all processing to your iOS device, keeping your computer cool and fast\n- Work with landscape or portrait mode with full rotation controls and choice over 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratios\n- Switch between any of your device’s front and back cameras in real-time\n- Supports switching between multiple iOS devices in real-time\n- No ads in the app, not ever\n\n— WE’RE HERE TO HELP —\n\nWe’re fanatical about supporting users, and we’d love to help you make the most of Camo.

      "label": "The DuckDuckGo app provides the most comprehensive online privacy protection with the push of a button. With one download, you get a new everyday browser that offers seamless protection while you search and browse, and even access to tracking protection for emails you receive.\n\nProtecting your privacy online is like protecting your home. Locking the front door won’t stop the most determined folks from getting inside, especially if you’ve left the back door and windows unlocked and an extra key under the doormat. That’s why we offer multiple types of privacy protection, most of which aren’t offered in most popular browsers by default.\n\nFEATURE HIGHLIGHTS\n• Search Privately by Default — DuckDuckGo Private Search comes built-in, so you can easily search the web without being tracked.\n\n• Escape Website Trackers Before They Load  — Automatically stop most hidden trackers (3rd-party scripts) from loading, which prevents companies from collecting and using (e.g. sale, ads, etc.) any data from these trackers. Our cutting-edge tracker blocking technology – called 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection – goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default.\n\n• Automatically Enforce Encryption — force many sites you visit to automatically use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection, which helps shield your data from Wi-Fi snoopers and network onlookers like your Internet provider. \n\n• Enable Built-in Email Protection — Over 85% of emails sent to Duck Addresses contained trackers that can detect when you’ve opened a message, where you were when you opened it, and what device you were using. Email Protection makes it easy to block most email trackers and hide your existing address when signing up for things online, all without switching email providers.\n\n• Escape Fingerprinting — help stop companies from creating a unique identifier for you by blocking their attempts to combine specific information about your browser and device settings.\n\n• Block Tracking Cookies — prevent most 3rd-party cookies from tracking you as you browse from site to site.\n\nWe also have many protections not available on most browsers including protection from link tracking, Google AMP tracking, and more.\n\nEVERYDAY PRIVACY CONTROLS\n• Tap Fire Button, Burn Data — Clear your tabs and browsing data with our Fire Button.\n\n• Signal Your Privacy Preference with Global Privacy Control (GPC) — built-into our app, GPC intends to help you express your opt-out rights automatically by telling websites not to sell or share your personal information. Whether it can be used to enforce your legal rights (for example, current or future CCPA, GDPR requirements) depends on the laws in your jurisdiction.\n\nNote about our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection following DuckDuckGo ad clicks: Our 3rd-Party Tracker Protection goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default, but we’re constantly working to make it more comprehensive. Currently, if an advertiser wants to detect conversions on their own website for our private DuckDuckGo search ads, our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection will not stop bat.bing.com requests from loading on the advertiser’s website following DuckDuckGo ad clicks, but those requests are stopped in all other contexts. This is because DuckDuckGo private search advertising is in partnership with Microsoft. As part of that partnership, viewing ads on DuckDuckGo is anonymous and Microsoft has committed to not profile our users’ ad clicks.\n\nRead more about this and our Tracking Protections at https://help.duckduckgo.com/privacy/web-tracking-protections/\n\nYou don't need to wait to take back your privacy. Join the millions of people using DuckDuckGo and protect many of your everyday online activities with one app. It's privacy, simplified. \n\nPrivacy Policy: https://duckduckgo.com/privacy/"

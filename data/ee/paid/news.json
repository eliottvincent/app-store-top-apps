However, some sites set up their feeds to only show a portion of each entry, you know, to get you to click through to their actual website. We find that really annoying, and we're sure you do too.\n\nWhich is why, unlike other RSS feed readers, that either push you into a browser (in-app or otherwise), or depend on third party text parsing services and require you to be online to fetch the full text of one article at a time (which makes it no different from having to click/tap through to a website), in lire, you get your favorite RSS feeds as they should've been. You don't need to click through to any website (though, you do still have the option to, if you really wanted). It takes your favorite partial feeds, does its magic, and converts them in to full feeds, so you don't have to click/tap on those annoying 'Read more' or 'Continue reading' links.\n\nOnce they're cached, you don't even need to be connected to read your full-text feeds.\n\nUse as a standalone feed reader, sync with iCloud,\n\nor,\n\nsync with any of the several services: Feedly, Feedbin, FeedHQ, The Old Reader, Inoreader, BazQux Reader, Newsblur, Feed Wrangler, FreshRSS, Miniflux, Nextcloud News, Tiny Tiny RSS."

The App lets you subscribe and organize your news feeds, which will be updated fully automatically, so you always have the latest news available within the App. All articles will presented for a comfortable reading experience, but of course the original web view is also available.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nLegi is special among RSS readers, because it has a speech output feature. This means the App can read all articles aloud when you can not read these yourself, for example when driving a car, while doing sports and for many other activities where you can't look on your device. The App has a full-featured audio player for the speech output (Play/Pause, skip back/forward, a timeline etc.) which works similar to the one of a music player App. Of course, all remote controls for music (the one from the control center, headphones, or Apple Watch) will work for Legi as well, so Legi can be in the background as well.\n\nThe full text of all articles will be presented in a comfortable reading mode, for which you can configure colors, fonts, text size etc. to match your own preferences. \n\nAn offline mode makes it possible to read all articles even if no internet connection is available. In addition the App lets you configure when and under which conditions the data is loaded, so you can load most or all of the data using WiFi and less or no data in mobile networks to avoid traffic.\n\nYou can also create \"smart playlists\" to categorize and organize articles independently of the feeds.\n\nSeveral 3rd-party services to manage your feeds are supported as well: \n- FeedWrangler\n- Feed HQ, FeedBlur\n- FeedBin\n- BazQux\n- InoReader\n- The Old Reader\n\nAlso feeds can be saved as favorites, you can export or import your feeds via OPML, you can share articles using the ShareSheet and much more.\n\nThe Watch App lets you read or listen to (via speech output) articles on your Apple Watch as well. This is great for all the occasions where you do not have your iPhone with you, for example for all kinds of sports activities"

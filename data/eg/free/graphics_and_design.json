Enter a text prompt, pick an art style and watch Art Ai, your personal AI Artist/Painter turn your idea into an AI-powered painting in seconds.\n\n\nSo how does Art Ai work?\nType in whatever you want to create! -- “Kanye west riding a unicorn”, “Pikachu holding a magical crystal ball”, “1800th century rainbow forest” or anything else you can imagine are just a few of the billions of potential paintings that could be made. Let your creativity be the light that guides you.\n\n\nPick an art style! -- Whether you’re looking for a vibrant colorful painting or something darker and more dystopian, Art Ai has you covered with an array of selected styles.\n\nGenerate your painting! -- Watch Art Ai use the power of AI to transform your idea and art style into a beautiful painting right before your eyes in seconds.\n\nArt Ai is expanding art to the masses. You don’t need a paint brush, pencil, or any art supplies to make beautiful artwork, all you need is an idea.

Share these imagaes to Telegram, WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram or Snapchat. The images are produced relatively fast. Text to image is an interesting concept and will always improve. This is just the beginning, produced images will be more and more clearer and precise.\n\nArt Ai, previously known as Text to Image, is created by the same creators of Disney Face, Clone:ar and Face Restore. We always listen to feedback and impement it as fast as possible.\n\nArt Ai PRO\n\nYou can subscribe to get an ad free experience.\n\nSubscriptions are auto renewable and are billed weekly at the rate selected depending on the subscription plan.\n\nThe cost of the weekly subscription is just $9.99\nThe cost of the yearly subscription is just $99.99\n\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.

      "label": "With Widgy, your home and lock screens becomes YOUR screens. You can make any kind of widget imaginable that perfectly matches the rest of your aesthetics. All the information you need can be easily surfaced through a widget that you designed. You don't have to clutter your screen with the information you don't want, it's just what you want, how you want it.\n\n• It's simple to make a widget •\n\nYou don't need to be a professional designer, you just need to know what you want. Once you figure that out, it's a matter of letting your creativity flow. Just add an element, pick a data source, throw on some effects, and put it where you want. Then repeat to add another element. After a while, you'll have a perfect widget, and all you need to do is to assign it to a widget slot and drop it on your home screen. There it is, marvelous! \n\nThe Widgy editor only has two parts. The preview and the layer list. When editing a layer, you get a couple of different sections that let you tweak the appearance and data of that layer. Each section has several special things you can do to the layer. The Preview will always show you a live display of exactly how the widget will look on your home screen, so you don't have to constantly go back and forth between the editor and home screen.\n\n• Everything you need •\n\nWidgy provides all the different elements that you would ever need to make your widget perfect. Along with that, there are all the data sources you could ever need, everything from system info to weather. And with all these data sources, there are several ways to display the data, whether it's a text, a nice chart, or something else.\n\n• There's no limits •\n\nThis isn't an app full of templates, everything is 100% customizable and interchangeable. It's your widget, and you choose how to make it. The only limit is your imagination. \n\n• Sharing and discovering is easy •\n\nYou can privately share widgets with your friends or publicly with all  Widgy users, all with a couple of taps. You can share your widget as a URL, QR Code, JSON data, a file, or you can publish it to be shown in the Explore section for all the Widgy users to see. \n\nOther than the Explore section, Reddit (r/Widgy) and Discord communities have produced thousands of Widgy widgets so far. So if you just want to browse widgets or if you need some inspiration you can get that too!\n\nNOTE: Widgy optionally integrates with Apple Health. This integration is used to display your data if you select one of those widget types. Permission for Widgy to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.\n\nAs with Health, all other permissions for Widgy are optional and are there just to show you the data you want to be displayed.\n\nWidgets for screenshots designed by SCOSeanKly.\nSome of the icons packs in screenshots designed by bulldog5278."

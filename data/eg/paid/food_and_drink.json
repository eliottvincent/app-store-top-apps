      "label": "Struggle free, healthy and practical recipes that are easy on the wallet. It’s as simple as that, and it’s a message that’s seen over 1 million people follow FitMenCook on social media.\n\nBe honest, have you ever heard these complaints about healthy eating?\n\n- “Eating healthy is too expensive!”\n- “It takes too long! I don’t have hours to spend in the kitchen.”\n- “Healthy food is too bland”\n- “I always end up cheating and slipping back in to bad habits”\n\nKevin Curry, founder of FitMenCook, has been there. After spotting a picture of himself on a friend’s Facebook wall he knew it was time for a change.\n\nHe followed all the common advice, changed to a healthy diet and started hitting the gym.\n\nFor a few months, things were great, but after a while he found himself craving the old foods he was trying so hard to avoid.\n\nHe got his hands on every book he could find on nutrition and started experimenting in the kitchen.\n\nHis aims were simple:\n\nA) Food should be easy to prepare and affordable\nB) Food should be vibrant and tasty, never boring\nC) Preparing food in advance is important\nD) Following a, b, c helps you achieve your fitness goals\n\nThe results for Kevin were game change and now he’s spreading message to the FitMenCook community on social media and inside the FMC app.\n\nTop 5 features:\n\n#1\nSHOPPING CART + APPLE WATCH\n\nWe've taken the hassle out of grocery shopping. Add any recipes you want to your shopping list and we'll organise the list by aisle, so you can easily find the items you need.\n\nThe shopping list also works on the Apple Watch.\n\n#2\nEASY STEP BY STEP VIDEO INSTRUCTIONS\n\nIf you’ve ever looked at recipe instructions and thought “this just looks too difficult for me” then you’ll find the included recipe videos very helpful. Not only is Kevin a great host, who’ll fill you with inspiration for healthy meals, but he’ll also break down the steps in a way that’s easy to follow.\n\n#3\nFOCUS ON MEAL PREP\n\nBuying ingredients in small quantities can make recipes more expensive. Not only that, but many of us don’t have time every day to spend in the kitchen.\n\nMeal prep is the solution. By designating two days of the week as your main cooking days, you can prepare your meals in bulk and eat healthy all week.\n\nThis is a crucial part of the app, and many of the meals are designed with meal preparation in mind, to make healthy living fit with a busy life.\n\n#4\nMACRO COUNTING AND INTEGRATION WITH APPLE HEALTH APP\n\nBodybuilders and fat-loss superheroes can rejoice as the FitMenCook app has nutritional information built right in! Recipes list calories, protein, carbs and fat. This data can then be shared with the Apple Health app.\n\n5#\nSCALE UP A RECIPE\n\nIncrease the serving sizes by tapping the + and - buttons in the recipe view. You can also switch the measurements between metric and imperial.\n\nThere’s more including:\n- 750+ recipes with more added each month\n- Search by ingredient: Type in Egg Avocado to see all recipes containing both of these ingredients\n- Share recipes with friends and family\n- Available in English and Spanish\n\nFor a video demonstration of the app in action, take a look at: http://fitmencook.com/app/\n\nOptional Meal Planner Subscription:\nFitMenCook Pro is available as a monthly (0.99 USD) or yearly (5.99 USD) subscription.

I would of paid 100 pounds for this had I know the contents before purchasing. I can tell LOADS of work has gone into this and you are sharing some amazing energy for little. Well well done. Thank you so much.\"\n- Michael Todd, Director of the UKH Gro\n\n\"I love this app! So many recipes!\"\n- Serge Gobachev \n\n\"Lost two lbs in four days!\"\n- Andrea Ward\n\n\"Awesome dishes.

I Love it :)\"\n- Jasmine Ogana\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThe only thing that matters when it comes to diet plans is if it works!\n\nBased on over 20 years of research the Dukan Diet is one of the most popular books and diet plans in France. It is a protein-based diet designed by French nutritionist and dietician, Pierre Dukan.\n\nThe diet consists of 4 phases: attack, cruise, consolidation, and stabilization.\n\nThe attack phase is designed to enable dieters to rapidly lose 2 to 3 kilograms (4.4 to 6.6 lb) in 2–7 days by kick-starting their metabolism. Dieters are allowed to eat as much as they want of 72 protein-rich foods.\n\nThe cruise phase is designed to allow dieters to more gradually achieve the weight they aim for by eating protein-rich foods with the addition of 28 specific vegetables. \n\nThe consolidation phase is designed to help in preventing any future massive weight gain. During this phase, fruit, bread, cheese and starchy foods are reintroduced into a normal diet, leaving two celebratory meals a week as directed by the plan.\n\nFinally, in the stabilization phase, dieters can essentially eat whatever they want without gaining weight by following a few lifestyle rules: protein day once a week, eating oat bran every day and making a fitness commitment to \"take the stairs\". Dieters should follow this last phase for the rest of their life to avoid regaining weight.\n\n- Features an elegant and intuitive interface\n\n- Over 300 dukan food recipes\n\n- Recipes for all meal types including: breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack\n\n- Star your favorites for easy reference\n\n- Filter menu to sort\n\n- Search feature to quickly find your favorite recipe\n\nDownload Dukan Diet Pro and start feeling healthier today!"

      "label": "How many of us struggle with \"kitchen math?\" The Kitchen Calculator PRO app makes cooking and measuring so much easier. Kitchen Calculator PRO does all the recipe conversions for you, and makes it simple to scale recipes up (or down) to change the number of servings the recipe yields. With Kitchen Calculator PRO you can:\n\n1.Quickly scale your recipes (add, subtract, multiply, divide) using fractions!\n\n2.Convert ingredients from weight to volume, and vice versa ( cups to grams, ounces,  etc. )\n\n3.Supports several volume, weight, distance, and temperature conversions\n\n4.Enter amounts and view results in standard cooking fractions (1/2, 1/3, etc )\n\n5.Grow a database with your favorite ingredients! (see weight to volume )\n\n\nUSER COMMENTS\n\n***** Exactly what I've been looking for! - \"I just tested this out on a new cake recipe and it was simple, easy and accurate. The cake came out *perfect*!\" by njanehair.\n\n***** Yippee, perfection! - \"I cook 3 meals a day for my toddler and am always needing to scale recipes down so I'm not making ridiculous amounts of food\" by Cindi M.\n\n***** Brilliant - \"For a cook trained in the metric system, this tool is a dream come true\" by BeeDiana.\n\n\nSCALE YOUR RECIPES\n\nEasily convert and scale recipes in an instant. Doubling a recipe (or cutting a recipe in half) is simpler than ever before, with all the most common units of cooking measurement right at your fingertips. \n\n\nWEIGHT TO VOLUME CONVERSIONS\n\nWhat is so special about weight to volume conversions?\n\nWhen converting from weight to volume it is important to take into account the ingredient you are converting. As you know, a cup of sugar does not weigh the same as a cup of rice. Furthermore, a particular brand of sugar may weigh different from another.  This is all made easy with Kitchen Calculator PRO.\n\nSo, how does Kitchen Calculator handle weight to volume conversions?\n\n1.It comes with a database of common ingredients based on weight figures from the USDA (US Department of Agriculture).\n\n2.It allows you to quickly enter and save your own ingredient weight for more precise conversions.  In many cases, you can enter the values right off the product label, using fractions!  \n\n3.Kitchen Calculator will remember any saved ingredient information for future conversions.\n\nNOTE: The preset ingredient list is based on USDA  (US Department of Agriculture) figures and are approximate values. They may differ from the ingredients you use. For precise calculations we recommend entering the weights for your ingredients and, whenever possible using a scale.\n\nINGREDIENT DATA SOURCE\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service. 2007.

      "label": "Sugar is in everything these days, from boxed cereals to pasta sauces; it's almost impossible to avoid unless you're eating a real food diet. The 7 Day Sugar-Free Detox was designed by the Young and Raw team of expert nutritionists and holistic health coaches to create a fun and cleansing experience for you while you break free from the chains of sugar. \n\nStudies show sugar can be highly addictive, so rest assured we've got your back when it comes to kicking it for good! Inside this detox, you're going to find two meal plans to choose from. Our Low-Sugar Plan has small amounts of natural sugar found in fruits. Our No-Sugar Plan is completely sugar free.\n\nRefined or processed sugar is incomplete in its nutrient profile, lacking minerals and vitamins required by our bodies for digestion. What ends up happening when we eat sugar, is our bodies have to seek out the proper minerals required for digestion and unfortunately, those minerals are \"borrowed\" from our mineral reserves. This can lead to mineral deficiency and other health issues that are today, considered \"modern diseases\". \n\nThe 7 Day Sugar Free Detox is designed to support:\n- Breaking sugar addiction\n- Weight loss\n- Liver & Kidney detox\n- Skin health \n- Balancing blood sugar \n- Mood balancing\n- Energy levels\n- Adrenal fatigue\n\nInside the 7 Day Sugar Free Detox you will find:\n- Low-Sugar Meal Plan which includes some fruit sugars\n- No-Sugar Meal Plan which is 100% sugar free\n- Recipes - along with a list of health benefits for each recipe\n- Shopping lists - to make shopping quick and easy, you can tick off items from the list\n- Morning and evening routines - including how to get a perfect night of sleep\n- Young and Raw's favorite books, quotes & documentaries\n- Frequently Asked Questions\n\nHow does the plan work to reset the body?\nThe 7 Day Sugar Free Detox was carefully crafted by experts to get you results while maintaining your sanity throughout the process! \n\nBy replacing sugar with fresh leafy greens, vegetables, seaweeds and seeds along with an abundance of healthy fats, your body will be less hungry for sugar. In the beginning, you may notice a withdrawal period as your body adjusts to running off of fat and real food rather than sugar and carbohydrates. Be patient with yourself throughout this process, it's not easy, but we know you can do it!\n\nThe meal plans have everything you need to detox, and because there are no added or refined sugars your liver and kidneys will get a much needed break from processed sugar.\n\nFor 7 days you're going to experience what it's like to enjoy only real, whole foods but don't forget that diet is only one part of the equation. Proper detox also includes getting enough fresh clean water and optimizing your sleep. Our sleep cycles ensure the body gets its time to effectively detox, renew and heal. The included sleep protocol was designed based on all of the information we have about the importance of optimized sleep and the experiments we have done, to create a protocol that really works. \n\nYour herbal protocol is always optional and if you're on any medications, pregnant or have a health condition, it's advised that you speak with your physician and consult an herbalist prior to taking new supplements. The herbal protocol is minimal yet powerful, including some of the most elite herbs for detoxing the liver, kidneys, creating clear skin and boosting energy in the process. \n\nIn Summary, the 7 Day Sugar Free Detox helps to reset the body by:\n- Gently cleansing the body and promoting toxin elimination\n- Gently introducing blood cleansing foods\n- Providing the body with enough healthy fats to begin removing a reliance upon sugar and processed carbohydrates\n- Encouraging a healthy sleep cycle \n- Creates a movement routine to stimulate the lymphatic system, the endocrine system and the detox organs\n- Hydrating effectively to flush the body of excess toxins and create electrolyte balance"

We'd love to help you get cooking!***\n\n#1 Food & Drink App and featured as one of Apple's \"Best New Apps\"!\n\nIt’s the Webby Award-winning app from Michelle Tam and Henry Fong, the James Beard Award nominated creators of Nom Nom Paleo—now available for both iPad and iPhone! Michelle and Henry’s Saveur Award winning food blog and New York Times bestselling cookbook are just the tip of the iceberg—this newly updated app makes cooking even more fun and inspirational, and takes all the guesswork out of cooking. Plus, now that the Nom Nom Paleo app’s available for iPhone, you can take these nomtastic recipes with you anywhere!\n\nFeatures:\n \n● Over 145 simple, tantalizing recipes, all free of gluten, soy, and refined sugar, sortable by food category, searchable by ingredients and category—the vast majority of which are approved for the Whole30® nutritional re-set program. You’ll find lots of recipes that are exclusive to this app, and not available on the Nom Nom Paleo website or cookbook. \n\n● More recipes are being added regularly! You won’t have to wait until future app updates—new recipes can now be added automatically to the app on your device!\n\n● More than 2,000 stunning, high-resolution photos showing every step of the cooking process.\n\n● Fun and visually-engaging new user interface and design, including a home display that allows you to quickly scroll through and visually select recipes.\n\n● Simple-to-follow instructions, including tips, shortcuts, and information about food and techniques.\n\n● An interactive, email-friendly grocery list that syncs across devices and makes food shopping a breeze.\n\n● An extensive “Paleo 101” primer that explains the benefits of the “caveman” diet and provides resources for more information about ancestral health and nutrition.\n\n● A Whole30-friendly 30-day sample meal plan with links to recipes.\n\n● An in-depth shopping guide with product reviews and links to sources for cooking tools and ingredients.\n\n● The ability to bookmark recipes, create a personalized category of favorite recipes, and add notes.\n\n● A “constant-on” function to prevent the screen from dimming while you cook.\n  \n● The ability to email complete recipes and shopping lists.\n\nPraise for Nom Nom Paleo:\n\n● The “Martha Stewart of Paleo.” –The New York Times\n\n● “Oddly provocative.” –Christopher Kimball of America’s Test Kitchen\n\n● “A must-have app.” –AppCraver\n\n● “Brilliantly designed.” –Apps Magazine\n \n● “Visually stunning.” –Gear Diary\n\n● “Always popping with flavor.” –The Kitchn\n\n● “Truly extraordinary.” –Michael Ruhlman, James Beard Award-winning food writer\n \nMessage from Michelle of Nom Nom Paleo:\n\nHey, Nomsters – my updated cookbook app is here, and it’s finally available for your iPhone!\n\nThis “cookbook on steroids” is a uniquely immersive culinary experience. It’s a visual feast packed with brand new recipes, as well as updated versions of classic Nom Nom Paleo dishes—all presented with my own special brand of whimsically snarky commentary. Food lovers and busy home cooks can visually follow each of my recipes from the pantry to the dining room table.\n \nBut that’s not all! For those who want to learn more about the “caveman” approach to nutrition and health, I’ve included a “Paleo 101” primer that explains why we eat whole, unprocessed, real foods (like meat, seafood, vegetables, fruits, and nuts) and avoid highly-processed and pro-inflammatory foods. You’ll also find an in-depth shopping guide, a 30-day meal planner, an interactive shopping list, and much, much more.\n \nMy hope is that this app will delight, engage, and inspire you to eat well and be well!\n \n● App development by Y Media Labs ●"

It's what our grandma's have been telling us for years: \"Eat real foods that are healthy, avoid highly processed factory foods and you'll feel better and live happier\".\n\nWhether you call it Paleo, real food, low carb, low sugar, grain-free, gluten-free ancestral, nutrient-dense, primal or whole food - the important thing is that the Paleo diet is a healthier way of eating. The list of benefits people have reported is enormous: \n● Weight loss ● More energy that doesn't vary wildly throughout the day ● Improved sleep ● Clearer skin ● Better digestion ● Improved fitness ● Reduced allergies. The list goes on but it's better to try it for yourself.\n\nThe 250 Paleo recipes included will help satisfy your cravings for delicious, healthy food. Inside Caveman Feast you'll find healthy breakfasts, filling main meals, tasty desserts, side dishes and snacks. \n\nRecipes include:\n● Perfect paleo burger\n● Paleo french toast\n● Healthy caveman cookies \n● Blueberry espresso brownies\n● Grilled buffalo shrimp\n● Smoked avocado lime pork chops\n● Apple dijon burgers\n● Homemade healthy mayonnaise\n● Caveman crunch bars\n● Sweet potato pasta\n● Beasty BBQ sauce\n● Caveman shepherd's pie\n\nFeatures in the app include:\n● Add recipes to your shopping list and see it organised by aisle, saving time at the grocery store\n● Track your calories and macros with our nutritional data\n● Increase or decrease recipe servings\n● Search by ingredient\n● Add notes to recipes\n● Share recipes with friends\n● Switch the measurement units\n● Plan a week of meals\n● Tick off your shopping list on your Apple Watch\n● Integrated with Apple Health\n\nThe quick and easy to follow recipes are by New York Times bestselling author George Bryant of civilizedcavemancooking.com. After decades in a constant battle with his weight and nearly losing both his legs while on deployment as a U.S. Marine, George decided to change his life. He went Paleo. What started as a simple website to share recipes with friends, has since grown into an award-winning food blog. After being in the Marines for 12 years, George now enjoys creating delicious Paleo recipes full-time, hoping to change as many lives as he can with real food recipes.\n\nGeorge works in collaboration with Abel James from the chart topping podcast \"The Fat-Burning Man show\" where he covers the Paleo lifestyle. Abel has been featured in Men's Health, Popular Science and Wired Magazine. You'll find exclusive content from Abel inside the app.\n\nNote: For users upgrading\nCaveman Feast 3.0 is available as a free update on iOS 9.3 and above.

In BLW (Baby Led Weaning) you don't put spoons, or pieces of food in your baby’s mouth. You simply offer your baby food, and he eats what he wants.\n\nBaby-led weaning allows babies to control their solid food consumption by \"self-feeding\" from the very beginning of their experiences with food. Baby-led weaning places the emphasis on exploring taste, texture, color and smells as the baby sets their own pace for the meal, and chooses which foods to concentrate on. Instead of spooning food into your baby's mouth, you present him or her with varied finger foods from which to choose and he or she chooses what to eat and how much. If she doesn't touch the oatmeal balls you made for her you do not put them in her mouth, you just offer them to her again at another meal."

      "label": "The Food Guide is your culinary adviser in an app. The program contains basic information for 2,000 foods and culinary specialties – and assists with translation when on vacation abroad. In order to know what’s behind a “Lubina” on a Spanish menu, all you need is to whip out your iPhone.\n\nFOOD ENCYCLOPEDIA AND SHOPPING ASSISTANCE\nFor every entry, the App provides at least one photo, evaluates culinary quality and indicates the scientific name, if applicable. In the description, the most important and relevant culinary information is summarized all in one place, and is followed by hints to uses in cuisine and its processing and preparation – without the App actually intending to be a cookbook. \n\nTRANSLATION ASSISTANCE ABROAD\nTravelers mostly enjoy that all the food names are simultaneously given in five languages – English, French, German, Spanish and Italian. Thus, it is possible to translate menus abroad, to ask about a specific fish on a Spanish market or to look up whether Banon cheese from the cheese menu in a restaurant is made with raw milk or not. \n\nSEARCH BY KEYWORD OR CHAPTER\nThe Food Guide can be perused by individual ingredients, but is also organized into 21 categories such as “Fish”, “Vegetables and Legumes”, “Herbs and Seasonings”, “Cheese”, “Seafood” and “Sausages and Ham”, to name just a few.\n\nFAVORITES FUNCTION\nInteresting findings can be transferred into an App-specific favorites list with just the touch of a finger. That way, they can quickly be found again at any time.\n\nRUNS OFFLINE\nIt is not necessary to have an Internet or a telephone connection to run the App. You will always have full access to all of the information, regardless of whether you find yourself on the beach on the Bahamas, in a Spanish mountain village or in a delicatessen in Paris.\n \nFood Guide Features:\n• Extremely attractive, easy to use interface\n• Multilingual dictionary with 2,000 food products and ingredients\n• Each entry accompanied by at least one highres picture of the product\n• More than 2,500 high quality pictures\n• Scientific names included in descriptions\n• Offers product knowledge and consumer information\n• App has 21 comprehensive chapters\n• Shows 1-5 star rating of enjoyment level \n• Versatile search functions\n• ‘Favorites’ feature lets you bookmark products that you want to return to"

I have first-hand knowledge. \n\nIn the photo you can see a visual confirmation of how did I burn fat from 106 kg to 81 kg of pure muscle mass.\n\nHowever, this doesn't mean that the Roman program is suitable only for the athletes who practice hard in the gym for 2 hours every day. I have given nutritional advice to many of my friends who have simply decided to live a healthy life and lose excess weight. Each and every one of them has achieved the desired result. And every time, I used the same calculations to draw up a meal plan.\n\nIt was quite boring. However, it was then that I had the idea to create Roman app using which everyone could instantly learn how to eat to lose weight now.\n\nTherefore, in my budget weight loss meal plan app, I, with mathematical precision, share the knowledge and experience with you on how to lose weight now.\n\nI wrote this budget weight loss meal plan app myself from scratch. Yes, I had to learn a programming language for iOS apps, but for me it is a pleasure as I deal with the development of websites.\n\nRoman app gives out the information that is usually given by coaches in the gym provided that you will pay for the training with a personal trainer. And such training is not cheap enjoyment.\n\nAll you need to get a detailed ration list is just to enter your current body weight. And that's it! The budget weight loss meal plan app will calculate the rest and present all necessary information on nutrition in a convenient form specially for you.\n\nYou can train in the gym until you are blue in the face, but if you eat fast food and sausages, you will not change your body shape. \n\nIn order to transform your body your priority should be on your nutrition first and training second, but not vice a versa."

If we guessed wrong, just tap on the ingredients in a recipe to switch back and forth.\n\nMULTI INGREDIENT SEARCH\nSearching for drinks with one or more ingredients is trivial. Go ahead, find all the drinks with Rum, Lime Juice, and Orange Liqueur. It's actually quite fun.\n\nCURATED SHORTLISTS\nPicking a drink out of a list of hundreds is overwhelming. Try looking through one of our curated shortlists. Whether it's Brunch, Girls Night Out, or just some Rest for the Wicked, we probably have a list for you.\n\nFLAVOR PROFILES\nAre you in the mood for lime or strawberry? Or maybe coffee? Either way, the flavor lists will help you find what you are looking for.\n\nSAVE YOUR FAVORITES\nLet's be honest, your memory is not at its best when drinking. Tap the heart next to a drink to add it to your favorites, so you can remember what to blame for your hangover.\n\nOTHER FEATURES\n* Sort by drink name or by glass type.\n* Search ingredients and drinks by name.\n* Automatic updates when new recipes are added.\n* Works offline.

      "label": "\"Kitchen Scales\" is the only app that, through a simple and pleasant interface, allows you to measure the amount of sugar, flour or liquids in a container of your choice.\n\nThe operation is very simple:\n\n1 - The first thing you will need is a glass or a regular-sized cup, preferably a transparent one.\n\n2 - Select what you want to measure and the shape of the container, either cylindrical or rectangular. Also remember to select the thickness of the edges and the bottom. A difference of a few millimetres will result in errors of several tens of grams.\n\n3 - Place the phone on the container.\n\n4 - Use your fingers to choose the diameter, making it match that of the container.\n\n5 - Place the phone next to the container and use your finger to choose the level of the measurement. If your phone has a cover, remove it, otherwise SUBTRACT the thickness of the cover from the thickness of the edge.\n\n6 - At this point you'll get the grams or millilitres if you are measuring a liquid.\n\nFor the first few times check the measurements, just to get started. Measurements made with this application are only approximate. They are quite precise, but they cannot be compared to measurements on scales."

You use a simple interface to plan out meals like “Hamburgers on Thursday, Fish and Rice on Friday”. Recent meals are easily available or you can type in new items the first time you use them.\n\nMealPlan is a universal app, and will sync between your iPhone and iPad using either iCloud or Dropbox. Plan your meals on the iPad's big screen, and automatically have your grocery list with you on your phone. And access your grocery list from your Apple Watch.\n\nMealPlan creates your grocery list as you're planning meals. When you're done, tap the Grocery Basket to see the list, add new items, mark off items you already have, and then print it, email it, or sync it with your iPhone. This is a huge time saver!\n\nAnd, on the iPad, once you’ve used the app for a few weeks, the Magic Wand will help you quickly fill out subsequent weeks, with a quick suggestions interface.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Simple interface to plan out meals.\n- Keep track of recipes and the groceries they use.\n- Automatically generated grocery list based on your meal plan.\n- Save grocery lists for later use (think \"Party\" or \"Camping\").\n- Save a week's planned meals as a template to reuse.\n- Combined search/add box makes it easy to add new items.\n- Print out a week's plan to any AirPrint printer.\n- Configure your own meals: Add snacks, or remove breakfast if you don't want to plan it.\n- Email a plain text summary of the week's plan.\n- Add a note to any meal item, including clickable links.\n- Dropbox sync for families with multiple devices and accounts.\n- Use Siri for groceries: \"Add Milk to my Grocery List\".\n\n\"Before MealPlan, I’d buy food at the grocery store and then forget I had it .. a few days later it would go to waste. A few minutes every week standing in front of the fridge with MealPlan in hand will help you get the most out of what you have on hand. Plan it, print it out and stick it to your fridge!\"\n\nVisit the website for more information, and a detailed walkthrough of what MealPlan can do."

Then you probably own a circulator or a similar device. To start, a zip-bag, a cooking pot and a thermometer is all you need. Many Sous Vide recipes work without special equipment. But you will need good advice!\n\nSous Vide has been adopted in professional kitchens for producing precise and consistent results. The Sous Vide method produces perfectly cooked food with outstanding flavor. Its success in high-end cuisine changed the culinary world. With a few starting tips anyone can use this technique. Step-by-step tutorials and Sous Vide timers (mini-recipes with an alarm) help you along the way.\n\nIdeas, suggestions or anything you would like to change? Contact us with your feedback on UserVoice!\n\nThe time for a piece of meat to reach a core temperature can be calculated. A formula using thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity and surface heat transfer calculates the time such shapes as cylinders, cubes and steaks need to acquire a certain core temperature. Consider the PolyScience Toolbox App or Douglas Baldwin’s formulas for calculating pasteurization times.\n\nBut food is never an exact geometrical shape and waiting for an extra hour for a piece to reach an additional half a degree is impractical. Adjustments for speed and efficiency improve the Sous Vide experience. We have tested Sous Vide recommendations that work and tutorials that make the first steps easy - for professionals and home cooks alike!\n\nSous Vide - no other cooking method gives you so much control!\n\nDon’t get the Anova Pro or the new Anova Precision Cooker (2019) as these devices are no longer equipped with Bluetooth!"

The best-selling cookbook, Ratio: The Simple Codes Behind the Craft of Everyday Cooking, by me, Michael Ruhlman, is now an iPhone app that will help you calculate amounts of ingredients in all the fundamental culinary preparations.  When you know a ratio, you don’t know a recipe, you know 1,000.  And this application does all the calculating for you.\n\n “Cooking, like so many other creative endeavors is defined by relationships.  For instance, knowing exactly how much flour to put into a loaf of bread isn’t nearly as useful as understanding the relationship between the flour and the water, or fat, or salt.  That relationship is defined by a ‘ratio’ and having a ratio in hand is like having a secret decoder ring that frees you from the tyranny of recipes. ….Michael Ruhlman, in handing us mortals a power better suited to the gods, has changed the balance of kitchen power forever.” —Good Eats host Alton Brown\n\n\nWhat You Get:\n\n--THE 32 CRITICAL RATIOS that form the backbone of the culinary arts, with instructions: doughs, batters, meat preparations, custards, sauces (pasta dough and pizza dough, sponge cake and pancakes, fritters and crepes, stocks and sauces, crème caramel and chocolate sauce.\n\n--A CALCULATOR that figures out how much of each ingredient you need, no matter how many or how few people you want to serve.\n\n--An OUNCES-TO-GRAMS CONVERTER (ratios work no matter what unit you choose to use!).\n\n--DELICIOUS VARIATIONS FOR RECIPES on all the ratios, ideas for the creation of new dishes according to your tastes.\n\n--An easy way to STORE YOUR OWN RECIPES and notes that you’ve created from the basic ratios.\n\n--Quick fun ways to SHARE what your cooking with your fellow cooks, on Facebook and on Twitter.\n\n--Ratios is also a great way to understand and TWEAK YOUR OWN RECIPES, to help you make your pancakes even fluffier, your pizza dough crisper, your crème brulee richer."

Fromage provides a convenient pocket resource of fantastic cheeses made throughout the world for your culinary exploration.

You can add your own favorite cheeses to the standard library and include personal notes about any of the cheeses.\n\nSearching within the library for that special cheese can be by name, country, milk-type, texture, or by your own custom tags (such as #atmystore).\n\nSo, if you’re a classically trained chef, professional party planner, cheese buyer, or just plain cheese lover, grab Fromage, your favorite wine, and experience the wonderful and historic flavors of cheese.\n_________________________________\n\nFromage comes with the ability to create personal cheese notes, rate cheeses from 1 to 5 stars (included an “Avoid” rating), add cheeses to your favorite lists (Try, Buy, or Favorites categories), record tasting impressions with up to 70 tasting keywords, and search the cheese library.\n\nYou can also enter your own cheeses (including photos captured from your device camera) and list those cheeses automatically in the “My Additions” category.  There is also a “Share” feature so cheese information can be sent (via e-mail) to friends or to the developer for inclusion in future versions of Fromage. \n_________________________________\n\nInternet or Wi-Fi connection is not required for program use, which is great for remote locations when no data plan is available.\n\nWhen internet is available, Fromage uses iCloud to synchronize your cheese entries and notes between all of your Apple devices which can include iPhone, iPad, and Macintosh.\n\nThe application provides English, French, Spanish, and German languages when the iOS device settings are set to that language."

Gelato tailors recipes to your ingredients so that they are perfect. Every. Single. Time. Do you want the ultimate triple chocolate ice cream, with chocolate slivers, brownie bits, topped with hot fudge and peanut butter sauce, and a dollop of whipped cream? And maybe reduce the fat by 25%? Gelato has the recipes for you. You want that as a vegan recipe? Not a problem. Do you have allergies? Gelato can let you know - and help you avoid - the allergens. Or maybe you want to choose between a rich custard base, a refreshing Philly base, or a milky gelato base? This app does that too.\n\nWhen you buy Gelato it comes with 10 classic flavors. Want more? Extra flavors are sold in packs of 4, with each pack costing less than a single scoop in an ice cream parlor. Every time you buy a pack you help with the continued development of the app, and we test every flavor personally before releasing it. If you want all of the flavors, then jump the gun and buy the Chef's special. You get all the flavor packs, both the ones out now and those we'll be releasing in the future. Simples!\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Dust of your ice cream maker, get your ingredients out, and start making the most stunning ice cream you will ever taste! All you need is a little nudge from our Gelato app to give you that absolutely perfect recipe."

      "label": "Save time and money managing your fridge and pantry with Kiff, and always eat your food in its best state possible.\n\nBy eating fresh food, you waste less, save money, and help the planet. With a unique UI and beautiful details, Kiff is the perfect companion in your journey to reduce food waste at home.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n• Add your packaged food in seconds with the barcode scanner.\n\n• Keep expiration dates under control so you can eat your groceries before it's too late.\n\n• Food open or stored for too long? Track the time since you opened, bought, or cooked your food.\n\n• Set the desired shelf life for each food and eat them before the time runs out.\n\n• Alerts, always on time. Kiff will notify you when your food is due soon.\n\n• Manage the food inventory and automatically add low-stock food to a list in the system's Reminders app.\n\n• All your groceries and leftovers in one app. Always in sight, so you know what to eat at a glance.\n\n• Find out what categories of food you consume and throw away more, and even identify those specific items that you always end up tossing away thanks to the consumption insights.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK\n\nWhen you arrive home from the grocery store and before storing your food in the fridge or pantry, open Kiff and add each item to the app. As easy as setting a shelf life and an expiration date, if they have one.\n\nYou don't have to add all the groceries at once. Start with fresh produce and food that goes in the fridge or freezer. You can add those items stored in the pantry or with the farthest expiration date later on.\n\nFor leftovers and when you cook for the whole week, just right after storing them in the fridge or freezer, open Kiff, and add them. As easy as setting a shelf life and starting the tracker.\n\nThat's it! Kiff will remind you to eat your leftovers and groceries before they go bad.\n\nABOUT KIFF\n\nYou open the fridge any day, and there they are, the sour milk, the expired yogurt, bad-looking leftovers, or the rotten lemon. The incredible thing is that about 1/3 of the world's food production is lost or wasted—1.3 billion tons per year, around 170 and 180 kilos per person. The output of 30% of the planet's agricultural land (that's greater than the size of China!), along with 170 billion cubic meters of water, all wasted.\n\nOnce all this food breaks down, it produces a carbon footprint of 4.4 billion tons of CO2 each year. Between 8 and 10% of the global greenhouse emissions. The third-largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world, just after China and the USA.\n\n40% of all this waste is generated at home—expired produce and discarded or gone bad leftovers that we throw away because we have cooked too much. The annual cost for each family can be a surprising amount between $1,200 and $1,800 US dollars, depending on where you live on the planet.\n\nWe build Kiff with one goal in mind: help you eat your food in its best state possible. Because food loses its nutritional capabilities after keeping it for too long, and if spoiled, it can be a risk for your health. By eating fresh food, you waste less, save money, and help the planet.\n\nMORE\n\n• Visit https://kiff.app to know more.\n\n• Discover more about food waste at https://kiff.app/awareness/\n\n• Check out our tips at https://kiff.app/support/\n\n• Check out our Food and Leftovers Shelf Life Guide at https://kiff.app/support/tips/food-shelflife-guide/ to learn how long your food can be stored."

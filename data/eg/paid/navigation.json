Watch in full screen, view in AR, search, add filters and so much more!\n\nShip Finder has been top rated and top ranking since 2009 and covers most of the world, tracking 20,000+ ships simultaneously.\n\nOur incredible app performance means that you can see all tracked vessels at once - no clustering here!\nSimply tap a ship to see its name, type, photos, speed, dimensions and much more.\nPowerful features such as filters, search and the ability to save favourite ships are included. (You can choose Apple or Google maps too!).\n\nAdd and browse bookmarks to saved locations around the globe to quickly navigate to areas or ports of interest.\n\nYou can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. \n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer, GPS tracker and trip cost monitor for iPhones and cellular iPads. \n∙∙ When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! \n∙∙ The cost monitor shows you the current cost of the journey as you drive and tells you each passengers share. \n∙∙ GPS tracker records your trips so they can be analyzed, viewed and shared at any moment.\n\n‣‣ COST MONITOR. What's the cost of my driving?\nBased on gas price for a gallon or litre, MPG (U.S. or UK) or liters per 100 km the app will tell you what the cost is as you drive. You can add an extra cost per kilometer or mile! Useful for all cost aware drivers and for splitting the cost between passengers.\n\n‣‣ GPS TRACKING. Where I've been? How long did it take to get from A to B? \nSpeedometer records your trip statistics even when GPS tracker is switched off. When you need point by point data to see on the map later or export (Google Earth and GPX), speedometer gives you the first class GPS tracker.\n\n‣‣ INFOTAINMENT. \nWhen switched on, infotainment shows trip stats or weather/wind forecast  when you wait. Way better than just showing you a 0 speed!\n\n‣‣ Easy to set speed limits and SPEED LIMIT MEMORY option\nSet speed limits with 4 or 8 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! With SPEED LIMIT MEMORY you just apply the speed limit once and the app applies it for you automatically the next time!\n\n‣‣ MODES\nUse MENU>MODES to turn the app into a Rally computer, G-Force monitor, Camera alerter or taximeter! Currently there are 12 modes available and we are constantly adding new ones.\n\n‣‣ WAYPOINTS.\nSpeedometer gives you the unique way to leave a note with location and even optional photo or audio note attached! As easy as double tap on the big speed digits! You'll find more in a documentation section (star button).\n\n‣‣ RED LIGHT & SPEED CAMERAS\nImport camera data into speedometer in Garmin or iGO csv formats from poi-factory.com, scdb.info or poi-plaza and let speedo alert you on a camera approach and set speed limit automatically before you pass the speed camera!\n\n‣‣ SUNSET/SUNRISE\nWith the sunset and sunrise information that our speedometer provides, you'll be able to avoid driving in the dusk.\n\n‣‣ BARO VSI. Barometric Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI, IVSI) in both scale and graph forms.\n\n‣‣ VOICE COACH. When enabled and configured, voice coach will be telling you active track distance and duration as well as current speed and altitude.\n\n‣‣ MAPS. Google's native, Apple map, Blank map and Offline maps.\n\n‣‣ Siri shortcuts: New Track, Stop Track, Speed limits.\n\n+ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and cellular iPads. All in retina graphics.\n\n+ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KM/H AND KNOTS. Maximum/TOP, average speed, distance traveled.\n\n+ BACKGROUND MODE! Speedometer will work in background if told so and will still warn you with audio alert when exceed a preset speed limit. You can use other apps while speedometer does its job in the background!\n\n+ PRIVACY. Speedometer never shares your location data with 3rd parties or ad agencies. Location data is used solely for tracking your speed and recording the GPS tracks and never leave the app unless you decide to share by means of a track export. It always let you know when background mode is on and never runs in background unless it is explicitly told to do so.\n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone as well as on any cellular iPad. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS (external GPS module is required). \n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nDrive safely, keep the log and notes and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal companion no matter what journey you are going on!"

      "label": "“Awesome!!! The best speed app on iphone” 5 Stars by kurtonic\n\nSpeed Box is a Speedometer and GPS app for both your iPhone and iPad. It displays your current speed, distance, direction and altitude along with your top speed and average speed. The app also keeps a record of the speed and altitude for the last few hours.\n\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n========================\n\n* MPH, KM/H and KNOTS\n* Show decimal speed (e.g. \"45.7 mph\")\n* One app for both the iPhone and iPad\n* \"Speak speed\" - Tap screen to have the speed spoken to you\n* 11 Analog and digital speedometers\n* Map view\n* Maximum and average speed\n* Altitude \n* Digital compass \n* HUD display to see speed in windshield \n* Odometer to measure distance traveled \n* Chart of the traveled speed and altitude \n* Warning signal when driving too fast \n* Export last 3 hours of data \n* Change maximum displayed speed on speedometer \n* Swipe finger over chart to display historic data \n* Display GPS accuracy by tapping the indicator in the top left corner \n\n\nUSER REVIEWS\n========================\n\n5 Stars by Darekakuta \n\"Just what I needed. My '58 chev's speedo doesn't work. This did the trick.\" \n\n5 Stars by Rawd \n\"Great My 79 Firebird speedo only goes to 140 kmh. ;). This worked perfectly.\" \n\n5 Stars \n\"Within 1 mile per hour +/- Great Job!\" \n\nSpeedBox was one of the very early Speedometer Apps for the iPhone. Take advantage of my experience and the refined algorithms that can get a much greater accuracy from the iPhone then a lot of other apps. I regularly update my application to make it even more accurate and usable. \n\nUsers have already used our application to verify the accuracy of their car's speedometer or they tried measuring the speed they achieved while skiing. Can you come up with more ideas? How about measuring the speed of the airplane you travel with? \n\nUSAGE NOTES\n========================\nThe \"GPS strength\" indicator in the top left corner should display a green dot. You can tap this indicator to display the current GPS accuracy.\n\nPlease allow the application up to a minute to find enough satellites to work correctly. \n\nIf you get a message to enable GSP, please go to ”Settings > General > Location Services“ on your iPhone and check if the little switch is set to \"On\" for Speed Box as well as for \"Location Services\" in general. \n\nATTENTION iPod touch users! Unfortunately this app doesn't work very well on the iPod touch and the iPad WiFI (without 3G) since these devices are missing a GPS!\n\n\nFEEDBACK\n========================\nIf you've got any wishes or suggestions for new features, please let me know with the contact form on this application's website (see link below).\n\nI am already working on the next update!"

      "label": "Theodolite was one of the earliest augmented reality (AR) apps for iOS when it debuted in 2009 -- in fact Theodolite was pioneering AR technology before \"AR\" was even a buzzword! In the time since, Theodolite has been used by millions of consumers and professionals in their outdoor adventures and on the job. Now, we've taken the Theodolite concept to Apple Watch by combining a compass, inclinometer, GPS, and maps into one indispensable app that sits on your wrist. We're excited to keep evolving this centuries-old instrument as hardware and software technologies allow the concept to come to new device formats.\n\nOn iPhone and iPad, Theodolite uses a viewfinder format, uniting the device sensors (GPS, magnetometer, gyro, accelerometer) and camera.  On Apple Watch, Theodolite combines data from these sensors into an AHRS (attitude and heading reference system) layout similar to what you'd see in the glass cockpit of a modern aircraft. This layout allows Theodolite to efficiently display compass bearing (yaw angle), pitch angle, and roll angle in a compact format that works extremely well on a small screen.  This information is augmented by latitude, longitude, and altitude from GPS, as well as sun and moon position.\n\nNew in Theodolite for Watch version 2 is a map screen and waypoint manager.  You can add waypoints on the map or at your current location, and view waypoints on the compass ring to visualize their bearing from your current location.\n\nTheodolite has settings for compass mode (true or magnetic), distance/altitude units (feet or meters), and position format (decimal degrees, degrees-minutes-seconds, MGRS, USNG, UTM, UTM-B, and Maidenhead Locator System).  Users can choose to display an artificial horizon in the center of the app display (tied to pitch and roll) and can set the app's level reference to flat or vertical orientations of the Watch.  The app has six color schemes, including two night vision modes - midnight red and luminescent green.\n\nTheodolite for Watch is recommended for Apple Watch Series 5 and later (including Ultra).  Apple Watch Series 4 and older do not have a compass sensor and will not show compass data.  On older devices, the app uses the device's gyro sensor to measure rotation.  You can twist the watch's digital crown to adjust and calibrate the gyro to the sun position, moon position, or a known bearing.  Using these references, the \"gyro compass\" is able to give bearing.  The calibration can be repeated as often as desired to give accurate results.\n\nTheodolite reports accuracy from the magnetometer sensor in your Watch.  To improve results, operate Theodolite away from magnets, electronics, or sources of electro-magnetic interference, including car dashboards, aircraft cockpits, metal structures, and other devices.\n\nLike all our apps, we plan to continually improve and evolve Theodolite for Watch.  Please contact us with feature requests, suggestions, and general feedback.  We'd love to hear what you're doing with the app!  And if you don't already have Theodolite for your iPhone or iPad, check it out!"

Live map markers continually update distance/heading relative to the current location and also show wayfinding info in the main viewfinder. Draw polygons on the map to mark things like property boundaries and trails, and import/export polygon data via KML.\n\nShare map markers and nav calculator points with other users of Theodolite via text messages or e-mail. This powerful capability opens up a wide range of collaborative uses including team land surveying, accident investigations, spotting wild fires, triangulation of landmarks, and advanced tactical observation and targeting. With an optional in-app purchase to enable team tracking, you can share location with up to 20 people on Theodolite's map.\n\nTheodolite includes features for serious users like a reference angle mode, nav calculator, map marker import/export, manual and automatic data logging with CSV and KML export, clipboard integration, %grade display, mil compass readout, optical rangefinders (including a mil-based reticle, sniper-style stadiametric graphs, and a variable 4X-24X scope), and night filters to improve use in dark conditions.\n\nTheodolite can provide location in military grid reference system (MGRS) coordinates, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, British/Irish National Grids, US National Grid, Maidenhead locator system, Map Grid of Australia, and six latitude/longitude formats. Optional US State Plane coordinates include SPCS27 and SPCS83 zones covering all US States. The optional Datum Pack adds over 230 geodetic datums to the app to improve position computation from GPS data, covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.\n\nAR Layers include navigational aids like the sun, moon, planets, and Polaris (North star), and the optional US Mountain Summits layer that shows over 70,000 US mountain summits in the viewfinder.\n\nTheodolite has been shown in Apple Keynotes, featured on the App Store, and has been a #1 selling Navigation app in App Stores around the world. Since its introduction in 2009, Theodolite has defined augmented reality navigation. The app continually introduces new technologies, pushing the limits of iOS app development and taking advantage of new hardware capabilities.\n\nFind out why Apple named Theodolite one of the most amazing apps available and showed it being used to explore the Great Wall of China. Where will you take it on your next adventure?\n\nNote: Theodolite is an iPhone app -- see “Theodolite HD” for use on an iPad. And be sure to check out the all-new \"Theodolite for Watch\" and put Theodolite on your wrist!"

For example, an E6B can be used to calculate heading and groundspeed after taking into account forecast winds. An E6B is also used to calculate data used for performance planning such as density altitude.  Our version goes beyond the analog E6B and even beyond all other E6B apps by including functionality to calculate time, rate and radius of turns, pivotal altitude (great for flight training use), and more."

It keeps a history of your locations with speed, course, altitude, and user activity data, lets you track your loved ones, check the speed they are travelling, get directions to their current location or view a street level picture of any place they are or they have been. You can also overlay and compare your contacts location against a GPX track: import from files, Strava or Apple Watch workout routes (the app integrates with HealthKit)\n\nMain features include:\n- safe location sharing with the people you trust, in real time\n- live data: force a contact’s device to immediately send a fresh location\n- passive and battery friendly: run in the background with no noticeable impact on battery life, location is periodically updated as the device moves\n- context data: location data can include location history, speed and course, altitude, whether you’re walking, running, moving in a vehicle or resting\n- you are in control: set who sees your current location or who has access to your location history with fine-grained access controls\n\nOther features: \n- excellent battery usage: PlaceTrack uses SLC mode (Significant Location Change) and region monitoring, NOT continuous background. PlaceTrack is suspended in the background most of the time and is woken up only when you move significantly (detected using cell towers signal); most of the time it just sleeps and the GPS hardware is powered off to preserve battery. Install the app and forget about it\n- save your location history for later viewing\n- optionally share your recent location or location history with authorized PlaceTrack contacts\n- forced contact location updates: you can ask for a live location update from a contact and the backend platform will silently ask your contact device for a new location update \n- delayed sync: stores your locations when network is unreachable and pushes them to the PlaceTrack servers when you're back online \n- in-app streetview images\n- track overlays: import route data from Apple Watch, Strava and GPX files\n- location sharing works using address book phone numbers: your phone number is authenticated through an sms code on your first activation \n- your data, including your phone number and location, is always sent on a secure connection (ssl) and is never shared with any third party"

Messages are also classified by system and ATA chapter, thus helping you focus on your FCOM or maintenance manual for additional research.\n\nB737 Alerts was developed by Bill Bulfer, a recently retired captain with a major airline with extensive time in type.

Pocket Earth then renders its beautiful vector maps on your device using our OpenGL ES based MagikMap technology.\n\nTo learn more about Pocket Earth or the community driven open data sources that we use, please visit our website.\n\n\nDon’t forget this:\n   1. Using the GPS features of this app can significantly affect battery life. Only leave GPS enabled when you need to use it. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Pocket Earth only uses GPS in the background for route navigation and gps track recording features. \n   2. This app uses data from the amazing community driven open mapping project called openstreetmap.org!  Coverage detail may vary by region, please visit our website to check the map detail for your regions of interest.\n   3.

      "label": "TrafficCamNZ displays internet accessible pictures of Traffic Cameras all over the world. Use it for any image with a fixed URL (web address).\n\nImages you choose as \"Featured\" are downloaded and setup side by side so that you can swipe across the screen to view multiple images quickly.\nTrafficCamNZ works over the cellular network though it works best with WiFi because, usually, it's faster!\n\nTrafficCamNZ can also use the GPS features in your device to show cameras around you. Try the predictive mode that predicts where you are travelling to display the next cameras (with known GPS coordinates) on your journey.\n\nTrafficCamNZ now contains details of more than 7000 cameras from around the world. You choose which cameras are the \"featured\" ones. Featured cameras are easily identified in the Library; they have a Green dot next to them.\nManaging your own personal list of cameras is easy too. This can be done in two ways:\n1. Enter a new camera directly on the iPhone and key in the entire URL (http://mywebsite/image.jpg) or\n2. Create your own XML file for importing into the application. Instructions on how to do this are available at the support web site or by contacting the developer.\n\nUsage Notes:\n* Pictures are displayed in the order they are received unless you set the image sequence number, you can then order the images how you want them\n* Check your network usage when downloading over the cellular network\n* Images are not cached, if you receive an image that isn't right (i.e. daylight when you know it is night time, that camera may not be functioning)\n* Sometimes the traffic camera pictures are not up-to-date. You may see night pictures when it is supposed to be daylight or perhaps pictures don't change. TrafficCamNZ has no control over that\n* You receive updates to the camera list automatically; a check is performed every 7 days when the application starts\n* Tap the image on the main window to display it full screen\n\nFeatures:\n* Easily flick through the loaded images with your finger - this was the original idea behind the application\n* Load your own web images\n* Free version available, loads up to 3 images\n* Full version available, loads up to 19 images on iPhone and 32 images on iPad\n* Allows XML import of camera list\n* Camera list (XML Import file) can be updated from a web site - doesn't require the release of a new application\n* No advertising\n\nMany great comments from around the world have been made about TrafficCamNZ:\n* Great little app, what a time saver. I would often leave work to find the traffic all congested, now I can check before I leave and even if it gets busy I can check on the road and take a different route. I have set my own cameras and can quickly check what's what. A real must for driving commuters, couriers or even taxi's. \n* This app works very well and is awesome if you travel a lot. Going on a road trip for work or vacation?  Google the cameras for your cities, insert the URL into the app, and cameras appear \n* I set it up for all the traffic cameras from Douglas County down through El Paso County (Colorado) and it works great!  So well in fact, that I sprung for the paid version\n* Make sure you enter in the URL's correctly - that's where some people mess up.  What you see is basically what the traffic/weather cam sees wherever they are. They have to be viewable on the Internet first. Awesome app!\n* App is very easy to use and I use it for going to work every day\n* I put 2 of the most important traffic cams on the way to work and it works perfect"

      "label": "Save time and money on your instrument flight training by mastering IFR holding pattern entries at the comfort of your own mobile device.\n\nMake IFR flight training easier!\n\nIs the following scenario familiar? You receive a holding clearance from ATC, and only have a couple of minutes, sometimes only a few seconds, to choose the correct entry. By the time you've figured out what's going on, you've already passed the holding fix and don't know what to do next.\n\nIf this sounds familiar, then you need not to worry. Confusion during holding entries happens to practically almost every new instrument student. Even instrument-rated pilots occasionally have the same problem — when they don't get enough practice.\n\nHolding Trainer solves this problem and as a result, cuts the time you have to spend on expensive flight and ground lessons. With Holding Trainer, you can practice on your own time and convenience, so that choosing the best holding entry in the air becomes a breeze. \n\n\nFeatures: \n\n-Entry Trainer - Drills you on choosing the best holding entry. Practice until choosing holding entries becomes second nature and impress your flight instructor with your skills.\n\n-Holding calculator. Solve and visualize any holding scenario by entering your current bearing to the fix and a outbound or inbound holding radial. \n\n-Holding tutorial - learn how to choose the best holding entry quickly and easily.\n\nHolding Trainer for iOS is a complete rewrite based on my popular Flash-based desktop Holding Trainer app available on pilotscafe.com.\n\n***Don't get \"stuck\" next time you receive a holding pattern clearance!***\n----------------------------------\nFor only a fraction of the cost of one ground lesson with your flight instructor, you can practice this important instrument skill at your own pace and save hundreds of Dollars on figuring out holding entries in the air.\n\nThis is a great tool for anyone training towards their instrument checkride, CFII, proficiency check, or simply trying to improve their holding patterns.\n----------------------------------"

      "label": "BlindSquare is pioneering accessible navigation both indoors and outdoors. Know where you are, know where you're going, travel with confidence.\n\nBlindSquare is a new solution that combines the latest technology to help the blind with their daily lives. It has been developed in collaboration with blind people and carefully field tested. You need either an iPhone or an iPad to get started. It also supports some additional accessories to enhance the experience. \n\nHow does it work? \n\nBlindSquare uses GPS and the compass to locate you. It then gathers information about the surrounding environment from FourSquare. BlindSquare has some unique algorithms to decide what information is the most relevant and then speaks it to you with high quality speech synthesis. \n“What's the most popular café within 200 meters radius? Where is the post office or the library?” \n\nYou can control BlindSquare also through voice commands. The Voice Command feature is a premium service requiring purchase of credits for continuous use.  Voice Command Credits are available as an in-app purchase on the App Store.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a GPS solution:\n\nWhen you start the app, it will start telling you the interesting places and street crossings around you. By changing the radius, you can limit the area you are interested in. You can also search by search term or by category. You can select an interesting place from the search results and perform the following tasks:\n\n1) Get contact info (address, phone number) \n2) Open twitter feed or restaurant menu (if provided)\n3) Make a phone call\n4) Start tracking the place (BlindSquare will assist you by repeating the distance and the clock face direction)\n5) Start your favourite navigator for turn-by-turn instructions (TomTom, Navigon or Apple Maps)\n\nBlindSquare is aware of when you travel by car, bus or train and starts to report interesting places in front of you (for example, the next stops) and street crossings when you are passing them.\n\nYou can also save your own private places to iCloud so they will be found with your every device.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a Foursquare client:\n\nIf you like to play Foursquare, you can do the following with BlindSquare:\n \n1) Get a list of nearby FourSquare venues\n2) When you are in a place, you can check in by shaking your device\n3) Do a check in with commenting and twitter/facebook sharing\n4) Correct the location of the place\n\nBlindSquare supports the following languages: English, Arabic, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean (South Korea), Norwegian, Polish, Portugues, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\nVoiceOver usage is supported but it also includes higher quality additional speech synthesis by Acapela Text-To-Speech from Acapela Group.\n \nInstructions in English: https://www.blindsquare.com/user-guide/ and https://www.blindsquare.com/faq/\n\nPlease note: This app retrieves data in real time from Foursquare and Open Street Map. Use of a flat rate data plan is highly recommended.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nHaving only been released in May 2012, BlindSquare has already received several prizes and awards:\n\n - GSMA: Global Mobile Awards 2013, Best Mobile Health Product or Service\n - Apps4Finland 2012\n - OpenCities App Challenge 2012\n - The Finnish Information Processing Association: Best Product 2012\n\nPlease note: To use BlindSquare, your iCloud account has to be active so BlindSquare can access it to save your settings and places.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

AyeTides displays tides and/or currents for over 12,500 locations worldwide and unlike many other tide apps, it does not require a network connection. With AyeTides you will never see those annoying ads or be asked to pay for additional features! Sailors, harbor pilots, beachcombers, nature photographers, and more use AyeTides to plan their outings on or around the world's oceans. \n\nHere are some of the things people are saying about AyeTides... \n\n\"AyeTides is a quality professional product”\n\n\"Your support has been the best I have experienced!\"\n\n“As a harbor pilot in New York I’ve been using your excellent tide and current app”\n\n\"I really appreciate the effort that you put into making AyeTides as accurate as it can be. It is a great program that has been very useful to us. I think we have 60 pilots using iPhones and iNavX and your app links in so well.\"\n\n\"I am a ships Pilot in BC and use Aye Tides a lot and it has become invaluable.”\n\nYou can see the day’s events in tabular form, or you can rotate the phone for an interactive graph that shows you the tide’s value at any point during the day. You can find a station on a map, by name, or based on your current location.\n\nAyeTides is updated regularly and stations are added whenever we find new data. We encourage our customers to contact us if you hare having any issues with the program so that we can help you. \n\nThis app is designed to run on your iPhone or iPod Touch. While it will run on your iPad, it does not offer the additional features available with AyeTides XL, which was designed specifically for the iPad. If you have multiple devices, you may want to consider our bundle. You get both apps at a discount!\n\nThis is the only place to install AyeTides. Other websites may look like they have AyeTides, but they do not. We only support iOS, any other version of AyeTides is not ours."

The App is user friendly and has jog dials that can be moved around smoothly to set the direction. The results are depicted in a fraction of a second saving time, and instead of opening a book to get the corresponding Beaufort force, sea states, compass points or wave heights – This App saves you all that trouble.\n\nThe inputs are:\nShip’s speed in nautical miles per hour (knots) or meters/sec (m/s).\nShip’s direction from zero to 360 degrees on compass.\nRelative wind direction as displayed on a standard shipboard anemometer from zero to 180 degrees port or starboard (stbd).\nRelative wind speed in nautical miles per hour (knots) or meters/sec (m/s).\n\n The following results are displayed after pressing the calculate button:\nTrue wind speed in nautical miles per hour (knots) or meters/sec (m/s).\nTrue wind direction from zero to 360 degrees on compass.\nTrue wind direction in terms of compass points\nCorresponding Beaufort force and description\nCorresponding Sea state description and code\nProbable wave height for the corresponding true wind speed.\nA photograph of what the sea state may look like.\n\nDeveloper: Captain Darren D’Souza – Master Mariner"

Compass : Use just like a real compass.\n   A compass is a navigational instrument that shows directions in a frame of reference that is stationary relative to the surface of the Earth. The frame of reference defines the four cardinal directions (or points) – north, south, east, and west.\n\n3. Water level : A colorful minimalistic bubble level tool bull's eye level or just level tool. \n    Hold device flat relative to the ground to use as a 360-degree bubble level tool, or hold device vertical to the ground to use as a horizon bubble level tool. \n\n4. Theodolite : Used mainly for surveying and have been adapted for specialized purposes in fields like meteorology and rocket launch technology.\nThat combines viewfinder, clinometer, compass, GPS and map. \n\n5.

      "label": "Dive Log is designed to work either as your primary SCUBA diving logbook application or in conjunction with compatible 3rd party desktop logbook applications. You can use Dive Log at the dive site or on the dive boat to capture the information about the site while it is fresh in your mind (or your dive guide's mind). You can even capture the GPS coordinates of the dive site using the built in location services of your iOS device. Details about your actual dive can be added immediately after your dive or at the après dive event and later be saved to your desktop computer. The dive buddy feature is fully integrated with Contacts on your iPhone or iPad, letting you capture information about your newest dive buddy or quickly add an existing buddy to a particular dive. The dive data and statistics features let you have an immediate answer the next time your dive guide asks how much weight you used on your last dive or have all the information you need about your dive history when you fill out that next dive waiver.  Metric and Imperial values are supported for all appropriate logbook fields. You can easily enter values using the appropriate units for the situation and view them in your preferred measurement system. You can even explore detailed dive profiles from popular dive computers that you download with your desktop software and later upload to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad. Dive profile data can also be transferred directly from certain dive computers directly via Bluetooth or using a supported Bluetooth accessory and an associated in-app purchase.  \n\nOn Windows, Diving Log 6.0 (www.divinglog.de) is fully integrated with Dive Log on iPhone/iPad and has built in synchronization. Diving Log 6.0 has extensive support for importing data from dive computers and other dive log applications. \n\nOn Mac OS X, logbook information can be imported to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad from a number of compatible applications using the free Dive Log Manager application available from More Mobile Software (www.moremobilesoftware.com/divelog-sync). Dive Log DT (available on the Mac App Store) can be used to directly import a number of dive computers and file formats and can synchronize with Dive Log on iOS.\n\nDive data can be directly downloaded on a Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch from Bluetooth LE capable dive computers such as the Suunto EON Steel, Suunto EON Core, Suunto D5, Scubapro Galileo 2 (G2), Aladin Sport (Matrix), Aladin H (Matrix), G2 HUD, Aladin A1, Shearwater Teric, Peregrine, Petrel 2, Perdix, Perdix AI, NERD 2, Oceanic VTX, Pro Plus 4, Geo 4.0, VEO 4.0, Aeris A300CS, Aqualung i300C, i550C, i750TC, i770R, Sherwood Wisdom 4, Mares Genius and certain heinrichs weikamp OSTC computers as well as the DiveNav Inc. bluebuddy and Tech Buddy dive logger accessories. Supported Bluetooth LE accessories are available separately.\n\nMares Bluelink Pro is a Bluetooth LE accessory by Mares and available for purchase separately (www.mares.com). The Bluelink Pro allows you transfer dive data from certain Mares dive computers (Puck Pro, Smart, Smart Air, Quad and Quad Air) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nDive Computer Buddy (aka DCbuddy) is a Bluetooth LE accessory by DiveNav Inc. (note that the DCbuddy itself is no longer available). The DCbuddy allows you transfer dive data from certain dive computers (including models from Suunto, Oceanic, Aqualung, Aeris, Sherwood, Tusa and Mares) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch."

Perhaps bored and passing time, or just stuck at home in silence.\nIt's been far too long since you last hit the court and worked up a good old sweat, am I right?\n\nYou'd go through the old familiar motions, as if on auto-pilot.\nLoading up that shot, arms tensing, and then a flick of the wrists:\nSwish. No basketball to play with, but your motions are on point!\n\nThe good old days flew by faster than you can shout 'travel!'.\nThat's youth for you. It came, now it's went.\nOr so you thought...\nYet now, that imaginary basketball's back in virtual form. He shoots! He scores!\nNothing beats that sound, that classic, weirdly satisfying\nSWISH!\nSo now you're up on your feet again, heart racing.\nYou're alone no longer! That's right! We get you, man!\nWe made AirShot: a game just for you!\n\nThere's the effortless motion recognition. The pinpoint spatial audio simulation.\nAnd it all comes together to recreate that satisfying swish.\n\nOnce a baller, always a baller.\nNo matter how tough life gets, you can always AirShot that stress away!\n\nHere's to each and every MVP out there, on the court or elsewhere!\n——————————————\n[How to Play]\nWear your watch according to the instructions shown to have it recognize your throwing motions, and you'll hear that old familiar swish. Nothin' but net!\n\n1. There's a chance you'll hear a clang as you hit the rim, missing the shot. There's a whole bunch of hidden secrets...\n2. On top of shooting hoops SFX, there's actual shooting SFX, whip noises, and more... We're adding heaps of new sounds with each update, and more gameplay for you to enjoy too."

By freedivers, for freedivers, our freedive apnea trainer helps you with static apnea tables and lung capacity training so you can effectively increase the time when diving underwater.\r\nSee why STAmina Apnea Trainer is one of the best apnea apps to improve the breath-holding time for freediving, scuba diving and spearfishing, as well as surfing, running, and other water sports with 6 different apnea tables types.\n\n\r\n■ FREEDIVING & SPEARFISHING APNEA TRAINER FEATURES:\n\n\r\n◉ 6 APNEA TABLE OPTIONS \r\nSTAmina Apnea Trainer can create / generate custom apnea (exercises that are automatically created based on the maximum breath-hold and match the user’s level) or let you select from the following customizable table types:\r\n\r\n- O2 deprivation table – accustoms a body to lower oxygen levels. This is achieved by increasing the amount of time that you hold your breath on each attempt, while the resting time is fixed.\r\n\r\n- CO2 Tolerance table – helps a body to adapt to high carbon dioxide levels. This is achieved by decreasing the length of resting time between fixed breath-hold periods.\r\n\r\n- Wonka table – a variation of CO2 tables. Apnea timer starts after the first contraction, the rest time takes one breath.\r\n\r\n- Mix table – tables where apnea time increases and rest time decreases with each round.\r\n\r\n- Custom table – allows mixing of different approaches to create a custom training, thus generating the most effective training program.\r\n\r\n- Pranayama – a breathing technique to decrease stress in the body and relax the nervous system.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ APPLE HEALTH SYNCRONIZATION \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED TRAINING WITH VARYING DIFFICULTY\r\nWhen you start working with the application, you set your personal record in breath holding. Based on this data, the app will offer a personalized training program with exercises of 3 difficulty levels to choose from: easy, normal, and hard.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED EXERCISE SETTINGS \r\nEach exercise can be edited by setting your own number of repetitions, breath hold time, rest time, etc.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ TRAINING REMINDERS \r\nGet the notification to start your apnea training. Set a reminder in the apnea diver app for the day and the time & get a notification to do a breath holding training session.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONAL STATISTICS AND DETAILED TRAINING HISTORY\r\nAll your workouts and exercises are recorded in the freedive trainer app to track the detailed progress of each training.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ VOICE GUIDANCE\r\nTraining may be accompanied by voice guidance with male/female voices recorded by professional voice actors. STAmina supports English, French, Russian voice guidance.\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n◉ HEART RATE AND OXYGEN SATURATION TRACKING\r\nTrack your heart rate while doing breath holding exercises (a compatible HR monitor or pulse-oximeter is required) \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CONTRACTIONS TRACKING \r\nUse our freedive trainer to track unlimited contractions, analyse captured data after exercises\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CLOUD SYNC / BACKUP\r\nAccess your data on multiple devices and easily restore it in case you switch devices/phones.\n\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\nStamina Apnea Trainer allows training breath hold effectively for anyone who cares about all kinds of diving including:\r\n> beginner or professional freedivers;\r\nspearfishers;\r\n> scuba divers to learn how to dive longer on one tank;\r\n> surfers in case of unexpected breath hold;\r\n> underwater sports athletes such as underwater rugby, hockey, etc.\r\n> runners who want to train breath holding & high tolerance to CO2 while running\r\n\r\n_______\r\nInfo https://getstamina.app/\r\nContact https://www.facebook.com/staminamobile/\r\nSupport hello@squarecrowdapps.com"

Wouldn’t it be great to be able to dive deeply with one big breath and take incredible pictures for your friends at home? The Apnea Trainer makes it possible! By using it to train three times a week, you can quickly double your underwater time.\n\nThis is the same training principle used by apnea divers. It’s based on a yoga technique which strengthens the diaphragm muscles allowing you to fill your lungs with more oxygen and releasing more carbon dioxide while exhaling. The system is relatively simple and depends on finding the right time intervals which are provided by the program, thus letting you relax and concentrate on your breathing. This will guarantee maximum training success.\nThe program will also come in handy just before the actual dive since a pranayama mode is already included. The Apnea Trainer will help you keep your whole body calm and give you the perfect preparation for those amazing, long-lasting dives. \n\n\nFeatures:\n+ Training to improve free diving time\n\n+ Pranayama mode to calm your body before diving or snorkeling\n\n+ Custom time settings for pro divers\n\n+ Optical and Audio instructions\n\n+ Easy to use interface\n\nUpdated user interface with the help of Bjoern Maser by www.minimalist.ch."

      "label": "We wanted to create this app as intuitive as possible. We want you to be able to focus on your workout and not bother with counting or anything else.\r\nHow to:\r\nFirst: Set your Tempo.\r\nYou have four numbers/counts. They are always in the same order.\r\n1.\tEccentric/DOWN - you lowering the weight e.g. Squat from standing to the bottom.\r\n2.\tBottom/HOLD - you pausing at your lowest position.\r\n3.\tConcentric/UP - you standing up with the weight. \r\n4.\tTop/HOLD - you fully extended/standing with the weight.\r\n\r\nSecond: Set where you want to start the movement.\r\nIn a Squat or a Bench Press you start from a standing or extended position.\r\nTherefore your counts will start with the „DOWN\" command.\r\nIn a Deadlift or Pull up you have to lift the weight or pull yourself up first!\r\nTherefore your counts will start with the „UP\" command.\r\nThe starting phase number will be highlighted in green.\r\n\r\nThird: Set your Sets/Reps/Rest\r\nHere you will see the time under tension for each set and for the total workout.\r\nThat’s it! Easy peasy lemon squeezy!\r\n\r\nPro Tips: \r\n„SKIP“\r\nif you don’t manage to fulfill your reps in a set, just hit „SKIP“ and the set ist done. The „Rest Time“ you set before will automatically start after hitting „SKIP“. On the Pause screen you will see your actual set and reps.\r\n\nVarying Reps in a workout\r\nLet’s say you don’t want to do the classic 5 x 12 Reps. \r\nSomething more fancy like 7 - 11 - 15 - 11- 7 Reps.\r\nJust set your Reps to „15“ your highest rep number of the workout and then just „SKIP“ every set after you did your target reps.\r\n\nAcoustic and optic output:\r\nMute or don’t mute ;-)\r\nYou will hear the commands like this:\r\nDOWN and UP with up to three seconds will be seen or heard as DOWN-DOWN-DOWN or UP-UP-UP.\r\nFrom a four second count it will be like this:\r\nDONW - 2 - 3 - 4  or  UP - 2 - 3 - 4\r\nThe „HOLDs“ either BOTTOM or TOP will always be just seen or heard as „HOLD“ no matter how long you want to hold."

      "label": "Flyskyhy forms your flight instrument during flight and shows all information you need for that. You get the normal data like altitude, climb rate, ground speed, and glide angle. But it also calculates and shows the current wind direction and strength, very important for your safety.\n\nA moving and rotating map shows your current flying position and flight trail. It indicates where you have gone up (in a thermal), and where you have had faster than normal decline. With that, you can easily find back that thermal that you lost. The map also shows the nearest known landing spots, and whether they are reachable by normal glide, given your current altitude and wind direction.\n\nIntegration with Bluetooth varios SensBox, FlyNet, GoFly iPico, XC-Tracer, BlueFlyVario, or SkyDrop gives accurate altitude and lift information. That turns your iPhone into an full-fletched GPS-vario, including vario tones.\n\nThe app makes a full log of your flight, that can be analyzed afterwards. Besides normal data like start and landing positions, duration of flight, and an altitude graph of the flight, Flyskyhy also calculates the scoring distances for you. So you can immediately see whether you have broken that FAI triangle record.\n\nYour live location is reported on livetrack24.com or loctome.com if you desire, so anybody can follow your flight while it is happening. If you are flying together with friends, then their location is shown on your map during your flight. So you never have to wonder anymore whether they are in front of or behind you.\n\nThe flight display has multiple screens which are all fully configurable. You can move all elements to other spots, delete and add elements, and resize them.\n\nThrough in-app purchases, the app also supports airspaces and waypoints.\n\nThe app is optimised for paragliding and hang gliders, but can be used with all  kinds of airsports.\n\nMain features during the flight;\n• Altitude, climb rate, ground speed, air speed, direction, glide angle and many more\n• Wind strength and direction\n• Moving map of the flying area\n• Spots where you have had lift, great for thermal coring\n• Shows whether you can still reach a landing spot with the current altitude and wind\n• Live tracking of your flight on livetrack24.com or loctome.com\n• Shows live location of your friends during flight\n\nAfter the flight:\n• Full logbook of all your flights\n• Basic flight data like start/landing, duration, height difference, distance flown, and many more\n• Calculation of 5-points, open triangle, and FAI triangle distances\n• Graph of altitude and climb rate\n• Signed IGC and KML log files of flights\n• Transfer the log to iTunes or send by email\n• Upload the flight directly to XContest, ParaglidingForum, DHV-XC, and other Leonardo servers\n• Open flight in Google Earth on the iPhone\n• Replay the flight and relive it!\n\nBy purchasing the Waypoints Extension you get access to:\n• A fully zoomable and scrollable map with the waypoints and optimised route. The map also shows start and landing spots, as well as restricted airspaces (with the Airspace Extension)\n• Enter new waypoints, either on the map or by specifying the parameters\n• Full route support with start time, goal, entry/exit points, etc. \n• Many instruments to guide you along the route\n• Visible and audible indication when a waypoint has been reached\n• Complete waypoints organiser\n• Import and export of various waypoint file formats\n\nBy purchasing the Airspace Extension you get access to:\n• Airspaces of 30 countries\n• Display of airspaces on the map with configurable colors and formats\n• Display of your vertical position w.r.t. airspaces\n• Visible and audible warnings when approaching and entering an airspace\n• Shows local airspaces by touching a spot on the map\n\nNote: a live internet connection is required for live tracking of your and your friends locations\nNote: continuous GPS and screen usage makes the battery drain faster than normal"

Recreational dive planners are decompression tables in which non-stop time under water is calculated. The Dive Planner can be used to practice for your dive certification exams, and can be used as a general guide for planning dives, and logging your dives so you never forget what to enter into your paper log book. \n\nDive Plan works for diving with air (21% Oxygen) filled tanks, as well as enriched air (nitrox from 21% to 40% oxygen). Please note that when diving on an altitude, special considerations must be taken into account, and different dive tables should be used.\n\nDive computers use much more sophisticated algorithms for calculated non-decmpression limits, based on the whole dive, whereas the recreational dive tables are much more conservative and assume a square profile dive where the diver spends the entire dive at one depth."

Simple and straightforward to use, the app uses the sound generated by tapping the strings to calculate the tension with high accuracy. In addition, the interactive swingweight calculator aids in customizing your racquet to fit your own stroke pattern, while the stiffness calculator allows you to simulate different racquet configurations. \n\nRacquetTune not only makes it easier to decide when it is time to restring, it is also an invaluable tool when testing different racquets and strings and in identifying which of your racquets is best suited for different types of games. RacquetTune also allows you to check whether your stringer is consistent in his work. \nRacquetTune includes the following user-friendly tools:\n\nTension measurement \n- Quickly determines the tension and stringbed stiffness. \n- Able to detect changes in tension as small as 0.1 kg/0.2 lb.\n- An accuracy indicator ensures results are consistent. \n- Graphical presentation of sound waves helps you find the ideal way of tapping the strings. \n- Settings can be customized to serve tennis, squash, racquetball and badminton racquets, respectively. \n- View the tension history for each racquet as a list or a graph.\n- Email a spreadsheet with test data.\n\nSwingweight calculator \n- Add as many weights as you wish to the frame. \n- Move and change weights to visualize how swingweight, balance and sweet spot location are affected.\n- Enter target values for the racquet and let RacquetTune distribute the weights automatically.\n\nStiffness calculator \n- Simulate various racquet and string configurations\n- Vary tension, string type and racquet head size. \n- Shows load-displacement curves, stiffness and elastic energies \n- Handles the large deformations encountered in actual play \n\nView a demo video at racquettune.com\n\nRacquetTune has been featured in tennis magazines in USA, Italy, France, Germany, Sweden and Norway. \n\n\"The app is very, very impressive. I get more tension diagnostic questions than just about anybody in the universe, so this is a very good thing to be able to recommend.\" \nJonathan Wolfe \nUS Racquet Stringers Association\n\nNote, that the actual string tension in the racquet and the setting seen on a stringing machine are two different things and therefore incomparable - more information can be found at racquettune.com."

It automatically calculates your pressure groups and can even find your minimum surface interval. It’s quick and simple and super easy to use. \n\nTo calculate your pressure groups just enter your depth (feet or meters) and time (min) for your first dive. Then enter your surface interval between dives in minutes. After that enter your second dive depth and time the same way, and the program will calculate your final PG, ABT, RNT, TBT and new no decompression limit. \n\nTo calculate your minimum surface interval between dives enter the depth and time of your first dive. Then enter the depth and time of your second dive. The program will now find your minimum surface interval and then calculate your final PG, ABT, RNT, TBT and new no decompression limit. \n\nThis program uses only the standard PADI dive tables. It can NOT calculate reverse profile dives. Reverse profile dives are when the second dive is deeper than the first. Unless you absolutely know what you are doing always dive shallower than the last dive. \n\nDisclaimer: This application is not a replacement for diving tables, dive computers, or experience. Please do not rely on Ez Dive Planner as your sole dive planner and make sure to double check all information before diving.

      "label": "THE AIKIDO GUIDE is a powerful tool that fully utilizes app technology to give a unique learning experience. The Guide is built up in an eclectic way, inspired by different teachers and schools. Access to different levels of information will provide challenges and inspiration to beginners as well as teachers. The Aikido Guide contains: \n• Techniques applied from 12 different attacks\n• 19 in-depth explanations of core techniques\n• 4 modes: Basic, advanced and two flowing modes \n• 344 videos of different combinations of attack, technique and mode \n• 568 different applications including Omote and Ura. Each application is shown from two or three angles \n• 14 videos explaining important Taisabaki – Way of entering, linked to each attack-technique combination \n• 18 videos with basic movements for individual practice\n• 4 videos with explanation of important principles of Aikido, such as the Triangle, the Circle and the Square\n• 3 video interviews \n\nUPGRADING OF THE VIDEOS: In June 2014, 38 videos were retaken and published. Among these were the explanations of the four modes, as well as the in-depth explanation of Kotegaeshi and several of the flowing techniques from Yokomen uchi and Shomen uchi. In this way the Aikido Guide is improved without the need of making new versions of the application itself.\n\nBJORN EIRIK OLSEN received his 6th Dan in 2004 and was promoted to Shihan by Aikikai Hombu Dojo in January 2012. He has been living in Japan for many years were he practiced intensively with teachers such as Morito Suganuma Sensei, Minoru Inaba Sensei and late Morihiro Saito Sensei – in addition to late Doshu Kishomaru Ueshiba, the present Doshu Moriteru Ueshiba and several of the old students of Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido. Presently he is the Chief instructor of the Norwegian Aikido Federation, and he has also been teaching in, among others, England, Greece and Vietnam. \n\nFor the best experience, this application requires WIFI.\n\nIMPORTANT: Audio/Video descriptions are in English only.\n\nREVIEWS: The Aikido Guide App has received very good reviews and scores from its users in 70 different countries, but they may not be visible on Apple Store in your country. Some examples:   \n\n\"Eine tolle App, führ mich momentan die beste Aikido-App. Sehr striukturiert und vor allem sehr viele Angriffs-Technik-Kombinationen. Zumindest führ einen Anfänger wie mich extrem hilfreich, da die Techniken detailliert gezeight und auch erklärt werden.\"\nBy x10001 from Switzerland about Aikido Guide (version 1.5, Apple App Store) on Nov 21, 2013.\n\n\"It's perfect for a beginner like me and i believe it will be very useful to the seasoned practitioners. It has clear explanation and clear illustration of each technique. Having it is just like having an Aikido instructor with you anytime you want. Thanks!\"\nBy likuankoh from Singapore about AikidoGuide (version 1.3, Apple App Store) on Dec 30, 2012.\n\n“Each technique from basic to advanced in 4 different steps of difficulty as a HQ-movie with comments and descriptions. I've never seen such a great guide before!\"\nBy takethetick from Germany about AikidoGuide (version 1.2, Apple App Store) on Jul 20, 2012.\n\n\"Sensei in your pocket - I have tried other aikido apps and they don't come close to the quality, content, and presentation of this one. Arigato gozaimashita.\"\nBy Chris in Virginia from United States about AikidoGuide (version 1.2, Apple App Store) on Jun 15, 2012.\n\n\"This is the first useful aikido guide I've seen. It is comprehensive and clear. A great guide to all basic techniques with the advanced versions just a click away. I wish I had this tool when I took my kyu-grades.\"\nBy Feerth from Norway about AikidoGuide (version 1.0, Apple App Store) on May 11, 2012.\n\nFor more information on reviews, please see http://www.aikidoguide.no/reviews.html.\n\n\nAIKIDO is a Japanese Martial Art that aims at solving situations in a harmonious way by understanding and expressing universal laws of body, mind and spirit."

Prolonged writing to a flash drive shortness its life span.\n\n+ PRIVACY\nThe app does not in any way collect or send private data or require login. The app is self contained working on your device without any need to contact other services or use internet connection.\n\n\n\nWHAT CRITICS SAY (WITH VIDEO):\n\n[Professional physical education teacher Jarrod Robinson]\n\n“Over the years, I’ve spoken to thousands of PhysEd teachers about the app BaM Video Delay. It’s a complete game-changer that takes what used to be possible with expensive and complicated systems and makes it a reality for everyone”\n\nhttps://thepegeek.com/2016/03/raising-bar-bam-video-delay/\n\n\n[australiancurriculumtfel.edublogs.org]\n\n“The app has great potential to be used on a regular basis in physical education classes as a formative assessment tool.”\n\nhttp://australiancurriculumtfel.edublogs.org/2015/11/11/formative-assessment-using-bam-video-delay-app-in-pe/\n\n\n\nUSER REVIEWS:\n\nBy Kbone2000\n5/5 Great app!\nEvery coach needs this app. Immediate feedback for players and a great way for self analysis.\n\nBy James McDermott\n5/5 Great app!\nWorks for what I need, nice that you can have a delay rather than asking someone to record each time.\n\nBy awholelottatry\n5/5 A great technical training tool for sport and fitness\nThis is exactly what I was looking for! Needed it to perfect technique in Crossfit Olympic lifting. Every technical sport could use this valuable tool.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nEver wanted to learn a new move? \nBe it for professional dancing, gymnastics, golf, basketball, tennis, martial arts, breakdance, strike a pose or other use.\n\nA mirror is nice but it's hard to move and look the same time, sometimes even impossible when not facing forward. \n\nA video camera is OK but it is a hassle with all the start, stop, rewind, positioning and other.\n \nSo in the end you don't use either, give up on learning something new and move on with your life.\n\n\n\"Bust a Move Video Delay\" solves these problems.\nIt gives you an easy to use tool with quick feedback. You see what you just did, so you can correct it, try again, look again, correct ... and so on.\n\nAlso, after the initial setup, no interaction is needed so you can focus on training without any distractions.  \n\n\n\nSO WHAT DOES A “VIDEO DELAY” DO ?\n\nIt continuously shows you what just happened seconds ago. There is no alternating record or play phase, just continuous playback but with a given delay.

Determining the solunar period is therefore useful for activities such as birdwatching, fishing or hunting. There are two major and two minor solunar periods each day. The time at which each solunar occurs varies depending on the date and on your geographical location.\n\nThe app helps you to determine the solunar period and expected animal activity index (where 6-point is when animals are most active). It also tells you the exact sunrise, sunset, sun transit, moon rise, moon set, and moon transit times, alone with moon phase. The app can utilize your iPhone's build-in GPS to obtain your geographical location. In case you are using iTouch or without GPS signal, the app also accepts user input of longitude and latitude. \n\n\nFEATURES:\n.Locations: GPS or Manual Entry\n.Major & Minor Periods\n.Activity Index\n.Moonrise / Moonset Times\n.Moon Phase Data\n.Sunrise / Sunset Times\n.Sun Transit\n.Moon Transit\n.Day / Week View\n.Any Date\n.Any Location - Worldwide\n\nNo network is needed.

      "label": "****Designed by sport scientists, trusted by elite athletes****\n****Validated in the prestigious Journal of Sports Sciences****\n\nWhat is your maximal strength? Which weight should you use in your next training session to optimize results? My Lift is the first scientifically designed app to measure your 1-Repetition Maximum (1-RM) in the most accurate way possible. \n\nKnowing your 1-RM in every single training session is essential to adjust your training intensity and get the best adaptations. However, performing an actual 1-RM test could be dangerous and fatiguing and, if performed every day, it will most likely lead to overtraining or injuries. \n\nTo solve this problem, My Lift uses scientifically validated algorithms that can estimate your 1-RM with high precision by simply recording your exercise. To do this, My Lift uses the high-speed video recording available on most iPhone and iPad devices to measure the velocity at which you are performing the exercise, which is highly correlated with your maximal strength capabilities. This novel approach is used by sport scientists and top-level coaches thanks to advanced instrumental like linear transducers or force platforms, but now you can measure your 1-RM like a pro just with your iPhone or iPad!\n\nMy Lift is very intuitive and easy to use: you just need to record one repetition of the desired exercise with 1 to 4 different submaximal loads and select its start and beginning in the app with its accurate frame-by-frame navigation. After that, My Lift will show you your 1-RM! \n\nLet's say you got a workout which includes 4x5 repetitions at your 80%1-RM. Well, you just need to pick a load and record one repetition with My Lift. It will tell if that load really corresponds to your 80% or not, so you can increase or decrease the weight to train in the right zone!\n\nMy Lift has a lot of great features that will help you measure your 1-RM in a very simple, yet powerful way:\n\n-Estimates your 1-Repetition Maximum (1-RM) in a very simple way by measuring your movement velocity, a novel approach used by top sport scientists and elite coaches\n-Measures what %1-RM corresponds to a specific load so you can adjust your training and get the best results\n-Calculate your movement velocity to monitor your performance!\n-Analysis of velocity loss to monitor fatigue.\n-Track the trajectory of your lift and measure instantaneous position and velocity\n-Works with some of the most widely-used upper and lower body exercises by default: bench-press, deadlift, pull-up, military press, back squat & hip thrust. You can even create your own exercises!\n-Multi-team and multi-user: create as many teams and users as you want\n-Progress analysis: save as many tests as you want and see your progress through time to check if you have improved or worsened your performance. You can even see the percent of change from one test to another!\n-Data export: export your whole database to a csv file and play with your data in Excel!\n-iCloud sync (iOS 13+)\n-Universal app: purchase once and install it on your iPhone, iPad and Mac (10.15+)\n\nMy Lift, train smarter and get the best results!"

Nevertheless, the application can run without GPS and internet connection, in this case, the user has to give the weather data.\n\nThe application is made up of four tabs that are described next:\n- Results: in this tab, the recommended main jet, needle position, air density and spark plug type values are shown. This data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine configuration given in the next tabs. In addition, this tab lets to make a fine tuning adjustment to adapt to a concrete engine.\n- Weather: you can set the values for current temperature, altitude, pressure and humidity. The values of this screen can be manually set or can be loaded by the application reading the data from the nearest public weather station (from the GPS tab).\n- Engine: you can set in this screen the information about your engine, carburator and track, that is, the engine type (Micromax, Minimax, Senior, Supermax, Junior or DD2), the model year of the engine, the spark plug brand used, the needle type, the float/pilot jet combo, the floats height, venturi, oil mix ratio, airbox type (new or old model) and the track type.\n- GPS: this tab allows to use the GPS to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity).\n\nThe application works with different measure units: inHg, mb, mmHg, hPa, atm for pressure, ºC and ºF for temperature.\n\nThe app is NOT VALID for Rotax Max engines before 2015. For these engines, you should install Jetting Max Kart."

      "label": "Designed by sports scientists and coaches. Scientifically validated (publication in review in a high-impact journal). \nThe only app that accurately calculates the complete power-force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino et al.´s method (published in 2015). \n\nMy Sprint is the first app scientifically developed to measure the individual sprint mechanical outputs (force, velocity, power, effectiveness) of athletes. Innovative design, validated by sports scientists, My Sprint is as reliable as a 4000$ radar plus PC system. Scientifically approved!\n\nSprint running, power output and forward acceleration are a key combination of performance in many sports activities. Determining individual Force–Velocity profile, maximal power and mechanical effectiveness during sprint propulsion is of great interest for coaches, sport practitioners, or physiotherapists. What makes you fast?\n\nTheir opinion about My Sprint:\n\n- Dr. Samozino: “One of our main interests is to make accessible to sport practitioners the scientific evaluations we do in our labs with very specific devices. The simple method on which My Sprint is based was developed in this sense to test the sprint mechanical capabilities in field condition. The results of the validation of the method in comparison to force plate measurements were better than those we expected! And the validity of the data obtained with My Sprint is in the same extent… but with an impressive simplicity!”  \n\n- Pr. Morin: “When we developed our 2015 simple method, we found it was a great achievement to measure sprint acceleration mechanics with a very high concurrent validity compared to the gold standard force plate measurements. My Sprint takes things to another level, since it allows accurate measurements with just an iPhone!”\n\nMy Sprint calculates Power-Force-Velocity profile and measures the individual sprint mechanical outputs (force, velocity, power, effectiveness) of athletes using the camera on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. It was specially designed to take advantage of the extraordinary 120-240fps camera of the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s. You just need to perform an all-out 40 m sprint and mark the track with a reference system marks located at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 meters and you only need six visible vertical markers (like thin poles) at these markers to record the time between markers. After that My Sprint does the computations and calculates athlete´s mechanical capabilities.  \n\nFEATURES: \n\n- Accurate measurement of the split times over a sprint acceleration. Scientifically validated!\n- Calculation the Power-Force-Velocity profile using the innovative Samozino et al.´s method. You can therefore know the athlete’s mechanical capabilities that determine the entire sprint acceleration performance. These properties are integrative and encompass all the mechanisms involved in the total external force produced during each lower limb extension and the ability to orient it effectively onto the ground. \n- Record amazing slow motion videos up to 240fps (iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s) and analyse in a frame-by-frame mode as well as import videos from your camera roll. \n- Multi-user. You can create as many users as your need with My Sprint. You can assign each user to a team for a higher ease of use. \n- Performance follow-up. You can record as many sprints as you want for each user created and analyze performance through a competitive season. \n\nNote: My Sprint was scientifically validated using an iPhone 6, and it uses the slow motion video recording on the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s. On other devices, the measurements are less accurate slow motion video recording feature is not available. \n\nA SPRINT ACCELERATION MECHANICS LAB IN YOUR POCKET!"

It doesn’t require any connection to your car. Results are provided as detailed reports featuring interactive charts.\n\nHow does PerfExpert dyno works ? It's simple :\n1. Create your car profile => Describe your car to PerfExpert by providing information such as curb weight, tire sizes or engine displacement. If you don't know how to find your car's specifications, we help you to do so.\n2. Mount your phone in your car => No need to connect your phone to your car. With your phone firmly mounted inside your car, PerfExpert can rely on its internal sensors to measure the real acceleration of your car.\n3. Accelerate through the entire engine rev range => On a flat, straight and horizontal road, perform an acceleration from low rev to the maximum rev, keeping the same gear : that's it!\n\nIMPORTANT : dyno test is not compatible with automatic gearboxes that doesn't have a manual mode.\n\nWith such a tool, you can check the efficiency of your various tunings, ECU mapping, chiptuning, and even your chassis settings.\n\nUsing the specification of the tested car and your device’s accelerometer, the application runs our algorithms and dynamic power loss calculations to provide the performances of your car with high accuracy.\n\nSkeptical? Here is a selection of comparison tests between “PerfExpert - Car Onboard Dyno” and real chassis dynos, performed by some of our users : http://bit.ly/perfexpert_vs_chassis_dyno\n\nFor further information, you can find our FAQ at https://www.perfexpert-app.com/faq\n\nHere are sample dyno and timed run reports created using the application :\nhttps://network.perfexpert-app.com/results/featured\n\nJoin now the growing PerfExpert community:\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/PerfExpert\n- Support : https://www.facebook.com/groups/perfexpert/\n\nFeatures:\n- Dyno test : measure the power and torque of your engine with advanced loss calculation model. Detection of the engine rev limiter. Detailed reports featuring interactive charts of wheel and engine horsepower and torque / engine speed, just like a regular chassis dynamometer.\n\n- Compute corrected power and torque using the correction norm of your choice (atmospheric pressure, ambient temperature and air humidity are taken into account). Available standards: DIN (Europe), SAE (America), JIS (Japan), CEE (Europe) and ISO (International).\n\n- Timed Run test to measure your 0-60mph, 0-60ft, 0-1/8mi, 0-1/4mi, 0-100km/h, 0-20m, 0-200m, 0-400m,  and much more.\n\n- Use of your phone accelerometer at its maximum frequency and advanced signal processing for smoothed curves.\n\n- Custom choice of units from a large choice: Hp, Ch, Cv, Kw, Nm, Ft.Lb, mKg, Mph, Km/h, m, ft, G, m/s², psi, inHg, mBar, °C, °F\n\n- Export reports in Tab Separated Value format and PNG"

      "label": "Golf GPS is a simple app.  It tells distance to bunkers, water hazards, and pins.  Many similar apps requires subscription (hopefully no additional cost) , or you need to build your own map ahead of time.  While struggling with my terrible iron shot, I got an idea.  When you play golf, you see red, white, blue yardage represents 100, 150 and 200 yards respectively from the pin.  The idea was why don’t I reverse it on my iPhone screen.\n\nIt draws a map around you, and put blue pin where you are.  And draw red, white, blue circle around you.  Since I can add circle easily, I add three more: 50, 250 & 300 yard.  For those who are familiar with meter, I add an option for you.\n\nThose circle should be enough for most player while the app allows you to drop yardage wherever you want.  Drop and drag it to a point you want, and it will tell exact distance from your location.  Those yardages will be stored internally and will be displayed again until you delete it.\n\n\n*** You need internet connection to use this app ***\n\nFeatures\n\n- It works any courses as long as you have internet connection \n- Distance circles around your current location: 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 \n- Support both yard and meter \n- 10-yard(meter) circles when you zoom in \n- Drop yardages wherever you want to know exact distance \n- Relocate yardages by drag & drop \n- App saves yardages for later play \n- Compass view (rotate map) to match the direction you are facing; easy to find green \n- Yardages in 3 different sizes \n- Support background mode for quick restart \n- More yardage circles when zoom closely for accuracy \n- Drop a marker (shot from)  where you hit and calculate distance from it\n- Purchase option to remove ads and enable Marker History View, which allows you to review your mark (short from) history after a game"

Has everything you need for your round of golf.”\n▸ GOLFERS ONLY wrote: “Does all the tedious calculations for you, so that your round is even more fun.”\n▸ GOLF & COUNTRY wrote: “The no. 1 iPhone app for golfers.”\n▸ EXTRA GOLF wrote: “This app provides you with everything you need.”\n\nWith the “Expert Golf” score card, you can record the scores for up to four players and archive these score cards. The app also calculates your Stableford points fully-automatically. This is facilitated by a vast database containing the score card information and the ratings of the golf courses (unlike other apps with which the users have to create the score cards themselves). \nThe database is updated and extended daily. An overview of the current list of courses can be found at courses.expertgolf.com. \n\nWhy Expert Golf is better\n▸ User-friendly and intuitive operation (a manual is superfluous).\n▸ The first score card in the world that can be signed on the touchscreen.\n▸ More precise data thanks to professional mapping.\n▸ Database updated daily.\n▸ Support 365 days a year.\n▸ No advertising pop-ups at all.\n▸ Excellent customer ratings and top rankings in the App Store.\n▸ Leading app for many years and improved with regular updates.\n\nIncluding updates for one year. (Note: Expert Golf is NOT a subscription. The annual fee will not automatically be charged again after the year has ended. You can continue to use the app without renewing the service, you will just no longer be able to download any new courses from the database.)\n\nFAQ – Why Expert Golf charges an annual fee\nEach year approximately 15% of golf courses are redesigned or newly built or the order of their holes is changed etc. This means that the database has to be constantly maintained and updated. Only with an annual fee concept will you be guaranteed access to up-to-date and comprehensive data that you can trust on a long-term basis. Providers that only charge a once-only payment for their app will sooner or later stop maintaining their data.\n\nExpert Golf is the only app that puts everything a player needs on a round of golf onto the iPhone. It comprises a total of four modules including “iGolfrules” – one of the world’s most popular sport apps that has been in the App Store top ten continually for many years and is officially recommended by Apple. You can add the following additional modules to your app (charges apply)\n▸ GPS caddie \n▸ Golf rules\n▸ Golf tips\n\nIf you are happy with our app we would be grateful if you would take a moment of your time to post a rating/ write a review in the App Store.\nIf, for whatever reason, you are not happy with the app or have any questions about it please contact our support team at support@expertgolf.com."

Calculations are provided for the best Trimix given a planned depth and a desired maximum partial pressure of oxygen and equivalent narcotic depth (END). You can also calculate the ceiling and maximum depths along with your END based on your planned mix. The dive planning tools support both salt water and fresh water calculations. The blending tools provide for filling a cylinder with a remaining mix (or empty) to a specified target mix using oxygen, helium and a topping mix (air or another available mix). You can also calculate the result of topping an existing partially filled cylinder with a specific topping mix (air or another available mix). There is also a Bleed Down calculator that allows you adjust an existing full or partially full cylinder to a new mix with minimal wasted gas. Trimix Tools supports calculations in both metric and Imperial/US systems of measure.\n\nTraveling on a boat or working out of network range? These tools are at hand any time you have your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. You could, for example, easily calculate the result of topping your cylinder from your first dive with air from the boat's compressor to take advantage of any remaining mix. You also have the convenience of saved settings that you can recall at a touch and adjust to a new situation as needed.\n\nChances are you regularly work with a specific set of mixes and common dive situations. Trimix Tools includes the convenience of saved settings that you can recall and adjust to a new situation as needed. You can also select mix values using pre-installed default mixes or your own saved custom mixes. When updating one of the mixes for a tool you are offered a list of saved mixes that you can use directly or adjust as needed. You can save the currently displayed mix by tapping on the \"+\" button. Just like with the saved calculations, you can re-arrange or delete any mixes in your saved list.\n\nDo you need to share your planning or blending calculations with other divers? All the tools have the ability to share the results of the calculations from within the application. You can set default email addresses and a subject Trimix Tool's settings that will be automatically added when you share a result.\n\nAll END calculations (Dive Planning and Best Trimix tabs) in Trimix Tools treat oxygen as a narcotic gas by default. There is an option available under the Settings tab to change the default so that oxygen is not treated as narcotic if that is your preference. Remember you must always personally analyze your mix before diving it.\n\nThis application is not a substitute for proper training and should not be used as a substitute for proper dive planning or the primary Trimix blending and planning methods taught during training. Please do not attempt to handle high pressure oxygen or fill SCUBA cylinders without proper training."

On the settings screen you can adjust the following:\n\nDifficulty - speed of the punches\nModel - who you fight against\nRing - put yourself in a virtual ring\nBackground Crowd - to cheer you on during the fight\nSurvival mode - enable a health bar above the fighters head. This goes down over time and when the fighter runs out of health you win.\nSurvival time - if survival mode on, how long will it last.\n\nAt the end of the fight see how many times you were hit and how many hits you dodged.\n\nThere is also a help screen to guide you through the settings in the app should you get stuck.\n\nAny universal phone VR headset is ok for running the app, just make sure it does not cover the front facing camera when in the headset. This is because the front camera is what is used for ARKit else you will get a black screen. It will still be usable, but you will not be able to see where you are going!"

      "label": "***Validation published on the Journal of Applied Biomechanics***\n\nWe know you love running, but do you know how do you run?\n\nDesigned by sport scientists & coaches of elite runners, Runmatic is the first scientifically designed app that analyzes your running and sprinting technique to help you to improve your performance and prevent injuries.\n\nRunmatic takes advance of the slowmotion recording capabilities of your iOS devices to accurately analyze your running and sprinting technique. Using scientifically validation equations, Runmatic calculates the contact-flight times, force, efficiency, frequency and even the asymmetry of your legs in a simple, accurate way. Runmatic can also analyze your stride informing about relevant variables such as pronation, pelvic drop or strike pattern, which could help you prevent injuries. \n\nRunmatic is an extraordinary tool for sprint analysis as well. It can measure total time, splits and contact/flight times with a precision comparable to professional timing gates. Moreover, it can create Kinograms (following the methodology by ALTIS) to analyze the quality of motion of each phase of the sprint. You can even calculate the most relevant angles of your body!\n\n\n****Pr. Jean-Benoit Morin, PhD, Expert in running biomechanics: \"This is a very useful app to evaluate and monitor the mechanics of the runners' strides. It's accurate, it's scientifically validated and it uses equations derived from our research (Morin et al., 2005). The tools often used to perform this kind of analyses are much more expensive and generally less practical for the general population. Runmatic solves this problem and allows runners to analyze and monitor their running mechanics in an easy way\"\n\n****Arturo Casado, Olympic runner, 2010 European 1500m Champion: \"Runmatic is very helpful for my training. It let me better understand how do I run, which is critical to improve my running economy and, therefore, my performance. Is like a lab in my pocket!\"\n\nRunmatic has a lot of great features that will help you monitor your running and sprinting performance in a very simple, yet powerful way:\n\n-Calculate contact time, flight time, frequency, max force, displacement of the center of mass and leg stiffness with scientific accuracy\n-Analyze your stride to calculate your pelvic drop, pronation and strike patter, which could help you prevent injuries.\n-Measure total time, splits and contact and flight times of your sprints.\n-Analyze the quality of the sprint by creating Kinograms (ALTIS methodology).\n-Multi-user: create as many users as you want\n-iCloud sync (iOS13 only)\n-Progress analysis: save as many runs as you want and see your progress through time to check if you have improved or worsened your performance. You can even see the percent of change from one test to another!\n-Data export: export your whole database to a csv file and play with your data in Excel!\n-Universal app: purchase once and install it on your iPhone, iPad or Mac (10.15+)\n\n\nRunmatic, analyze your running/sprinting mechanics and improve your performance!"

Nevertheless, the application can run without GPS and internet connection, in this case, the user has to give the weather data.\n\nThe application is made up of four tabs that are described next.\n\n- Results: In this tab, a recommended jetting and exhaust length setup are shown. These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine and track configuration given in the following tabs. The following values are given: high needle, low needle, pop-off pressure and exhaust length. Besides this information, the air density and density altitude are shown too. In addition, this tab lets do a fine tunning adjustment for the high and low needles to adapt to the concrete engine. \n\n- Weather: In the second tab, called Weather, you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. The values of this screen can be manually set or can be loaded by the application reading the data from the nearest weather station (from the GPS tab).\n\n- Engine: You must set in this screen the information about the engine, that is, the engine type (Leopard, X30 Senior, X30 Junior X30 Super), carburetor, exhaust restrictions (for Junior engines), the oil mix ratio and the type of the circuit (short or long tracks). Depending of the track type, the jetting setups will be adapted.\n\n- GPS: This tab allows to use the GPS to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity). \n\nThe application works with different measure units: inHg, mb, mmHg, hPa, atm for pressure, ºC and ºF for temperature."

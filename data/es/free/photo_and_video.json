      "label": "Teleprompter for Video makes it easy to create professional-looking videos on your iPhone or iPad. Simply read from the prompter while recording video. \n\nIt's perfect for anyone wanting to record a vlog, practise a speech or give a business communication. The app helps actors film self-tape auditions, religious leaders give sermons, job seekers create video resumes and much more. \n\nUsed by over 1 million people worldwide!\n\nHere's how it works...\n\nYou read from a script while filming yourself in high definition. The prompter script (or autocue) scrolls next to the camera lens, helping you make eye contact with your audience. \n\nThey won't know you're reading from a script!\n\nAfter recording, you can edit your video - add your logo, resize for social media, replace background using a green screen, add text and automatically caption the video using the timings from your recording (or export a .srt file for uploading captions on social media). You can even add a background music track using our royalty-free audio.\n\nHere's a summary of all the wonderful features:\n\nRECORD PRO VIDEOS WITHOUT EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT\n* Record videos using the front and rear-facing cameras.\n* Record your video in landscape or portrait.\n* Choose your camera resolution (720p, 1080p, 4K) and frame rate (24, 25 PAL, 30, 60) based on what your device supports.\n* Add beautiful filters to your videos in real-time including Portrait mode (newer devices only).\n* Record sound using in-built and external microphones.\n* Long tap to set AE/AF Lock and manually adjust the exposure.\n* Pinch the screen to zoom.\n* Display a 3x3 grid to help you position yourself.\n\nA SIMPLE TO USE TELEPROMPTER\n* Use voice-assisted scrolling to sound more natural when presenting using a teleprompter. The script scrolls as you speak!\n* Set a countdown to get into position and a countdown to automatically end recording when the teleprompter script reaches the end.\n* Control the teleprompter app with a Bluetooth remote control, wireless keyboard, foot pedal or Apple Watch. Using a remote control you can start and stop the video recording as well as control the scrolling script (start / pause / resume / adjust speed).\n* Mirror the script for use in a teleprompter pro rig device.\n* Adjust the font size, scrolling speed and many other settings.\n\nEASILY MANAGE SCRIPTS ON MULTIPLE DEVICES\n* Import your scripts from Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive or iCloud in .doc, .docx, .txt, .rtf, .pdf formats.\n* Share teleprompter scripts across different iOS devices.\n* Format your scripts in Rich Text to make them easier to read.\n\nEDIT VIDEOS AFTER RECORDING\n* All videos are saved in the app for editing later.\n* Automatically add captions / subtitles to your videos or export a .srt file to import your captions into YouTube, Facebook or other video platforms.\n* Resize videos to landscape, portrait or square for uploading to social media.\n* Add an image or logo to your videos (in-app purchase required).\n* Add text to your video.\n* Change the video background after recording using the smart green screen / chroma key filter.\n* Add background music to your videos. Choose from your library or our selection of royalty-free tracks.\n\nPRO PURCHASES AVAILABLE\n* Teleprompter for Video is free for scripts of up to 750 characters. That's around 1 minute of video with no watermarks.\n* There is a one-off purchase to buy longer teleprompter scripts. This is for unlimited scripts.\n* There is a one-off purchase to allow you to add your own logo to your videos. This is for unlimited recordings.\n* There is also a premium purchase that combines the above purchases at a discounted rate.\n* This app does NOT require a monthly or annual subscription."

      "label": "Web Video Caster® allows you to watch on your TV videos from your favorite websites including movies, TV shows, live streams of news, sports, IPTV.\n\nSUPPORTED STREAMING DEVICES\n\nWeb Video Caster® supports the most popular streaming devices, allowing your TV to stream videos directly from the web.\n\n• Google Cast (Chromecast, Android TV, Chromecast built-in)\n• DLNA devices like Xbox, Samsung TVs, LG TVs, etc. \n• Roku, Roku stick and Roku TVs\n• Apple TV 4\n• Fire TV and Fire TV stick\n• PlayStation 4 - by using its web browser\n• Most web browsers by visiting http://cast2tv.app (PS4, Smart TVs, other consoles and set top boxes)\n\n\n*If you experience a compatibility issues, contact us and include the brand and model number.\n\nSUPPORTED MEDIA\n\n• HLS live streams in M3U8 format (Chromecast, most DLNA devices lack support for it)\n• Authenticated videos including movies and TV shows\n• MP4 videos\n• Live news and sports\n• Any HTML5 videos*\n• IPTV playlists on M3U, W3U and RSS format\n\n*Your streaming device must be capable of decoding the video you are playing. Web Video Caster doesn't perform any video/audio decoding or transcoding.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nWeb Video Cast™ is a browser, which allows you to stream videos of movies, TV shows, and other media from the internet to a streaming device or smart tv. Web Video Caster grabs the video URL inside the web page, sends it to the streaming device (i.e. Chromecast or DLNA device), and then plays the video directly from the content provider. This ultimately saves your mobile device’s battery. It also detects subtitles on the web page. Web Video Cast™ does not host these videos. This is not a mirroring app.\n\n\nGET STARTED\n\nFollow these simple step-by-step instructions to start streaming:\n\n1. Find a video online that you want to watch.\n\n2. Make sure this video can play on mobile browsers without Flash.\n\n3. Connect to your streaming device.\n\n4. Play the video as you normally would. Or, click the play button on the toolbar.\n\nPREMIUM FEATURES**\n\n• No in-app advertising\n• Most visited sites\n• Bookmarks\n• Set homepage\n\n**This functionality does not apply universally to all streaming devices. \n\nLIMITATIONS & DISCLOSURES\n\nAs with all apps, there are some limitations we are aware of and want you to know about up front.\n\n• We are in no way associated with any web media providers and we do not have control over the content they provide.\n• Web Video Caster does not support nor play Flash or FLV videos.\n• The app does not support tab casting, like the Chromecast extension for the PC web browser.\n• We cannot do anything to fix issues that arise on the server side (media content provider) such as failure to play or buffering, which is especially common during heavy load times and weekends.\n\n\nSHARE YOUR FEEDBACK\n\nWe are committed to open communication with our users. Please contact us first with any questions or support issues before leaving a review. We will respond and address your concern promptly. Contact us through our user community https://goo.gl/dAE555 or our website http://www.webvideocaster.com/contactForm"

Enjoy the show on your big screen. \n\nWith Video & TV Cast you can browse through the web and stream any online video on your Chromecast (movies, tv shows, sports, music and more). Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your Chromecast. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Chromecast immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n* The app only works with a Chromecast 1+2+Ultra by Google and on devices with Google Cast or Chromecast built-in.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* Please test your favorite videos with the free edition before upgrading!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. \n\n* If a specific video does not cast, please check our FAQ. If that does not help, please give us a chance to help you by dropping a mail to info@video-tv-cast.com instead of leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for your video as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> UPGRADE FEATURES (available as in-app purchases)\n\n* Premium Edition: Unlocks all of the features listed here. Also future features are included, so you do not have to pay for them when they are released in an updated app version. \n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Chromecast. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker: Blocks ads & popups on most websites and removes the sponsoring ads from the app. You can update and enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Subtitles: Display subtitles & closed captions on TV.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> USER FEEDBACKS\n\n\"You've brought the chromecast to life on iOS devices!! And you designed it work easily and quickly\"\nRyan, England\n\n“I looooove your app. It has taken my Chromecast to a whole new level.”\nRosalind Romero, USA\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nWe want to say thank you for all your great support and kindly invite you to honestly rate our app. This helps us to keep up our app development and support for you. Please do not trust other apps that ask you for 5-star ratings in exchange for premium upgrades. This is against good developer ethics and also against Apple guidelines.\n\nIf you have any feedback, feature requests or other request, please notify us at info@video-tv-cast.com\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here. Chromecast is a trademark of Google LLC."

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "VOR Tracker is a small but powerful training tool for pilots. It is the only one of its kind for the iPhone & iPad, providing the real aircraft feel the other apps are missing!\n\nVOR Tracker is a real IFR simulation, so you will find no multiple choice questions or yet more methods which might or might not work for you. \n\nYou can actually practice IFR procedures in real time, using either a fixed card CDI, RMI, HSI, or EHSI, which provides additional information like wind, track, and groundspeed. \n\nPractice holding patterns, DME arcs, radial interceptions, and 2 needle tracking in real time. It is practice what it is all about! There is no need for explaining again and again what you already know from flight school. It is about applying your knowledge when the flight instruments start moving!\n\nWherever you are, IFR training is only two taps away!\n\nChose between a VOR and NDB and get used to the different characteristics. The NDB comes with atmospheric disturbances and an adjustable dip error to match the instrument you are used to.\n\nDon’t waste your time trying to imagine what you would do in the aircraft – just do it!\n\nVOR Tracker is designed for:\n\n- Student pilots who have the theoretical knowledge for flying IFR procedures, and want to save money by preparing for their pilot training.\n\n- Pilots who want to refresh their IFR navigation skills for an upcoming check ride.\n\n- Pilots going for an assessment. Holding patterns and radial interceptions are commonly used during sim assessments and can really spoil the day. Being prepared will make the difference!\n\n- People who have the knowledge of flying IFR procedures and want to give it a try.\n\n\nVOR Tracker is NOT:\n\n- a game.\n\n- a flight simulator, it focuses on navigation at a constant speed and altitude.\n\n- a flight training course teaching you how to fly IFR procedures.\n\n\nStill interested? Read on to find out how VOR Tracker will boost your skills in no time!\n\n- Choose between a fixed card CDI, RMI, HSI, or EHSI.\n\n- Use the instruments like you would do in the real aircraft.\n\n- Use the map mode to verify your progress.\n\n- Lost? Use the help function to display the holding pattern entries in the map mode.\n\n- Things are going a bit too fast? Use the freeze mode to orientate.\n\n- Getting bored in straight flight? Use the fast mode.\n\n- You want to start over or change the aircraft’s position or heading? Just drag & drop, or twist the aircraft symbol.\n\n- Practice a particular holding pattern or radial interception exercise over and over again from new, random starting positions using the reposition button.\n\n- Start with no wind and increase the difficulty later on by adding wind.\n\n- To add more realism, the wind can be selected to be gusty and/or variable in direction.\n\n- Getting settled? Why not increase the aircraft’s speed in the settings menu?\n\n- Customize your own missions and adjust the wind the way you want.\n\n- Use the hidden wind function to add a realistic challenge.\n\n- Analyze your progress in the map mode. Rewind and start over. The previous track lines will still be displayed for you to see the difference.\n\nPrepare yourself without wasting expensive flight time – use VOR Tracker to brush up your IFR skills!\n\nVOR Tracker is the most efficient trainer for holding patterns and radial interceptions available on the App Store.\n\nSupporting you during your IFR training, it will pay for itself in no time. Take that as a promise!"

Mnemonica, Aronoson, Sti-stebbins) \n\n‘Practice P.A.O’ \n\nOur method for learning the stack uses the unique P.A.O Method (person, action, object.) \n\nYou will be able to enter your own custom values and practice them within the app! \n\nIn order to protect the integrity of our methods we won’t go any deeper into that here, but you will be able to practice P.A.O within the app. \n\n‘Practice the Stack’\n\nThis is where you’ll spend most of your time.\n\nIn the ‘practice the stack’ part of the app there are a lot of settings you can play around with! \n\nYou can practice any part of the stack e.g. 1-10, 5-25, or 1-52 (anything you choose!) \n\nYou can also practice based on suits, odd cards, even cards, red or black cards and more! \n\nYou can also set your own rules for the training deciding whether you want to be timed, lose lives, or practice in free play mode. \n\nYour custom stacks also automatically sync with this part of the app. \n\nEach day you practice you’ll update your streak - get to thirty days and we’ll send you something special! \n\nThis app is constantly being worked on to make it the best app in the magic industry regarding stack training - you won’t be disappointed. \n\nBuy now!"

Enjoy 42 different levels and 18 detailed spelling rules.\n\nIn the first 18 levels, you will have the opportunity to review the spelling rule to follow for the words that appear in the game, you must detect whether the word is written correctly or not. From level 19 onwards, the challenge will be greater, since you will have to play directly with the previously learned or follow the hint Fibi provides.\n\nPerfect to play at the end of the class to reinforce your knowledge. For the older ones, it never hurts to remember some of the basic rules of writing, while having fun.\n\nThere are over 1,400 words that can appear in the game, so you’ll have new words almost every time you play it.\n\nHow to play it:\nThe gameplay is very intuitive, you will have to jump (with a simple tap on the screen) to land on the platform that has a word, you will then have to determine if the word is correct or not. You will have a limited number of opportunities, so you have to be careful, also win prizes (hearts, balls, stars) to get more points … but be careful, because there are things that Fibi cannot touch (chocolates) because you can lose points.\nRemember that you will have to keep jumping because if Fibi loses the momentum, you can fall into the abyss. If you manage to reach the final platform, you can see your personal record and advance to the next level.\n\nAre you ready? Let’s enjoy it!"

Montessori Preschool covers colors, shapes, phonics, reading, counting, coding, addition, subtraction, music and much more!  Download Montessori Preschool and your learners will have hours of fun interactive educational games at their fingertips.\n\n- Multi-user interface for teachers (up to 40 profiles per account)\n- Secure environment (no ads, no external link, no consumable purchases)\n- Can be used offline once downloaded\n \nDesigned by certified Montessori teachers with years of classroom experience, Montessori Preschool is a fun child-centered app divided in 4 subjects: Math, Early literacy, Arts and Practical Life.  You’ll absolutely love the enchanting graphic design and educational content, it is just the perfect app for children from 3 to 7 years old.\n\nIn Montessori Preschool, children can enjoy exactly the same daily activities as in a regular preschool, they can play the mini-games, they can interact with cute avatars and they can customize their school using the points earned while playing.  Parents/teachers benefit from a tailor-made dashboard that tracks each child’s progress and suggests the next activity.\n\nFEATURES\n\n- A comprehensive Montessori 3-7 years old environment to learn by doing \n- Regular updates and new content to make the app forever captivating! \n- An enchanting digital classroom to make learning fun and simple for children at every stage\n- 4 broad areas of learning grounded in the fundamentals of Montessori: self-correction, autonomy, self-confidence and adaptability \n- A fun “reward“ system for increased motivation\n- Individualized interactive learning paths designed by certified Montessori teachers\n\nMath\nOur math curriculum covers learning to count, recognize numbers, trace them… from zero to 1 million.  Introduction to addition and subtraction using Montessori materials are also available.\n\nEarly Literacy\nIn a Montessori classroom, early literacy starts before learning to read.  Children are exposed to sounds and train their ear to identify them before putting a name on a letter.  In the Early Literacy class, children can start with fun sound games like “I spy” and move all the way to reading comprehension. \n\nArts & creativity\nOur Arts class includes an introduction to colours (primary and secondary) as well as many drawing/colouring options and 4 games to learn the basics of music. \n\nPractical Life\nBecause children this age love to reproduce everyday activities done by adults, Maria Montessori included a range of activities like dusting, taking care of plants, cleaning a mirror or washing clothes.   Montessori Preschool welcomes users in a digital school with lockers, a corridor full of daily responsibilities or discoveries.  \n\nChinese\nOur cute Chinese classroom offers numbers, songs, vocabulary and Chinese characters.\n\nLanguages \nSimply switch languages in the app settings (all 8 languages are included in the subscription price) and start your children on a new learning journey.\n \nABOUT US \nEdoki Academy’s mission is to provide children with enjoyable early-learning activities using the latest technologies. Our team members, many of whom are young parents or teachers, strive to produce tools that motivate and inspire children to learn, play, and progress.\n \nPRIVACY\nRead our Privacy Policies: https://www.edokiacademy.com/en/privacy-policy & our Terms of Use: https://www.edokiacademy.com/en/terms.\n \nCONNECT WITH US! \nContact us: support@edokiacademy.com or visit our website: edokiacademy.com.

      "label": "EstaTest es una aplicación móvil intuitiva y fácil de emplear. Destinada a cualquier alumno, docente, investigador o analista de datos que necesite relacionar variables (realizar pruebas de contraste de hipótesis, pruebas bivariantes de relación). La app guía en el proceso de decisión, de realización y de interpretación, de forma muy simple e intuitiva.\n\nPrimero le solicitará que marque las variables que pretende relacionar entre sí, su tipología (categórica de dos categorías o de más, o bien numérica o métrica –cuantitativa), una vez introducida la combinación, la app le hará algunas preguntas tipo filtro, para determinar las condiciones de aplicación, según tipo de prueba, en relación al supuesto seguimiento de ley normal por parte de las distribuciones o variables métricas en juego, o sobre el número de casos esperados en un procedimiento de relación entre categóricas –Chi cuadrado. En algún caso, la app le preguntará por el tipo de diseño de las variables para seguir determinando, con precisión y exactitud, el tipo de prueba adecuada para efectuar la relación solicitada. Una vez aplicados todos los filtros, los cuales puede ir pasando el usuario por defecto, marcando la situación más habitual o esperada en caso de que desconozca los supuestos de aplicación, la app indicará la prueba o procedimiento estadístico a aplicar para ver la posible asociación (relación) entre las variables.  Las pruebas que le propondrá cuando se cumplan las condiciones de aplicación son las siguientes: Chi cuadrado, t-test medidas independientes, t-test medidas relacionadas, anova, correlación… En este caso estamos ante pruebas paramétricas –cuando la variable métrica sigue ley normal, o bien lo suponemos. En el supuesto que no sea así, cuando la variable métrica en juego no siga la ley normal –caso de pruebas no paramétricas- la app le propondrá las siguientes pruebas: U de Mann Whitney, T de Wilcoxon, prueba de kruskal Wallis, correlación de Spearman. \n\nLa app no solamente propone la prueba a efectuar, sino que también le permite ver un breve vídeo donde se explica cómo se realiza el procedimiento estadístico y cómo se interpreta, realizado con el paquete estadístico IBM-SPSS. Los vídeos duran entre uno y dos minutos."

For those of you, who are having difficulties understanding and solving classical mechanics problems, this app is a huge help.It will calculate all forces exerted on a body and simulate the resulting motion in two dimensions, with three degrees of freedom.\n\nUse objects, structures and tools to build your model. You can set physical properties, like mass, velocity, size, position and many more. The app will calculate and show you all the forces on each object. To see the forces in action, just run the simulation. Even during the simulation all forces can be shown and all properties will be updated. You can specify final conditions, to stop the simulation automatically, when these conditions are met.\n\nFrom the very small like the motion of particles to the very big like the moon going around the earth, if you can draw the model, Newtonium can calculate the forces.\n\nFeatures:\n- create, load and save your models\n- change gravitation, friction, resistance or behavior during collisions\n- specify real world physical properties of all objects\n- use tools like springs, struts, and pulleys\n- units are converted automatically\n- set initial and final conditions\n- forces and velocities are displayed as arrows for each object\n- forces are described in detail\n- use the simulator to animate your model\n- display diagrams for objects in motion\n- verify conservation of energy or momentum"

The app was designed for Iphone and Ipad, including Iphone X and Ipad pro. The app is based on an original load sheet, will work only in portrait view, so in the case of the Iphones you will have to move with your finger the screen to get all over the page. Bigger the screen less moving. In the Ipad`s case the page will be in full view. The zoom in and out is available in all devices.

Its going tibia ok, the Skelly app is just what you need! With the Skelly app you can literally pull the inspiration you need right out of your pocket anywhere, anytime!\n\nSkelly is a fully poseable, anatomically correct reference skeleton for artists. A simplified version of the skeleton is also included, named “Robo-Skelly”. These figures were created to make the study of anatomy easier and more enjoyable for students and professionals without leaving your wallets bone dry. They can also be used to inspire poses for drawing, painting, sculpting, illustration, animation, comics, manga, storyboarding, twerking, and to fully understand the anatomy of the human skeleton. No need for super gluteus, Skelly comes pre-assembled and ready to pose as soon as you launch the app! \n\nLearning the structure of the human body is the skeleton key to drawing the figure in an anatomically correct manner without having to clear your browser history to avoid awkward conversations with your loved ones. Whether you want to make works like Michelangelo or Miyazaki, Skelly will help you focus on your art and let you personalize his poses, rather than searching for reference material and hiring models. Learn to draw the skeleton from any angle without the inconvenient and morally questionable need to go grave robbing.\n\nFEATURES:\n \nAnatomically correct skeleton\nSimplified “Robo Skelly”\nProportions based on the teachings of Dr. Paul Richer\nSkull fits perfectly into a “Loomis Head” as taught by Andrew Loomis\nPoseable joints\nPose Library - choose from pre made poses and save your own\nMovable camera\nAdjustable light source\nChoose light or dark background\nReset to neutral “Anatomical Pose”\n\nPEOPLE LOVE IT:\n\nJames Gurney, author of ‘Color and Light’ and ‘Imaginative Realism’ Says:\n\n\"Bend him, twist him, contort him! The Skelly app lets you put a virtual human skeleton into any pose, and to see him from any angle, and in any lighting. It’s a great tool for art students or professionals wondering what the skeleton is really doing beneath a life pose, or for anyone wanting to visualize a pose from scratch. The interface is intuitive to learn and easy to use, without sacrificing any of the nuances of the human body’s complex range of movement. Skelly is a big improvement over the old wooden mannikin.\"\n\n- Chris Oatley, Director Of The Oatley Academy Of Visual Storytelling Says:\n\n\"Skelly is the fastest, most fluid anatomical reference I have ever seen. I was shocked at how easy it is to pose the figure and direct the light source. Finally! It’s the app visual artists have been waiting for.\"\n\nHave any questions? CONTACT US:\n\nskelly@proko.com"

Acceso en el panel privado a los audios de los grupos online y material de estudio.\n\nAUDIOS\nLos audios sobre Un Curso de Milagros (entrevistas, debates, clases online, sesiones de preguntas y respuestas, monográficos y narraciones) se pueden reproducir normalmente o descargar para ser escuchados en cualquier otro momento sin utilizar los datos de tu teléfono. Esto es especialmente útil para aquellos que han adquirido el material de estudio o para quienes suelen escuchar los audios cuando viajan en coche o en avión y no hay buena conexión a internet. Puedes marcar los que más te gusten y guardarlos en tu lista de favoritos. También te resultará fácil encontrar el audio que buscas escribiendo parte del título o la descripción que recuerdes. Si detienes el audio o cierras la aplicación, la reproducción comenzará en el punto en que lo dejaste. También puedes programar el reproductor para que se apague al cabo de un tiempo.\n\nLECCIÓN DEL DÍA\nElige la lección que estés practicando y programa la alarma para que te avise cada día. Esto se puede hacer mediante dos opciones:\n1. Alarma diaria: simplemente eliges la hora a la que quieres ser avisado. Puedes programar tantas alarmas como quieras durante una semana seleccionando el día.\n2. Intervalo: en algunas ocasiones el Libro de ejercicios te pide realizar la lección cada cierto tiempo, como por ejemplo cada hora. En ese caso puede ser más interesante esta opción. Selecciona la hora de inicio y la hora final a la que sonará la alarma, así como los intervalos en los que quieres ser avisado (puedes elegir desde 10 minutos hasta 8 horas de intervalo).\nOtra opción que te resultará útil es el cronómetro que se encuentra al final de cada lección. Puedes programarlo para que te avise desde un minuto hasta una hora, de forma que sólo tendrás que ocuparte de realizar correctamente la lección.\n\nSALAS DE CHAT (Disponibles próximamente)\nUna parte importante del estudio de Un Curso de Milagros es poder compartir con otros estudiantes lo que se está aprendiendo. Las salas de chat son un espacio de comunicación para los miembros del grupo online asociado a tu inscripción, en el que puedes intercambiar puntos de vista y perspectivas que enriquezcan el debate y el aprendizaje conjunto, creando así una comunidad que retroalimenta tanto el avance individual como grupal.\n\nPANEL PRIVADO\nAquí encontrarás la información relacionada con tu usuario: inscripciones y renovaciones, audios de las clases online y material de estudio.\n\nINCIDENCIAS Y SOLUCIÓN DE PROBLEMAS\nTipo de incidencia: los audios se detienen cuando se apaga la pantalla.\nSolución: cambiar los ajustes de ahorro de batería y/o los ajustes de ahorro de datos activos y permitir que la aplicación no sea ajustada.\n\n\nAVISO IMPORTANTE\nSe ha comprobado que en los modelos de iPhone que utilizan las versiones de software 13.3 y 13.4 los audios se detienen poco después de que la pantalla se apague, sin que el cambio de configuración de ahorro de batería o uso de datos indicados más arriba pueda evitarlo. Es posible que este error quede subsanado en posteriores actualizaciones del software por parte de Apple.\nEn el caso de que detectes alguna incidencia en el funcionamiento de la aplicación puedes volver a instalarla (no tiene coste adicional). Si persiste no dudes en contactar con nosotros en info@menteuno.com indicándonos la marca, modelo y versión de tu dispositivo y enviándonos una captura de pantalla con la descripción del problema.\n\nEsta app no contiene publicidad."

This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch.

Parents of children with autism have found this app helpful in engaging their children, but truly it is for anyone that wants to teach their kids something new while stimulating and training their brains.\n\nEvery animal, transportation mode, and tile has five different sounds linked, so children can learn different sounds and images associated with objects. Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

      "label": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training. It is yet another beautifully designed and easy-to-use app for kids“ by lilmagoolie.com"

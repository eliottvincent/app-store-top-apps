Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

Acceso en el panel privado a los audios de los grupos online y material de estudio.\n\nAUDIOS\nLos audios sobre Un Curso de Milagros (entrevistas, debates, clases online, sesiones de preguntas y respuestas, monográficos y narraciones) se pueden reproducir normalmente o descargar para ser escuchados en cualquier otro momento sin utilizar los datos de tu teléfono. Esto es especialmente útil para aquellos que han adquirido el material de estudio o para quienes suelen escuchar los audios cuando viajan en coche o en avión y no hay buena conexión a internet. Puedes marcar los que más te gusten y guardarlos en tu lista de favoritos. También te resultará fácil encontrar el audio que buscas escribiendo parte del título o la descripción que recuerdes. Si detienes el audio o cierras la aplicación, la reproducción comenzará en el punto en que lo dejaste. También puedes programar el reproductor para que se apague al cabo de un tiempo.\n\nLECCIÓN DEL DÍA\nElige la lección que estés practicando y programa la alarma para que te avise cada día. Esto se puede hacer mediante dos opciones:\n1. Alarma diaria: simplemente eliges la hora a la que quieres ser avisado. Puedes programar tantas alarmas como quieras durante una semana seleccionando el día.\n2. Intervalo: en algunas ocasiones el Libro de ejercicios te pide realizar la lección cada cierto tiempo, como por ejemplo cada hora. En ese caso puede ser más interesante esta opción. Selecciona la hora de inicio y la hora final a la que sonará la alarma, así como los intervalos en los que quieres ser avisado (puedes elegir desde 10 minutos hasta 8 horas de intervalo).\nOtra opción que te resultará útil es el cronómetro que se encuentra al final de cada lección. Puedes programarlo para que te avise desde un minuto hasta una hora, de forma que sólo tendrás que ocuparte de realizar correctamente la lección.\n\nSALAS DE CHAT (Disponibles próximamente)\nUna parte importante del estudio de Un Curso de Milagros es poder compartir con otros estudiantes lo que se está aprendiendo. Las salas de chat son un espacio de comunicación para los miembros del grupo online asociado a tu inscripción, en el que puedes intercambiar puntos de vista y perspectivas que enriquezcan el debate y el aprendizaje conjunto, creando así una comunidad que retroalimenta tanto el avance individual como grupal.\n\nPANEL PRIVADO\nAquí encontrarás la información relacionada con tu usuario: inscripciones y renovaciones, audios de las clases online y material de estudio.\n\nINCIDENCIAS Y SOLUCIÓN DE PROBLEMAS\nTipo de incidencia: los audios se detienen cuando se apaga la pantalla.\nSolución: cambiar los ajustes de ahorro de batería y/o los ajustes de ahorro de datos activos y permitir que la aplicación no sea ajustada.\n\n\nAVISO IMPORTANTE\nSe ha comprobado que en los modelos de iPhone que utilizan las versiones de software 13.3 y 13.4 los audios se detienen poco después de que la pantalla se apague, sin que el cambio de configuración de ahorro de batería o uso de datos indicados más arriba pueda evitarlo. Es posible que este error quede subsanado en posteriores actualizaciones del software por parte de Apple.\nEn el caso de que detectes alguna incidencia en el funcionamiento de la aplicación puedes volver a instalarla (no tiene coste adicional). Si persiste no dudes en contactar con nosotros en info@menteuno.com indicándonos la marca, modelo y versión de tu dispositivo y enviándonos una captura de pantalla con la descripción del problema.\n\nEsta app no contiene publicidad."

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported.

      "label": "\"Best App for Preschool Word Games\" -- Best iPhone Apps book, O'Reilly Media\n\n\"An application that uses early childhood development theory — great!\" -- Daniel Donahoo, GeekDad (Wired)\n\nI See Ewe is an educational game for that helps your preschooler learn to recognize over 50 different shapes, objects, colors and animals, and exposes them to their first sight words. I See Ewe accomplishes this through two simple yet fun and engaging games. \n\nThe first game, \"Learn Shapes\", presents a child with a number of cards, each containing a different item. The game then verbally asks the child to find a specific item amongst the displayed cards while displaying the written form of the specific item's name. The child is successful when they tap on the card with the correct item. \n\nThe second game, \"Match Shapes\", is a memory match game that challenges the child to turn over cards two at a time to find a pair of matching cards. \n\nYou are able to adjust the level of difficulty for each game and activate verbal prompts that help your preschool child learn. \n\nI See Ewe has English, German, Spanish and Chinese (Mandarin) languages localizations built in. You can select which language version you want to use in the game options view.\n\nBe sure to visit the I See Ewe website for a detailed description of how to use the app with your preschool child."

The app inspires children not to use their smartphones and tablets just for consuming but for creating and expressing themselves creatively.\n \nA crazy character, a funny animal or maybe a whole underwater world? With a large color palette and a variety of geometric shapes, children can create wherever their minds and fantasy leads them. Composing, rejecting, re-composing or changing the colors - the app encourages children to try out new things and not to be afraid of making mistakes. \nThere are more functions for advanced artists, such as grouping elements and working with different layers. This lets them learn principles that will later make dealing with complex graphics programs easier. \n \nHIGHLIGHTS: \n- Easy, intuitive and child-friendly operation. \n- Age-appropriate graphics, letters and numbers. \n- Nurtures fine-motor skills. \n- No internet or WLAN required.\n- No in-app purchases. \n \nDISCOVER, PLAY AND LEARN: \nIn our \"Art Adventure\" app, children gain insight into the world of art and design and easily acquire a basic understanding of structures, levels and contours. At the same time their eagerness to experiment, imagination and creativity are stimulated. \n \nIDEAL FOR CLASSROOM LESSONS\nWith its intuitive, child-friendly operation, the app is perfectly suited for classroom lessons - it is optimized for children from 5 years of age, requires no internet connection and does not collect data.\n \nMANY USES\nAfter storage, your personally created characters and graphics can be used for presentations, programming projects, comics and much more or sent directly to family and friends.\n\nAbout Fox & Sheep:\nWe are a Studio in Berlin and develop high quality apps for kids at the age of 2-8 years.

Because Solar Walk knows what time it is, the planets are in proper orientation to the Sun: Earth is dark where it is currently night and gradually lightens to daytime on the other side.” - NY Times\n\n\"It's great for showing my students the relative positions of the planets in the solar system, the satellites orbiting the Earth and our place in the galaxy. Awesome with a smartboard as well.\" - by jbrown61\n\nSolar Walk enables you to:\n\n► Observe 3D model of our Solar system with all its objects in real time and in a ​proper orientation.

      "label": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training. It is yet another beautifully designed and easy-to-use app for kids“ by lilmagoolie.com"

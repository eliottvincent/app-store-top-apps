      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

Destinada a cualquier alumno, docente, investigador o analista de datos que necesite relacionar variables (realizar pruebas de contraste de hipótesis, pruebas bivariantes de relación). La app guía en el proceso de decisión, de realización y de interpretación, de forma muy simple e intuitiva.\n\nPrimero le solicitará que marque las variables que pretende relacionar entre sí, su tipología (categórica de dos categorías o de más, o bien numérica o métrica –cuantitativa), una vez introducida la combinación, la app le hará algunas preguntas tipo filtro, para determinar las condiciones de aplicación, según tipo de prueba, en relación al supuesto seguimiento de ley normal por parte de las distribuciones o variables métricas en juego, o sobre el número de casos esperados en un procedimiento de relación entre categóricas –Chi cuadrado. En algún caso, la app le preguntará por el tipo de diseño de las variables para seguir determinando, con precisión y exactitud, el tipo de prueba adecuada para efectuar la relación solicitada. Una vez aplicados todos los filtros, los cuales puede ir pasando el usuario por defecto, marcando la situación más habitual o esperada en caso de que desconozca los supuestos de aplicación, la app indicará la prueba o procedimiento estadístico a aplicar para ver la posible asociación (relación) entre las variables.  Las pruebas que le propondrá cuando se cumplan las condiciones de aplicación son las siguientes: Chi cuadrado, t-test medidas independientes, t-test medidas relacionadas, anova, correlación… En este caso estamos ante pruebas paramétricas –cuando la variable métrica sigue ley normal, o bien lo suponemos. En el supuesto que no sea así, cuando la variable métrica en juego no siga la ley normal –caso de pruebas no paramétricas- la app le propondrá las siguientes pruebas: U de Mann Whitney, T de Wilcoxon, prueba de kruskal Wallis, correlación de Spearman. \n\nLa app no solamente propone la prueba a efectuar, sino que también le permite ver un breve vídeo donde se explica cómo se realiza el procedimiento estadístico y cómo se interpreta, realizado con el paquete estadístico IBM-SPSS. Los vídeos duran entre uno y dos minutos."

      "label": "Experiment with plant characters, evolve them into new species and discover their unique personalities. Keep collecting plants until you’ve collected them all! The world of science just got a little bit weirder and a lot more fun with Toca Lab: Plants!\n\nJust like with the first app in the Toca Lab Series, Toca Lab: Elements, your curiosity will lead the way. Choose your plant, then visit five different locations in the lab:\n\n● Grow light: Shine the light on your plant and watch what happens! Does your plant bask and happily sigh in the light, or groan and wriggle away? What happens when you turn the light up a notch or two?\n\n● Watering tank: Put your plant in the tank and fill it up with water. Will your plant float? How does your plant behave when it’s soaking wet?\n\n● Nutrition station: What’s the optimal diet for your plant? Try the three different nutrition formulas and discover which ones your plant character likes!\n\n● Cloning machine: Spin the wheel on the cloning machine and before you know it, you’ll have five little versions of your plant. Wonder what the clones can do? Experiment and find out!\n\n● Crossbreeding apparatus: Here you can mix two plants to create something unexpected. Try it and see what happens!\n\nHave fun experimenting at each station to see how the plants evolve. Keep experimenting until you’ve collected all 35 plant characters in the app. Once you’ve collected a plant, keep experimenting to continue to evolve it! Who says kids can’t be scientists? Toca Lab: Plants brings out the budding botanist in everybody!\n\nFEATURES\n- Start with one plant and experiment your way to 35 different plant characters, each with its own unique personality!\n- Continue to evolve existing plants through experimentation!\n- Evolve plants with five lab tools: grow light, watering tank, nutrition station, cloning machine and the crossbreeding apparatus.\n- Discover plants from five groups: green algae, mosses, ferns, trees and flowering plants.\n- Learn the names and Latin names of real-life plants!\n\n--\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

This app will turn your English text into its phonetic transcription using International Phonetic Alphabet.\n \nFeatures:\n \n- See phonetic transcription of the whole text, not just the dictionary forms of separate words.\n- Choose between British and American* pronunciation. When British dialect is selected the [r] sound at the end of the word is only voiced if followed by a vowel, which follows British phonetic convention.\n- International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) symbols used.\n- The structure of the text and sentences in it (line breaks, punctuation marks, etc.) is preserved in phonetic transcription output making it easier to read.\n- You can output the text and its phonetic transcription along each other line-by-line to make back-reference to the original text easier.\n- An option to vary pronunciation depending on whether words are in stressed or weak position in the sentence, as in connected speech.\n- In addition to commonly used vocabulary the database contains a very substantial amount of place names (including names of countries, their capitals, US states, UK counties), nationalities and popular names.\n- Where a word has a number of possible pronunciations (highlighted in blue in the output) you can select the one that agrees with the context by tapping on it.\n- Print out the output results, share via email or copy to pasteboard.\n- Let the built-in speech synthesiser read your text out loud. Control the playback and follow IPA transcription of the current word with a highlight.\n- Custom URL scheme to open toPhonetics from 3rd-party apps.\n\nGestures (IPA transcription screen):\n1. Single tap\n    - Tap a word to set the cursor to it and speak it (you can mute/un-mute it with the button at your bottom-right).\n    - Tap in a blank space to stop speech and hide the cursor.\n2. Double-tap\n    - Double-tap a word to open it in the built-in dictionary; if the word has multiple pronunciations you'll see the list of them first.\n    - Double-tap in a blank space to reset the font to the size set in iOS preferences.\n3. Pinch in or out to make the text smaller or larger.\n4. Start to slide horizontally to select a part of your text. The Speak button respects current selection.\n\n\n*) American transcriptions are based on the open Carnegie Mellon University Pronouncing Dictionary."

      "label": "Simply the best interactive, most complete, self contained dictionary and translator between English and Ancient Egyptian! \n\nThis app explains what the ancient symbols mean, how they were pronounced and how they formed words and phrases. \n\nThe App contains 2229 hieroglyphic signs and almost 49,000 words, phrases, titles, epithets, and locations used in Ancient Egypt. The dictionary also contains the Horus, Birth, and Throne names of all the known Pharaohs and Queens of Egypt. Our dictionary has more than twice the content of any other smartphone translation apps.\n\nHieroglyphics Pro has several modes: \n    Beginner, Student and Pro. \nBeginner mode uses a minimal set of 200 glyphs and an easy pronunciation guide. \nStudent mode allows choice of over 700 glyphs, organized by shape, and standard transliteration. \nThe Pro mode uses all 1,071 glyphs in Gardiner's classic categories with over 1200 additional New Kingdom and later signs.  \n\nA unique feature of Hieroglyphics Pro is the ability to find glyphs by how often they are used in inscriptions. Adding the common signs to a phrase or word is a snap! Egyptian words and phrases are drawn graphically in groups, in the artistic style of the ancient inscriptions.\n\nThe App now offers 4 ways to enter Hieroglyphs for translation:  \n    •Graphically from Gardiner groupings, or in Beginner Mode, Manley's Groupings\n      - A unique feature allows finding glyphs sorted by their frequency of use!\n    •Direct keyboard text entry of Gardiner codes (i.e., A1, D21, Aa2) and phonetic shortcuts as defined by the MdC (i.e., Htp, nTr,  r, etc.)\n    •By transliteration symbol from the MdC table\n    •Searching for keywords in a glyph's description or determinative words\n\n    Text entries of Gardiner Codes and MdC can now be edited with a cursor and finger swiping, just like other text editing apps!\n\nVery quick and convenient! \n\nHieroglyph Pro is the first and only mobile App to introduce Hieratic glyphs, and how they evolved over the centuries.\n\nHieroglyphics Pro is a modern iOS 16 App, back compatible to iOS 13, Dark Mode and all. It contains help files and links to both on-line references and to printed books for advanced study.\n\nHieroglyphics Pro has been developed and evolved in consultation with professional Egyptologists."

      "label": "\"Exploring Emotions is highly recommended for any educator working with students on emotional regulation\" - Jackie Bryla (A.C.T.)\n\nThe Zones of Regulation®: Exploring Emotions is an application designed to foster self-regulation skills in fun and exciting ways while simulating everyday situations students can relate to.\n\nExploring Emotions is based off of the widely adopted framework, The Zones of Regulation, by Leah Kuypers (www.zonesofregulation.com). The framework was published as a curriculum (2011, Social Thinking Publishing, www.socialthinking.com) as well as an original app, both titled The Zones of Regulation. The Zones of Regulation teaches four concrete colored “zones” to categorize all the feelings, sensory states and emotions we experience, helping students develop awareness of how they are feeling and by providing a simple language and visual structure to communicate their feelings to others. In addition, students learn about tools and how they can be used to manage each of their zones. The app helps students gain skills in consciously regulating their behaviors to the social and environmental demands.\n\nExploring Emotions offers a new medium to address self-regulation needs and reinforce The Zones framework. There are several features in the app that create a comprehensive learning experience:\n\n• Audio voiceover enriches the experience for students by providing social interaction between characters and instructional teachings throughout the app.\n\n• Data tracking allows students to apply what they are learning in the app to their own life by self-monitoring and reflecting on their feelings (Zones) and how they were managed during events that occurred over the course of their day. These graphs can be saved, revisited and edited, and also emailed to an email address.\n\n• Easy navigation throughout the app allows students to return to any point in the app to replay and consider different outcomes.\n\n• Integration of an expansive toolbox that is fully customizable by students. Students learn about and categorize dozens of tools to help them manage their zones. They are also able to adjust the content of their toolbox.\n\n• Incorporation of mini games provide real-time the opportunity for students to reflect on the outcome of games and how this triggers emotions.\n\n• Multiple environments including a classroom, a cafeteria, and a park that offer different scenarios, events and activities to participate in. Students easily relate to the various situations presented throughout the app, helping them to make connections between learning in the app to real life.\n\n• Reinforcing activities are infused throughout the app. For example, students can unlock a mini game and customize their avatar by coloring their hair and buying custom outfits.\n\n• References to The Zones of Regulation curriculum are embedded throughout the app to assist adults who support a student in locating additional educational resources to strengthen learning.\n\nExploring Emotions is designed to be used with Pre-K, elementary students, secondary students, as well as is applicable to adults that struggle with emotional control. To enhance learning, it is recommended that an adult closely monitor the student's progression through the App, asking probing questions and facilitating discussions about how the App's content can be generalized to the student's real life. Exploring Emotions is a resource for parents to teach and encourage self-control and emotional management in the home through the Zones framework. It is an exciting resource for therapists and teachers looking to address social emotional learning (SEL) through a medium that is motivating for students to engage in.\n\nThe App provides a fun and engaging experience for students while learning and gaining valuable knowledge to assist in developing real-life skills in self-regulation and emotional control.\n\nDownload The Zones of Regulation: Exploring Emotions today!"

Men da denne del af læseindlæringen er det vigtigste trin i læseprocessen, skal den trænes meget. \n\nDer skal gives god tid til at lytte og smage på lydene og derudfra høre, om det er noget, der giver mening eller ej. Det er en god ide også selv at sige lydene højt og lade lydene ’læse’ ordet. \n\n- Forlyd og rimdel\nAlle lyde kan høres, lige så mange gange man vil, ved at trykke på lyden. Opgaven er at vælge en forlyd sammen med rimdelen, der giver et rigtigt ord. \n\nDet går ud på at lytte til lydene, se på ordet og vælge de lyde, der giver ord, der betyder noget.\n\n- Sammensætning af lyde\nAlle ordene der er brugt er lydrette, så fokus kommer på metoden at sætte lyde sammen til ord. \nDet er bogstavernes standardlyde, der benyttes. Dog er der også medtaget de vigtige lyde:\n•-e (fx løve)\n•-er (løver) \n•-d (blødt d, fx blad)\n•-g (blødt g fx dage). \n\nDer er ikke benyttet stumme bogstaver (fx hund) og vokalglidning (fx smøkke for smykke).\n\n- Supplement til skrivehæfter \nVi anbefaler 10 minutters træning om dagen. Det er godt at træne sammen med en voksen de første par gange, så kan man hjælpe hinanden og snakke om metoden. \n\nHvis ordene i Læseguld er for svære, anbefaler vi, at træne med Læseguld, der indeholder lettere ord med enkel konsonant i forlyden.\n\n------\n\n- Udviklet af eksperter\nAlle ordene der er med i Læseguld er nøje udvalgt og inddelt i sværhedsgrader. Dette er gjort af erfarne lærere, der har specialiseret sig i børn med læsevanskeligheder. Ordene er ord som børn kender og alle ordene er lydrette, så fokus kommer på lydmetoden - at sætte lyde sammen til ord. \n\nMålgruppe: 6-10 år"

      "label": "MathStudio Express, a full-featured scientific calculator with hundreds of mathematical functions that cover Basic Math, Pre-Algebra, Algebra, Trigonometry, Precalculus, Calculus, Statistics, Finite Math, Linear Algebra and Statistics.\n\n\"MathStudio is a natural for students and for engineers who occasionally need a comprehensive math program but don't need the full horsepower and daunting complexity of Mathematica or Maple. It's a huge leap from the usual calculator program for tablets and smartphones.\"\n▸ IEEE Spectrum Review by Kenneth R. Foster\n\nMathStudio is an indispensable tool for students, teachers, and engineers. It provides features comparable to TI calculators but with a modern and intuitive interface.\n\n\"I've been waiting for a program like this a long time on my iPhone or iPad, and somehow never found MathStudio until now. This is a phenomenal engineering application for the student or professional. It does it all... Solving equations, integrating, calculating derivatives, and graphing. I had a TI-92 calculator back in my college days that I used for years and dearly loved and this app blows it out of the water. The UI is extremely functional and intuitive to use. They include a really quick tutorial that gets you up and running quickly. This is the example app for the potential of a device like the iPhone or iPad. Superb!\"\n▸ Fantastic... It's a TI-92 on steroids by Dan Frame\n\nGraph equations with speed and ease you never thought were possible!  Move, rotate and pinch function, parametric, polar, implicit, contour, spherical, cylindrical, vector fields, fractals and image plots with amazing speed and accuracy.  Use the T variable to create animated plots that graph in space and time!  MathStudio is the first calculator to introduce time graphing when it was first released as SpaceTime in 2003 for Pocket PC.\n\n\"This is truly an amazing piece of software for the iPhone that could potentially render all the graphing calculators out-there obsolete! I was very impressed with all the graphing features (2D, 3D, 4D, etc) and the powerful CAS loaded with preprogrammed functions. MathStudio solves and displays complex expressions in a fashion that reminds me of my TI 92's 'pretty print' mode. I highly recommend this application to every college student and math enthusiast!\"\n▸ Dump your graphing calculator! by Syldaril\n\nPlot lists of numerical data in scatter, histograms, box, and probability plots.  MathStudio even includes an advanced regression analysis package, choose from several regression functions or create your own.\n\n\"I am so lucky to find this application! I will never use TI-89 again! And the price is unbelievable! And you can do scripts! TI-89 costs over 100 dollars. You can use this application instead! Too bad our professor doesn't let us use phones on the test. I will try to convince him by showing this application. MathStudio is well worth the money.\"\n▸ Wow! by aurorae_borealis\n\nMathStudio is powered by that fastest proprietary computer algebra system available on iOS that beautifully typesets your answers.  Got a tough algebra equation to solve or polynomial to factor?  Solve quadratic equations, systems of equations, limits, derivates, integrals, differential equations and much more.  Create scripts in MathStudio's powerful programming language that supports variables, loops, and recursion.\n\n\"This application is simply amazing. I continue to be stunned by the speed and accuracy in which it solves/plots/does just about anything you could possibly need to do in math. I prefer it to computer math applications because you simply cannot beat the touch interface. This app has changed the way that I do math every day, and I highly recommend it to anyone who does math on a daily basis.\"\n▸ Amazing by rationalresponse"

Acceso en el panel privado a los audios de los grupos online y material de estudio.\n\nAUDIOS\nLos audios sobre Un Curso de Milagros (entrevistas, debates, clases online, sesiones de preguntas y respuestas, monográficos y narraciones) se pueden reproducir normalmente o descargar para ser escuchados en cualquier otro momento sin utilizar los datos de tu teléfono. Esto es especialmente útil para aquellos que han adquirido el material de estudio o para quienes suelen escuchar los audios cuando viajan en coche o en avión y no hay buena conexión a internet. Puedes marcar los que más te gusten y guardarlos en tu lista de favoritos. También te resultará fácil encontrar el audio que buscas escribiendo parte del título o la descripción que recuerdes. Si detienes el audio o cierras la aplicación, la reproducción comenzará en el punto en que lo dejaste. También puedes programar el reproductor para que se apague al cabo de un tiempo.\n\nLECCIÓN DEL DÍA\nElige la lección que estés practicando y programa la alarma para que te avise cada día. Esto se puede hacer mediante dos opciones:\n1. Alarma diaria: simplemente eliges la hora a la que quieres ser avisado. Puedes programar tantas alarmas como quieras durante una semana seleccionando el día.\n2. Intervalo: en algunas ocasiones el Libro de ejercicios te pide realizar la lección cada cierto tiempo, como por ejemplo cada hora. En ese caso puede ser más interesante esta opción. Selecciona la hora de inicio y la hora final a la que sonará la alarma, así como los intervalos en los que quieres ser avisado (puedes elegir desde 10 minutos hasta 8 horas de intervalo).\nOtra opción que te resultará útil es el cronómetro que se encuentra al final de cada lección. Puedes programarlo para que te avise desde un minuto hasta una hora, de forma que sólo tendrás que ocuparte de realizar correctamente la lección.\n\nSALAS DE CHAT (Disponibles próximamente)\nUna parte importante del estudio de Un Curso de Milagros es poder compartir con otros estudiantes lo que se está aprendiendo. Las salas de chat son un espacio de comunicación para los miembros del grupo online asociado a tu inscripción, en el que puedes intercambiar puntos de vista y perspectivas que enriquezcan el debate y el aprendizaje conjunto, creando así una comunidad que retroalimenta tanto el avance individual como grupal.\n\nPANEL PRIVADO\nAquí encontrarás la información relacionada con tu usuario: inscripciones y renovaciones, audios de las clases online y material de estudio.\n\nINCIDENCIAS Y SOLUCIÓN DE PROBLEMAS\nTipo de incidencia: los audios se detienen cuando se apaga la pantalla.\nSolución: cambiar los ajustes de ahorro de batería y/o los ajustes de ahorro de datos activos y permitir que la aplicación no sea ajustada.\n\n\nAVISO IMPORTANTE\nSe ha comprobado que en los modelos de iPhone que utilizan las versiones de software 13.3 y 13.4 los audios se detienen poco después de que la pantalla se apague, sin que el cambio de configuración de ahorro de batería o uso de datos indicados más arriba pueda evitarlo. Es posible que este error quede subsanado en posteriores actualizaciones del software por parte de Apple.\nEn el caso de que detectes alguna incidencia en el funcionamiento de la aplicación puedes volver a instalarla (no tiene coste adicional). Si persiste no dudes en contactar con nosotros en info@menteuno.com indicándonos la marca, modelo y versión de tu dispositivo y enviándonos una captura de pantalla con la descripción del problema.\n\nEsta app no contiene publicidad."

Play with and learn about sharks, penguins, octopuses, seahorses, turtles and many others!\n\nWith \"What’s in The Oceans?\" you can play and learn freely, with no pressure or stress. Play, observe, ask questions and find the answers. Explore how animals interact with each other, how they live, how they defend themselves and how they reproduce.\n\nLearn and get informed about the pollution of the oceans and its dangers. See how plastics, overfishing, climate change and ships affect the life and health of different ecosystems. We only have one planet — let's take care of it!\n\nWith five incredible ecosystems:\n\nSouth Pole\nDiscover the life of penguins, seals and orcas. Play with them! What do they eat and how do they live? How does climate change affect them?\n\nOctopuses\nFeed the sharks and learn how octopuses defend themselves and not be devoured. Try to protect the divers inside the shark cage!\n\nDolphins\nSee how the dolphins hunt, reproduce and come out to breathe. Play with them until it becomes night so they can go to sleep. Watch the fishing nets — if the dolphins get caught in them, they will not be able to come out to breathe.\n\nTurtles\nFeed the turtles and watch them lay eggs. Help the younglings to get out of the egg, and make sure the turtles don't eat the plastic bags, as they sometime mistake them for jellyfish. Look at the remoras — they always hitch a ride on the turtles.\n\nSeahorses\nSeahorses are small and fragile. Protect them from their predators, crabs, and make the algae and corals grow so they can hide.\n\nFeatures\n\n• Discover how animals live and how they interact in different ecosystems.\n• Play and learn with different marine animals: octopuses, crabs, sharks, turtles, jellyfish, seahorses, penguins, orcas, seals, remoras, starfish...

The app is designed to let you work effectively on smaller screens.\n- The iPad app features a split-screen layout. You can enjoy a full-screen workspace, or work on two views simultaneously.\n- The iPad app runs on Macs with Apple silicon as well. Buy one app and it works on all of the platforms.\n\n[+] MATLAB interpreter\n\n- The interpreter works for language syntax that is essential to survive a MATLAB course. It provides the most commonly used built-in functions for learners.\n- The interpreter computes on your device locally. You will not miss a single app feature even if you go completely offline.\n- SIMO comes with a full set of documentation and user guides. It is offline accessible and full-text searchable.\n\n[+] Visualization tool\n\n- Plots are rendered in real-time using your device's computing power. Operations such as updating line attributes, pan and zoom are fast and responsive.\n- Stunning 3D plots are rendered by the device's GPU in real-time. Pan, zoom or rotate with multi-touch gestures, trackpad or keyboard shortcuts. \n- Plot attributes are editable through the built-in user-interface. You can improvise with different styles without entering a single line of code.\n\n[+] Command console\n\n- You can run one or many lines of code from the command console. It supports line numbering, auto-intent and syntax highlighting.\n- Search over thousand lines of output data instantly. You'll never get overwhelmed by the sea of numbers.\n- Output data are formatted automatically to fit the screen size or app window. Data are always neatly presented however you resize the app.\n\n[+] File manager\n\n- Files can be synced across all of your iCloud Drive enabled devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac). Or, you can store them locally on device. \n- Tons of files buried in tons of folders? No worries. The search feature will help you find an item instantly. \n- It has features you expect from a useful file manager. Add, copy, delete, duplicate, move, rename, sort and more.\n\n[+] Script editor\n\n- It has features you expect from a useful script editor. Syntax highlight, auto-indent, line numbers and more.\n- Search for a word in a script. Replace occurrences with another word.\n- Recent items are accessible from your finger tip. It is a useful feature for navigating through frequently accessed files. "

      "label": "Carryout Multiplications step by step\n\nThis Application enables you to solve multiplication problems step by step, just as you would do it on a sheet of paper.  Being able to carry out the multiplication step by step is the key feature of this application. \n\nThe application surface area represents a worksheet that’s touch enabled. As you start to do the multiplication you touch areas on the screen to highlight it and then use the keypad to enter the numbers. The idea is to enable long multiplications where you go digit by digit line by line also entering any carry forwards to solve the problem.\n\n\nHow the application works\n\nWhen you start the application it presents a screen where you choose the type of multiplications you like to practice. You could choose number of digits that you want for multiplicand as well as the multiplier and also set the range for the numbers; also you could choose if you want the application to present numbers that would result in rounding. Once set, the application presents questions that are generated randomly using the above criteria.\n\nAs guidance, if the user is a kindergartener and wants to practice basic multiplication facts, you might choose to start with one digit and may set your multiplier limit to the same number say 4 to practice multiplying by 4 (see the screenshot below).  As you start to get more comfortable with your basic one digit multiplications you could start to turn it up a notch by increasing the digits on the first number (multiplicand) and also introduce the rounding.\n\nIf the user is in higher grades and has basic multiplication facts squared away, he or she could start with multiple digits on the second number (multiplier) and you will be presented with the worksheet that will allow you to do multiline multiplications (see the screen shot below).\n\nPractice, Practice, Practice\n\nIsn’t that we have heard so many times about Math? Should I really have to carry my workbooks everywhere, isn’t it really so cumbersome to do your workbooks when you are in the car with your parents. With the fabulous technology in your hand you have this fabulous application that I am confident will provide you the tool that you are looking for to improve your grades and become more confident.\n\nFinally\n\nAs you can see this application doesn’t become obsolete after just one grade, it is something that you really want to keep with you for quite many years.\nI am very confident that this tool will prove to be a tool that will truly help you learning multiplications and give you the edge that you are looking for in your classroom.\n\n*****Testimonials*****\n\nThese are from my three testers for this application,\nMy 6 year old daughter says she has just moved to two digit level.\nI myself am having fun with four digit multiplication, what a great brain exercise. Didn’t know what the calculators and computers have done to my mathematical ability (grin).\nMy 14 year old, Dad this is so cool.."

Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text. This app never transmits data from your device.\n\n\nNote: Non-English localizations focus on solar system objects and constellation names."

      "label": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training. It is yet another beautifully designed and easy-to-use app for kids“ by lilmagoolie.com"

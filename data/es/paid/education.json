Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside.

Fun for kids and adults alike and plenty of challenges at all levels.\n\n*Dinosaur Chess  by Mls968\nThis is a great program. The lessons are interesting, and play levels go from easy to difficult. My 4 and 6 year olds are learning the game, and it's helping novice players like my wife and I too. Highly recommended to anyone who wants to introduce their children to chess!\n\n*An excellent app   by Adg6\nA wonderful app. Ideal for anyone new to chess. It is even fun for experienced chess players.\n\n*Highly Recommended - by doled \n\"This is a fantastic chess teaching game. This game alone makes it worth buying an iPad. My three year old now knows the piece names and basic moves. My six year old is well on her way to playing a full game. Our family has had an iPad since the day the iPad was released and this is one of the best apps we have.\"\n\n*Great! - by TonySchleizer\n\"This game has gotten my 5 year old interested in chess. Great tutorials that get progressively harder as skills improve.\"\n\n\n* Great for getting started - by Milfordthelargebonedgorilla\n\"This has been fantastic for my five year old son...using this in addition to a real board and pieces has helped him immensely in understanding each of the pieces, how they move, their strengths and weaknesses...a terrific way to introduce young ones to the game without overwhelming them\"\n\n\n* Great learning tool - by Triplescoop \n\"I have an adopted 7 year old boy with fetal alcohol syndrome. It is very hard for him to learn to play games. Checkers was very hard for him to learn. I thought that chess would be something that he would have to wait to learn. I bought this app even though there were no reviews. So glad I did! What a great teaching tool! I love the mini games that teach the directions that each piece can move. We play slowly but my son can play chess! I recommend this for anyone who wants to learn the basics of the game. This app is for beginners. Great for kids! Thank you to the developers of this app!\"\n\n\n*Super! - by Chess player\n\"Hats off to the developers. A fun program for kids.\"\n\n\n*Ideal For kids - by Kingkot \n\"This game is ideal to teach the kids in the chess.\""

This app will turn your English text into its phonetic transcription using International Phonetic Alphabet.\n \nFeatures:\n \n- See phonetic transcription of the whole text, not just the dictionary forms of separate words.\n- Choose between British and American* pronunciation. When British dialect is selected the [r] sound at the end of the word is only voiced if followed by a vowel, which follows British phonetic convention.\n- International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) symbols used.\n- The structure of the text and sentences in it (line breaks, punctuation marks, etc.) is preserved in phonetic transcription output making it easier to read.\n- You can output the text and its phonetic transcription along each other line-by-line to make back-reference to the original text easier.\n- An option to vary pronunciation depending on whether words are in stressed or weak position in the sentence, as in connected speech.\n- In addition to commonly used vocabulary the database contains a very substantial amount of place names (including names of countries, their capitals, US states, UK counties), nationalities and popular names.\n- Where a word has a number of possible pronunciations (highlighted in blue in the output) you can select the one that agrees with the context by tapping on it.\n- Print out the output results, share via email or copy to pasteboard.\n- Let the built-in speech synthesiser read your text out loud. Control the playback and follow IPA transcription of the current word with a highlight.\n- Custom URL scheme to open toPhonetics from 3rd-party apps.\n\nGestures (IPA transcription screen):\n1. Single tap\n    - Tap a word to set the cursor to it and speak it (you can mute/un-mute it with the button at your bottom-right).\n    - Tap in a blank space to stop speech and hide the cursor.\n2. Double-tap\n    - Double-tap a word to open it in the built-in dictionary; if the word has multiple pronunciations you'll see the list of them first.\n    - Double-tap in a blank space to reset the font to the size set in iOS preferences.\n3. Pinch in or out to make the text smaller or larger.\n4. Start to slide horizontally to select a part of your text. The Speak button respects current selection.\n\n\n*) American transcriptions are based on the open Carnegie Mellon University Pronouncing Dictionary."

Your children can then use the coins to unlock other cute characters.\nA motivating math app that has your children solving hundreds of math tasks in just minutes. Efficient math practice for grade school!\n\nLearning principle: how children have fun learning math\nOur tests have shown children voluntarily solving hundreds of tasks in a short time. On paper, that would be almost impossible.\n\nThe game principle is easy to understand: For every correctly solved task, the player jumps one step up the stairs. If the answer is wrong, they jump down one level.\nEach task solved is rewarded with a coin. But some tasks offer bonuses.\nYour children can then use the coins to unlock other characters.\n\nThe direct feedback and the proven reward system motivates the children to keep solving tasks.\nOur goal with Fiete Math Climber is for children to do arithmetic voluntarily because it's fun and they can see their progress.\n\nBehind the scenes, the app analyzes the child's task-solving style and continuously adjusts the difficulty.\nBy gently increasing the challenge, their motivation increases and they gain self-confidence in solving math tasks.\n\nNevertheless, it is always up to the children to decide how difficult they want the tasks to be: they can skip tasks they find too difficult, simplify them, or even make them harder.\nThis freedom keeps their motivation high and ensures that your child will have fun with this math app for a long time.\n\nHelps parents and teachers to identify and resolve issues\nThe app continuously analyzes the child's arithmetic and reveals the child's skills and potential issues with certain tasks. \nThe analytics algorithm immediately identifies issues and creates targeted sets of tasks.\nThe perfect add-on for math class.\n\nThe task list shows parents and teachers what tasks the child has tackled. \nThis makes it possible to see how far the child's skills have come and why they have issues with certain tasks. It will also parents and teachers to help address these issues.\n\nUser management allows multiple students to use the app at the same time.Extensive statistics provide information on whether a child is really improving.\n\n\nFeatures\n- Contains all arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n- Number range adjustable from 1 to 1,000\n- Pre-configured exercise sets include: arithmetic up to 20, multiplication tables, carrying tens, etc.\n- suitable for children ages 5 to 10\n- targeted training possible\n- task definition is comprehensively adjustable\n- motivation through entertaining game structure with direct feedback\n- long-term motivation through the possibility of collecting figures \n- user management\n - multiple players possible\n- statistics show learning progress\n- display all tasks solved\n- skills analysis\n- identify skills and potential issues\n- secure\n- all data remains on the device\n\n\nSUPPORT INFORMATION\nWe do our best to test our apps on all devices.

There are over 1400 questions that cover the bones and their prominences as well as the muscles and all of their most commonly tested criteria. Each question on the muscles and bones are accompanied by a custom illustration. These illustrations are constructed in a unique way that exaggerates and simplifies their attachment points, placement, and functions making future recall easier for the user.\n\nThe bones are covered thoroughly in our tap/touch based questions. This includes the location and name each part/prominence of the bone as well as identifying the prominences that specific muscles attach to.\n\nEach muscle is covered in a highly detailed and accurate way. The criteria each muscle is tested on includes the most commonly tested questions in anatomy education: Fibre orientation(s), origin, insertion, cross-section, action, nerve innervation, and blood supply.\n\nThis app is perfect for quick review before a test by specific anatomic region or you can customize a test in our “Custom Random” mode. For causal review on the go or for summative tests (multiple regions and criteria) use our “Full Random Testing” mode to be rapidly quizzed on the entire Simple Lines Anatomy content at random.\n\nUse in-game statistics to monitor your accuracy and progress in each body region and testing type. Select “Weak Areas Occur More Frequently” to have questions you previously answered incorrectly show more often to strengthen your knowledge in that region."

      "label": "This guided meditation digital recording and book from New York Times best-selling authors Esther and Jerry Hicks explains  how \"getting into the vortex\" is essential for manifestation using the Law of Attraction. Gain an understanding of what the \"vortex of creation\" means and how you can use meditation to enter the vortex in order to allow the Law of Attraction to work for you. Also gain valuable insights about what happens to your affirmations and manifestation efforts when you are out of the vortex.  Five guided meditation audio sessions with music are included in this app.  \n\nListeners will be led by Abraham through four guided meditation sessions on these topics: General Well-Being, Financial Abundance, Physical Well-Being and Relationships.   Each guided meditation experience is 15 minutes long.   \n\nThis Vortex of Attraction Guided Meditation iPhone App is an exact duplicate of the physical product and includes the complete written text, and the complete audio recording along with an extra bonus track of guided meditation music which was not included with the original product.\n\nMany people exert manifestation and Law of Attraction efforts outside of the Vortex, and then conclude that the Law of Attraction \"doesn't work.\" Find out how to stop efforting and start allowing the Vortex of Creation to align you with the life you desire.  These are the first guided meditation recordings ever produced containing the Teachings of Abraham."

      "label": "Team Shake provides a technological and environmentally friendly way to choose teams for board games, sporting events, tournaments, school projects or anytime groups are required. The newest release brings many new features including full iPad support, balancing teams based on skill or gender, importing users from a file, enabling video output, and sharing teams via facebook or email. \n\nTeam Shake is the premier iOS App for creating teams. Instead of a hat and scraps of paper, the user enters his friends' names in his iPhone and gives it a shake. The screen will then display a random set of color-coded teams. These teams can immediately be used for game play or shared via facebook or email.   The quick and easy selection of random (or balanced) teams eliminates fighting over who will be on which team. Innovative use of the iPhone shake gesture gives users the satisfying feeling of shaking a virtual hat without the trouble of carrying around an actual hat. Conventional buttons can also be used for those who would rather not shake their expensive hardware about.  \n\nThe app is designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind. Names can easily be entered with the onscreen keyboard, chosen from the user's contacts, or imported from a file. The email and facebook functions document the members of each individual team as well as preserving the team number and color assigned by the app. For repeated use of Team Shake, lists of friends can be easily saved and loaded later. The current list is also automatically saved so that if you exit the app, or even reboot the device, changes will not be lost. For teachers and others with large lists of people, Team Shake supports the ability to import teams from text or csv files.\n\nIf you have any problems, feature requests, or comments please send an email to support@rhine-o.com. \n\nFeatures:\n\n* Create 1 to 64 random teams\n* Create completely random or balanced teams\n* Full iPad support\n* Eliminates fighting over choosing teams\n* Share / Save teams via email or Facebook\n* Teams can be chosen by the number of teams or by the size of teams.\n* Save lists of friends for later games\n* Import lists from email or spreadsheet\n* Export lists and options for use on another device\n* Satisfying feeling of shaking a “virtual” hat to create teams\n* Animated shaking hat\n* Entry of names via onscreen keyboard\n* Entry of names via iPhone contacts\n* Temporarily disable people who are absent\n* Set groups of people to always be on the same team\n* Set groups of people to always be on different teams\n* Set user strength to make more even teams (now supports fully balanced teams)\n* 5 users strengths level\n* Pick a single random person from the list of players\n* User strength indicator on the main screen (can be disabled in options)\n* Number of active players and total players is now displayed on the main screen\n* Video Out Support\n* Option to Sort Teams by Name\n* Option to balance male / female team members\n* \"Equal Ability\" option to create teams where all players have the same strength\n* Option to create separate male and female teams\n* Configurable Team Colors\n* Configurable Team Names\n* Print Support\n* Export Teams in CSV or XLS Format\n* Team Shake now supports simultaneously assigning players to multiple subteams and / or oppose teams at the same time.\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now have customized names to make selection easier\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now be enabled or disabled globally so that teams can be made quickly without subteams / oppose teams.  In particular, Balance Teams Strengths will work when separate Male / Female teams are created.\n\nYappler-Tags: Teams, Groups, Random, Hat, Entertainment, Games, Utilities"

Your baby may say their first word from as early as 4 to 6 months, and by the time they’re 18 months, they may even be able to string a simple sentence of two or three words.\n\nResearch has shown that taking a couple of minutes a day to read or play with your baby, encouraging them to repeat some words, will dramatically increase their language skills, as well as strengthen your emotional bonds.\n\n\nMy First Words is an attractive puzzle for children +1 years old, developed to teach them how to say the name of common objects that surround them.\n\nThe game includes 14 boards with different themes containing more than 120 words of their environment to learn. It also includes some advanced words to encourage the development of the children who are already speaking.\n\n\nThis game has been specifically designed to improve the following areas:\n\n- Hand-eye coordination\n- Concentration\n- Classification of objects\n- Visual perception\n- Vocabulary\n\nMy First Words features voices in Spanish, Portuguese and English, so if your baby has already learned all the words, encourage him or her to learn languages!\n\n\nPlayToddlers’ games encompass different areas of toddler’s personal growth, and have been specifically designed to be used by babies, with a simple and attractive interface that allows them to use the application by themselves, improving their development and self-esteem."

Because Solar Walk knows what time it is, the planets are in proper orientation to the Sun: Earth is dark where it is currently night and gradually lightens to daytime on the other side.” - NY Times\n\n\"It's great for showing my students the relative positions of the planets in the solar system, the satellites orbiting the Earth and our place in the galaxy. Awesome with a smartboard as well.\" - by jbrown61\n\nSolar Walk enables you to:\n\n► Observe 3D model of our Solar system with all its objects in real time and in a ​proper orientation.

Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text. This app never transmits data from your device.\n\n\nNote: Non-English localizations focus on solar system objects and constellation names."

      "label": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training. It is yet another beautifully designed and easy-to-use app for kids“ by lilmagoolie.com"

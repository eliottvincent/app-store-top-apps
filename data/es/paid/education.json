      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Destinada a cualquier alumno, docente, investigador o analista de datos que necesite relacionar variables (realizar pruebas de contraste de hipótesis, pruebas bivariantes de relación). La app guía en el proceso de decisión, de realización y de interpretación, de forma muy simple e intuitiva.\n\nPrimero le solicitará que marque las variables que pretende relacionar entre sí, su tipología (categórica de dos categorías o de más, o bien numérica o métrica –cuantitativa), una vez introducida la combinación, la app le hará algunas preguntas tipo filtro, para determinar las condiciones de aplicación, según tipo de prueba, en relación al supuesto seguimiento de ley normal por parte de las distribuciones o variables métricas en juego, o sobre el número de casos esperados en un procedimiento de relación entre categóricas –Chi cuadrado. En algún caso, la app le preguntará por el tipo de diseño de las variables para seguir determinando, con precisión y exactitud, el tipo de prueba adecuada para efectuar la relación solicitada. Una vez aplicados todos los filtros, los cuales puede ir pasando el usuario por defecto, marcando la situación más habitual o esperada en caso de que desconozca los supuestos de aplicación, la app indicará la prueba o procedimiento estadístico a aplicar para ver la posible asociación (relación) entre las variables.  Las pruebas que le propondrá cuando se cumplan las condiciones de aplicación son las siguientes: Chi cuadrado, t-test medidas independientes, t-test medidas relacionadas, anova, correlación… En este caso estamos ante pruebas paramétricas –cuando la variable métrica sigue ley normal, o bien lo suponemos. En el supuesto que no sea así, cuando la variable métrica en juego no siga la ley normal –caso de pruebas no paramétricas- la app le propondrá las siguientes pruebas: U de Mann Whitney, T de Wilcoxon, prueba de kruskal Wallis, correlación de Spearman. \n\nLa app no solamente propone la prueba a efectuar, sino que también le permite ver un breve vídeo donde se explica cómo se realiza el procedimiento estadístico y cómo se interpreta, realizado con el paquete estadístico IBM-SPSS. Los vídeos duran entre uno y dos minutos."

      "label": "Team Shake provides a technological and environmentally friendly way to choose teams for board games, sporting events, tournaments, school projects or anytime groups are required. The newest release brings many new features including full iPad support, balancing teams based on skill or gender, importing users from a file, enabling video output, and sharing teams via facebook or email. \n\nTeam Shake is the premier iOS App for creating teams. Instead of a hat and scraps of paper, the user enters his friends' names in his iPhone and gives it a shake. The screen will then display a random set of color-coded teams. These teams can immediately be used for game play or shared via facebook or email.   The quick and easy selection of random (or balanced) teams eliminates fighting over who will be on which team. Innovative use of the iPhone shake gesture gives users the satisfying feeling of shaking a virtual hat without the trouble of carrying around an actual hat. Conventional buttons can also be used for those who would rather not shake their expensive hardware about.  \n\nThe app is designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind. Names can easily be entered with the onscreen keyboard, chosen from the user's contacts, or imported from a file. The email and facebook functions document the members of each individual team as well as preserving the team number and color assigned by the app. For repeated use of Team Shake, lists of friends can be easily saved and loaded later. The current list is also automatically saved so that if you exit the app, or even reboot the device, changes will not be lost. For teachers and others with large lists of people, Team Shake supports the ability to import teams from text or csv files.\n\nIf you have any problems, feature requests, or comments please send an email to support@rhine-o.com. \n\nFeatures:\n\n* Create 1 to 64 random teams\n* Create completely random or balanced teams\n* Full iPad support\n* Eliminates fighting over choosing teams\n* Share / Save teams via email or Facebook\n* Teams can be chosen by the number of teams or by the size of teams.\n* Save lists of friends for later games\n* Import lists from email or spreadsheet\n* Export lists and options for use on another device\n* Satisfying feeling of shaking a “virtual” hat to create teams\n* Animated shaking hat\n* Entry of names via onscreen keyboard\n* Entry of names via iPhone contacts\n* Temporarily disable people who are absent\n* Set groups of people to always be on the same team\n* Set groups of people to always be on different teams\n* Set user strength to make more even teams (now supports fully balanced teams)\n* 5 users strengths level\n* Pick a single random person from the list of players\n* User strength indicator on the main screen (can be disabled in options)\n* Number of active players and total players is now displayed on the main screen\n* Video Out Support\n* Option to Sort Teams by Name\n* Option to balance male / female team members\n* \"Equal Ability\" option to create teams where all players have the same strength\n* Option to create separate male and female teams\n* Configurable Team Colors\n* Configurable Team Names\n* Print Support\n* Export Teams in CSV or XLS Format\n* Team Shake now supports simultaneously assigning players to multiple subteams and / or oppose teams at the same time.\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now have customized names to make selection easier\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now be enabled or disabled globally so that teams can be made quickly without subteams / oppose teams.  In particular, Balance Teams Strengths will work when separate Male / Female teams are created.\n\nYappler-Tags: Teams, Groups, Random, Hat, Entertainment, Games, Utilities"

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

      "label": "Learn Russian Just By Reading\n\nStories have manually added word for word translation so the meaning of the text is always and immediately available. This teaches you the more common words fast and easy. The App includes integrated practice for more difficult words. Get new stories and audio for free with updates to this App!\n\nMethod: \n\nOur App is based on three elements to expand your mastery of the language fast and easy. Association by story, immediate availability of meaning and memorizing efficiency. Use the following method to attain new vocabulary fast:\n\n1. Read the stories and re-read them until you know most of the words: \n\nThis is a fast process because there's no lookup time with the unique word-for-word literal plus idiomatic translations, and most words or their root forms occur more than once, so you'll start recognizing them already after the first read.\n\nIf looking at (yes, not up) our word-for-word translation costs one second, and looking up a word in a dictionary costs a minute, it means our method is 60 times faster.\n\n2. Then focus on the remaining words that you still don't know by adding them to your wordlist: \n\nThe spaced repetition practice in the My Words section, and the direct links to the words on the pages support memorization of the more difficult words.\n\nWhere a google or dictionary translation might be 50% off track where it concerns the correct meaning in context and conjugation of low frequency words, the manually added literal word-for-word translation is 100% correct.\n\nThis means that on top of being much faster, you're memorizing two times more efficiently than with any other method.\n\nWho Are We: \n\nA terrific and enthousiastic team, dedicated to bringing you as much word for word literal plus idiomatically translated text, in as many languages as possible, in the coming years. Look out for updates on this piece of software with more functionality and more stories.\n\nTranslating word for word literally, and including idiomatically where necessary, is hard, painstaking work. However, to us, this project and the method we advocate mean that we can turn a language that is opaque to a beginner or even an advanced student into clear and easy learning material.\n\nSupport this project by buying the App, and more material will follow!"

Flexibility is key, with adjustable play modes and difficulty levels to build confidence and offer exciting challenges for children of varying ages. \n\nFeatures:\n- Child-friendly interface with no complicated menus\n- More than 170 objects to play and new words to learn\n- 11 categories: toys, vehicles, animals, food, kitchen, living room, flags, ocean creatures,    shapes, alphabet and numbers. \n- Clear and pleasant voice guide spoken by native speakers\n- Available in 14 languages: English, French, Spanish, Japanese, German, Swedish, Russian, Dutch, Portuguese, Norwegian, Danish, Korean, Chinese and Italian.\n- Adjustable game modes to suit different age groups\n- Multiple difficulty levels\n- Personal best scoring system\n- Beautifully illustrated original cartoons\n- Cheery background music track that can be easily switched on or off\n- For iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad\n\nDid you know that our brain contains billions of neurons and that each neuron is responsible for storing a different piece of information? Only a couple of thousands of these are used by most people. Memory games are a fantastic way for kids to develop important skills and have heaps of fun along the way!\n\nParents have the choice between two play modes designed to cater to the different needs of toddlers and preschool children. In ‘Baby Mode’, the cards stay upturned throughout the entire game. Players only need to match the same objects, after which the object’s name will be spelled out and read aloud. ‘Normal Mode’ works like any ordinary memory game, but with added features to help and to guide. \n\nBoth modes allow you to choose between multiple levels - from easy-peasy 2X2 small board all the way up to 7X4 giant board on iPad! Saved scores means no efforts are ever wasted and motivates players to beat their personal best. \n\nTip for the parents: You can limit the amount of time cards are displayed at the beginning of each game in the settings menu. \n\n--------------\n\nConnect with us!\n\nVisit us: http://www.GiggleUp.com\nLike us: facebook.com/GiggleUpApps\nFollow us: twitter.com/GiggleUpApps\nEmail us: Support@GiggleUp.com\n\nBrought to you by GiggleUp, creators of the award-winning Interactive Telling Time and other educational apps for kids.

      "label": "Do you want to learn a foreign language quickly? A unique program for memorizing words will help you to do it. \nThe main success of learning a foreign language consists in the most rapid vocabulary replenishment: you should repeat words time and again. For this purpose people often use the notepads, what is not always convenient.\n\nNew app \"My Dictionary: polyglot\" combines several functions and advantages:\n• 90 kinds of dictionaries (English, German, French, Spanish, etc.);\n• 8 types of training: word search, writing the words, searching for a translation, comparison of the studied words and its translation;\n• Automatic translation of an adding word;\n• Evaluation of learning the words;\n• Completely learned words can be hidden or deleted from the main list of study;\n• Short statistics, that shows the dynamics of learning;\n• Pronunciation of a word;\n• Quick search of words and translations in the dictionary;\n• Tags for words, search by tags, training by tags;\n• Transcription for words and usage examples;\n• Image editor for words;\n\nThis app allows you to expand your vocabulary fast enough. Its main advantage is the availability of 8 different trainings for learning. 90 kinds of dictionaries include the most popular world languages, such as English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Portuguese. As a result, it is possible to learn sequentially or simultaneously speaking several languages.\n\nThe app provides a unique opportunity to learn multiple words per day and it is the fastest way to learn the language because vocabulary is the basis of a quick study. The more new words you learn, the better you will understand your interlocutor, and the easier you will communicate with him. Of course, the grammar is also necessary, but we recommend to learn it after learning vocabulary, at least the basic words. Otherwise learning a foreign language will be much harder, longer and more boring.\n\nThis app will be especially useful for those who read foreign literature, visit foreign forums and sites. Finding a new unknown word in the text, the user can simply add it to his dictionary, see the translation, and then learn with the help of training. Usually without a dictionary people forget a new word soon, and seeing it again they have to look for it once more.\n\nDuring the app’s development the complexity of \"manual\" search of translation and the psychological aspects of learning of words, including the lack of free time, were taken into account. So: Having met in the text an unknown word, just go to the app, enter a new word in the dictionary and see the translation. If it’s necessary, add it to the list of studied words. During studying the program shows the level of mastering the words (in percent). When the word is learned, it is enough to tick \"Studied\" on the appropriate word and it ceases to appear in training. Learned words do not appear in the list for training, but remain in the dictionary that allows you to find them quickly when it’s needed. Thus, the application “My Dictionary: polyglot” is an invaluable aid in learning a foreign language.\n\nSupported dictionaries in the application: Russian, English, Albanian, Arabic, Armenian, Azerbaijan, Afrikaans, Basque, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Bosnian, Welsh, Vietnamese, Hungarian, Haitian (Creole), Galician, Dutch, Greek, Georgian, Danish, Yiddish, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Icelandic, Spanish, Kazakh, Catalan, Kyrgyz, Chinese, Korean, Latin, Latvian, Lithuanian, Malagasy, Malay, Maltese, Macedonian, Mongolian, German, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Serbian, Slovakian, Slovenian, Swahili, Tajik, Thai, Tagalog, Tatar, Turkish, Uzbek, Ukrainian, Finish, French, Croatian, Czech, Swedish, Estonian, Japanese."

We'll help you understand what is happening to you, to learn about your emotions and to get to know yourself.\r\n\r\nIt is very important to exercise emotional intelligence from a very early age, to acquire the skills that help us to know ourselves and to manage emotions and complicated situations. That is why we've created this app. A self-knowledge app; but, above all, an app to become aware of emotions and learn to identify and manage them.\r\n\r\nWith simple explanations, mini-games and activities.\r\n\r\nAn app that helps children manage and express their emotions, and that provides tools and activities to help us relax when certain emotions take over. All of this thanks to mindfulness: exercises and techniques to relax and calm down, to be well with oneself and prevent certain situations from overtaking us.\r\n\r\nAn app that allows you to create your own avatar, become the protagonist and explain your own story. \r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n\r\n• Discover the main emotions.\r\n• Create your avatar.\r\n• Practice mindfulness and feel calm.\r\n• Tell your own story.\r\n• Express yourself through drawings, photos, voice...\r\n• Paint mandalas while you relax.\r\n• Free play, with no rules or stress.\r\n• No ads.\r\n• No in-app purchases or hidden extras.\r\n\nABOUT LEARNY LAND\n\nAt Learny Land, we love to play, and we believe that games must form part of the educational and growth stage of all children; because to play is to discover, explore, learn and have fun. Our educational games help children learn about the world around them and are designed with love. They are easy to use, beautiful and safe. Because boys and girls have always played to have fun and learn, the games we make - like the toys that last a lifetime - can be seen, played and heard.\nAt Learny Land we take advantage of the most innovative technologies and the most modern devices to take the experience of learning and playing a step further. We create toys that could not have existed when we were young.\nRead more about us at www.learnyland.com.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWe take Privacy very seriously. We do not collect or share personal information about your children or allow any type of third party ads.

TeacherTool was developed in practical use for practical applications and has been setting unrivaled standards in terms of data security, functional scope, ease-of-use and support since 2009. TeacherTool will revolutionize the way your student administration by making it more effective, easier to navigate and more customized. TeacherTool puts all of your key student information right at your fingertips so that it can be instantly accessed and edited. By assigning your own password and using powerful data encryption tools, you will also be able to protect the data against unauthorized access.\n\nIf, for instance, a student inquires about his or her grade status, you will be able to spontaneously review with the student, criterion by criterion, his or her performance development based on compelling graphics.  \n\nIf a proposed grade is not in compliance with your pedagogic standards, you can make individual adjustments to the grade computation process at your discretion!\n\nDo you prefer to use symbols to grade your students’ work? - TeacherTool also has the capability to use symbolic grading systems (including Emojis for your youngest pupils!) The solution can readily convert conventional grades into symbols and vice versa – no adjustments required. \n\nIf a student provides an excuse for an absence, you will be able to see when the student was absent in TeacherTool right away. Simply click on the identified time frame to excuse the absence. \n\nIf you have to grade a test, all you have to do is define the number of points for each individual question and TeacherTool will automatically convert them for you. You can even use this tool for other types of assessments, e.g. in physical education. \n\nIf you want to create a tally sheet for homework, you will find it convenient that  TeacherTool treats all types of remarks/comments as tally sheets and that homework is just one of many possible applications.  \n\nYou may also want to record data during lessons in the classroom. Handling this task is one of the special capabilities of the TeacherTool! It knows your class schedule and is very versatile when it comes to making updates: it proposes times of absence to be logged, automatically calculates late arrivals, generates entries into the register and handles lots of other tasks. \n\nDo you have to plan and document lessons?

      "label": "Updated to continue to be the WORLD'S GREATEST BITS OF INTELLIGENCE APP FOR KIDS!\n\nSmartBits is an Educational Stimulation App designed for children between 4 months and 6 years old based on the Doman Method Program of Encyclopedic Knowledge.\n\nIt uses \"BITS OF INTELLIGENCE\" or \"Information Cards\", which are units of information in the form of precise, specific, clear, and innovative images for children. Each one shows a single element. BITS or Information Cards are categorized into groups according to subject. \n\nSmartBits helps children to:\n• Advance language skills.\n• Learn new vocabulary.\n• Develop visual and auditory capabilities.\n• Improve attention and concentration.\n\nSmartBits is a STIMULATION METHOD organized into sessions. The BITS are taught in full screen mode (visual stimulus) accompanied by an audio recording of the name of the element displayed (auditory stimulus).\n\n\nMODES OF OPERATION:\n\n• AUTOMATIC MODE. The image cards change automatically every 1.5 seconds. SmartBits adds new cards from time to time, removing the oldest from the relevant group. Once it has been displayed a sufficient number of times, the entire group is withdrawn. Adults should only be concerned with adding groups of cards to sessions when asked to do so by SmartBits.\n\n• MANUAL MODE. The adult or child work manually through the BITS from the chosen group. In this mode, the cards can be used without automatic audio reproduction to improve the child's verbal skill with the aid of an adult.\n\n• LOOP MODE. This displays all the cards from all available categories in one on-going session.\n\n\nFEATURES:\n\n• Creation of multiple users, so several children can use the program independently.\n• Option to create two user profiles, one in each language, so a single child can use the program in both languages.\n• Option to show or hide text shown in all modes of operation to encourage reading.\n• User’s guide.\n• Settings panel for SmartBits users.\n• AUDIO RECORDING module to replace the card audio with new recordings in your own voice and/or recordings in another language. This module can be purchased from SmartBits.\n• Child protection feature to prevent access to the internet.\n• Suitable for children with special educational needs.\n\n\nCONTENTS:\n\nLibrary of information cards consisting of a total of 265 high-resolution images organized in 16 groups:\n\n• Mammals 1: 23 cards\n• Amphibians and Reptiles: 20\n• Fruits 1: 14\n• Vegetables 1: 15\n• Music Notes: 15\n• Wind Instruments: 13\n• Maths 1: 20\n• Maths 2: 20\n• Human Body Organs: 11\n• Parts of the Universe: 16\n• Monuments 1: 17\n• Roman Civilization: 18\n• American Countries: 15\n• European Countries: 12\n• Flags of European Countries: 23\n• Flags of Asian Countries: 13\n\n\nThe library can be extended up to 991 cards by purchasing additional cards from the application itself:\n\nCard Set #3: 127 cards\n• String Instruments: 12\n• Insects: 18\n• Portraits of Artists 1: 11\n• Transport: 19\n• Flowers: 16\n• Landforms: 16\n• Vegetables 2: 15\n• Maths 3: 20\n\nCard Set #4: 140 cards\n• Percussion Instruments: 13\n• Birds: 17\n• Tools 1: 17\n• Minerals: 19\n• Aromatic Herbs: 17\n• Fruits 2: 17\n• Maths 4: 20\n• Maths 5: 20\n\nCard Set #5: 118 cards\n• Toys 1: 13\n• Kitchen Utensils 1: 14\n• Mammals 2: 12\n• Parts of the Human Body: 16\n• School Supplies 1: 11\n• Monuments 2: 16\n• Colors: 12\n• Traffic Signs 1: 13\n• Home Furniture 2: 11\n\nCard Set #6: 110 cards\n• Food 1: 16\n• Home Appliances: 17\n• Clothes 1: 13\n• Toys 2: 14\n• Balls: 14\n• Portraits of Artists 2: 11\n• Actions 1: 11\n• Trees: 14\n\nCard Set #7: 118 cards\n• Toiletries: 14\n• Jobs: 19\n• Tools 2: 15\n• Dried Fruits: 12\n• Kitchen Utensils 2: 14\n• Clothes 2: 13\n• Mammals 3: 14\n• Monuments 3: 17\n\nCard Set #8: 113 cards\n• Home Furniture 1: 11\n• Roads: 13\n• Street Furniture: 12\n• Food 2: 16\n• Toys 3: 14\n• Portraits of Artists 3: 11\n• Schools Supplies 2: 11\n• Actions 2: 12\n• Traffic Signs 2: 13\n\n\nCONTACT:\nwww.smartbitsapp.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/smartbitsapp\nEmail: info@smartbitsapp.com"

You can also use it as a TED viewer through the video function with the subtitles activated. \n\nThe notable feature is that a huge number of TED lectures are constantly added, which means an unlimited amount of available learning materials for you. \nTEDICT allows you to download as many TED lectures as you want, so you’ll always get new learning materials. \n\nThe World’s Best Intellectual Archive, TED \nHigh-level TED speeches \nThis program even features various kinds of English pronunciations from all over the world. \n\nUse TEDICT to listen to cool ideas from TED and improve your English skills!\n\n\n* More Information -> \nhttp://cocoswing.com/tedict/\n\n\nTED does not endorse or sponsor this app in any way.

Anyone can use it, but it is designed around ABRSM’s aural tests for Grades 6 to 8. The app can be used in any order, however often you like, on your own or with your teacher. \n\nUse ABRSM Aural Trainer to:\n• Exercise your musical memory (remember how music sounds and be able to repeat it).\n• Develop your confidence and accuracy at sight-singing (reading and singing the music you see).\n• Improve your recognition of cadences, chords and modulations. \n• Learn to describe texture, structure, dynamics, articulation, tempo and tonality.\n• Practise identifying the features in music that make-up its style and character.\n• Develop the skills to know when a piece of music was written.\n\nThe app covers the following ABRSM aural test content:\n• Melodic Repetition\n• Sight-singing\n• Cadences\n• Chords\n• Modulations\n• Musical Features\n• Rhythmic Repetition\n• Metre\n\nAll exercises are fully interactive. Each one gives you the opportunity to repeat the question, or to compare your response to the correct answer and hear the music again . The app also features supporting tools including a cadence trainer, progress tracker and guides to the aural tests in ABRSM graded music exams.\n\nMany exercises are automatically marked by the application. Self-review and critical listening are also key to successful development of the musical ear, which is why the app provides tools for you to review and evaluate your performance against sample responses in all cases. Your progress is logged whenever you use the app, so you can always see at a glance the areas you might want to revisit."

Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

      "label": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training. It is yet another beautifully designed and easy-to-use app for kids“ by lilmagoolie.com"

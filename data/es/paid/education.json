      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "VOR Tracker is a small but powerful training tool for pilots. It is the only one of its kind for the iPhone & iPad, providing the real aircraft feel the other apps are missing!\n\nVOR Tracker is a real IFR simulation, so you will find no multiple choice questions or yet more methods which might or might not work for you. \n\nYou can actually practice IFR procedures in real time, using either a fixed card CDI, RMI, HSI, or EHSI, which provides additional information like wind, track, and groundspeed. \n\nPractice holding patterns, DME arcs, radial interceptions, and 2 needle tracking in real time. It is practice what it is all about! There is no need for explaining again and again what you already know from flight school. It is about applying your knowledge when the flight instruments start moving!\n\nWherever you are, IFR training is only two taps away!\n\nChose between a VOR and NDB and get used to the different characteristics. The NDB comes with atmospheric disturbances and an adjustable dip error to match the instrument you are used to.\n\nDon’t waste your time trying to imagine what you would do in the aircraft – just do it!\n\nVOR Tracker is designed for:\n\n- Student pilots who have the theoretical knowledge for flying IFR procedures, and want to save money by preparing for their pilot training.\n\n- Pilots who want to refresh their IFR navigation skills for an upcoming check ride.\n\n- Pilots going for an assessment. Holding patterns and radial interceptions are commonly used during sim assessments and can really spoil the day. Being prepared will make the difference!\n\n- People who have the knowledge of flying IFR procedures and want to give it a try.\n\n\nVOR Tracker is NOT:\n\n- a game.\n\n- a flight simulator, it focuses on navigation at a constant speed and altitude.\n\n- a flight training course teaching you how to fly IFR procedures.\n\n\nStill interested? Read on to find out how VOR Tracker will boost your skills in no time!\n\n- Choose between a fixed card CDI, RMI, HSI, or EHSI.\n\n- Use the instruments like you would do in the real aircraft.\n\n- Use the map mode to verify your progress.\n\n- Lost? Use the help function to display the holding pattern entries in the map mode.\n\n- Things are going a bit too fast? Use the freeze mode to orientate.\n\n- Getting bored in straight flight? Use the fast mode.\n\n- You want to start over or change the aircraft’s position or heading? Just drag & drop, or twist the aircraft symbol.\n\n- Practice a particular holding pattern or radial interception exercise over and over again from new, random starting positions using the reposition button.\n\n- Start with no wind and increase the difficulty later on by adding wind.\n\n- To add more realism, the wind can be selected to be gusty and/or variable in direction.\n\n- Getting settled? Why not increase the aircraft’s speed in the settings menu?\n\n- Customize your own missions and adjust the wind the way you want.\n\n- Use the hidden wind function to add a realistic challenge.\n\n- Analyze your progress in the map mode. Rewind and start over. The previous track lines will still be displayed for you to see the difference.\n\nPrepare yourself without wasting expensive flight time – use VOR Tracker to brush up your IFR skills!\n\nVOR Tracker is the most efficient trainer for holding patterns and radial interceptions available on the App Store.\n\nSupporting you during your IFR training, it will pay for itself in no time. Take that as a promise!"

Everything will arrive in the selected location so you can begin your next adventure!\n\nCREATE AN ORIGINAL VIDEO OF YOUR STORY\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice as you’re telling the story, along with your characters’ movements. Create videos up two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share later!\n\nFEATURES:\n- Explore four locations: stable, arena, forest and shop.\n- Create stories for 24 new characters plus horses and other animals!\n- Care for your horses: feed them, lather them up till they're nice and clean, brush them. \n- Choose outfits from your favorite themes: medieval, western, everyday stable life and fantasy!\n- Hop on to ride bikes in the forest and race motorcycles in the arena!\n- Set up obstacles and show off your horse's jumping skills!\n- Eat at the food court and use the portable potties!\n- Have a campout! \n- Snuggle into your sleeping bag to stay warm under the stars! \n- Take a canoe ride or swim by a waterfall.\n- Make music with magical lily pads!\n- Move horses, characters and objects from here to there in the horse transport! \n- Record your stories in the app and share with your friends!\n- No time limit or high scores — play for as long as you like!\n- No third-party advertising\n\nWE LISTEN\nOne of our top requests for the Toca Life series has been horses!

Our educational games help children learn about the world around them and are designed with love. They are easy to use, beautiful and safe. Because boys and girls have always played to have fun and learn, the games we make - like the toys that last a lifetime - can be seen, played and heard.\nAt Learny Land we take advantage of the most innovative technologies and the most modern devices to take the experience of learning and playing a step further. We create toys that could not have existed when we were young.\nRead more about us at www.learnyland.com.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWe take Privacy very seriously.

      "label": "The EduCalc Classic app, rewritten from the ground up:\n\n-- All screens have portrait and landscape\n-- Polynomial solver up to 10th degree\n-- Wide range of settings for font sizes and graph line widths\n-- Updates to this version will be more frequent, going forward\n-- Matrix calculator more intuitive and is integrated with main calculator screen\n-- Table has an \"ask\" mode where you enter input values and it gives you the outputs.\n-- Please report bugs to the email address inside the app\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n1)  Scientific Calculator.  A lot of thought has gone into the design of the keyboard, which gives you everything you need while keeping the keys as large as possible.  Available functions include the following:\n\n• the usual arithmetic functions and exponentiation.\n• square root, cube root, nth root, natural log, log base 10, log of arbitrary base, absolute value, factorial, permutations (nPr), combinations (nCr), modulus, random integer, bell curve, cumulative normal distribution.\n• Define and name your own constants\n• Summations\n• Complex numbers!\n• Sig figs (enable under settings)\n• Programmable keys (enable under settings)\n\n2)  Graphing.  Capabilities:\n• Graph up to nine equations at once.\n• Graphs are labeled.\n• You can drag the graph or pinch to zoom in or out.\n• Calculator can find roots and intersections.\n• Can graph in polar coordinates.\n• Can graph parametric equations.\n• Can graph parametric equations.\n• Can graph implicit functions, such as x^2+y^2-4=0.  Most calculator apps can't do this!\n\n3)  Vector and Matrix calculator.  Vector dot and cross products.  Multiply and add matrices.  Determinant, transpose, Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors.  \n\n4)  It can make a table of the values of any function you care to enter.  You can choose the starting x value of the table, as well as how much x increases for each successive row.\n\n5) Triangle solver.  Enter three sides, two sides and an angle, or two angles and a side, and the solver calculates the rest.\n\n6) Polynomial solvers.  Find the roots of a polynomial, up to 10th degree.\n\n7)  System of linear equations solver.\n\n8)  The  reference hits the high points of the following subjects:\nalgebra, calculus, geometry, trigonometry, vectors, vector calculus, and classical mechanics.  So if you need a reminder of a trig identity . . . or the quadratic formula . . . or the chain rule from calculus . . . and so on, it's right there for you.\n\n9)  A unit converter.  Your data are in meters, and you need an answer in feet?  No problem!  With a tap, you can enter the result of your conversion into the calculator.  Currently converts different units of the following: acceleration, angle, area, density, distance, energy, force, mass, power, pressure, speed, temperature, time, and volume.  Great for physics problem sets!  You can also define your own units.\n\n10)  Constants for scientific calculations -- speed of light, strength of gravity at Earth's surface, etc. etc. etc.  Tapping on a constant will insert it into your calculation -- i.e, you don't have to key in the value.  Again, great for physics problem sets!\n\n11)  Statistics mode, including options for scatter plots and for regression lines.\n\n12)  Works on both iPhone and iPad.\n\n13)  Derivatives! (Answer simplification is limited.)\n\n\nI'd love to learn about your comments or suggestions.  You can write me at the email address on the settings screen of the app. Thanks!"

Answer as many questions as possible in minute-long games, or you can now practice without the pressure of a countdown timer - a feature which is new for 2019. Questions are randomly generated which means it is very replayable. The game has been carefully designed for children, with large, widely spaced buttons. We recommend that young children play on a tablet.\n\nSix main topics are covered: \n\n* Times tables - up to 10 or 12 \n* Division - up to 10 or 12\n* Square numbers\n* Number bonds\n* Doubling \n* Halving\n\nBetween these topics, the four standard arithmetic operations are covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nYou can create up to 30 player profiles per device to track an individual's high scores (increased from 15 in 2019). If you prefer there's also the option to play as a guest. All data is stored locally on your device so you don't have to worry about privacy issues. We've also made it very easy for children to quickly switch between profiles after playing a game, if they're sharing a device.\n\nAfter each game, the score achieved is displayed along with the child's high score. Bronze, silver or gold stars and trophies are awarded depending on the score achieved in each game."

      "label": "Everybody likes a visual reinforcement system. Using this app, you can let someone know what he’s working for, how much work he needs to do, and how close he is to earning a reward for that work. You can use this for lessons in school, chores at home, getting your children to eat their vegetables, and much more! Start the app by selecting the number of tokens (1-5) your student must earn. Then set up your student's reinforcer choice board by selecting 1-6 items from our pre-loaded symbol library or your own photo library. To delete a picture from the teacher choice screen just press down on an image for 5 seconds. Show the choice board to your student to select what to work for and then begin your lesson. Each time a student earns a token, slide a token to the empty dot. Once the student has earned all of his tokens, push the \"cash in\" button to show your student what he's earned! The token board resets to start the next deal or you can create a new choice board for your student to select a new reinforcer.\n\nThis app is now available in American English and Brazilian Portuguese. To enable Brazilian Portuguese please make sure your Apple device is set to use Portuguese as its main language via Settings->General->International.\n\nVisit www.pecs.com for more information on using visual reinforcement systems.\n\nFeature Summary\n•Select number of tokens for each deal (1-5)\n•Customize student choice board to include up to 6 images selected from preloaded images or images in your photo library\n•Bright token board to contrast with materials on student's desktop\n•Token board shows student what he's working for, how many tokens he needs, his progress in the deal.\n•Student \"cashes in\" at end of deal by pushing button. Earned item is highlighted and tokens return to start"

      "label": "Lección del día con alarma sonora programable y cronómetro cuenta atrás con aviso de finalización del ejercicio, descarga de audios para escuchar en línea o posteriormente sin conexión, lista de audios favoritos y búsqueda por palabras, salas de chat para compartir con otros estudiantes de Mente Uno, notificaciones instantáneas de nuevas publicaciones (audios, artículos, actividades, cursos, nuevo material de estudio, encuentros, avisos, recomendaciones, etc). Acceso en el panel privado a los audios de los grupos online y material de estudio.\n\nAUDIOS\nLos audios sobre Un Curso de Milagros (entrevistas, debates, clases online, sesiones de preguntas y respuestas, monográficos y narraciones) se pueden reproducir normalmente o descargar para ser escuchados en cualquier otro momento sin utilizar los datos de tu teléfono. Esto es especialmente útil para aquellos que han adquirido el material de estudio o para quienes suelen escuchar los audios cuando viajan en coche o en avión y no hay buena conexión a internet. Puedes marcar los que más te gusten y guardarlos en tu lista de favoritos. También te resultará fácil encontrar el audio que buscas escribiendo parte del título o la descripción que recuerdes. Si detienes el audio o cierras la aplicación, la reproducción comenzará en el punto en que lo dejaste. También puedes programar el reproductor para que se apague al cabo de un tiempo.\n\nLECCIÓN DEL DÍA\nElige la lección que estés practicando y programa la alarma para que te avise cada día. Esto se puede hacer mediante dos opciones:\n1. Alarma diaria: simplemente eliges la hora a la que quieres ser avisado. Puedes programar tantas alarmas como quieras durante una semana seleccionando el día.\n2. Intervalo: en algunas ocasiones el Libro de ejercicios te pide realizar la lección cada cierto tiempo, como por ejemplo cada hora. En ese caso puede ser más interesante esta opción. Selecciona la hora de inicio y la hora final a la que sonará la alarma, así como los intervalos en los que quieres ser avisado (puedes elegir desde 10 minutos hasta 8 horas de intervalo).\nOtra opción que te resultará útil es el cronómetro que se encuentra al final de cada lección. Puedes programarlo para que te avise desde un minuto hasta una hora, de forma que sólo tendrás que ocuparte de realizar correctamente la lección.\n\nSALAS DE CHAT (Disponibles próximamente)\nUna parte importante del estudio de Un Curso de Milagros es poder compartir con otros estudiantes lo que se está aprendiendo. Las salas de chat son un espacio de comunicación para los miembros del grupo online asociado a tu inscripción, en el que puedes intercambiar puntos de vista y perspectivas que enriquezcan el debate y el aprendizaje conjunto, creando así una comunidad que retroalimenta tanto el avance individual como grupal.\n\nPANEL PRIVADO\nAquí encontrarás la información relacionada con tu usuario: inscripciones y renovaciones, audios de las clases online y material de estudio.\n\nINCIDENCIAS Y SOLUCIÓN DE PROBLEMAS\nTipo de incidencia: los audios se detienen cuando se apaga la pantalla.\nSolución: cambiar los ajustes de ahorro de batería y/o los ajustes de ahorro de datos activos y permitir que la aplicación no sea ajustada.\n\n\nAVISO IMPORTANTE\nSe ha comprobado que en los modelos de iPhone que utilizan las versiones de software 13.3 y 13.4 los audios se detienen poco después de que la pantalla se apague, sin que el cambio de configuración de ahorro de batería o uso de datos indicados más arriba pueda evitarlo. Es posible que este error quede subsanado en posteriores actualizaciones del software por parte de Apple.\nEn el caso de que detectes alguna incidencia en el funcionamiento de la aplicación puedes volver a instalarla (no tiene coste adicional). Si persiste no dudes en contactar con nosotros en info@menteuno.com indicándonos la marca, modelo y versión de tu dispositivo y enviándonos una captura de pantalla con la descripción del problema.\n\nEsta app no contiene publicidad."

Play, observe, ask questions and find the answers. Explore how animals interact with each other, how they live, how they defend themselves and how they reproduce.\n\nLearn and get informed about the pollution of the oceans and its dangers. See how plastics, overfishing, climate change and ships affect the life and health of different ecosystems. We only have one planet — let's take care of it!\n\nWith five incredible ecosystems:\n\nSouth Pole\nDiscover the life of penguins, seals and orcas. Play with them! What do they eat and how do they live? How does climate change affect them?\n\nOctopuses\nFeed the sharks and learn how octopuses defend themselves and not be devoured. Try to protect the divers inside the shark cage!\n\nDolphins\nSee how the dolphins hunt, reproduce and come out to breathe. Play with them until it becomes night so they can go to sleep.

(Please set your iPhone to Ring mode to hear the audio playback.)\n・Fun illustrations help users to better retain the words studied. \n・Users can bookmark the words they like. The bookmarked words are compiled in the Bookmark list in \"List.\"\n\n◇ “Check” helps learners to track their mastery.\n・Users check their understanding of the vocabulary studied and sort the words into those mastered and those not yet retained.\n・The words already mastered are taken out of the study set, leaving behind just those that still need to be worked on.\n\n◇ “List” displays a list of all words covered by the app so that users can see their progress and review the vocabulary.\n・The list can be arranged in any of three orderings: lesson order, a-i-u-e-o order, and alphabetical order. The words bookmarked in the Study mode are also listed in the Bookmark list.\n・Checkmarks are automatically placed next to words that have been mastered.\n・The Study view of words can be displayed from the list entries, enabling quick review.\n\n\n○This app is based on the vocabulary from the third edition of GENKI.\n○Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

These Flashcards are the perfect accompaniment to Kyng & Kyren's Generational Wealth Building Activity Book and will teach your child everything that was mentioned, and more.\r\n\r\n*  Give your kids a head start in life, and help them be the best possible version of themselves. \n\r\nBy buying this app, you’re investing in your child’s future, and giving them a springboard from which they can be successful and prosper in this modern, but often complicated world.\r\n\n* So, what are you waiting for? It’s never too early or too late to become financially literate. Inspire your child today and get started on building the fundamental blocks of financial literacy by buying this app now! \n\r\nAS SEEN ON CNN, GOOD MORNING AMERICA, FOX BUSINESS, THE SHADE ROOM AND MORE....\r\n\nWhen Kyren Gibson became a dad he realized he needed to change his life, leave the streets behind him and build a legacy for his son, Kyng. Kyren began to research how to increase generational wealth. He focused on nurturing his son and teaching him that work ethic is key; when paired knowledge. The duo began to post various videos online with one of now 8-year old Kyng showcasing his deep understanding of financial terms going viral. Kyren realized there was an opportunity to educate his community about finances by making learning fun, engaging, and motivating. He could help the African-American community build legacies instead of debt.\r\n\nKyren and Kyng went into their second partnership now as businessmen. They created “Kyng & Kyren” an educational tool and motivational speaking platform with the goal of empowering their community through wealth and knowledge.\r\n\r\n“Instead of waiting for our next great leader like sheep, I’ll step up and be the shepherd that’ll lead and show our people the way!” – Kyren Gibson"

Because Solar Walk knows what time it is, the planets are in proper orientation to the Sun: Earth is dark where it is currently night and gradually lightens to daytime on the other side.” - NY Times\n\n\"It's great for showing my students the relative positions of the planets in the solar system, the satellites orbiting the Earth and our place in the galaxy. Awesome with a smartboard as well.\" - by jbrown61\n\nSolar Walk enables you to:\n\n► Observe 3D model of our Solar system with all its objects in real time and in a ​proper orientation.

You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text. This app never transmits data from your device.\n\n\nNote: Non-English localizations focus on solar system objects and constellation names."

      "label": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training. It is yet another beautifully designed and easy-to-use app for kids“ by lilmagoolie.com"

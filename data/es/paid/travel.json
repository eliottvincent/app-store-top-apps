Thanks to the “salto nel tempo” [“time leap”] mode, it is possible to view the most ancient historic phases slowly fading, which allows for easy understanding of remains from the past. The proximity of other time windows with regard to our position is indicated by a tool which shows how to reach a new vantage point.\n\nIf the application is used far away from the areas in question, or if you do not wish to follow the automatic indications or the compass and gyroscope functions, it is possible to select the area from the list or from the map. Moreover, the manual mode allows you to display an overview of the area simply by moving a finger on the screen.\n\nThe core of this application consists in the best and most rigorous 3D reconstructions currently available. Its original contents have been designed on purpose by the Altair 4 Multimedia team, with its architects, archaeologists and artists who have thirty years of experience in the area of cultural heritage enhancement, working in collaboration with the most prestigious Italian and international universities and research institutes.\n\nThe application will therefore avail itself of continuous updates thanks to research progress in the areas of history and archaeology, as well as to new spectacular reconstruction processing, with new Time Windows opening onto the Eternal City.\n\nAreas currently available: Colosseum, Roman Forum, Palatine, Imperial Fora."

Just start the application and type in the amount you want to convert and eCurrency converts instantly. Tap on one of the flags to change the currency you want to convert to. A built-in calculator allows for math calculations. The current exchange rate and rate change compared to the previous day is conveniently displayed in the main interface.\n\n==Favorites Support==\neCurrency supports over 200 currencies. The “Favorites” functionality allows you to define the currency pairs you use as favorites. To create a new favorite go into the “Settings” and touch the “+” Button.

It shows informations about the region where a car is registered and links to the maps application, so that you can see on the map where the car is coming from and use the maps application to let it show you the way to that specific location. A global full text search or simple search for plate keys is another part of LicensePlate. Once you've spotted a plate you can mark it and build up your collection of plates you've seen on the street.\n\nThis application is ideal for longer road trips. Be sure to have an answer when your kids play a License Plate quiz again... and hey, i like that Pub quiz idea...! \n\nCountries:\nAustria, Switzerland, Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy, Ireland, Norway, Poland, Greece, Czech Republic, Northern Ireland, Spain, Lithuania, Slovakia, Croatia, Romania, former GDR, Japan, Turkey, Ukraine, Slovenia\n\nNo regional informations, basics:\nBelgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Sweden, Latvia, Hungary"

All timetable data is stored on your phone, so it can be used offline. \n\nFeatures:\n    - View times for any saved trip with a single tap\n    - Real-time delay information and vehicle map (Sydney only, subject to data availability)\n    - Trackwork and service interruption information\n    - Interactive maps (create your trip by clicking on your station/stop)\n    - Alarms (arrival/departure, time/distance)\n    - Multi-modal trip editor (customise exact change locations / lines)\n    - View your favourite trips on Apple Watch\n\nNOTE: Best efforts are taken to ensure timetable accuracy, but no guarantees are made. If you find an error in the timetable, please email support@tripview.com.au with details. No guarantees are made about real-time data availability. If the transit operator doesn't provide real-time data for a particular service, TripView will revert to showing the scheduled time, as per the timetable.\n\nAlarms require iOS4 and a device that is capable of multitasking. Note: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 500 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from Irún to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 900 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 900+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

      "label": "Hola, all you independent travelers to Cuba! Want to explore Cuba your way, with Cuban locals in the lead and without the usual commercial mumbo jumbo? Experience complete freedom and get value for your money! Use Cuba-Junky’s Casa Particular Directory app as your simple and user friendly ‘Yellow Pages’ while planning, traveling and exploring!\n\nWhy you need this app when you plan to visit Cuba \n- Cuba friendly and explorer friendly (simple, practical and cheap!)\n- Several updates a week with new casas and features \n- Even more casas in the app than on our website\n - Direct contact with the casa through the app\n - Save yourself  $5 per night by using the app to contact the owners directly  \n\nWhat are casas particulares? \nCuba’s version of B&Bs offer the island’s best lodging values for anyone who likes doing things authentically, or in this case: the Cuban way. You can find hundreds of casas in this app. They are rooms, suites, or sometimes entire apartments. The Cuba-Junky casa directory app is current, convenient, and easy to use. It provides casa photos, phone numbers, email addresses, Facebook and website links—all for about US $5!  \n\nOnline, offline and more \nBut there is more. The casa particular directory app is very frequently updated at no extra charge. And you can access other types of info through the app, such as the weather forecast, or use it to contact your casa.\n\n  No commission: save $5 per night! \nBy using this app and contacting a casa directly, you often save the $5 per night commission that the owner normally charges for bookings made through a third party. Casa owners pay no commission or other costs to Cuba Junky. Say this to the casa owner and get that discount!\n\n  Some free Cuba advice?\n Cuba-Junky’s advice is: make a reservation for your first night in Cuba and after that just “go with the flow.” Using your Cuba-Junky casa particular app, it will be easy to find casas while in Cuba, or to call ahead to a casa in the next town you plan to visit. You can talk to the owner directly, find out what’s available, and at what price.   \n\nWhy does this app cost about $5?  \nJust because Cuba Junky have to keep it running. We charge no hidden $5 per night commission. We just love Cuba. If you do too, go and enjoy it, and while you’ re at it, help us keep Cuban locals in the lead! ¡Gracias amigos!"

You can also get the current weather and NOTAM for any day selected in your roster, and export your flights to your calendar or to LogTen Pro. And if you want to know what you’re doing next with just one swipe, you can use the great widget included in the app which displays information about your next duty in the notification center.\n\nWARNING: in this version the only airline supported to download schedules is Ryanair. If you fly for a different airline you will only be able to create your events manually.\n\nThe app includes Brake Cooling Schedule calculations for the 737-800.\n\nIt also contains a tool to assist you during refueling operations (expected fueling time, expected quantity in each tank, x-check actual liters delivered against expected liters).\n\nA list of the IATA and airline specific delay codes is provided with a very convenient search feature.\n\nFinally, a non-exhaustive list of airports is available with details about each airport. You can manually add new airports to this list.\n\nMore features to come in future versions!"

Street View coverage is displayed in blue.\n\n\nEASY TO USE\nWalking through panoramas has never been easier using the interactive, expandable mini map that also displays your viewing angle and field of view. Virtually traveling abroad is even more immersive and fun with Live Panorama mode: Turn around in the panorama simply by rotating the device.\n\n\nAPPLE WATCH APP\nStreets is the only app capable of displaying 360° Street View panoramas on the Apple Watch. Just turn your wrist or pan to turn around in any direction. Use the digital crown to zoom. Streets for Apple Watch automatically syncs favorites and recent searches with your iPhone.\n\n\nOPEN FROM MAPS & OTHER APPS \n“Open location in Streets” displays nearby panoramas from websites, from „Maps“ or „Contacts“, or from many other apps that support sharing of locations and addresses. If you’re already using our location finder app Where To?, you’ll also be able to take advantage of a tight, bidirectional integration.\n\n\nDRAG & DROP\nOn iPad or Mac, drag a pin location from the Maps app, a contact, or a textual address into the Streets app to find nearby panoramas. Even geotagged photos can be dropped in Streets to find 360° spherical images near the photo location.\n\n\nCOMMUNICATIVE\nShare Street View panoramas using drag-and-drop (on iPad) or the share sheet. Handoff and AirDrop let you easily transfer the currently viewed panorama between multiple devices. Mark panoramas as favorites that are automatically synced between devices. Rename favorites and organize them in folders.\n\n\n2000+ GALLERY PLACES \nMore than 2000 hand-picked “Gallery Places” show spectacular places such as museums, castles, national parks, ski slopes and even underwater attractions. Geysers in Yellowstone national park, old masterpieces in Amsterdam’s van Gogh museum or NASA’s rocket launch pad in Cape Kennedy are just a few of the breathtaking places waiting to be explored. Gallery places also include background information such as descriptions and links.\n\n\n\nMORE FEATURES\n- Supports iPad Pro, Split View and Slide Over\n- Supports keyboard navigation (with Bluetooth or Smart Keyboard)\n- Spotlight search also finds Streets panoramas\n- Siri can create reminders with a link to the currently displayed panorama\n- Supports the “Shortcuts” app\n\n\nWHAT OTHERS SAY\n\n“I highly recommend Streets 3.“\n- John Voorhees, MacStories\n\n“it’s hard to imagine Cupertino doing it better than Streets 3”\n4.5/5 mice\n- J.R. Bookwalter, Macworld\n\n“If you haven't migrated to Google Maps on iOS because you're OK with Apple Maps but you miss Google Street View, here's a pretty easy solution.“\n- Mel Martin, Engadget\n\n“Thankfully, with Streets, you can continue using Maps and still be able to quickly pull up Street View without ever feeling like you’ve left the app.“\n- Jordan Khan, 9to5Mac\n\n\nTwitter & Facebook\nCheck us out on Twitter: @futuretap\nand Facebook: http://facebook.com/streetviewapp"

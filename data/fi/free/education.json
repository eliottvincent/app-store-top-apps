Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

WordDive has users in over 150 countries, and according to a customer survey conducted in 2017, 96% of WordDive users recommend it. Start now. You will get hooked!\n\nHow does WordDive work?\n\nLearning with WordDive is based on the WordDive Method, created by dozens of language learning experts, engineers, psychologists and user interface developers. It utilises multiple senses for learning: you will learn Spanish, English or another language of your choice by listening, reading, looking at pictures, writing and speaking. \n\nWordDive also optimises learning pace and study items individually for you. This means you will really remember the words and grammar you have learned permanently. Permanent learning frees you to have fluent conversations in your new language. Words will come out naturally, and you won't have to struggle to remember a specific word.\n\nWho can benefit from WordDive?\n\nWordDive is suitable for anyone: child or adult, beginner or advanced. Whether you want to learn the basics of Spanish or French for a trip abroad or hone your English skills for work, WordDive is the right choice. Students preparing for matriculation exams have also improved their results with WordDive. In other words, just set your goal – whether it's the basics or higher level skills – and WordDive can help you. \n\nOur courses are based on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), which is a widely known skill level scale for foreign languages. With WordDive, you can keep track of your progress and collect trophies in real time. WordDive will also remember your progress – when you change to another iOS device or a computer, you can pick up from where you left off.\n\nPlease note\n\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to all of this app’s courses and features.\n\nPayment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

      "label": "Math can be fun! “Fun Mathematics” is a fun and engaging game to practice mental arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) for K, 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th graders. \r\n\r\nMental math (the ability to do math calculations in one's head) is an important skill for primary students required both to achieve academic success and in daily tasks that take place outside the classroom. It takes a lot of time and practice to master mental arithmetic. Our game is created to make this learning enjoyable and fun for children. \r\n\r\nThe game allows you to select the math facts and operations you would like to master, so each grade in the elementary school (K-5) can play it:\r\n•  Kindergarten: addition and subtraction within 10\r\n• 1st Grade: addition and subtraction within 20 (Math Common Core Standards: CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.1.OA.C.5)\r\n• 2nd Grade: two-digit addition and subtraction, multiplication tables (CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.2.OA.B.2)\r\n• 3rd Grade: multiplication and division, addition and subtraction within 100, times tables (CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.3.OA.C.7, CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.3.NBT.A.2);\r\n• 4th Grade: three-digit addition and subtraction\r\n\r\nYou can select yourself the math facts and operations you would like to master and also configure the type of tasks and speed of monsters.\r\n\r\nDifferent levels, monsters, weapons, additional accessories and the clothes of the character won’t allow the child to become bored. Instead, these elements will motivate him to move forward in the learning process!\r\n\r\nWe think fighting slime monsters is a more entertaining and interesting way of achieving daily arithmetic practice than flash cards or quiz apps. Kids in kindergarten all the way up to 4th grade will enjoy practicing mental math with the “Fun Mathematics” trainer!\r\n\r\nWe would love to hear your feedback. In case you have any questions or comments about the game, please write to us at slimesapp@speedymind.net.\r\n\r\nTerms of service: https://speedymind.net/terms\r\nPrivacy policy: https://speedymind.net/privacy-policy"

      "label": "Play with letters, sounds and words together with Alfie Atkins. Children love learning new things through play. This app, Play ABC, Alfie Atkins, stimulates children's language learning skills by clearly connecting the function and purpose of letters in an experimental, playful way.\n\nAlfie has some extraordinary devices in his room: a letter tracer, a word machine and a puppet theatre. With the letter tracer, children will learn the appearance and sound of all letters and train their motor skills and muscle memory by drawing and tracing letters on the screen. Using Alfie's homemade word machine, children will spell new words using phonemes and letter tips. All new words are sent to the puppet theatre, where children use their creativity and imagination to tell fantastic stories. This playloop, with concrete results, has a motivational effect and helps children develop their language skills at their own pace.\n\nPlay ABC, Alfie Atkins is developed by language teachers and game designers. It was created and tested in collaboration with teachers and students of schools in Finland and Sweden. The app has been developed based on children's needs and does not feature points, time limits or other elements that could lead to failure or stress. Children will play and learn using the app on their own terms and at their own pace, in preschool, at school or at home.\n\nPlay and learn:\n  • The sounds, phonemes and names of letters\n  • How to trace letters\n  • How to spell around 100 different words\n  • How to read simple words\n  • Upper and lowercase letters\n  • Fine motor skills and eye-hand coordination\n  • The basics of literacy\n  • Creative storytelling\n\nThe app is available in 6 different languages, and the full version allows the creation of individual profiles for multiple children.\n\nPlease note that family sharing of in-app purchases aren't supported by Apple. So if you want to purchase the full version of the app and share it with family members please purchase the separate premium, full version, of the app available on the Appstore instead.\n\nGro Play is an xEdu.co alumnus and member of the trade organization Swedish EdTech Industry. Gro Play collaborates with Playful Learning Center, the University of Helsinki, in the development of game-based learning.

      "label": "Moka Mera Lingua is a free language-training application aimed at preschool children. There\nare no advertisements, outside links or in-app purchases. All content is available free of charge.\nMoka Mera Lingua was developed in Finland and is based on the Finnish method of early childhood education. Moka Mera Lingua was created in collaboration with educators, researchers, and children. With cute characters and various activities and minigames, the application ensures that kids stay entertained while learning a foreign language naturally.\n\nGameplay contains no text, so no reading skills are necessary. We utilize the power of “learning through play”—a scientifically proven concept of learning which combines training with gameplay. Moka Mera Lingua doesn’t have a beginning or an end. Children can play and explore the application in any way they choose. This is in line with the way young kids generally interact digitally.\n\nMoka Mera Lingua features two characters speaking different languages: the shark Atlas and the little monster Moka Mera. These languages can be freely changed based on your child’s native and target languages. The game features everyday words and phrases, teaching your child basic vocabulary and pronunciation. \n\nThe languages available are Arabic (Levantine), Chinese (Mandarin), Danish, English, Finnish, French, German, Icelandic, Norwegian, Russian, Spanish (Latin American), Swedish and Ukrainian. \n\nAtlas and Moka Mera live in a tree house with four rooms, each containing different activities.They will develop different needs during play, such as hunger or fatigue, which naturally moves activity around the house. If you don’t understand the foreign language the little monster Moka Mera is using, simply tap Atlas the shark, who will help you in your native language.\n\nPlayroom\nHere, Atlas and Moka Mera can listen to the Moka Mera song on the radio, water a plant, or play maracas.\n\nParrot minigame\nRecord yourself in Moka Mera Lingua while naming 70 different items. After the recording, your voice can be played back straight or as if said by an elephant, a cow, or a frog!\n\nKitchen\nWhen they’re hungry, Atlas and Moka Mera go to the kitchen, where you prepare food they ask for while learning the names of basic foodstuffs.\nDishwashing minigame\nAfter eating, the dishes need to be washed. While scrubbing the plates and utensils clean, don’t forget to add water and detergent for best results.\n\nToilet\nRehearse basic toilet etiquette with Atlas and Moka Mera, including flushing, wiping and washing hands.\n\nBathtub minigame\nPractice naming colors with Atlas and Moka Mera as they fish up various things from the bathtub.\n\nBedroom\nThe bedroom contains two minigames.\nSheep counting minigame\nHelp Atlas and Moka Mera go to sleep by bouncing a sheep over a fence while learning the numbers from one to twenty.\n\nSpyglass minigame\nAtlas and Moka Mera need help to find various things around the city. Can you find the carousel, the firetruck, or even the sea monster?\n\nWe take your child’s privacy seriously. Moka Mera Lingua has no online functionality and collects no usage data. There are no advertisements, outside links or in-app purchases. One of the minigames uses the microphone and will ask for permission to use it. No recordings will be stored. The application works offline and no Internet connection is necessary.\n\nFor more information, please visit mokamera.com."

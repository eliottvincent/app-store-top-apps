It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom.

In 2015, the technology publication Red Herring chose WordDive as one of its Top 100 European startup companies. You can try WordDive for free for 7 days without any commitments. WordDive has users in over 150 countries, and according to a customer survey conducted in 2017, 96% of WordDive users recommend it. Start now. You will get hooked!\n\nHow does WordDive work?\n\nLearning with WordDive is based on the WordDive Method, created by dozens of language learning experts, engineers, psychologists and user interface developers. It utilises multiple senses for learning: you will learn Spanish, English or another language of your choice by listening, reading, looking at pictures, writing and speaking. \n\nWordDive also optimises learning pace and study items individually for you. This means you will really remember the words and grammar you have learned permanently. Permanent learning frees you to have fluent conversations in your new language. Words will come out naturally, and you won't have to struggle to remember a specific word.\n\nWho can benefit from WordDive?\n\nWordDive is suitable for anyone: child or adult, beginner or advanced. Whether you want to learn the basics of Spanish or French for a trip abroad or hone your English skills for work, WordDive is the right choice. Students preparing for matriculation exams have also improved their results with WordDive. In other words, just set your goal – whether it's the basics or higher level skills – and WordDive can help you. \n\nOur courses are based on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), which is a widely known skill level scale for foreign languages. With WordDive, you can keep track of your progress and collect trophies in real time. WordDive will also remember your progress – when you change to another iOS device or a computer, you can pick up from where you left off.\n\nPlease note\n\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to all of this app’s courses and features.\n\nPayment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. Your subscription will be renewed automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current payment period. Your iTunes account will be automatically charged at the same price for renewal within the 24-hour period prior to the end of the current payment period unless you change your subscription preferences in your Account Settings.

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

      "label": "Learn Spanish with free lessons daily. Let Mondly teach you the Spanish language quickly and effectively. In just minutes you’ll start memorizing core Spanish words, form sentences, learn to speak Spanish phrases and take part in conversations. Fun Spanish lessons improve your vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation like no other language learning method. Beginner or advanced learner, traveler or business professional with a tight schedule? The app works great and dynamically adjusts to your needs.\n\nExplore language exercises for reading, listening, writing and speaking enhanced with a dictionary, verb conjugator and state-of-the-art speech recognition technology - you’ll feel like having your own Spanish language tutor in your pocket.\nDownload the language learning pill today and enjoy the benefits of learning a new language for life.\n\n▶ The secret path to language learning\nRemember the Spanish language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of Spanish grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.\nMondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.\n\nHere are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:\n\n• State-of-the-art Speech Recognition. Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your Spanish words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak Spanish clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.\n\n• Useful phrases for real situations. Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning Spanish. Mondly teaches you Spanish vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.\n\n• Learn conversational Spanish. Conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core Spanish vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs, and speak Spanish clearly.\n\n• Verb conjugations. If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the Spanish verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.\n\n• The Leaderboard. See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.\n\nPLEASE NOTE\n\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to all of this app’s courses and features.\n\nSubscription options:\n- One-monthly subscription for $US9.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n- One-yearly subscription for $US47.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n\nYour subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current payment period.\n\nYour iTunes account will be automatically charged at the same price for renewal within the 24-hour period prior to the end of the current payment period unless you change your subscription preferences in your Account Settings.\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\nAny unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\nYou can manage your subscriptions through your Account Settings after purchase.\n\nWhen a subscription is canceled, access to the app’s courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nPrivacy Policy: www.mondly.com/privacy\nTerms: www.mondly.com/terms\n\nWe welcome your feedback and suggestions at: ios[at]mondly[dot]com\n\nBefore you know it, at the end of these Spanish lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language."

      "label": "Play with letters, sounds and words together with Alfie Atkins. Children love learning new things through play. This app, Play ABC, Alfie Atkins, stimulates children's language learning skills by clearly connecting the function and purpose of letters in an experimental, playful way.\n\nAlfie has some extraordinary devices in his room: a letter tracer, a word machine and a puppet theatre. With the letter tracer, children will learn the appearance and sound of all letters and train their motor skills and muscle memory by drawing and tracing letters on the screen. Using Alfie's homemade word machine, children will spell new words using phonemes and letter tips. All new words are sent to the puppet theatre, where children use their creativity and imagination to tell fantastic stories. This playloop, with concrete results, has a motivational effect and helps children develop their language skills at their own pace.\n\nPlay ABC, Alfie Atkins is developed by language teachers and game designers. It was created and tested in collaboration with teachers and students of schools in Finland and Sweden. The app has been developed based on children's needs and does not feature points, time limits or other elements that could lead to failure or stress. Children will play and learn using the app on their own terms and at their own pace, in preschool, at school or at home.\n\nPlay and learn:\n  • The sounds, phonemes and names of letters\n  • How to trace letters\n  • How to spell around 100 different words\n  • How to read simple words\n  • Upper and lowercase letters\n  • Fine motor skills and eye-hand coordination\n  • The basics of literacy\n  • Creative storytelling\n\nThe app is available in 6 different languages, and the full version allows the creation of individual profiles for multiple children.\n\nPlease note that family sharing of in-app purchases aren't supported by Apple. So if you want to purchase the full version of the app and share it with family members please purchase the separate premium, full version, of the app available on the Appstore instead.\n\nGro Play is an xEdu.co alumnus and member of the trade organization Swedish EdTech Industry. Gro Play collaborates with Playful Learning Center, the University of Helsinki, in the development of game-based learning.

Tunnistetaan se äänne, miltä se kuulostaa, ja miten se kuuluisi sanoa.\n\nMotoriikka harjoituksia\n- Sen jälkeen treenataan kielen ja suun motoriikkaa, jotta R-äänteen ääntäminen on ylipäätään mahdollista. Siihen tarvitaan vahvat kielilihakset.\n\nD-äänne\n- Kolmantena lähdetään ääntämään D äänettä, joka on huomattavasti helpompi ääntää kuin R, mutta se lähtee samasta kohtaa kuin R-äänne.\n\nPikku-r\n- Sen jälkeen siirrytään pikku-r, joka on vähän kuin R, dzzz, täristetään sitä kieltä.\n\nTäryn etsintä\n- Viidentenä aloitetaan täryn etsintä. Sitten, kun se D on löytynyt sieltä, vielä aggressiivisemmin yritetään täristää sitä kieltä.\n\nR puheessa\n- Viimeinen osio tässä soveluksessa on ärrän sijoittaminen puheeseen. \n\nSovelluksesta löytyy monipuolisia tehtäviä ääntämisen treenaamiseen erilaisten pelillistettyjen harjoitusten avulla.\n\nVoit ladata sovelluksen helposti ja ilmaiseksi laitteesi sovelluskaupasta."

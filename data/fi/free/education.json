It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom.

WordDive has users in over 150 countries, and according to a customer survey conducted in 2017, 96% of WordDive users recommend it. Start now. You will get hooked!\n\nHow does WordDive work?\n\nLearning with WordDive is based on the WordDive Method, created by dozens of language learning experts, engineers, psychologists and user interface developers. It utilises multiple senses for learning: you will learn Spanish, English or another language of your choice by listening, reading, looking at pictures, writing and speaking. \n\nWordDive also optimises learning pace and study items individually for you. This means you will really remember the words and grammar you have learned permanently. Permanent learning frees you to have fluent conversations in your new language. Words will come out naturally, and you won't have to struggle to remember a specific word.\n\nWho can benefit from WordDive?\n\nWordDive is suitable for anyone: child or adult, beginner or advanced. Whether you want to learn the basics of Spanish or French for a trip abroad or hone your English skills for work, WordDive is the right choice. Students preparing for matriculation exams have also improved their results with WordDive. In other words, just set your goal – whether it's the basics or higher level skills – and WordDive can help you. \n\nOur courses are based on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), which is a widely known skill level scale for foreign languages. With WordDive, you can keep track of your progress and collect trophies in real time. WordDive will also remember your progress – when you change to another iOS device or a computer, you can pick up from where you left off.\n\nPlease note\n\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to all of this app’s courses and features.\n\nPayment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.

      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

In the Early Literacy class, children can start with fun sound games like “I spy” and move all the way to reading comprehension. \n\nLogic and coding\nThe app also offer pre-coding and reasoning games.\n\nNursery Rhymes\nYounger children love our latest additions: Wheels on the bus and Head, shoulders, knees & toes and now Old MacDonald sing alongs.\n\nShapes & Colors\nA key element of preschool; learn the names of all the shapes and colors but in a fun, interactive way!\n\nNurse's station\nHelp the school nurse take care of the school's children and animals.

      "label": "Learn English with free lessons daily. Let Mondly teach you the English language quickly and effectively. In just minutes you’ll start memorizing core English words, form sentences, learn to speak English phrases and take part in conversations. Fun English lessons improve your vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation like no other language learning method. Beginner or advanced learner, traveler or business professional with a tight schedule? The app works great and dynamically adjusts to your needs.\n\nExplore language exercises for reading, listening, writing and speaking enhanced with a dictionary, verb conjugator and state-of-the-art speech recognition technology - you’ll feel like having your own English language tutor in your pocket.\n\n▶ The secret path to language learning\nRemember the English language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of English grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.\nMondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.\n\nHere are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:\n\n• Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors. Learn the right English pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.\n\n• State-of-the-art Speech Recognition. Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your English words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak English clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.\n\n• Useful phrases for real situations. Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning English. Mondly teaches you English vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.\n\n• Verb conjugations. If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the English verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.\n\n• Advanced Statistics. The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.\n\n• The Leaderboard. See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.\n\nBefore you know it, at the end of these English lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language.\n\nPLEASE NOTE\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to all of this app’s courses and features.\n\nSubscription options:\n- One-monthly subscription for $US9.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n- One-yearly subscription for $US47.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n\nYour subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current payment period.\n\nYour iTunes account will be automatically charged at the same price for renewal within the 24-hour period prior to the end of the current payment period unless you change your subscription preferences in your Account Settings.\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\nAny unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\nYou can manage your subscriptions through your Account Settings after purchase.\n\nWhen a subscription is canceled, access to the app’s courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nPrivacy Policy: www.mondly.com/privacy\nTerms: www.mondly.com/terms\n\nWe welcome your feedback and suggestions at: ios@mondlylanguages.com"

Our game is created to make this learning enjoyable and fun for children. \r\n\r\nThe game allows you to select the math facts and operations you would like to master, so each grade in the elementary school (K-5) can play it:\r\n•  Kindergarten: addition and subtraction within 10\r\n• 1st Grade: addition and subtraction within 20 (Math Common Core Standards: CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.1.OA.C.5)\r\n• 2nd Grade: two-digit addition and subtraction, multiplication tables (CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.2.OA.B.2)\r\n• 3rd Grade: multiplication and division, addition and subtraction within 100, times tables (CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.3.OA.C.7, CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.3.NBT.A.2);\r\n• 4th Grade: three-digit addition and subtraction\r\n\r\nYou can select yourself the math facts and operations you would like to master and also configure the type of tasks and speed of monsters.\r\n\r\nDifferent levels, monsters, weapons, additional accessories and the clothes of the character won’t allow the child to become bored. Instead, these elements will motivate him to move forward in the learning process!\r\n\r\nWe think fighting slime monsters is a more entertaining and interesting way of achieving daily arithmetic practice than flash cards or quiz apps. Kids in kindergarten all the way up to 4th grade will enjoy practicing mental math with the “Fun Mathematics” trainer!\r\n\r\nWe would love to hear your feedback. In case you have any questions or comments about the game, please write to us at slimesapp@speedymind.net.\r\n\r\nTerms of service: https://speedymind.net/terms\r\nPrivacy policy: https://speedymind.net/privacy-policy"

      "label": "Learn Spanish with free lessons daily. Let Mondly teach you the Spanish language quickly and effectively. In just minutes you’ll start memorizing core Spanish words, form sentences, learn to speak Spanish phrases and take part in conversations. Fun Spanish lessons improve your vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation like no other language learning method. Beginner or advanced learner, traveler or business professional with a tight schedule? The app works great and dynamically adjusts to your needs.\n\nExplore language exercises for reading, listening, writing and speaking enhanced with a dictionary, verb conjugator and state-of-the-art speech recognition technology - you’ll feel like having your own Spanish language tutor in your pocket.\nDownload the language learning pill today and enjoy the benefits of learning a new language for life.\n\n▶ The secret path to language learning\nRemember the Spanish language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of Spanish grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.\nMondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.\n\nHere are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:\n\n• State-of-the-art Speech Recognition. Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your Spanish words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak Spanish clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.\n\n• Useful phrases for real situations. Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning Spanish. Mondly teaches you Spanish vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.\n\n• Learn conversational Spanish. Conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core Spanish vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs, and speak Spanish clearly.\n\n• Verb conjugations. If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the Spanish verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.\n\n• The Leaderboard. See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.\n\nPLEASE NOTE\n\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to all of this app’s courses and features.\n\nSubscription options:\n- One-monthly subscription for $US9.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n- One-yearly subscription for $US47.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n\nYour subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current payment period.\n\nYour iTunes account will be automatically charged at the same price for renewal within the 24-hour period prior to the end of the current payment period unless you change your subscription preferences in your Account Settings.\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\nAny unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\nYou can manage your subscriptions through your Account Settings after purchase.\n\nWhen a subscription is canceled, access to the app’s courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nPrivacy Policy: www.mondly.com/privacy\nTerms: www.mondly.com/terms\n\nWe welcome your feedback and suggestions at: ios[at]mondly[dot]com\n\nBefore you know it, at the end of these Spanish lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language."

It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go.

It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom.

      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

      "label": "Learn English with free lessons daily. Let Mondly teach you the English language quickly and effectively. In just minutes you’ll start memorizing core English words, form sentences, learn to speak English phrases and take part in conversations. Fun English lessons improve your vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation like no other language learning method. Beginner or advanced learner, traveler or business professional with a tight schedule? The app works great and dynamically adjusts to your needs.\n\nExplore language exercises for reading, listening, writing and speaking enhanced with a dictionary, verb conjugator and state-of-the-art speech recognition technology - you’ll feel like having your own English language tutor in your pocket.\n\n▶ The secret path to language learning\nRemember the English language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of English grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.\nMondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.\n\nHere are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:\n\n• Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors. Learn the right English pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.\n\n• State-of-the-art Speech Recognition. Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your English words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak English clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.\n\n• Useful phrases for real situations. Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning English. Mondly teaches you English vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.\n\n• Verb conjugations. If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the English verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.\n\n• Advanced Statistics. The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.\n\n• The Leaderboard. See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.\n\nBefore you know it, at the end of these English lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language.\n\nPLEASE NOTE\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to all of this app’s courses and features.\n\nSubscription options:\n- One-monthly subscription for $US9.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n- One-yearly subscription for $US47.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n\nYour subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current payment period.\n\nYour iTunes account will be automatically charged at the same price for renewal within the 24-hour period prior to the end of the current payment period unless you change your subscription preferences in your Account Settings.\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\nAny unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\nYou can manage your subscriptions through your Account Settings after purchase.\n\nWhen a subscription is canceled, access to the app’s courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nPrivacy Policy: www.mondly.com/privacy\nTerms: www.mondly.com/terms\n\nWe welcome your feedback and suggestions at: ios@mondlylanguages.com"

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

This app, Play ABC, Alfie Atkins, stimulates children's language learning skills by clearly connecting the function and purpose of letters in an experimental, playful way.\n\nAlfie has some extraordinary devices in his room: a letter tracer, a word machine and a puppet theatre. With the letter tracer, children will learn the appearance and sound of all letters and train their motor skills and muscle memory by drawing and tracing letters on the screen. Using Alfie's homemade word machine, children will spell new words using phonemes and letter tips. All new words are sent to the puppet theatre, where children use their creativity and imagination to tell fantastic stories. This playloop, with concrete results, has a motivational effect and helps children develop their language skills at their own pace.\n\nPlay ABC, Alfie Atkins is developed by language teachers and game designers. It was created and tested in collaboration with teachers and students of schools in Finland and Sweden. The app has been developed based on children's needs and does not feature points, time limits or other elements that could lead to failure or stress. Children will play and learn using the app on their own terms and at their own pace, in preschool, at school or at home.\n\nPlay and learn:\n  • The sounds, phonemes and names of letters\n  • How to trace letters\n  • How to spell around 100 different words\n  • How to read simple words\n  • Upper and lowercase letters\n  • Fine motor skills and eye-hand coordination\n  • The basics of literacy\n  • Creative storytelling\n\nThe app is available in 6 different languages, and the full version allows the creation of individual profiles for multiple children.\n\nPlease note that family sharing of in-app purchases aren't supported by Apple. So if you want to purchase the full version of the app and share it with family members please purchase the separate premium, full version, of the app available on the Appstore instead.\n\nGro Play is an xEdu.co alumnus and member of the trade organization Swedish EdTech Industry. Gro Play collaborates with Playful Learning Center, the University of Helsinki, in the development of game-based learning.

      "label": "Learn Korean by speaking from the start!\nPractice speaking essential Korean expressions in first-person POV scenarios.\n\n===========\n\n• \"But I can just learn Korean by watching Kpop!?”\n\nJust like if you were learning how to swim, you’d go into a pool instead of watching videos of Michael Phelps swimming. You can't learn Korean by listening to BTS or watching Crash Landing on You! Don't get us wrong, we too love listening to Kpop and watching Kdrama. But if your goal is to ACTUALLY SPEAK Korean, you have to, well – SPEAK! Teuida's first-person POV conversations will get you speaking everyday expressions in real-life scenarios.\n\n• 3 min > 30 min\n\nWe believe that 3 minutes of actual speaking will help you more than 30 minutes watching someone else speak (long lecture videos).\nWhy waste your precious time learning about Korean when you can learn Korean by speaking it yourself? Our interactive lessons not only get you to speak with the tutors but gives instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Overcome fear of speaking\n\nResearch shows that one of the greatest barriers to speaking a language is confidence. After all, what's the point of knowing all the grammar rules and verb conjugations if you can't speak when the moment comes? Teuida helps you overcome fear of speaking by simulating real-life scenarios but without all the social anxiety. (i.e. Our characters won't throw shade at you for mispronouncing!)\n\n• What about those other apps?\n\nMost apps out there are vocabulary-building games and will teach you a lot of new words and basic hangul. But if your goal is to actually speak Korean, then well let's face it... no amount of matching words with cute pictures will improve your speaking.\n\n===========\n\nHere’s a list of things that make Teuida different:\n\n•  Essential expressions :\n\nNo more weird, awkward phrases (translated by bots) that no Korean people actually use in real life. (Let's be honest, when was the last time you had to say \"I am a boy, you are a woman\" in real-life?)\n\n• Taught by Bilingual Tutors:\n\nOur crazy selection of fully bilingual tutors not only speak Korean but understand where you’re coming from. They know exactly what to teach you because they've been in your shoes!\n\n• AI Pronunciation Analysis:\n\nWhat's the point of repeating sentences aloud if you can't tell whether you're pronouncing it right? Teuida has a convenient voice recognition system that will give instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Fun, Interactive Stories:\n\nWe believe that learning and fun are not mutually exclusive. In fact, learning is most effective when it's fun! You'll find yourself laughing, screaming and at times even cringing with the characters.\n\n• Real-life Scenarios:\n\nReal-life everyday situations! Everything from ordering a drink at the cafe to talking to your KPOP bias. Okay, that last scenario isn't really an everyday situation. But hey! You never know! ;)\n\n• Culture-specific tips:\n\nA wise man once said that \"the person who learns language without learning culture risks becoming a fluent fool\". We believe understanding culture is the key to learning language. So we hand-selected each scenario to reflect the culture-specific elements of Korea.\n\nSo... what are you waiting for? Stop reading and start speaking with Teuida!\n\n===========\n\nPlease note you will need a TEUIDA Premium plan in order to access all content and exclusive features."

      "label": "Word Tag works\nGet ready to be outsmarted by your kids. This game will increase their vocabulary performance by 43% in just four weeks!\n\nIn 20 minutes of gameplay a day – with eight exposures to every new word over three weeks – you'll see your child's confidence soar and their schoolwork improve. While kids are focused on having fun and acing the game, they will be learning up to 1,000 new words a year, all personalized to their level. The learning happens almost invisibly, so they learn more because they are having fun (and it doesn’t feel like homework). And while they are busy getting all the fun rewards, you can track their advancement on a progress report showing all the pedagogical activities behind the chest of treasures your kid accumulates in the game.\n\nWith characters designed by Craig Kellman (Madagascar, Hotel Transylvania), developed by the brilliant designers of Subway Surfers, crafted on the foundations created by the award-winning team of Mrs Wordsmith, and backed by a stellar team of literacy experts, Word Tag will have a lasting impact in the education and entertainment of the whole family. \nOur unique pedagogical approach was developed and endorsed by Susan Neuman (Professor of Early Childhood and Literacy Education, NYU), Ted Briscoe (Professor of Computational Linguistics, University of Cambridge), and Emma Madden (Headteacher at Fox Primary, one of the UK’s top schools).\n\nHow does it work, you ask? \nWord Tag uses spaced repetition to teach vocabulary. This is the most effective way to learn new words. It works by repeatedly exposing kids to the same word, over a series of short, focused sessions, to make sure vocabulary gets stored in long-term memory.\nWe developed several mini-games, to be played in a specific order, carefully scaffolded, with each mini-game building further on kids’ understanding of a word. We took the elements that make for a great game (including rewards, exciting challenges, and a beautiful world to explore) and blended them with research on what boosts learning.\n\nKids will encounter the same word eight times, across four different game activities:\n\nWild Styling Syllables: In this game, kids unlock word definitions by working with jumbled syllables that must be placed in the right order. This introduces them to the meaning, spelling, and pronunciation of each new word.\n\nWild Styling Synonyms: It also reinforces word meaning by bringing in synonyms and word pairs.\n\nContext Sentence Game: gives kids a chance to use words in context by choosing the right word to complete a sentence.\n\nPop Quiz: This game helps recap what kids have seen before, as they choose synonyms and word pairs for multiple words in a fast-paced quiz.\n\nWord Tag uses individual feedback to repeat the words each child needs most, more often, based on their performance in the game. It modulates difficulty, making sure kids encounter words that are challenging enough to keep them engaged, but not so challenging that they get frustrated. This balance is what keeps kids learning.\n\nThe words kids see are tailored to their needs, including:\n\nCreative writing and literature words\nTextbook words from the Lexile database\n\nUS exam words (inc. SSAT, SAT)\nUK exam words (inc. KS1/KS2 SATs, ISEB 11+)\nInspirational words\nSTEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) words\n\nFor more information, have a look through our T&C:\nhttps://uk.mrswordsmith.com/pages/terms-and-conditions?_ga=2.116069062.1935758160.1595001437-1560637269.1540981688\n\nOr our Privacy Policy:\nhttps://uk.mrswordsmith.com/pages/privacy?location=GB"

      "label": "Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 500 million active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. \n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.\n\nApple Terms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

      "label": "Tumblr. Pure effervescent enrichment. Old internet energy. Home of the Reblogs. All the art you never knew you needed. All the fandoms you could wish for. Enough memes to knock out a moderately-sized mammal. Add to it or simply scroll through and soak it up. \n\nOh, and influencers? Don’t even go here. Every video you find, every quote you reblog, every tag you curate, every waterfall GIF you secretly gaze at in wonder—that’s all you. You’re the explorer. We’re just a map you all keep on making. Welcome home. Welcome to weird. Make it yours. \n\nNow picture all of the above, but on the go. That’s what this is. \n\n-\n\nChances are if you’ve seen it elsewhere, it probably started here. That text post explaining the exquisite specifics of something you never realized you needed to know. That digital painting you can’t stop thinking about. Tumblr is the home of all things weird and wonderful, funny and fascinating—old-school internet vibes. We’re built a little different, just like everyone else who goes here.\n\nYour dashboard will become the place to see what you want to see: a chronological tapestry of all the wonderful, nonsensical, fantastical things you like. Whether you post, lurk in likes, reblog and add your own take, this is your universe to discover, express, and enjoy. Whatever your community, you’ll find a ready-made home here.\n\nWhen you have something to say—a hot take on the finer points of a Virgo moon, an image of your turtle Harold that you simply *have* to share with the world, F1 fanfic that your mutuals need to see—you have so many options. Shoot your shot with a photo, a video, or a text post. You can make an audio post of your ramblings or share your current favorite song via Spotify. We even have a pre-set chat post for all your incorrect quotes. Don’t say we don’t spoil you!\n\nThe reblog starts conversations in which anyone can join. Reblogging creates jokes and continues them—sometimes across the world and over the years. Whatever you choose to send into our effervescent digital ether, know that it can, and will, go anywhere. (Unless, of course, you use our post-level reblog controls. Private blog? Private post only for a couple of your friends to engage with? All possible here). No matter who you are, where you are, or what you are (looking at you here, Pikaman), this is your space—with as much freedom or privacy as you need. \n\nTumblr is the home of fandom. Maybe you have a favorite blorbo from your show? There’s fanart you’ll want to stare at, reblog, stare at again—or create yourself. You can read your favorite ficcers from ao3, *and* see their OC art on Tumblr, *and* discuss the finer points of lore with them. Pokémon? Got it. Marvel? Here. Kpop? Check. Supernatural? Of course. Minecraft? Ready and waiting. Star Wars? Yes! Doctor Who? You get the idea: it’s all here. Wait. Frogs. Did we mention the frogs? \n\nIt’s a whole world out here. If the prospect of reblogging, shipping, curating, and fanart feels a little daunting, or you simply require a refresher on how all this works, head over to tips.tumblr.com, where Cat Frazier of animatedtext.tumblr.com will take you through the finer points of Tumblr etiquette—the effervescent, the eeby, the deeby.\n\nSo.

      "label": "Since 2017, WatchChat is the fastest and most reliable app that allows you to send and receive WhatsApp messages on your Apple Watch. To offer the widest range of features and up-to-date technology the app has been updated more than 60 times in the past 3 years and we will continue to do so.\n\nYou only need to scan a QR code and then you can:\n\n- access all of your WhatsApp chats (and group chats)\n- enjoy VOICE MESSAGES (SEND + RECEIVE)\n- reply to chats via KEYBOARD, QUICK REPLIES, DICTATION and SCRIBBLE\n- use a VARIETY of different KEYBOARD LAYOUTS*\n- watch VIDEOS\n- see STATUS UPDATES (TEXT, PICTURE, VIDEO)\n- view STICKERS and HD PICTURES (and ZOOM into them in native resolution)\n- CUSTOMIZE your quick replies\n- start a new chat right from the Watch\n- set each chat's font size\n- …\n\n... all with full respect to your privacy, WatchChat does not collect any personal data.\n\n*The currently supported keyboard layouts are:\n\n- FlickType (English)\n- ABC (English, Deutsch, Español, Português, אבגדה, Ελληνικά, Suomi, русский)\n- QWERTY (English, Español, Italiano)\n- QWERTZ (Deutsch)\n- AZERTY (Français)\n- אבגדה)עברית)\n\n\n\nSetting up the app for the first time only takes 4 simple steps:\n\n- open the app on your Apple Watch\n- open WhatsApp\n- in WhatsApp, go to (Settings) > (Linked Devices / WhatsApp Web) > (Link a device)\n- scan the QR code that will appear on your Apple Watch after 10-30 seconds\n- if a popup comes up, just try again, it will work out eventually :)\n\n\nAs this is a 3rd-party-app, I would really appreciate if you had suggestions for further development so I can take your ideas into consideration. If you encounter issues while using the app, don't hesitate to contact me, I am more than happy to help.\n\n\nPlease keep in mind that, as the app isn’t officially affiliated with WhatsApp, available features and functionality are subject to change. To keep up with everything, the app has been updated more than 70 times since its release in 2017 - I am always looking for ways to offer new features or improve the existing ones.\n\n\nYou can use the app for free forever, but if you want to support the app's further development, the \"Support WatchChat Development\" subscription CAN be purchased for free users to access the \"Contacts\" and \"Status\" sections and will grant access to future additions. After the free trial period, if offered, the subscription automatically renews with the price and duration given in the purchase button unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. YOU CAN MANAGE AND CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTIONS BY GOING TO YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS ON THE APP STORE AFTER PURCHASE. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\n\nAs of January, IF you want to sign up for the subscription, the free trial period is 3 days, it is billed annually and the price is about the equivalent of 3 USD.\n\n\nTerms of use: https://watchchat.info/terms.html"

It also allows you to easily see what kind of needs are near you. Help can be peer support, going for a jog together, helping your neighbor carry groceries... Commu doesn't discriminate. You can easily reach out to other users and agree on details within the app in our built-in chat, without the need to share phone numbers or social media profiles.\n\nWe are not a freelance-platform. We focus on volunteer helping, neighborhood helping and helping each other without pay. We believe helping each other is one of the best ways to get to know new people!\n\nHop in and start meeting new people and get to know your neighbors through the means of helping!\n\nCommu is built by three young Finnish entrepreneurs. We have a mission to lower the threshold to ask for help and give help. We launched the app in May 2021 and are constantly improving it according to our user feedback.

      "label": "Get answers and tips from REAL PEOPLE in seconds!\n\nSuperfy lets you talk with people and get the advice you need. You can ask anything, answer others, and help them too.\nInstead of asking Siri, or going through Google search results, asking in online groups and sites like Reddit, Quora, and AMA websites for answers and tips or even searching Yelp for recommendations, just ask any question, and Superfy will instantly find people that can answer.\n\nIt's just like chatting on iMessage, but instead of asking people you know if they might have an answer, you can get to anyone who knows the answer.\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n1. Ask any question or search anything\n2. Superfy sends it to the most relevant people \n3. Get answers in instant messages from real people!\n4. Chat to find out more and talk about your interests.\n\nYou can use Superfy to ask and answer questions on literally ANYTHING.\nSuperfy will help you satisfy your curiosity and also let you help others. You will also meet new people from around the world. It's awesome!\n\nTrending questions:\n*Best thing to watch on Netflix right now? \n*Which college or university should I go to?\n*What’s it like to work at Google? \n*How do I stop dying in Fortnite?  \n*Which broadway show should I see?\n*What's the best Italian restaurant in NYC? \n*Will there be another MCU Avengers movie??\n*Going to SXSW this year - any tips?\n\nGet tips from real people about real experiences. \nChat with people who know what they are talking about!  \nIt's great if you are a curious person that has a lot of questions, and also if you are an expert in many fields and want to share your knowledge and help others.\n\n-------------------\nWe all use Google to search for stuff, and it's great! But there are many things that Google can't find because the information and tips you need are stuck in people's minds. That's why people ask Questions on their Facebook wall or Facebook Groups, ask Siri, Alexa and Cortana, or even go to chat apps like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and other apps looking for answers from people. People also use Quora, Reddit, Ask.com, and Yahoo Answers to get answers from people - these are great tools, but it's nothing like getting a response in a live chat from a real person!\n\nSuperfy is really awesome. Our users love the app because they get to help others, get answers, chat about fields of interest, and also get to meet new people from around the world and even make new friends.\n\nSuperfy is not an online group - you get your answer in a one on one chat with a real person in real-time. \n\nWe love our community; feedback is welcome at feedback@superfy.co\n\nSee you on Superfy!"

With personality insight, you are empowered to understand how it all works for yourself, make the right decisions, and set yourself up for success.\n\nWe were using all the dating apps. It was always the same result–going on dates with people we had no chemistry with. We were exhausted from all the wasted time and effort. We made Boo because we knew there was a better way.\n\nOur mission is to create a future in which personality enables our greatest potential, starting with our relationships.\n\nWe hope you like it,\nThe souls at Boo\n\nhttps://boo.world/terms-and-conditions"

No matter what you’re into, you can meet passionate people posting about it on Mastodon!\n\nJoin a community and create your profile. Find and and follow fascinating folks and read their posts in an ad-free, chronological timeline. Express yourself with custom emoji, images, GIFs, videos, and audio in 500-character posts. Reply to threads and reblog posts from anyone to share great stuff. Find new accounts to follow and trending hashtags to expand your network.\n\nMastodon is built with a focus on privacy and safety. Decide whether your posts are shared with your followers, just the people you mention, or the whole world. Content warnings let you hide posts containing sensitive or triggering material until you're ready to engage with them. Each community has its own guidelines and moderators to keep its members safe, and robust blocking and reporting tools help prevent abuse.\n\nMore features:\n\n• Dark Mode: Read posts in light, dark, or true black mode\n• Polls: Ask followers for their opinion and tally the votes\n• Explore: Trending hashtags and accounts are a tap away\n• Notifications: Get notified about new follows, replies, and reblogs\n• Sharing: Post directly to Mastodon from any share sheet in any app\n• Cuteness: Our mascot is an adorable elephant, and you'll see them pop up from time to time\n\nMastodon is a registered nonprofit and development is supported directly by your donations.

Bullies are not welcome. Momio is for kids and you have to be less than 18 years old to use it.\n\nMomio - Always among friends!\n\n\nHI PARENTS!\nWe do the best we can to keep our users safe on Momio, but we need your help! Go through our rules and safety features together, and frequently ask your kid how it's going on Momio, just as you ask how it is going in school.\n\nMomio is designed as a first social media experience. It's a safe place to practice what it means to be on social media. We don't share your child's information with others, and we don't save anything that we don't have to save. Children on Momio have usernames, so they don't have to share their real names with anyone. To ensure kids a good night’s sleep, Momio is closed at night.\n\nThere are clear rules on Momio. For example bad language, bullying, hurting others' feelings or posting something of a sexual nature is not allowed. If a child breaks these rules, our police officer Jack sends a message explaining what went wrong and why it's not OK. Jack also regularly shares safety tips with the kids and encourages them to think how to behave well and responsibly on the internet.\n\nIf you have any questions, our well-trained support team is ready to help. Read more about us and our safety at http://company.momio.me/ - and don't forget to check out our blog! We give out tips and explanations regarding children and the internet. You can even sign up for a newsletter!\n\n\nFOLLOW US!\nFollow Momio on social media - we'll be so happy!\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/momio_official\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MomioOfficial\n\nFor parents:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Momio_official\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MomioParents\nBlog: http://company.momio.me/blog\n\n\nIN-APP PURCHASES\nMomio is totally free to use.

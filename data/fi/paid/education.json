      "label": "Lolan Tavuviidakko on uusin sovelluksemme, joten se on rakennettu huolella kymmenien miljoonien Lola Panda asiakkaiden oppimistuloksiin perustuen. Tällä sovelluksella on lukemisen oppimistakuu – katso tiedot kuvauksen lopusta!\n\nHyvä lukutaito antaa lapselle eväät kaikkeen oppimiseen kouluvuosien aikana. Tavujen hahmottaminen on tärkeää lukemista opeteltaessa. Tällöin lukunopeus lisääntyy, joka auttaa ymmärtävän lukemisen kehittymiseen. Lolan Tavuviidakko on suunniteltu erityisesti 6-7 -vuotiaille lapsille.\n\nLolan Tavuviidakko jakautuu seuraaviin oppikokonaisuuksiin:\n• Helppoja vokaali- sekä soinnillisia konsonanttialkuisia sanoja: AA-SI\n• Helppoja vokaali- ja konsonanttialkuisia sanoja sisältäen geminaatan: HA-NA\n• Melko vaikeita 2 tavuisia sanoja sisältäen pitkiä vokaaleja: AAR-RE\n• Vaikeita 2 tavuisia sanoja sisältäen konsonanttiyhtymiä: jout-sen\n• Helppoja 3 tavuisia sanoja: en-ke-li\n• Vaikeita 3 tavuisia sanoja: ank-ku-ri\n• Vaikeita 3 tavuisia ja melko helppoja 4 tavuisia: juo-ma-la-si\n• Melko vaikeita 4 tavuisia: il-ma-pal-lo\n• Vaikeita 4 tavuisia: e-le-fant-ti\n\nSovelluksen käytettävyys on tuttua Lola Panda laatua ja graafinen ilme sekä animaatiot entistäkin hauskempia. Lola Pandan äänenä toimii yksi Suomen tunnetuimmista lastenohjelmien ääninäyttelijöistä, Johanna Ala-Siurua. \n\nTavuihin perustuva oppiminen jakoi aiemmin sekä opettajia, vanhempia että tutkijoita. Aikaisemmin lukemisen oppiminen tapahtui käytännössä aina tavujen kautta. Sittemmin tavuista luovuttiin lähes kokonaan. Tällä hetkellä tavujen merkitys on lähteestä riippumatta kuitenkin keskeisempi kuin 20 vuotta sitten. Erityisen hyvin tavut sopivat digitaalisiin ratkaisuihin kuten Lolan Tavuviidakkoon. Tavuihin perustuva oppiminen voi tuoda myös suuren avun oppimisvaikeustapauksiin.\n\nLolan Tavuviidakko soveltuu lapsille, joille esim. Lolan Aakkosjuna ja Lolan ABC-juhlat sovellukset ovat jo liian helppoja, mutta jotka eivät vielä osaa lukea sujuvasti. Lolan Tavuviidakko sopii erinomaisesti esikouluun sekä alakoulun 1. luokalle ja sitä voidaan käyttää ryhmässä tai yksin. Lapsi voi käyttää sovellusta yksin aloittamalla esim. helpolta tasolta, jolloin tehtävät vaikeutuvat oppimisen myötä. Vaihtoehtoisesti opettaja tai vanhempi voi valita sovelluksesta opeteltavan alueen jolloin jo aloitustaso on sopiva.\n\nJos lapsesi ei kuitenkaan osaa vielä kaikkia kirjaimia, niin silloin kannattaa hankkia Lolan Aakkosjuna ja harjoitella kirjainten tunnistamista Lolan seurassa. Jos on tarvetta lisäharjoittelulle kirjainten äänteissä, niin silloin oikea vaihtoehto on hankkia Lolan ABC-juhlat, jossa Lola opettaa lapsesi tunnistamaan kirjaimet äänteiden avulla.\n\nLisää tietoa laadukkaista Lola Pandan oppimissovelluksista löydät kotisivultamme: www.lolapanda.com/fi\n\nTervetuloa hauskan oppimisen ja Lolan Tavuviidakon pariin!\n\n*Lolan Tavuviidakko -sovelluksen ostajat saavat 100% oppimistakuun! Mikäli lapsesi harjoittelee läpi sovelluksen kaikki kolme tasoa, mutta ei opi lukemaan sanoja, ota tuolloin yhteyttä osoitteeseen: support@beiz.com. \n\nKysymme muutaman jatkokysymyksen tilastointia varten ja jokainen yhteyttä ottanut asiakas saa toisen ilmaisen Lola -sovelluksen! Vastaamme viesteihin muutamassa päivässä. Takuu kattaa 100% tapauksista."

You can travel around the world with numerous flying objects, cars and ships.\nYou can disguise yourself as a Viking, pirate or pilot. \n\nWith its numerous objects, this \"\"digital doll's house\"\" is perfect for creative role-playing.\nYour children will learn about the special features of different countries (Mexico, USA, India, France, the Caribbean and Germany) and discover differences but also numerous similarities.\nTo ensure that no child feels excluded, Fiete World contains a variety of people with different skin colours.\n\nNEW in this version: \nMEXICO\nWith horses, jeep, or pick-up truck through the jungle, walking through the city with a huge mechanical skeleton or with a hot air balloon over the cactus-covered desert. \nFeeding jungle animals, making chocolate, painting murals, making tacos or fighting with wrestlers. Mexico offers a lot of extreme variety.\n\nUSA\nChildren can ride a Ferris wheel in the colourful theme park and re-enact the moon landing or Jurassic Park in the film studio. They play with Kong the giant ape, visit the school and the record shop and when they are hungry they visit the burger shop or eat something at the hot dog stand. Then they can go to work at the harbour, play with the crane and unload ships.\n\nFRANCE\nIn venerable France, for example, children can sit in the evening in a chic café on the Seine under the Eiffel Tower, or they can play robber and gendarme with the police. Of course there is also a police helicopter, a police boat and a police car.\n\nINDIA\nIn densely populated India, the children can harvest tropical fruits and squeeze juices, change tires in the Auto Werkstadt, ride an elephant or work on the latest robot technology. What is particularly exciting here are the clear contrasts between tradition and technology.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS OF THE APP\n- Discover a huge world\n- Switch between day and night mode\n- Go on a treasure hunt, sail the pirate ship\n- Ride an elephant, dinosaur \n- Play with a robot or with a huge skeleton\n- Fell trees and use the wood to make a fire\n- Disguise yourself\n- plant flowers and vegetables\n- Change the wheels of all cars\n- Bake a cake\n- Fly a helicopter, a jet, a historic aircraft, a hot air balloon or a U.F.O.\n- have a picnic on the beach - deliver packages\n- Send postcards around the world\n- Discover souvenirs from all over the world in Fiete's room\n\nIMPROVE CHILDREN\n- Fantasy role playing games\n- Telling your own stories\n- Experiment\n- Interaction with others\n- Understanding the world\n- Open-mindedness\n\nABOUT US\nWe are Ahoiii, a small app development studio from Cologne.

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Highly recommended! - Five Stars!\nThis is the best app I've found for increasing my code accuracy and helping to increase my speed. Five Stars!\n\nHam Morse allows you to practice morse code on your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. It is designed particularly for Ham radio operators and others who wish to achieve or maintain a high level of proficiency in this classic mode of communication.\n\nHam morse has the following features:\n\nThe code is sent using the Farnsworth timing whereby the morse characters are sent at 15 words per minute (WPM) and then extra spacing is added to slow the overall WPM to speeds slower than 15 WPM. The farnsworth speed can be adjusted if you wish to use a speed other than 15WPM. The maximum speed that the morse can be sent at is 50 words per minute. The morse audio waveforms have a 5ms rise time to reduce key clicks and yet provide crisp code to copy.\n\nThe audio frequency can be varied from 220Hz up to 900Hz. A typical value might be around 700Hz but a lower tone can be very useful in some situations.\n\nThe code can be paused just in case you are interrupted or want to take a break, an incoming call on an iPhone pauses the code automatically.\n\nTo help you learn the morse code itself HamMorse allows you to practice a variety of sets of characters from individual random letters all the way to the current news stories from around the world.\n\nKoch - This setting uses the Koch character progression. It starts with just one letter and then you can add a new letter when you have mastered the previous character set. This is one of the most popular methods of learning the morse character set.\n\nLetters - Practice the individual letters, A-Z. Add new letters to your practice set using the settings page.\n\nNumbers - Practice the numbers, 0-9. Which numbers you practice can be controlled on the settings page.\n\nCallsigns - allows you to practice receiving random amateur radio callsigns, a mixture of letters and numbers (eg AA9PW, G1SNT, G5RV) that often prove troublesome when copying code on the air. HamMorse creates a wide variety of international callsigns using the standard ITU prefixes to provide useful practice where ever in the world you may be.\n\nPunctuation - provides a wide variety of punctuation and standard morse code prosigns.\n\nTop 100 and 500 most common words - this is a great way to start to recognize whole words the key to really improving your speed.\n\nNews feeds - these provide the opportunity to copy real sentences and keep up with the news at the same time. Note that the News feeds will only work with an active network connection.\n\nHam QSOs - listen to examples of typical on-air exchanges between ham radio operators - practice coping the callsigns, RST reports, location, rig, antenna and many other pieces of a typical QSO.\n\nAccessibility support - The app also has support for Apple's accessibility tool, Voice Over. When Voice Over is activated each button and field has an audible description available describing the button or slider and its use.\n\nText Delay - As an additional learning aid You can have the text appear a few seconds after the morse code is played so you have time to copy the letter before it appears on screen.\n\nText Filter - Filter out characters from the News feeds or QSOs that you are not yet familiar with so you can start practicing with real text even if you don't yet know the whole morse character set."

The difficulty of the exercises is gradually increased, starting with whole hours and continuing with half hours, quarter hours and so on. If it’s too challenging, just press the Hints button to get help with the time expressions. The app also contains exercises on elapsed time, such as ”What time is it in 20 minutes?”. In the final category you can test your acquired skills with a mix of different styled clocks.\n\nIn addition to the many exercises, there is also an experimental mode where the relationship between the clock and the time of day is illustrated with the passing of the sun and moon across the sky. You can freely drag the hands of the clock and see how the sky changes and also get the time read out load.\n\nThe app is suitable for children in grades K-3.\n\nCategories\n1. Tell the time\n2.

This app, Play ABC, Alfie Atkins, stimulates children's language learning skills by clearly connecting the function and purpose of letters in an experimental, playful way.\n\nAlfie has some extraordinary devices in his room: a letter tracer, a word machine and a puppet theatre. With the letter tracer, children will learn the appearance and sound of all letters and train their motor skills and muscle memory by drawing and tracing letters on the screen. Using Alfie's homemade word machine, children will spell new words using phonemes and letter tips. All new words are sent to the puppet theatre, where children use their creativity and imagination to tell fantastic stories. This playloop, with concrete results, has a motivational effect and helps children develop their language skills at their own pace.\n\nPlay ABC, Alfie Atkins is developed by language teachers and game designers. It was created and tested in collaboration with teachers and students of schools in Finland and Sweden. The app has been developed based on children's needs and does not feature points, time limits or other elements that could lead to failure or stress. Children will play and learn using the app on their own terms and at their own pace, in preschool, at school or at home.\n\nPlay and learn:\n  • The sounds, phonemes and names of letters\n  • How to trace letters\n  • How to spell around 100 different words\n  • How to read simple words\n  • Upper and lowercase letters\n  • Fine motor skills and eye-hand coordination\n  • The basics of literacy\n  • Creative storytelling\n\nThe app is available in 6 different languages, and the full version allows the creation of individual profiles for multiple children.\n\nThis is the premium, full, version of the app which enables:\n  • Preschools, schools and organisations can purchase the app through the volume purchase program (VPP)\n  • Family sharing is supported\n\nGro Play is an xEdu.co alumnus and member of the trade organization Swedish EdTech Industry.

They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

      "label": "There's never been a better time to get into Astronomy! Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text. This app never transmits data from your device.\n\n\nNote: Non-English localizations focus on solar system objects and constellation names."

Discover all the foods you can make and how you can make them!\n\nCREATE AN ORIGINAL VIDEO OF YOUR STORY\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice as you’re telling the story, along with your characters’ movements. Create farm videos up two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share later!\n\nFEATURES:\n- Explore four locations: barn, house, field and store.\n- Create stories for 29 new characters plus all the animals!\n- Feed the animals, milk the cow and gather eggs from your hens.\n- Bottle the milk from the milk tank.\n- Help the vet check the animals.\n- Let the pigs (or people!) wallow in the mud.\n- Clean up different types of animal poop!\n- Grab the banjo, fiddle, guitar or washbucket bass and jam into the night!\n- Pick fruit in your orchard.\n- Farm your crops from planting to harvest.\n- Use your tractor's different functions to farm faster!.\n- Fire up the food machine to turn your harvest into food.\n- Record your stories in the app and share with your friends!\n- No time limit or high scores — play for as long as you like!\n- No third-party advertising\n\nWE LISTEN\nSo many of you asked for a farm in the Toca Life series, and we're excited to give you what you want!

      "label": "Welcome to the game of copying silly faces! In GIGGLEBUG'S FACE RACE, your goal is to copy expressions and emotions from animated characters. The more accurately you twist your expressions, the higher score, and bigger laughs you can get. The game is a truly social experience with the iPhone or iPad. It is meant for kids of all ages and adults alike. \n\nHOW IT WORKS\nWe are proud to have developed an original face detection algorithm for this game. The device camera recognises positions of the eyes, cheeks, teeth, tongue and tilt of the head.  The game evaluates the expressions and game gives feedback in the form of a playful star rating. After playing the game, you will get a ridiculous collection of photos of yourself and your loved ones having a laugh. \n\nGIGGLEBUG VALUES\nGigglebug is an independent pre-school brand originating from Finland. It has been launched in 2013 to spread positivity. Gigglebug has been devised by pedagogical experts in Finland, one of the leading PISA ranked countries in the world. Gigglebug teaches positive ways of interacting, and aims to bring joy out of the screen and into the social space where children are playing.  When you can think positive, you can do anything better."

      "label": "The infosphere, Visualized.\n\nEvery time we use our phones, tablets or laptops we are entering an invisible world of wireless digital signals. It is a world that we cannot see but that is literally all around us.\nThe Architecture of Radio is a 360 degree data visualization of what this world might look like. It shows the cell towers, GPS satellites and Wi-Fi routers around you that allow us to live our digital lives.\n\nNew: support for Iphone X, XR, XS and XS Max Screens\nNew: Cardboard support!\nImmerse yourself in the Infosphere in Virtual Reality using a cardboard or compatible headset*\n\n*Carboard support only for iPhone. iPhone 6s or newer recommended for best performance.\n\nWhy should I use this app?\n\nOut of curiosity! We are increasingly dependent on a global ecosystem of digital signals. We use them for so many things, yet we cannot see them. We can see the roads we use to travel, the buildings we live in, but not the infrastructure that is changing the world. How can we understand this world without understanding how it works? \nThe purpose of this app is to make the invisible visible so we can look at it, think about it and discuss it.\n\nWhy Should I not use this app?\n\nThis app is not a measurement tool. It’s purpose is to inspire, to see the world through a different lens. The app is based on real world data and gives you a pretty good idea of the density of digital signals around you, but it won’t tell you where to move the couch to get a better WIFI signal.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is a data visualization, based on global open datasets of cell tower, Wi-Fi and satellite locations. Based on your GPS location the app shows a 360 degree visualization of signals around you. The dataset includes almost 7 million cell towers, 19 million Wi-Fi routers and hundreds of satellites.\n\nIs this really what radio signals look like?\n\nWe can’t see radio with our eyes. The waves that we use for our cell phones and Wi-Fi are way outside the spectrum of visible light. In order to “see” radio, it has to be interpreted or translated into an image that we can see. There are many ways to do that but it will always be an interpretation.\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is an impression of the infosphere, a way of seeing it."

The newest release brings many new features including full iPad support, balancing teams based on skill or gender, importing users from a file, enabling video output, and sharing teams via facebook or email. \n\nTeam Shake is the premier iOS App for creating teams. Instead of a hat and scraps of paper, the user enters his friends' names in his iPhone and gives it a shake. The screen will then display a random set of color-coded teams. These teams can immediately be used for game play or shared via facebook or email.   The quick and easy selection of random (or balanced) teams eliminates fighting over who will be on which team. Innovative use of the iPhone shake gesture gives users the satisfying feeling of shaking a virtual hat without the trouble of carrying around an actual hat. Conventional buttons can also be used for those who would rather not shake their expensive hardware about.  \n\nThe app is designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind. Names can easily be entered with the onscreen keyboard, chosen from the user's contacts, or imported from a file.

Depending on the child’s age, all animations and functions can run automatically or be controlled through a tap.\n\n7 interactive scenarios contain over 100 interactive animations and surprises:\n\n1. Steer the digger, fill the truck and repair the water pipe.\n2. Paint the house in different colours and unload the removals truck.\n3. Operate the crane and build a new roof for the house.\n4. Mix cement and build a real wall.\n5. Operate a big cement mixer and concrete a large area.\n6. Drive the street sweeper and clean the dirty road.\n7. Unload the crane truck and make sure it leaves on time.\n\nAmazing graphics, great animations, a user-friendly interface, no text and no in-app purchases.

I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside.

The world of science just got a little bit weirder and a lot more fun with Toca Lab: Plants!\n\nJust like with the first app in the Toca Lab Series, Toca Lab: Elements, your curiosity will lead the way. Choose your plant, then visit five different locations in the lab:\n\n● Grow light: Shine the light on your plant and watch what happens! Does your plant bask and happily sigh in the light, or groan and wriggle away? What happens when you turn the light up a notch or two?\n\n● Watering tank: Put your plant in the tank and fill it up with water. Will your plant float? How does your plant behave when it’s soaking wet?\n\n● Nutrition station: What’s the optimal diet for your plant? Try the three different nutrition formulas and discover which ones your plant character likes!\n\n● Cloning machine: Spin the wheel on the cloning machine and before you know it, you’ll have five little versions of your plant. Wonder what the clones can do? Experiment and find out!\n\n● Crossbreeding apparatus: Here you can mix two plants to create something unexpected. Try it and see what happens!\n\nHave fun experimenting at each station to see how the plants evolve. Keep experimenting until you’ve collected all 35 plant characters in the app. Once you’ve collected a plant, keep experimenting to continue to evolve it! Who says kids can’t be scientists? Toca Lab: Plants brings out the budding botanist in everybody!\n\nFEATURES\n- Start with one plant and experiment your way to 35 different plant characters, each with its own unique personality!\n- Continue to evolve existing plants through experimentation!\n- Evolve plants with five lab tools: grow light, watering tank, nutrition station, cloning machine and the crossbreeding apparatus.\n- Discover plants from five groups: green algae, mosses, ferns, trees and flowering plants.\n- Learn the names and Latin names of real-life plants!\n\n--\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

How big is a planet, compared to a human? And how small is an atom really? You can’t fully wrap your head around the scope of things by just reading about them – so this app lets you experience them in comparison to get a feeling for their true scale. By simply swiping you can zoom in and out all the way from the world of fundamental particles up to the largest stars at the edge of the observable universe. \n\nSeamless zooming between the scales of 10^-35 meters to 10^26 meters (no math required) \n\nAmazing fun facts for various scale levels, like the smallest bacterium and the largest black hole \n\nTap any object for an explanation of what it is and how it works\n\nBeautifully animated illustration of more than 250 objects\n\nOriginal Kurzgesagt music to complement your experience"

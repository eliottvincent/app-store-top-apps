Your children can then use the coins to unlock other cute characters.\nA motivating math app that has your children solving hundreds of math tasks in just minutes. Efficient math practice for grade school!\n\nLearning principle: how children have fun learning math\nOur tests have shown children voluntarily solving hundreds of tasks in a short time. On paper, that would be almost impossible.\n\nThe game principle is easy to understand: For every correctly solved task, the player jumps one step up the stairs. If the answer is wrong, they jump down one level.\nEach task solved is rewarded with a coin. But some tasks offer bonuses.\nYour children can then use the coins to unlock other characters.\n\nThe direct feedback and the proven reward system motivates the children to keep solving tasks.\nOur goal with Fiete Math Climber is for children to do arithmetic voluntarily because it's fun and they can see their progress.\n\nBehind the scenes, the app analyzes the child's task-solving style and continuously adjusts the difficulty.\nBy gently increasing the challenge, their motivation increases and they gain self-confidence in solving math tasks.\n\nNevertheless, it is always up to the children to decide how difficult they want the tasks to be: they can skip tasks they find too difficult, simplify them, or even make them harder.\nThis freedom keeps their motivation high and ensures that your child will have fun with this math app for a long time.\n\nHelps parents and teachers to identify and resolve issues\nThe app continuously analyzes the child's arithmetic and reveals the child's skills and potential issues with certain tasks. \nThe analytics algorithm immediately identifies issues and creates targeted sets of tasks.\nThe perfect add-on for math class.\n\nThe task list shows parents and teachers what tasks the child has tackled. \nThis makes it possible to see how far the child's skills have come and why they have issues with certain tasks. It will also parents and teachers to help address these issues.\n\nUser management allows multiple students to use the app at the same time.Extensive statistics provide information on whether a child is really improving.\n\n\nFeatures\n- Contains all arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n- Number range adjustable from 1 to 1,000\n- Pre-configured exercise sets include: arithmetic up to 20, multiplication tables, carrying tens, etc.\n- suitable for children ages 5 to 10\n- targeted training possible\n- task definition is comprehensively adjustable\n- motivation through entertaining game structure with direct feedback\n- long-term motivation through the possibility of collecting figures \n- user management\n - multiple players possible\n- statistics show learning progress\n- display all tasks solved\n- skills analysis\n- identify skills and potential issues\n- secure\n- all data remains on the device\n\n\nSUPPORT INFORMATION\nWe do our best to test our apps on all devices.

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile.

Spotlight important content or action. Reflector Director brings screens to center stage for emphasis. Eliminate distractions by enabling full-screen mode. \n \nPreview Screens \nReflector Director shows screen previews of any devices that are connected to Reflector 4, even if the screen is hidden to your audience. This allows you to know what’s going to be presented before you show a connected device screen to others in the room. \n \nKeep Audience Focused \nAdd Reflector Director to any classroom or collaborative space to create a distraction-free environment. Spend more time concentrating on people and less time in front of a computer screen. \n \nDevice Frames \nUse Reflector Director to select new device frames to display on mirrored screens, or choose to hide frames entirely. Displaying a frame around devices adds a polished and professional feel. \n \nSecure Pairing \nPairing Reflector Director to Reflector 4 is easy and secure. Reflector Director even helps you easily connect to a computer’s Reflector software on limited and restricted networks. The apps are paired directly together with no in-between connections. Use a Quick Connect Code (TM), QR Code or Bluetooth to easily pair. \n \nHow It Works \nSimply open the Reflector Director app on your iOS device and connect to the Reflector 4 software on your computer to begin managing the devices that are connected to the Reflector software. \n \nReflector Director allows you to step away from your computer while still controlling how your audience views the devices that are connected to Reflector 4. Easily show and hide devices, emphasize screens, enable full-screen mode or change device frames all while away from your computer. \n \nReflector Director is compatible with Reflector 4. It REQUIRES this application running on your computer: https://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector/download/ \n \nNOTE: Reflector Director does NOT allow you to mirror a device to your iPhone or iPad.

You can travel around the world with numerous flying objects, cars and ships.\nYou can disguise yourself as a Viking, pirate or pilot. \n\nWith its numerous objects, this \"\"digital doll's house\"\" is perfect for creative role-playing.\nYour children will learn about the special features of different countries (Mexico, USA, India, France, the Caribbean and Germany) and discover differences but also numerous similarities.\nTo ensure that no child feels excluded, Fiete World contains a variety of people with different skin colours.\n\nNEW in this version: \nMEXICO\nWith horses, jeep, or pick-up truck through the jungle, walking through the city with a huge mechanical skeleton or with a hot air balloon over the cactus-covered desert. \nFeeding jungle animals, making chocolate, painting murals, making tacos or fighting with wrestlers. Mexico offers a lot of extreme variety.\n\nUSA\nChildren can ride a Ferris wheel in the colourful theme park and re-enact the moon landing or Jurassic Park in the film studio. They play with Kong the giant ape, visit the school and the record shop and when they are hungry they visit the burger shop or eat something at the hot dog stand. Then they can go to work at the harbour, play with the crane and unload ships.\n\nFRANCE\nIn venerable France, for example, children can sit in the evening in a chic café on the Seine under the Eiffel Tower, or they can play robber and gendarme with the police. Of course there is also a police helicopter, a police boat and a police car.\n\nINDIA\nIn densely populated India, the children can harvest tropical fruits and squeeze juices, change tires in the Auto Werkstadt, ride an elephant or work on the latest robot technology. What is particularly exciting here are the clear contrasts between tradition and technology.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS OF THE APP\n- Discover a huge world\n- Switch between day and night mode\n- Go on a treasure hunt, sail the pirate ship\n- Ride an elephant, dinosaur \n- Play with a robot or with a huge skeleton\n- Fell trees and use the wood to make a fire\n- Disguise yourself\n- plant flowers and vegetables\n- Change the wheels of all cars\n- Bake a cake\n- Fly a helicopter, a jet, a historic aircraft, a hot air balloon or a U.F.O.\n- have a picnic on the beach - deliver packages\n- Send postcards around the world\n- Discover souvenirs from all over the world in Fiete's room\n\nIMPROVE CHILDREN\n- Fantasy role playing games\n- Telling your own stories\n- Experiment\n- Interaction with others\n- Understanding the world\n- Open-mindedness\n\nABOUT US\nWe are Ahoiii, a small app development studio from Cologne.

Ride motorcycles and camp out under the stars! You can play your way in Toca Life: Stable!\n\nEXPLORE AN EXCITING WORLD\nTHE STABLE: Step into the stable and can care for your horses. Wash them, brush them, then saddle up for a trot. When you're finished grooming your horses (and cleaning up their poop!), take a well-deserved break in the club room.\n\nTHE ARENA: Next, advance to the arena and show off your horse's jumping skills. Hear the cheers when the winners take their place on the podium. After the celebration, you can race motorcycles in the arena — vroom! — or get a snack in the food court.\n\nTHE FOREST: Ready to frolic in the forest? Choose your most trusted horse and head off for an adventure in the woods, where you can sleep under the stars in your sleeping bag, then wake up for a swim in the waterfall.\n\nTHE SHOP: When you need more horse tack, head over to the shop — you'll find everything you need.\n\nTRAVEL BETWEEN LOCATIONS\nEach location gives you access to the horse transport, so you can get your horses, equipment, bikes and even characters from here to there. Put what you want to move into the transport, close the door and select the new location by tapping an icon. Everything will arrive in the selected location so you can begin your next adventure!\n\nCREATE AN ORIGINAL VIDEO OF YOUR STORY\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice as you’re telling the story, along with your characters’ movements. Create videos up two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share later!\n\nFEATURES:\n- Explore four locations: stable, arena, forest and shop.\n- Create stories for 24 new characters plus horses and other animals!\n- Care for your horses: feed them, lather them up till they're nice and clean, brush them. \n- Choose outfits from your favorite themes: medieval, western, everyday stable life and fantasy!\n- Hop on to ride bikes in the forest and race motorcycles in the arena!\n- Set up obstacles and show off your horse's jumping skills!\n- Eat at the food court and use the portable potties!\n- Have a campout! \n- Snuggle into your sleeping bag to stay warm under the stars! \n- Take a canoe ride or swim by a waterfall.\n- Make music with magical lily pads!\n- Move horses, characters and objects from here to there in the horse transport! \n- Record your stories in the app and share with your friends!\n- No time limit or high scores — play for as long as you like!\n- No third-party advertising\n\nWE LISTEN\nOne of our top requests for the Toca Life series has been horses!

      "label": "***** 5/5 stars  EducationalAppStore.com *****\nLetraKid is an educational game addressed to children (4-8 years old) that can help them to learn pre-cursive and print block handwriting correctly, while having fun when doing so!\n\nWHAT KIDS CAN LEARN FROM THIS GAME\n\n• Recognize letter shapes and perfect alphabet pronunciation\n• The correct letter formation: start, checkpoints, strokes direction, order etc. Difficulty Levels 1 and 2 with assisted writing are designed to focus on the letter formation.\n• Develop fine motor skills for handwriting activity. Difficulty Levels 3 to 5 with freehand writing activities will focus on this improvement to help maximize confidence and form when writing.\n• Playing with a stylus pen will also help to improve standard pencil grasp. Any stylus compatible with the device will work.\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n\n• 16 languages with full support for interface, human native voices for letter/numbers pronunciation and full official alphabets. (ENGLISH, ESPAÑOL, FRANÇAIS, DEUTSCH, ITALIANO, PORTUGUÊS, NEDERLANDS, SVENSKA, NORSK, DANSK, SUOMI, ROMÂNĂ, JĘZYK POLSKI, TÜRKÇE, BAHASA INDONESIA and BAHASA MELAYU)\n• 3 popular letter formation rules that will provide flexibility for picking the right stroke order and direction for the child. Vital for improving grasp on key terms and rulings within handwriting.\n• Makes use of the 10 most used fonts in classes all over the world for learning pre cursive and print block handwriting: ZB style, HWT style, DN style, German(Hamburg) style and Euro Latino.\n• Full support for both Left and Right handwriting rules.\n• 5 difficulty levels with AUTO and LOCK settings, ranging from assisted writing for beginners, up to real freehand writing with minimal support and strict evaluation.\n• 4 set of glyphs: ABC (full alphabet for upper case letters), abc (full alphabet for lower case letters), 123 (numbers from 0 to 9) and a special set of signs for funny exercises.\n• 5 progression levels, color coded for each glyph that allows parents and teachers an instant evaluation of the progression and most exercised letters at the alphabet level.\n• 16 funny sticker rewards that will unlock after progression milestones are reached. Also, their drawing rules after each completed progression at Alphabet/glyph list level.\n• 3 profile slots with 50 funny avatars and name customization that will save independently the settings and the progression.\n• Full support for both Landscape and Portrait orientations.\n\nGREAT IN THE CLASSROOM!\n\nWith a unique and real-time feedback feature as well as complex tracing evaluation algorithms, LetraKid is not just another tracing app.\n\nThis is a new approach, focused on creating a fun game by utilizing handwriting mechanics itself. This avoids using distracting random rewards or secondary game mechanics that can break and confuse the learning process, optimizing learning progress and educational appeal to children.\n\nThe real time feedback will give both audio and graphic clues about the quality of the tracing and will adjust with difficulty level.\nOur tracing evaluation algorithms allow for an accurate and fun reward, using a 5 star rating for each exercise. This engages and motivates the kids to progress and to strive for more.\n\nDESIGNED for KIDS\n\n• No ads or irritating pop-ups.\n• No collection of personal data\n• Game settings are by default behind a parental gate. This can be disabled, but ensures a child to work with a certain font, formation rule, difficulty level and various other features for total specification to their needs.\n• External links are protected by a permanent parental gate and includes upgrade to full version, feedback and social media usage to help follow the latest news and changes with regards to the platform.\n\nGot any ideas for improving LetraKid? Then please send us your feedback and requests."

Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text. This app never transmits data from your device.\n\n\nNote: Non-English localizations focus on solar system objects and constellation names."

      "label": "Lolan Tavuviidakko on uusin sovelluksemme, joten se on rakennettu huolella kymmenien miljoonien Lola Panda asiakkaiden oppimistuloksiin perustuen. Tällä sovelluksella on lukemisen oppimistakuu – katso tiedot kuvauksen lopusta!\n\nHyvä lukutaito antaa lapselle eväät kaikkeen oppimiseen kouluvuosien aikana. Tavujen hahmottaminen on tärkeää lukemista opeteltaessa. Tällöin lukunopeus lisääntyy, joka auttaa ymmärtävän lukemisen kehittymiseen. Lolan Tavuviidakko on suunniteltu erityisesti 6-7 -vuotiaille lapsille.\n\nLolan Tavuviidakko jakautuu seuraaviin oppikokonaisuuksiin:\n• Helppoja vokaali- sekä soinnillisia konsonanttialkuisia sanoja: AA-SI\n• Helppoja vokaali- ja konsonanttialkuisia sanoja sisältäen geminaatan: HA-NA\n• Melko vaikeita 2 tavuisia sanoja sisältäen pitkiä vokaaleja: AAR-RE\n• Vaikeita 2 tavuisia sanoja sisältäen konsonanttiyhtymiä: jout-sen\n• Helppoja 3 tavuisia sanoja: en-ke-li\n• Vaikeita 3 tavuisia sanoja: ank-ku-ri\n• Vaikeita 3 tavuisia ja melko helppoja 4 tavuisia: juo-ma-la-si\n• Melko vaikeita 4 tavuisia: il-ma-pal-lo\n• Vaikeita 4 tavuisia: e-le-fant-ti\n\nSovelluksen käytettävyys on tuttua Lola Panda laatua ja graafinen ilme sekä animaatiot entistäkin hauskempia. Lola Pandan äänenä toimii yksi Suomen tunnetuimmista lastenohjelmien ääninäyttelijöistä, Johanna Ala-Siurua. \n\nTavuihin perustuva oppiminen jakoi aiemmin sekä opettajia, vanhempia että tutkijoita. Aikaisemmin lukemisen oppiminen tapahtui käytännössä aina tavujen kautta. Sittemmin tavuista luovuttiin lähes kokonaan. Tällä hetkellä tavujen merkitys on lähteestä riippumatta kuitenkin keskeisempi kuin 20 vuotta sitten. Erityisen hyvin tavut sopivat digitaalisiin ratkaisuihin kuten Lolan Tavuviidakkoon. Tavuihin perustuva oppiminen voi tuoda myös suuren avun oppimisvaikeustapauksiin.\n\nLolan Tavuviidakko soveltuu lapsille, joille esim. Lolan Aakkosjuna ja Lolan ABC-juhlat sovellukset ovat jo liian helppoja, mutta jotka eivät vielä osaa lukea sujuvasti. Lolan Tavuviidakko sopii erinomaisesti esikouluun sekä alakoulun 1. luokalle ja sitä voidaan käyttää ryhmässä tai yksin. Lapsi voi käyttää sovellusta yksin aloittamalla esim. helpolta tasolta, jolloin tehtävät vaikeutuvat oppimisen myötä. Vaihtoehtoisesti opettaja tai vanhempi voi valita sovelluksesta opeteltavan alueen jolloin jo aloitustaso on sopiva.\n\nJos lapsesi ei kuitenkaan osaa vielä kaikkia kirjaimia, niin silloin kannattaa hankkia Lolan Aakkosjuna ja harjoitella kirjainten tunnistamista Lolan seurassa. Jos on tarvetta lisäharjoittelulle kirjainten äänteissä, niin silloin oikea vaihtoehto on hankkia Lolan ABC-juhlat, jossa Lola opettaa lapsesi tunnistamaan kirjaimet äänteiden avulla.\n\nLisää tietoa laadukkaista Lola Pandan oppimissovelluksista löydät kotisivultamme: www.lolapanda.com/fi\n\nTervetuloa hauskan oppimisen ja Lolan Tavuviidakon pariin!\n\n*Lolan Tavuviidakko -sovelluksen ostajat saavat 100% oppimistakuun! Mikäli lapsesi harjoittelee läpi sovelluksen kaikki kolme tasoa, mutta ei opi lukemaan sanoja, ota tuolloin yhteyttä osoitteeseen: support@beiz.com. \n\nKysymme muutaman jatkokysymyksen tilastointia varten ja jokainen yhteyttä ottanut asiakas saa toisen ilmaisen Lola -sovelluksen! Vastaamme viesteihin muutamassa päivässä. Takuu kattaa 100% tapauksista."

After shopping, grab a bite to eat at the pet shop cafe, where pets get a table too!\n\nBREEDER’S BUNGALOW: Here’s where the pet breeder starts and ends their day. The bungalow is, of course, filled with pets — hiding in the greenhouse and playing in the yard and splashing in mud. Don’t worry, the giant bathtub gets everyone clean again!\n\nENJOY A FREE GIFT\nBundled with Toca Life: Pets is a free pack of 18 exclusive iMessage stickers! Add pet stickers to your messages to express yourself in a fun way.\n\nFEATURES\nRole-play in five locations: pet park, pet hotel, veterinary, pet shop and breeder’s bungalow.\n- Meet 23 new characters.\n- Play with and care for 124 real and fantasy animals. \n- Bathe muddy pets and get them clean again!\n- Pretend to be a vet and care for sick and injured pets.\n- Dress your pets in fun hats — stack hats on hats on hats!\n- Pets can pee and poop!\n- Keep spaces clean by cleaning up all the pet poop!\n- Poop is also stackable! Stack the poop high, bag it up and discard!\n- Build an agility course to train pets and help them get the exercise they need.\n- Pull the branch in the pet park to discover a surprise!\n\nLIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice and your characters’ movements as you’re telling the story. Create videos up to two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share your storytelling later! \n\nAbout Us:\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

The more accurately you twist your expressions, the higher score, and bigger laughs you can get. The game is a truly social experience with the iPhone or iPad. It is meant for kids of all ages and adults alike. \n\nHOW IT WORKS\nWe are proud to have developed an original face detection algorithm for this game. The device camera recognises positions of the eyes, cheeks, teeth, tongue and tilt of the head.  The game evaluates the expressions and game gives feedback in the form of a playful star rating. After playing the game, you will get a ridiculous collection of photos of yourself and your loved ones having a laugh. \n\nGIGGLEBUG VALUES\nGigglebug is an independent pre-school brand originating from Finland. It has been launched in 2013 to spread positivity. Gigglebug has been devised by pedagogical experts in Finland, one of the leading PISA ranked countries in the world. Gigglebug teaches positive ways of interacting, and aims to bring joy out of the screen and into the social space where children are playing.  When you can think positive, you can do anything better."

      "label": "The infosphere, Visualized.\n\nEvery time we use our phones, tablets or laptops we are entering an invisible world of wireless digital signals. It is a world that we cannot see but that is literally all around us.\nThe Architecture of Radio is a 360 degree data visualization of what this world might look like. It shows the cell towers, GPS satellites and Wi-Fi routers around you that allow us to live our digital lives.\n\nNew: support for Iphone X, XR, XS and XS Max Screens\nNew: Cardboard support!\nImmerse yourself in the Infosphere in Virtual Reality using a cardboard or compatible headset*\n\n*Carboard support only for iPhone. iPhone 6s or newer recommended for best performance.\n\nWhy should I use this app?\n\nOut of curiosity! We are increasingly dependent on a global ecosystem of digital signals. We use them for so many things, yet we cannot see them. We can see the roads we use to travel, the buildings we live in, but not the infrastructure that is changing the world. How can we understand this world without understanding how it works? \nThe purpose of this app is to make the invisible visible so we can look at it, think about it and discuss it.\n\nWhy Should I not use this app?\n\nThis app is not a measurement tool. It’s purpose is to inspire, to see the world through a different lens. The app is based on real world data and gives you a pretty good idea of the density of digital signals around you, but it won’t tell you where to move the couch to get a better WIFI signal.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is a data visualization, based on global open datasets of cell tower, Wi-Fi and satellite locations. Based on your GPS location the app shows a 360 degree visualization of signals around you. The dataset includes almost 7 million cell towers, 19 million Wi-Fi routers and hundreds of satellites.\n\nIs this really what radio signals look like?\n\nWe can’t see radio with our eyes. The waves that we use for our cell phones and Wi-Fi are way outside the spectrum of visible light. In order to “see” radio, it has to be interpreted or translated into an image that we can see. There are many ways to do that but it will always be an interpretation.\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is an impression of the infosphere, a way of seeing it."

      "label": "Team Shake provides a technological and environmentally friendly way to choose teams for board games, sporting events, tournaments, school projects or anytime groups are required. The newest release brings many new features including full iPad support, balancing teams based on skill or gender, importing users from a file, enabling video output, and sharing teams via facebook or email. \n\nTeam Shake is the premier iOS App for creating teams. Instead of a hat and scraps of paper, the user enters his friends' names in his iPhone and gives it a shake. The screen will then display a random set of color-coded teams. These teams can immediately be used for game play or shared via facebook or email.   The quick and easy selection of random (or balanced) teams eliminates fighting over who will be on which team. Innovative use of the iPhone shake gesture gives users the satisfying feeling of shaking a virtual hat without the trouble of carrying around an actual hat. Conventional buttons can also be used for those who would rather not shake their expensive hardware about.  \n\nThe app is designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind. Names can easily be entered with the onscreen keyboard, chosen from the user's contacts, or imported from a file. The email and facebook functions document the members of each individual team as well as preserving the team number and color assigned by the app. For repeated use of Team Shake, lists of friends can be easily saved and loaded later. The current list is also automatically saved so that if you exit the app, or even reboot the device, changes will not be lost. For teachers and others with large lists of people, Team Shake supports the ability to import teams from text or csv files.\n\nIf you have any problems, feature requests, or comments please send an email to support@rhine-o.com. \n\nFeatures:\n\n* Create 1 to 64 random teams\n* Create completely random or balanced teams\n* Full iPad support\n* Eliminates fighting over choosing teams\n* Share / Save teams via email or Facebook\n* Teams can be chosen by the number of teams or by the size of teams.\n* Save lists of friends for later games\n* Import lists from email or spreadsheet\n* Export lists and options for use on another device\n* Satisfying feeling of shaking a “virtual” hat to create teams\n* Animated shaking hat\n* Entry of names via onscreen keyboard\n* Entry of names via iPhone contacts\n* Temporarily disable people who are absent\n* Set groups of people to always be on the same team\n* Set groups of people to always be on different teams\n* Set user strength to make more even teams (now supports fully balanced teams)\n* 5 users strengths level\n* Pick a single random person from the list of players\n* User strength indicator on the main screen (can be disabled in options)\n* Number of active players and total players is now displayed on the main screen\n* Video Out Support\n* Option to Sort Teams by Name\n* Option to balance male / female team members\n* \"Equal Ability\" option to create teams where all players have the same strength\n* Option to create separate male and female teams\n* Configurable Team Colors\n* Configurable Team Names\n* Print Support\n* Export Teams in CSV or XLS Format\n* Team Shake now supports simultaneously assigning players to multiple subteams and / or oppose teams at the same time.\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now have customized names to make selection easier\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now be enabled or disabled globally so that teams can be made quickly without subteams / oppose teams.  In particular, Balance Teams Strengths will work when separate Male / Female teams are created.\n\nYappler-Tags: Teams, Groups, Random, Hat, Entertainment, Games, Utilities"

      "label": "Little Builders - construction site fun for 2-6 year old children!\n\n2 new scenes added. Drive the street sweeper and unload the truck crane!\n\nOn our construction site your child can drive a digger, mix cement, roof a building, operate a crane, drive a street sweeper or paint a house. There’s so much to do here. Our Little Builders dig, plaster, fill, paint and mix... And they need your children´s help.\n\nAt the same time they can watch funny things happen, because on every building site there’s always something going wrong. Water suddenly bursts from a pipe, a builder falls into a hole or the wind blows the bricks away because the cement wasn’t dry yet.\n\nLittle Builders is the first 3D app for children aged 2-6 years that want to explore the world of being a real little builder. Depending on the child’s age, all animations and functions can run automatically or be controlled through a tap.\n\n7 interactive scenarios contain over 100 interactive animations and surprises:\n\n1. Steer the digger, fill the truck and repair the water pipe.\n2. Paint the house in different colours and unload the removals truck.\n3. Operate the crane and build a new roof for the house.\n4. Mix cement and build a real wall.\n5. Operate a big cement mixer and concrete a large area.\n6. Drive the street sweeper and clean the dirty road.\n7. Unload the crane truck and make sure it leaves on time.\n\nAmazing graphics, great animations, a user-friendly interface, no text and no in-app purchases. Download now and start building!\n\nPlease also check out our other great Apps for kids:\n\n„PETTING ZOO“ - is a fantastic storybook app for the iPad and iPhone. It features beautiful, fun, interactive animations of over 20 animals, and it’s bound to be a big favorite for kids and animal lovers of all ages.\n\n„NIGHTY NIGHT“ - is the perfect App for a daily go-to-sleep ritual with lovely animals, sweet music and great narration.\n\n„LITTLE FOX MUSIC BOX“ – is a sing-along songbook with more than 100 interactive elements in 3 songs and the little fox music studio where you can record your own songs.\n\nIf you experience any trouble with the App or have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us any time: contact@foxandsheep.com.

Some say that strange experiments are going on in the living room. One kid I know absolutely swears they heard weird music coming from the basement. Can a house sing? I’ve also talked to kids who say the entire kitchen is covered in slime. Even my best friend, who never believes anything, told me the house is alive!\n\nI had to see for myself\n\nI did, I swear. I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside. I could really use a partner, though. Seriously, will you come with me?\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nPrivacy is an issue that we take very seriously.

The world of science just got a little bit weirder and a lot more fun with Toca Lab: Plants!\n\nJust like with the first app in the Toca Lab Series, Toca Lab: Elements, your curiosity will lead the way. Choose your plant, then visit five different locations in the lab:\n\n● Grow light: Shine the light on your plant and watch what happens! Does your plant bask and happily sigh in the light, or groan and wriggle away? What happens when you turn the light up a notch or two?\n\n● Watering tank: Put your plant in the tank and fill it up with water. Will your plant float? How does your plant behave when it’s soaking wet?\n\n● Nutrition station: What’s the optimal diet for your plant? Try the three different nutrition formulas and discover which ones your plant character likes!\n\n● Cloning machine: Spin the wheel on the cloning machine and before you know it, you’ll have five little versions of your plant. Wonder what the clones can do? Experiment and find out!\n\n● Crossbreeding apparatus: Here you can mix two plants to create something unexpected. Try it and see what happens!\n\nHave fun experimenting at each station to see how the plants evolve. Keep experimenting until you’ve collected all 35 plant characters in the app. Once you’ve collected a plant, keep experimenting to continue to evolve it! Who says kids can’t be scientists? Toca Lab: Plants brings out the budding botanist in everybody!\n\nFEATURES\n- Start with one plant and experiment your way to 35 different plant characters, each with its own unique personality!\n- Continue to evolve existing plants through experimentation!\n- Evolve plants with five lab tools: grow light, watering tank, nutrition station, cloning machine and the crossbreeding apparatus.\n- Discover plants from five groups: green algae, mosses, ferns, trees and flowering plants.\n- Learn the names and Latin names of real-life plants!\n\n--\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

The world of science just got a little bit weirder and a lot more fun with Toca Lab: Plants!\n\nJust like with the first app in the Toca Lab Series, Toca Lab: Elements, your curiosity will lead the way. Choose your plant, then visit five different locations in the lab:\n\n● Grow light: Shine the light on your plant and watch what happens! Does your plant bask and happily sigh in the light, or groan and wriggle away? What happens when you turn the light up a notch or two?\n\n● Watering tank: Put your plant in the tank and fill it up with water. Will your plant float? How does your plant behave when it’s soaking wet?\n\n● Nutrition station: What’s the optimal diet for your plant? Try the three different nutrition formulas and discover which ones your plant character likes!\n\n● Cloning machine: Spin the wheel on the cloning machine and before you know it, you’ll have five little versions of your plant. Wonder what the clones can do? Experiment and find out!\n\n● Crossbreeding apparatus: Here you can mix two plants to create something unexpected. Try it and see what happens!\n\nHave fun experimenting at each station to see how the plants evolve. Keep experimenting until you’ve collected all 35 plant characters in the app. Once you’ve collected a plant, keep experimenting to continue to evolve it! Who says kids can’t be scientists?

It helpful for musicians from beginners to experts and allows you to understand musical structures and find inspiration.\n\nAll chords and scales can be played ascending, descending and harmonically and  are shown on virtual piano and staff. The root note and inversion of the chords can easily be changed. App also includes song composer that allows you to easily layout chords progressions and recommend chords based on selected scale.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFeatures\n\n* Large chord collection;\n* Large scale collection;\n* Chord progressions collection;\n* Song composer with chord recommendations\n* Audio playback support for everything;\n* Piano view for chords and scales\n* Staff view for chords and scales\n* Find chords by the root and inversion, notes on staff or piano keys;\n* Find scales by the root or piano keys;\n* Interactive circle of fifths;\n* MIDI in and out support;\n* Scale fingerings for both hands.\n* Simple and intuitive.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nUser Reviews\n\nI'm a piano teacher of 15 years and have more and more students who want to play chords and improvise. This app is a perfect resource for them. I like it because it's thorough but at the same time very simple.\n\nI am new to piano, familiar with some scales, and chord progressions but this app will really help me to understand and explore various combinations. I pair this app with additional learning material online to help me fully understand the math / science behind the music.\n\nThis app is great for understanding scales, chords, chord progressions, and the circle if fifths. I like the easy to use interface. It only includes common scales and chords. I have another app that has tons of complicated and confusing scales that I've never heard of much less can pronounce. I just wanted something to show me the common scales and chords, and this app does it. It also sounds the chord or scale.\n\nIt gives you so much when you’re stuck composing. I’m relatively new to music theory, and for me, this makes everything I’ve been learning about chords super clear.\n\nI have taught piano for 33 years. This is the best app for any level student. It is so easy to use and kids love it when I use the iPad in their lesson."

If it’s too challenging, just press the Hints button to get help with the time expressions. The app also contains exercises on elapsed time, such as ”What time is it in 20 minutes?”. In the final category you can test your acquired skills with a mix of different styled clocks.\n\nIn addition to the many exercises, there is also an experimental mode where the relationship between the clock and the time of day is illustrated with the passing of the sun and moon across the sky. You can freely drag the hands of the clock and see how the sky changes and also get the time read out load.\n\nThe app is suitable for children in grades K-3.\n\nCategories\n1. Tell the time\n2.

Crazy Gears is a new-aged digital puzzle game, designed with a real mechanical engine and with children's critical thinking skills in mind! Hours of fun guaranteed for everyone who is up for the challenge, yes, even you Mom & Dad!\n\n*** Children's Technology Review Awards 2015 ***\n*** Parent's Choice Gold Winner Fall 2015***\n*** App of the week by Fun2Tap ***\n*** Best of the Best by Best Apps For Kids ***\n*** Featured worldwide by App Store as a Best New App ***\n\n\nABOUT CRAZY GEARS\nExplore a captivating digital playground in this tantalizing puzzle game! Children manipulate gears, chains, rods, and pulleys, to pull themselves through each level, which teaches them how different mechanisms affect one another when constructing a machine. Each reasoning challenge was carefully designed to adhere to the theories of educational technology pioneer, mathematician, computer scientist, and designer of the first programming language for children, Seymour Papert.\n\n“The best use of games is to leverage their tendency to enhance learning”- Papert\nRecommended Ages 5-9 \n\nAs a child, Papert fell in love with gears. Their movement fascinated him in every way and inspired his career. Crazy Gears was conceived not only as a tribute to him, but with the hope of providing a child with the inspiration to discover and understand the physical properties of mechanisms found in their everyday lives. Such complex notions include tension, motion, and gravity. We achieve this by encouraging the child to manipulate the objects in each level to determine how they work together to accomplish a goal.  Interactions with technology give kids the power to construct their understanding of STEM/STEAM subjects in meaningful ways. Here we engage them in play that does just that!\n\n\nFEATURES\n• No rules\n• No explicit instructions \n• Kid-Friendly​ Design\n• Powerful Artificial Intelligence\n• Seamless Interaction\n• Multiple Language Support\n• Crash Resistant Design\n• Bold, bright colors\n• Automatic Memory\n• Special mode for children with CVI\n\nSTEM/STEAM TOPICS EXPLORED\n• Gears \n• Mechanical Systems (simple and complex) \n• Action and Reaction \n• Motion (circular, rotary, and reciprocating) \n• Ratios\n• Tension\n• Torque and Speed\n• Mechanical Advantage \n\nABOUT US\nEdoki Academy’s mission is to provide children with enjoyable early-learning activities using the latest technologies. Our team members, many of whom are young parents or teachers, strive to produce tools that motivate and inspire children to learn, play, and progress. \n\nPRIVACY\nWe take your child’s privacy very seriously, for this reason, we are proud to offer a product that is certified COPPA compliant by PRIVO. \n\nCONNECT WITH US!\nIf you have any support requests, comments, or questions do not hesitate to contact us at support@edokiacademy.com.

Discover concepts such as sequencing, actions, loops, conditionals or events.\r\n\r\nPlay and learn as you unlock levels and incorporate new elements to develop your logical thinking while collecting coins, opening chests and avoiding being caught by your enemies: jump on top of the turtle, make sure that the carnivorous plant doesn't appear and dodge the projectiles as you advance towards the flag. \r\n\r\nSome elements of the game will remind you of the famous \"Super Mario Bros\", the game that introduced many of us to platform games and made us fall in love with video games as a tool for developing perceptual skills and problem solving. So we have paid Mario a humble tribute. \r\n\r\nPlay and learn freely without pressure or stress. Think, act, observe, ask yourself questions and find the answers. Have fun making the robot move forward, jump and perform all kinds of actions to complete the level.\r\n\r\nPlay in four different worlds and dozens of levels that progressively increase the difficulty. Program different lines of actions depending on the enemies that appear, considering events and conditionals. \r\n\r\nAnd finally... CREATE YOUR OWN LEVELS! Become an expert programmer and share your own creations. Parents and teachers can also create challenges for children or students.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\n• Helps develop logical thinking.\r\n• Easy and intuitive scenarios, with kid-friendly interfaces.\r\n• Dozens of levels distributed across four worlds  working on different programming concepts.\r\n• Includes programming concepts such as loops, sequences, actions, conditions and events...\r\n• Create levels and share them with other devices.\r\n• Content for boys and girls starting at just 5 years old. A game for the whole family. Hours of fun.\r\n• No ads.\r\n• No in-app purchases, and no scams of any kind.\r\n\nABOUT LEARNY LAND\n\nAt Learny Land, we love to play, and we believe that games must form part of the educational and growth stage of all children; because to play is to discover, explore, learn and have fun. Our educational games help children learn about the world around them and are designed with love. They are easy to use, beautiful and safe. Because boys and girls have always played to have fun and learn, the games we make - like the toys that last a lifetime - can be seen, played and heard.\nAt Learny Land we take advantage of the most innovative technologies and the most modern devices to take the experience of learning and playing a step further. We create toys that could not have existed when we were young.\nRead more about us at www.learnyland.com.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWe take Privacy very seriously.

Be on the lookout for elite, legendary, and limited edition creatures. Focus sessions of 25 minutes or longer guarantees at least a rare species.\n\n-Creature Key-\nCommon: Green\nUncommon: Blue\nRare: Purple\nLegendary: Gold \nElite: Electric Black or Red\nLimited Edition: Varies \n\nHow it Works iPhone: \n1. Set your Hatch timer from 5 to 120 minutes \n2. Stay focused without leaving the app \n3. Enter the goal or other information for this session \n4. Hatch your new friend \n\n-How it Works iPad-\n1. Set your Hatch timer from 5 to 120 minutes \n2. You may let the timer run in the background \n3. Complete your task \n4. Hatch your new friend \n\nParents & Teachers: \nHatch utilizes positive behavioral reinforcement as a way to reward students for staying focused and completing tasks. We recommend starting off with shorter sessions, 5-10 minutes, and gradually increasing the focus sessions as your child or student becomes accustomed to staying focused for longer periods of time without interruption.\n\nPro Tip: Create a family or class focus group. Give your group a fun name and compete to see who can log the most focus minutes in the family. Set your Hatch timer for 25-30 minutes at night and let everyone in the family curl up with their favorite book and come together when it’s time to see what everyone has hatched. \n\nEndorsed by Order out of Chaos (@orderoutofchaos) as a tool to help students with ADHD or those who are otherwise easily distracted"

      "label": "NoteWorks is a musical game, designed to teach note recognition and improve sight reading skills. Hungry Munchy is eager to swallow elusive blue notes. Your goal is to help Munchy catch each note as quickly as possible. \n\nThe game combines learning and fun into a single gratifying experience. The app is both educational and entertaining, with an intuitive and visually appealing interface. \n\nNoteWorks was created for: \n• iPhone, iPod touch and iPad users.\n• Players of all ages. \n• Beginners to advanced music students. \n• Families with multiple players. \n• Music teachers with multiple students. \n\nGame design features include: \n• A funny animated character. \n• User-friendly menus. \n• Superb graphics. \n• Engaging sound effects. \n\nNote reading options: \n• On-screen piano keyboard input.\n• On-screen guitar fretboard input.\n• MIDI keyboard input.  \n• \"A, B, C\" note naming:\n. . . CDEFGAB\n. . . CDEFGAH\n. . . ABCDEFG\n. . . AHCDEFG \n• \"Do, Re, Mi\" (Fixed Do) note naming. \n• Treble clef. \n• Bass clef. \n• Tenor clef. \n• Alto clef. \n• Custom note range in all four clefs.\n\nEducational features: \n• Students learn by playing and having fun. \n• Multiple game settings allow players to stay in control. \n• Students can choose to play with hints. \n• Students play without hints to earn points and stars. \n• Players learn to recognize notes instantly, on sight. \n• For beginners, the game starts by teaching a limited range of notes. \n• Note range can be easily customized as students advance. \n• After mastering accidentals, students learn key signatures. \n• Game speed is controlled to increase or decrease difficulty, or students may choose to play without any time limit.\n• Sharing of game progress: ability to share game results with teachers.\n\nWhile music teachers persistently stress the importance of sight reading, most teachers prefer not to spend valuable lesson time on basic note recognition skills. Thus, NoteWorks helps music teachers concentrate on more interesting aspects of their art, such as technique and musicality. \n\nSerious music students can take advantage of the game to learn clefs outside of their own instruments, as well as prepare for music theory exams. In addition, non-musicians could use NoteWorks as an interesting memory game, to help keep their minds sharp and quick. \n\nNoteWorks was created for people who like to learn by playing and having fun. It was designed with the objective of neither being too easy nor too hard, and never boring. We hope you'll find NoteWorks both useful and entertaining, and we would greatly appreciate it if you could share your thoughts and opinions about the game by rating it."

Your task is to touch the correct image. This type of training is perfect for learning words in different languages. For the small children you will find rewards and surprises like teddy bears and owls doing funny things. \n\n--- Alphabet ---\n\nIn this part you train on how to recognize the letters in the alphabet just by hearing their names. Uppercase and lowercase characters are included. Rewards and surprises are given in this exercise as well.\n\n--- Words and images ---\n\nPart 3 uses both words and images at the same time. Seeing the text under the image eases the learning. For each correct answer a part of a hidden picture is revealed!\n\n--- Learn words ---\n\nWords are now presented without any images, which makes this part a pure listening-reading exercise. Response-time is measured and you get a number of stars depending on how fast you were. Only the fastest responses get 5 stars! \n\n--- Initial letter ---\n\nWe now make is really hard by using words with the same initial letter(s). This time your reading is really put to the test!\n\n--- The right word ---\n\nA framed picture is shown and underneath it you will find a set of words. Can you find the right one? Once the correct answer have been given you will see only the correct, now larger, text and picture combined so you will remember it to the next time.\n\n--- Settings ---\n\nLanguages: English, Spanish, German, Italian, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Portuguese, Polish and Dutch. \n\nFor each language, the following settings are available: \n\n• The button with the sound icon turns on or off the menu music. \n• The button with the flag is for changing the language \n• The button with \"abc\" toggles between uppercase and lowercase letters. \n• The button with the star chooses difficulty level (1-5). \n• The button with boxes selects the number of boxes with images and words on the screen (4, 6, 9 or 12 boxes). \n• The button with colour chooses the background colour.\n• The button with a teddy bear turns on or off on rewards in the first activities.\n\n--- Difficulty levels ---\n\nLevel 1 - monosyllabic words such as car, sun and bed.\nLevel 2 - short words such as flag, ant, and drum.\nLevel 3 - words with a silent –e, such as cake, fence and frame. \nLevel 4 - difficult words such as mirror and tomato. \nLevel 5 - a blend of hard and easy words \n\nGood luck with your training!"

(Please set your iPhone to Ring mode to hear the audio playback.)\r\n・Basic information on the target kanji is provided with fun illustrations and mnemonic hints, as well as animations of their stroke order.\r\n(The illustrations and hints are taken from the very popular learning resource “Kanji Look and Learn.”)\r\n・Users can bookmark the kanji words they like. The bookmarked words are compiled in the Bookmark list in \"List.\"\r\n\r\n◇ “Check” helps learners to track their mastery.\r\n・Users check their understanding of the kanji words studied and sort them into those mastered and those not yet retained.\r\n・The kanji words already mastered are taken out of the study set, leaving behind just those that still need to be worked on.\r\n\r\n◇ “List” displays various lists of all the words and kanji covered by the app so that users can see their progress and review them.\r\n・In the lists arranged in lesson order, a-i-u-e-o order, or alphabetical order, checkmarks are automatically placed next to words that have been mastered.\r\n・Kanji information on the cards can be displayed from the entries in the On/Kun list.\r\n・Users can search kanji words from their target kanji in the Serial # list.\r\n・The words bookmarked in the Study mode are also listed in the Bookmark list.\r\n・The Study view of kanji words or the target kanji can be displayed from the list entries, enabling quick review.\r\n\r\n○This app is based on the kanji list from the third edition of GENKI.\r\n○Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

Choose among two types of exploration: a traditional guided tour or an interactive story set on board in the mid-1990s.\nYou can immerse yourself in a three-dimensional stereoscopic world thanks to the 360° spherical photographic images captured on board, the sound effects granted exclusively to the Museum by the Italian Navy Submarine School, and a number of interactive animated objects.\n\nEscape immersion! - Adventure on board\nDuring the Escape immersion! experience you will be on board as a machinist (the guy who looks after the engines on the submarine), embarked on board the Toti on June 20, 1990 for a mission in the Mediterranean Sea. You will wake up in your camp bed in the launch room and you will be asked to perform a series of operations to complete a fast immersion and escape from enemy aircrafts.\nFollow your officer’s directions and use the clues disseminated on the Toti: if all goes as planned you will be able to perform an immersion and cover your tracks.\n\nGuided Tour - Explore the submarine\nThe Guided Tour experience allows you to explore the whole submarine, from the launch room to the engine room. You will be guided by a voice that will give you more information about the rooms and the technological equipment, as well as recounting some anecdotes and stories about life of board.\nInside the ship, curious and meticulous players will discover some \"easter eggs\" containing original and entertaining stories that no Museum guide will ever tell you!\nTo fully appreciate the immersive experience, use the customised VR Cardboard viewer on sale at the Museum bookshop in Milan http://www.mustshop.it/  or a generic viewer available at online stores such as http://g.co/cardboard. \n\nWithout the viewer the app can also work in 2D mode.\n\nFor information about this app, help and safety data: http://www.museoscienza.org/toti/vr \n\nFor information on items for sale in the Museum Shop (online purchases, catalog, news) \nhttp://www.mustshop.it/ \n\nContacts: info@museoscienza.it \n\nFor your own safety do not use the app while you drive, walk or find yourself in situations where you cannot be distracted.\n\n© 2015 Museo Nazionale della Scienza e della Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci"

Thank\nyou” - Chattity\n\nSound Touch is the #1 app for entertaining and engaging young children -- complete with\nanimal sounds and music.\n\nStimulate children's brains and teach them all at the same time.\n\nListen to the sounds that farm animals, pets and other wildlife make in nature by touching\nwhimsical cartoons. Teach your toddler what an airplane, truck, and train sound like in a way that they will love.\n\nEach tile you touch opens up and reveals an exciting picture that plays a sound. The images rotate so that children can learn to identify the object, not just the single image that is shown.\n\nParents and children alike love this app and you will too! Download and play with your baby,\ntoddler or young children -- it's easy to learn and can entertain for hours.\n\nListen to the sounds made by both nature and machines. From boats, firetrucks, and\nhorse-drawn carriages to ducks, tigers, and birds. Each animal or object is like its own flash card; when opened, it plays a sound that is sure to stimulate each child and leave them with awe and wonder. This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch. Let them explore and learn with their senses. Parents of children with autism have found this app helpful in engaging their children, but truly it is for anyone that wants to teach their kids something new while stimulating and training their brains.\n\nEvery animal, transportation mode, and tile has five different sounds linked, so children can learn different sounds and images associated with objects. Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

      "label": "There's never been a better time to get into Astronomy! Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text. This app never transmits data from your device.\n\n\nNote: Non-English localizations focus on solar system objects and constellation names."

Because Solar Walk knows what time it is, the planets are in proper orientation to the Sun: Earth is dark where it is currently night and gradually lightens to daytime on the other side.” - NY Times\n\n\"It's great for showing my students the relative positions of the planets in the solar system, the satellites orbiting the Earth and our place in the galaxy. Awesome with a smartboard as well.\" - by jbrown61\n\nSolar Walk enables you to:\n\n► Observe 3D model of our Solar system with all its objects in real time and in a ​proper orientation.

      "label": "Lolan Tavuviidakko on uusin sovelluksemme, joten se on rakennettu huolella kymmenien miljoonien Lola Panda asiakkaiden oppimistuloksiin perustuen. Tällä sovelluksella on lukemisen oppimistakuu – katso tiedot kuvauksen lopusta!\n\nHyvä lukutaito antaa lapselle eväät kaikkeen oppimiseen kouluvuosien aikana. Tavujen hahmottaminen on tärkeää lukemista opeteltaessa. Tällöin lukunopeus lisääntyy, joka auttaa ymmärtävän lukemisen kehittymiseen. Lolan Tavuviidakko on suunniteltu erityisesti 6-7 -vuotiaille lapsille.\n\nLolan Tavuviidakko jakautuu seuraaviin oppikokonaisuuksiin:\n• Helppoja vokaali- sekä soinnillisia konsonanttialkuisia sanoja: AA-SI\n• Helppoja vokaali- ja konsonanttialkuisia sanoja sisältäen geminaatan: HA-NA\n• Melko vaikeita 2 tavuisia sanoja sisältäen pitkiä vokaaleja: AAR-RE\n• Vaikeita 2 tavuisia sanoja sisältäen konsonanttiyhtymiä: jout-sen\n• Helppoja 3 tavuisia sanoja: en-ke-li\n• Vaikeita 3 tavuisia sanoja: ank-ku-ri\n• Vaikeita 3 tavuisia ja melko helppoja 4 tavuisia: juo-ma-la-si\n• Melko vaikeita 4 tavuisia: il-ma-pal-lo\n• Vaikeita 4 tavuisia: e-le-fant-ti\n\nSovelluksen käytettävyys on tuttua Lola Panda laatua ja graafinen ilme sekä animaatiot entistäkin hauskempia. Lola Pandan äänenä toimii yksi Suomen tunnetuimmista lastenohjelmien ääninäyttelijöistä, Johanna Ala-Siurua. \n\nTavuihin perustuva oppiminen jakoi aiemmin sekä opettajia, vanhempia että tutkijoita. Aikaisemmin lukemisen oppiminen tapahtui käytännössä aina tavujen kautta. Sittemmin tavuista luovuttiin lähes kokonaan. Tällä hetkellä tavujen merkitys on lähteestä riippumatta kuitenkin keskeisempi kuin 20 vuotta sitten. Erityisen hyvin tavut sopivat digitaalisiin ratkaisuihin kuten Lolan Tavuviidakkoon. Tavuihin perustuva oppiminen voi tuoda myös suuren avun oppimisvaikeustapauksiin.\n\nLolan Tavuviidakko soveltuu lapsille, joille esim. Lolan Aakkosjuna ja Lolan ABC-juhlat sovellukset ovat jo liian helppoja, mutta jotka eivät vielä osaa lukea sujuvasti. Lolan Tavuviidakko sopii erinomaisesti esikouluun sekä alakoulun 1. luokalle ja sitä voidaan käyttää ryhmässä tai yksin. Lapsi voi käyttää sovellusta yksin aloittamalla esim. helpolta tasolta, jolloin tehtävät vaikeutuvat oppimisen myötä. Vaihtoehtoisesti opettaja tai vanhempi voi valita sovelluksesta opeteltavan alueen jolloin jo aloitustaso on sopiva.\n\nJos lapsesi ei kuitenkaan osaa vielä kaikkia kirjaimia, niin silloin kannattaa hankkia Lolan Aakkosjuna ja harjoitella kirjainten tunnistamista Lolan seurassa. Jos on tarvetta lisäharjoittelulle kirjainten äänteissä, niin silloin oikea vaihtoehto on hankkia Lolan ABC-juhlat, jossa Lola opettaa lapsesi tunnistamaan kirjaimet äänteiden avulla.\n\nLisää tietoa laadukkaista Lola Pandan oppimissovelluksista löydät kotisivultamme: www.lolapanda.com/fi\n\nTervetuloa hauskan oppimisen ja Lolan Tavuviidakon pariin!\n\n*Lolan Tavuviidakko -sovelluksen ostajat saavat 100% oppimistakuun! Mikäli lapsesi harjoittelee läpi sovelluksen kaikki kolme tasoa, mutta ei opi lukemaan sanoja, ota tuolloin yhteyttä osoitteeseen: support@beiz.com. \n\nKysymme muutaman jatkokysymyksen tilastointia varten ja jokainen yhteyttä ottanut asiakas saa toisen ilmaisen Lola -sovelluksen! Vastaamme viesteihin muutamassa päivässä. Takuu kattaa 100% tapauksista."

      "label": "Welcome to the game of copying silly faces! In GIGGLEBUG'S FACE RACE, your goal is to copy expressions and emotions from animated characters. The more accurately you twist your expressions, the higher score, and bigger laughs you can get. The game is a truly social experience with the iPhone or iPad. It is meant for kids of all ages and adults alike. \n\nHOW IT WORKS\nWe are proud to have developed an original face detection algorithm for this game. The device camera recognises positions of the eyes, cheeks, teeth, tongue and tilt of the head.  The game evaluates the expressions and game gives feedback in the form of a playful star rating. After playing the game, you will get a ridiculous collection of photos of yourself and your loved ones having a laugh. \n\nGIGGLEBUG VALUES\nGigglebug is an independent pre-school brand originating from Finland. It has been launched in 2013 to spread positivity. Gigglebug has been devised by pedagogical experts in Finland, one of the leading PISA ranked countries in the world. Gigglebug teaches positive ways of interacting, and aims to bring joy out of the screen and into the social space where children are playing.  When you can think positive, you can do anything better."

      "label": "The infosphere, Visualized.\n\nEvery time we use our phones, tablets or laptops we are entering an invisible world of wireless digital signals. It is a world that we cannot see but that is literally all around us.\nThe Architecture of Radio is a 360 degree data visualization of what this world might look like. It shows the cell towers, GPS satellites and Wi-Fi routers around you that allow us to live our digital lives.\n\nNew: support for Iphone X, XR, XS and XS Max Screens\nNew: Cardboard support!\nImmerse yourself in the Infosphere in Virtual Reality using a cardboard or compatible headset*\n\n*Carboard support only for iPhone. iPhone 6s or newer recommended for best performance.\n\nWhy should I use this app?\n\nOut of curiosity! We are increasingly dependent on a global ecosystem of digital signals. We use them for so many things, yet we cannot see them. We can see the roads we use to travel, the buildings we live in, but not the infrastructure that is changing the world. How can we understand this world without understanding how it works? \nThe purpose of this app is to make the invisible visible so we can look at it, think about it and discuss it.\n\nWhy Should I not use this app?\n\nThis app is not a measurement tool. It’s purpose is to inspire, to see the world through a different lens. The app is based on real world data and gives you a pretty good idea of the density of digital signals around you, but it won’t tell you where to move the couch to get a better WIFI signal.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is a data visualization, based on global open datasets of cell tower, Wi-Fi and satellite locations. Based on your GPS location the app shows a 360 degree visualization of signals around you. The dataset includes almost 7 million cell towers, 19 million Wi-Fi routers and hundreds of satellites.\n\nIs this really what radio signals look like?\n\nWe can’t see radio with our eyes. The waves that we use for our cell phones and Wi-Fi are way outside the spectrum of visible light. In order to “see” radio, it has to be interpreted or translated into an image that we can see. There are many ways to do that but it will always be an interpretation.\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is an impression of the infosphere, a way of seeing it."

I appen finns också fem stycken musikvideor att titta på. \n\nOm Babblarna \nBabblarna är ett gäng färgglada figurer som gör språkträning till ett spännande och lekfullt äventyr. Den pedagogiska plattformen är Karlstadmodellen och språkträningen riktar sig till barn i tidig språkutveckling. Babblarna älskas av alla, stora som små och ingen tänker på att det är just språkträning det handlar om i leken och äventyren i Babblarnas värld. Babblarna pratar sitt eget språk som helt bygger på ljudet i deras namn. Genom att lyssna på Babblarna när de pratar och genom att härma deras sätt att prata så tränas effektivt förmågan att använda betoningar och melodi i språket. \nTips: Det finns många roliga produkter med Babblarna. De har också en egen sajt bara för barnen www.babblarna.se \n\nBabbapp är utvecklad och utgiven av Hatten Förlag AB.

      "label": "Team Shake provides a technological and environmentally friendly way to choose teams for board games, sporting events, tournaments, school projects or anytime groups are required. The newest release brings many new features including full iPad support, balancing teams based on skill or gender, importing users from a file, enabling video output, and sharing teams via facebook or email. \n\nTeam Shake is the premier iOS App for creating teams. Instead of a hat and scraps of paper, the user enters his friends' names in his iPhone and gives it a shake. The screen will then display a random set of color-coded teams. These teams can immediately be used for game play or shared via facebook or email.   The quick and easy selection of random (or balanced) teams eliminates fighting over who will be on which team. Innovative use of the iPhone shake gesture gives users the satisfying feeling of shaking a virtual hat without the trouble of carrying around an actual hat. Conventional buttons can also be used for those who would rather not shake their expensive hardware about.  \n\nThe app is designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind. Names can easily be entered with the onscreen keyboard, chosen from the user's contacts, or imported from a file. The email and facebook functions document the members of each individual team as well as preserving the team number and color assigned by the app. For repeated use of Team Shake, lists of friends can be easily saved and loaded later. The current list is also automatically saved so that if you exit the app, or even reboot the device, changes will not be lost. For teachers and others with large lists of people, Team Shake supports the ability to import teams from text or csv files.\n\nIf you have any problems, feature requests, or comments please send an email to support@rhine-o.com. \n\nFeatures:\n\n* Create 1 to 64 random teams\n* Create completely random or balanced teams\n* Full iPad support\n* Eliminates fighting over choosing teams\n* Share / Save teams via email or Facebook\n* Teams can be chosen by the number of teams or by the size of teams.\n* Save lists of friends for later games\n* Import lists from email or spreadsheet\n* Export lists and options for use on another device\n* Satisfying feeling of shaking a “virtual” hat to create teams\n* Animated shaking hat\n* Entry of names via onscreen keyboard\n* Entry of names via iPhone contacts\n* Temporarily disable people who are absent\n* Set groups of people to always be on the same team\n* Set groups of people to always be on different teams\n* Set user strength to make more even teams (now supports fully balanced teams)\n* 5 users strengths level\n* Pick a single random person from the list of players\n* User strength indicator on the main screen (can be disabled in options)\n* Number of active players and total players is now displayed on the main screen\n* Video Out Support\n* Option to Sort Teams by Name\n* Option to balance male / female team members\n* \"Equal Ability\" option to create teams where all players have the same strength\n* Option to create separate male and female teams\n* Configurable Team Colors\n* Configurable Team Names\n* Print Support\n* Export Teams in CSV or XLS Format\n* Team Shake now supports simultaneously assigning players to multiple subteams and / or oppose teams at the same time.\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now have customized names to make selection easier\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now be enabled or disabled globally so that teams can be made quickly without subteams / oppose teams.  In particular, Balance Teams Strengths will work when separate Male / Female teams are created.\n\nYappler-Tags: Teams, Groups, Random, Hat, Entertainment, Games, Utilities"

      "label": "NOTE: Remastered version from the PC version. A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English. Subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out \"Papa's Freezeria HD\" for iPad!"

Her husband Majd, who remains behind in Syria, communicates with Nour through a messaging app, advising her as best he can so that she reaches her destination safely.\n \n“Bury me, my love” is a Syrian goodbye phrase that roughly means, “Take care, don’t even think about dying before I do.” This phrase takes on a deeper meaning as Majd says it to his wife, Nour, as she undertakes her perilous journey to reach Europe.\n\nA co-production from ARTE, the European cultural network, with The Pixel Hunt and Figs.\n \n***A game in an instant messaging app\nAs Majd, you can communicate with Nour and follow her journey, just as if you were chatting with her via WhatsApp. You will text each other and exchange emojis, pics and selfies, relevant links…\n \n*** Multiple narrative routes to discover\nBy reading instant messages and choosing response options, players help Nour overcome the hardships she will encounter.\nYour choices in Bury me, my Love truly impact on the story, with Nour able to visit 50 different locations and reach 19 potential different endings with widely divergent outcomes.\n \n*** Based on real-life events\nBury me, my Love is a “reality-inspired game”, a documented fiction that draws inspiration directly from real-world events. The original idea stems from an article written by Le Monde journalist, Lucie Soullier, telling the story of Dana, a young Syrian woman who fled her country and is now living in Germany.\n\nWinner of the best meaningful play - 14TH IMGA\nGame Beyond Entertainment - BAFTA\nBest Emotional mobile & handheld game - Emotional Games Awards\nBest Work - Japan Prize 2018\n \nThis experience may affect the sensitivity of younger people."

A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome back to the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza!\n\nIn Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the old and aging animatronics are joined by a new cast of characters. They are kid-friendly, updated with the latest in facial recognition technology, tied into local criminal databases, and promise to put on a safe and entertaining show for kids and grown-ups alike!\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nAs the new security guard working nights, your job is to monitor cameras and make sure nothing goes wrong after-hours. The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift). So to make your job easier, you've been provided with your very own empty Freddy Fazbear head, which should fool the animatronic characters into leaving you alone if they should accidentally enter your office.\n\nAs always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for death or dismemberment.\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English.

A great fit, and a great port.\"*** PocketTactics\n\nA Spiel des Jahres Recommended game, Jaipur is one of the most most well-loved 2-player tabletop games. Jaipur is a fast-paced card game for two players with a blend of tactics, risk and luck. You are one of the most powerful traders in Jaipur, the capital city of Rajasthan. You and your opponent duel to demonstrate to the Maharajah that you can earn a greater profit than your competition. At the end of a round, one player receives the Maharajah's seal of excellence, and the first player to earn two seals of excellence wins the privilege of being invited to the Maharajah’s court! \n\nEach turn, you can choose to take one card, exchange your cards for other goods, buy the camels needed to transport your wares, or sell at the market. The sooner you sell and the more you sell of a single good at once, the higher your profit. \n\nIf you take cards, you have to choose between taking all the camels, taking 1 card from the market or swapping 2 to 5 cards between the market and your cards. If you sell cards, you get to sell only one type of good per turn, and you get as many chips from that good as you sold cards. The chips’ values decrease as the game progresses, but you get increasingly high rewards for selling sets of 3, 4, or 5 cards of the same good at a time, so it’s all about waiting just the right amount of time to make your trade.\n\nYou can’t sell camels, but they are integral to trading and they’re also worth a little something at the end of the round, sometimes enough to secure the win so use them smartly!\n\nIn this digital adaptation of the award-winning card game, find a comprehensive interactive tutorial and an extensive campaign mode. Solo play is available at three levels of difficulty. Play online 2 player cross-platform or locally in pass & play mode. Track your achievements within the app and use your Asmodee Digital account to sign on.  Enjoy beautiful illustrations by Vincent Dutrait.\n\nLanguages available: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish.\n\nJaipur includes: \n• A faithful adaptation of Sebastien Pauchon's original Jaipur game\n• Online cross-platform 2 player mode \n• Local pass & play mode\n• Solo play against 3 difficulty levels of AI\n• An extensive campaign mode\n• All new artwork by Vincent Dutrait\n• Detailed, interactive, turn-by-turn, in-game tutorial.\n• Achievement tracking\n• No in-app purchases or ads\n• Languages available: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish.\n\nAwards:\n2014 Juego del Año Finalist\n2011 Games Magazine Best New Family Card Game Winner\n2010 Spiel des Jahres Recommended\n2010 Lys Grand Public Finalist\n2010 International Gamers Award - General Strategy: Two-players\n2010 Golden Geek Best Card Game Nominee\n2010 Golden Geek Best 2-Player Board Game Nominee\n2010 Fairplay À la carte Winner\n\n\nFor more information, please visit http://asmodee-digital.com/jaipur\n\nHaving an issue?

      "label": "Shattered Pixel Dungeon is a traditional roguelike dungeon crawler RPG that's simple to get into but hard to master! Every game is a unique challenge, with four different heroes, randomized levels and enemies, and hundreds of items to collect and use. ShatteredPD is also updated once every two or three months, so there's always something new.\n\n◀ Choose Your Hero ▶\nEach of ShatteredPD's four playable heroes has their own unique mechanics and gameplay style. Smash some heads as the durable Warrior, fry your enemies as the arcane Mage, or use terrain to your advantage as the stealthy Rogue or the markswoman Huntress!\n\nAs you progress through the dungeon you'll earn points to spend on talents, choose a subclass, and gain powerful lategame abilities. You can turn the Warrior into a combo-building Gladiator, the Mage into a soul-sucking Warlock, the Huntress into a tanky Warden, or explore loads of other possibilities!\n\n◀ Explore the Dungeon ▶\nShatteredPD's dungeon is procedurally generated with random layouts, room types, items, traps, and enemies. In each game you'll find equipment and collect or craft consumable items to power you up or help you out in a pinch. There is a huge variety to what you might see from run to run and region to region.\n\nAs you progress through the dungeon you'll find equipment that can be enchanted, upgraded, and augmented as you outfit your hero. Set foes ablaze with an enchanted weapon, wade through enemies with upgraded armor, or gain powerful damage, defensive, or utility benefits from one of the many wands, rings, or magical artifacts.\n\n◀ Succeed or Die Trying ▶\nThe Dungeon is filled with enemies, traps, hazards, and bosses intent on ending your run! Battle hostile wildlife in the sewers and caves, mad thieves and guards in the prison, occult servants in the fallen dwarven city, and maybe something even worse further down...\n\nAll these hazards can make the game quite tough, but don't be discouraged! You probably won't win on your first try, but there are many tricks and strategies to discover and learn on the path to getting your first win!\n\n◀ Almost A Decade in the Making ▶\nShattered Pixel Dungeon is an open source game based on the source code of Pixel Dungeon by Watabou (first released in 2013). It started in 2014 as a project to rebalance Pixel Dungeon but has steadily grown into its own game over the last 8 years!\n\nFeatures Include:\n• 4 Heroes, each with 2 subclasses, 3 endgame abilities, and over 25 talents.\n• Over 250 items including equipment, consumables, and items crafted via alchemy.\n• 5 dungeon regions, 26 floors, over 100 room types, and trillions of possible floor layouts.\n• Over 60 enemy types, 30 traps, and 5 detailed bosses to test your skills.\n• 9 optional challenges and over 100 achievements for completionists.\n• Interface modes for large and small screens, and support for multiple input types.\n• Updates every 2-3 months with new content, fixes, and improvements.\n• Support for many languages thanks to the game's dedicated communities."

Almost as if something were calling you...\n\nTurning on the lamp, you cautiously get up, moving towards the sound that woke you. This is your uncle's house and though you've been here many times, it suddenly feels very different. \n\nThe room is littered with wonderfully strange and interesting artifacts, souvenirs from your uncle's travels, from where he would not say. On the floor lays a small tiled box, broken open. Unfolding the paper nestled within it, you instantly recognize the symbols. \n\nThe fireplace!\n\nRunning back into the bedroom, you examine again the symbols on the paper. They match perfectly those in the woodwork of the mantel, but are arranged differently...\n\nThough your hands are shaking with excitement, you work quickly, rearranging the wooden symbols to match the ones on the paper, hearing them click into place easily one after the other, until the pattern is complete.\n\nSuddenly, beams of golden sunlight burst through the opening in the fireplace, cutting through the darkness in the room. Standing back with a gasp, you look through the opening, eyes wide in awe at the beautiful, magical land from your dream on the other side. \n\nWith a deep breath, you step through the opening and take your first steps into another world...\n\nFeatures:\n• Beautiful hand-painted graphics that draw you into this mesmerizing adventure!\n• Lots of items to collect and puzzles to solve!\n• Original soundtrack and sound effects!\n• A journal that keeps track of all the symbols and clues that you encounter.\n• A dynamic map that shows all of the areas you have explored, as well as your current location.\n• A complete hint system built right into the game.\n• The Hidden World has been translated into many languages.\n• Available for iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad!"

      "label": "After a lengthy radio silence, Taylor returns at last! This brand new adventure finds the hapless astronaut on the other side of a black hole, relying on you alone to help make life-or-death decisions in a playable, branching story of survival in the depths of unknown space.\n \nBut this time, there’s a twist: Players can also choose to communicate with T2, Taylor’s time-warped, alien-infected “evil twin,” helping or hindering as they see fit. Throughout the story, seemingly simple decisions can have profound effects. Make choices using your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch, and face the consequences alongside the desperate astronauts.\n \nWriter Dave Justus (Fables: The Wolf Among Us) returns to pen this fourth Taylor adventure -- the seventh overall in the acclaimed, multi-million-selling Green Series. Whether this is your first interaction with Taylor, or you’ve been a diehard fan from the beginning, you’ll discover a deep, immersive story of survival and perseverance, with many possible outcomes.\n \nThe original Lifeline took the App Store by storm -- reaching #1 Top Paid Game on iPhone and Apple Watch in 29 countries -- while pioneering a new narrative experience enabled by modern devices. This story plays out in real time as the astronauts work to stay alive, with notifications delivering new messages throughout your day. Keep up as they come in, or catch up later when you’re free. You can even respond to Taylor or T2 directly from your Apple Watch or your iPhone lock screen, without launching into the app.\n \nOr, dive in and jump back to earlier points in the story, and discover what happens when you make a different choice. Complete any single path to restart the story and unlock this mode.\n \nThe story contains no in-app purchases and no ads. An internet connection is not required. \n \nPraise for the original Lifeline:\n\n“I’ve played many games that I find engrossing, but Lifeline may be one of the first that changed the way I thought about my daily routine, which leapt off the screen and became a part of my lived experience.” - Eli Cymet, Gamezebo\n\n“I felt an immediate attachment to a fictional character pinging me from a strange galaxy to my wearable.” - Luke Hopewell, Gizmodo Australia\n\n“For a few brief hours I cared – really cared – about the fate of a completely fictional character. I don’t think any other game I’ve played has made me feel that way before.” - Matt Thrower, PocketGamer\n\nLifeline: Beside You in Time was created by:\nDave Justus\nMars Jokela\nColin Liotta\nCrystal Silva\nMatt Burchstead\n\nMusic by Rose Azerty\n\nIn loving memory of William Justus, my lifelong lifeline. Hope you dig this one, dad."

Set across three continents during the turbulent Middle Ages, spectacular conflicts and scheming rivals line the path to power as the great kingdoms of the medieval world vie for supremacy. Be it through diplomacy or conquest, trade or subterfuge, you must secure the resources and loyalty required to rule an empire from the shores of Western Europe to the sands of Arabia.\n\nTHE STRENGTH OF NATIONS\nUnlock up to 17 playable factions and build them into major world powers through statecraft, subterfuge or all-out war.\n\nTHE KINGDOMS EXPANSION\nAvailable via in-app purchase, this massive expansion includes 24 playable factions across four unique, fully featured campaigns. Wage war from the jungles of the Americas to the deserts of the Holy Land, from the deceptively gentle shores of the British Isles to the frigid Baltic plains.\n\nTHE ART OF WAR\nDeploy infantry, archers and cavalry into huge real-time battles, with a full range of medieval weaponry at your command.\n\nTHE TOOLS OF STATE\nUse sophisticated diplomacy, lucrative trade agreements and daring agents to forge alliances or destabilise your rivals.\n\nTHE TEST OF TIME\nShape the destinies of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East through five momentous centuries of combat, competition and conquest.\n\nTHE POWER IN YOUR HANDS\nTake command, with a brand-new user interface and enhanced touch controls for fingertip control of the battlefield. Or, play with any iPadOS-compatible mouse & keyboard.\n\n===\n\nTotal War: MEDIEVAL II requires 4.3GB of free space.

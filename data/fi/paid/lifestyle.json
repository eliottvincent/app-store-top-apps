From Polynesian (Tahitian, Samoan, Tongan, etc.) tatau. In Marquesan, tatu.\" Before the importation of the Polynesian word, the practice of tattooing had been described in the West as pricking, painting, or staining. Sailors on the voyage later introduced both the word and reintroduced the concept of tattooing to Europe.\n\nThis is not to be confused with the origins of the word for the military drumbeat — see military tattoo. In this case, the English word tattoo is derived from the Dutch word taptoe (OED).\n\nThe first written reference to the word tattoo (or tatau), appears in the journal of Joseph Banks (24 February 1743 – 19 June 1820), the naturalist aboard Captain Cook's ship the HMS Endeavour: \"I shall now mention the way they mark themselves indelibly, each of them is so marked by their humor or disposition\".\n\nThe word \"tattoo\" was brought to Europe by the explorer James Cook, when he returned in 1771 from his first voyage to Tahiti and New Zealand. In his narrative of the voyage, he refers to an operation called \"tattaw\". Before this it had been described as scarring, painting, or staining\n\nTattoo enthusiasts may refer to tattoos as \"ink\", \"pieces\", \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"tats\", or \"work\"; to the creators as \"tattoo artists\", \"tattooers\", or \"tattooists\"; and to places where they work as \"tattoo shops\", \"tattoo studios\", or \"tattoo parlors\".\n\n\nA tattooed man's back, Japan, c. 1875\nUsage of the terms \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"pieces\", and work\" is gaining greater support,[citation needed] with mainstream art galleries holding exhibitions of both conventional and custom tattoo designs. Beyond Skin, at the Museum of Croydon, is an example of this as it challenges the stereotypical view of tattoos and who has them. Copyrighted tattoo designs that are mass-produced and sent to tattoo artists are known as \"flash\", a notable instance of industrial design. Flash sheets are prominently displayed in many tattoo parlors for the purpose of providing both inspiration and ready-made tattoo images to customers.\n\nThe Japanese word irezumi means \"insertion of ink\" and can mean tattoos using tebori, the traditional Japanese hand method, a Western-style machine, or for that matter, any method of tattooing using insertion of ink. The most common word used for traditional Japanese tattoo designs is Horimono. Japanese may use the word \"tattoo\" to mean non-Japanese styles of tattooing."

GhostEye will use the camera to watch for movement and take a snapshot when it detects changes in the image.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Use the rear or front camera where available\n- Adjust sensitivity to prevent false motion detection\n- Save snapshot images at 25%, 50%, 75% or full size\n- Share saved images with other apps, e.g. iCloud, Email etc.\n\nTIP 1: Even a cheap tripod (e.g. from a pound shop) will provide a steady image to prevent your device being affected by motion or vibration. Don't try to use the app while holding your device as it will detect lots of movement.\n\nTIP 2: The app can be used to catch trespassers in an area by leaving your device plugged into a charger and pointing to the area to monitor.\n\nIf the app does not do what you were expecting, or there is an issue with it running on your device, please contact me for help.\n\nThere are no adverts in this software.

Currently this includes an on-the-fly pitch tracker - so you can practise different ways of speaking and immediately see their effect - as well as unlimited archive space, celebrity comparison graphs, and a charting tool so you can track your progress over time.\n\nWe’re working to expand Vocular to other areas too.

      "label": "Esther and Jerry Hicks present the teachings of Abraham to show how you can use the universe's Law of Attraction to achieve all that your heart desires. In this beautiful collection of cards, they provide affirmations, thoughts and meditations to help you connect with the health-giving potentials of the cosmos. Every part of your life is experienced through the perspective of your physical body and when you feel good, everything you see looks better. There are few things of greater value than the achievement of health and physical wellbeing. Not only does a good-feeling body promote positive thoughts, but, also, positive thoughts promote a good-feeling body. Ponder these cards, and you will find a new point of attraction will begin to be activated within you that eventually can lead to a wonderful mood or attitude, for if you are able to find feelings of relief even when your body is hurting or sick, you will find physical improvement, because your thoughts create your reality. Regain your health and your life today with these fantastic cards. FEATURES: - Browse Health and the Law of Attraction cards anywhere, anytime on your device* - Save cards to review at any time* - Email cards to yourself or share with a friend* About the Author: Excited about the clarity and practicality of the translated word from the Beings who call themselves Abraham, Esther and Jerry Hicks began disclosing their amazing Abraham experience to a handful of close business associates in 1986. Recognizing the practical results being received by themselves and by those people who were asking practical questions and then applying Abraham’s answers to their own situations, Esther and Jerry made a deliberate decision to allow the teachings of Abraham to become available to an ever-widening circle of seekers of how to live a happier life. Using their San Antonio, Texas, conference center as their base, Jerry and Esther have traveled to approximately 50 cities a year since 1989, presenting interactive Law of Attraction workshops to those leaders who gather to participate in this expanding stream of progressive thought. And although worldwide attention has been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading Edge thinkers and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham’s Law of Attraction concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures, and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person to person—as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences. In November 2011, Jerry made his transition into Non-Physical, and now Esther continues to conduct the Abraham workshops with the help of her physical friends and co-workers and, of course, with the Non-Physical help of Abraham and Jerry. People are able to access Abraham directly by attending the seminars in person or by participating in the online live streaming of most events. There is also an extensive YouTube library of Abraham videos. Abraham—a group of uplifting Non-Physical teachers—present their Broader Perspective through Esther Hicks. And as they speak to our level of comprehension through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant, yet comprehensively simple essays in print and in sound, they guide us to a clear connection with our loving Inner Being, and to uplifting self-empowerment from our Total Self.

Also, in everyday life and at work, its modest matt black presence does not distract you or disrupt your productivity, even when using the app for extended periods of time. Its full-screen appearance integrates with the iPhone/iPad device body and blends into your living space ambience, as if it were a minimalist home decor item.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Switch between 12/24 hour clock\n- Switch between portrait and landscape mode\n- Option to show seconds when tapping screen\n- Brightness/dimness control inside the app\n- Show/hide background tiles\n- Enlarge/reduce to any size\n\nNOTES:\n- Your device’s Auto-Lock is disabled while this clock is active in the foreground.\n- This app does not start automatically like the Mac screensaver.\n- You cannot replace your device’s Lock Screen with this clock."

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

Control and get your car stats on the watch or phone without opening the app. You can combine/schedule/automate commands based on triggers/conditions such as when you're driving, if your charging cable isn't plugged in, when you're sleeping, when you're about to go to work, when you're connected to certain Bluetooth or WiFi connections, when you tap a NFC tag, when your alarm goes off, or a certain time each day. Add Shortcuts as icons on your home screen or widgets for quick access to your car's stats or to control it.\n- Fully functional Apple Watch app with vehicle stats complications\n- Opens, connects, and issues commands faster than other Tesla apps\n- Queued commands. You can close the app after issuing a few commands even if your car is asleep and it'll still do them.\n- View your battery stats such as the current/total usable kWh of your car compared to the stated capacity, how much phantom drain your car currently has, and a history of your car's range vs its odometer/time.\n- Display battery/power usage even when not charging\n- No phantom drain or background usage. This app doesn't use your car's batteries when the app isn't in use.\n- See the total miles/kWh added from the last charge session\n- Estimated range is displayed (this estimates your battery range based on your past 30 miles of usage)\n- Consolidated stats and commands into one screen for quicker access to information. View all three ranges (estimated, rated, ideal/typical, odometer) at the same time and up to the nearest 1/100th mi/km\n- See and copy the raw vehicle data returned by Tesla's API servers\n- 3D Touch menu for quick commands from the Home Screen\n- Use HomeLink or Summon your car when not near it and without continuous press needed (autopilot required). Activate keyless start prior to Summon to avoid needing a keyfob nearby.\n- Avoid idle fees from Tesla by setting an in-app alarm that alerts you when charging reaches a certain kW or % level\n- Camp/Dog Mode allows you to keep the HVAC on in the car even though there is no activity. Normally, the car will turn off HVAC after 30 minutes.\n- View how many range miles are being used per hour\n- Use the remotes:// URL schema with parameters to issues commands\n- Max cool and Max heat buttons to quickly send multiple commands to your car to optimize cooling and heating\n- No-Commands Mode lets you log in the app for your family/friends to monitor your Tesla's location without allowing them to control to your car\n- Breadcrumb tracking allows you to see the path that the car has recently taken\n- Trip statistics shows your current MPGe, kWh used, miles traveled, kWh per 100 miles, cost savings vs. an internal combustion engine car, cost savings over the car's lifetime, and many more fun stats\n- Save trip routes to different save slots and compare the distance, kWh used, cost, and more for each route\n- In-app browser can detect commands from javascript so that you can create scheduled, queued or repeated commands\n- Ability to change passenger and driver temperature separately\n\nPrivacy/Security notice: This app only communicates directly to Tesla's servers when sending login credentials and commands. No identifying information is stored by our company.\n\nDisclaimer: This software and documentation do not come from nor is endorsed by Tesla Inc. Use this app at your own risk.

An alarm that irritates me enough to wake up\n √ Exceptional App!! This app is super super annoying... It really gets me out of bed\n √ Love it. It's the best alarm ever\n √ Great Alarm! Been having trouble getting up. No more!\n √ This app is so easy to use, and has all the perfect functions! I'll never be late again!\n\nFEATURED IN THE MEDIA\n √ Definitely one of the more “annoying” alarms to help you get up and out of bed in the morning. – AppAdvice.com\n √ If you are the kind of person who has a difficult time waking up after you’ve turned off your alarm, this app may help keep you from being late for work. - iDownloadBlog\n\nAlso in MacWorld NL, AppsRumors, AppChronicles, etc.\n\nHOW IT WORKS \n\nAs the name \"Step Out!\" implied, the only way you can turn off this alarm clock is STEPPING out of your bed (you still can snooze - in a limited duration). It uses advanced image recognition and step tracking technologies to check whether you’re far away from your bed. \n\nAfter ringing, the app asks you to capture another photo of a specified place, it should be where you usually be every time you wake up, such as the bathroom, the kitchen, ... So you just take a photo and do your routine work like washing your face or preparing breakfast. \n\nAnother alternative is using the step counter, which simplifies this process into just nothing. You wake up and go to wherever you want with the device. After reaching enough number of steps, the alarm will automatically turn off. It’s simply a smarter alarm with no additional action., You’ll love using it from the very first time. \n\nFEATURES IN DETAIL\n\n- MUSIC ALARM \no Wake up with your favorite songs\no Listen to them when moving\n\n- FULLY FUNCTIONAL ALARM \no Easy setup with hand-drawn mini-game\no Repeating rule for daily, weekly alarms \no Built-in alarm sounds \no Snooze, Vibrate, Fade-in & Volume for the perfect experience \n\n- MOTION TRACKING \no Innovative motion tracking system to sense your steps\no Smart anti-cheat system to make sure that you are stepping\n\n**IMPORTANT: We do not encourage our users to step so fast when you are not totally awake, this app will just recognize the steps when you aren’t walking too fast.\n\n- IMAGE RECOGNITION\no State-of-the-art image recognizing engine\no Can match both horizontal and vertical pictures\no Strict image comparison to assure you’re leaving your bed and your eyes opened wide enough to take the right picture.\n\n**HINT: Choose a scene that has a stable light condition for better matching results.\n\n- SLEEP TIMER \no Fall asleep with music \no Auto-lock and ready for next alarm \n\n- FLASHLIGHT \no Easy to find way through the dark when you are stepping\n\n- CLOCK \no Full feature clock \no Show/hide seconds, 24 hour format, …"

      "label": "What’s your personality? How do you and your loved ones, friends, and co-workers compare? Imagine having quick access to the right keywords to get your point across!\n\nWhether you’re in a boring meeting, on the phone with a challenging client, or dealing with a flustered family member — this application is for you. The essential themes of each personality Type are just a tap away. You can also explore each personality in depth: learn a person’s core needs and values, cognitive processes, interaction style, team behavior, pitfalls, growth points, and much more.\n\nYou will quickly learn about Type Theory and how to positively influence others using the “Compare” feature. This feature relies on sophisticated algorithms to show you the likely commonalities, differences, and synergies between two people. The algorithms compare communication, problem solving, learning and adaptation, love relationships, growth and change, and more.\n\nIN DEPTH:\nPersonality is far more than just superficial traits. Personality reveals motivation and cognition — why (and how) people act. In short, this application helps you discover what makes people “tick”. When you know why someone needs something, or how they prefer to go about doing a task or interaction, then you have leverage to improve the situation. \n\nFor almost six decades, thousands of successful professionals — counselors, teachers, managers, coaches, salespeople, and others — have used the insights of Type Theory. Type Theory is supported by decades of published statistical analysis of over six million people.\n\nThe famous and highly respected Dr. Carl Jung first described eight cognitive processes people use. The eight processes combine to match the sixteen personality Types. Thus, when you learn about Type Theory, you learn what occurs on the inside; in a person’s head and heart — and how they relate back-and-forth with others. No other personality theory can give you this picture.\n\nThis application is ideal for serious students of psychology. Learning about ourselves and others is not done by simply “taking a test” that “tells” us who we are. Although we include multiple personality assessments, genuine learning for adults involves continual exploration and reflection. This application gives you tools; you the one who brings the curiosity and patience for discovery.\n\nEXPERTISE:\nThis application is the work of renowned Type Theorist and UCLA lecturer Dario Nardi, PhD, author of numerous books on personality psychology, cognition, neuroscience, and self-leadership. Dr. Nardi has worked with many other experts, including practicing organizational development consultants and psychologists. What you get is the product of many minds and personalities, not just one.\n\nFEATURES:\n•   Save Multiple Personality Assessments and Profiles For Reference\n•   Includes Three Personality Assessments: “Short Form”, “Long Form”, and “Standard-Form”\n•   Essential Details of the Well-Known 16 Personality Types (“ESTJ”, “INFP”, etc) by Isabel Briggs-Myers\n•   Keywords to Apply Subtle Influence on Others\n•   A Super “Compare” Feature to Pinpoint and Manage Commonalities and Differences Between Any Two Personality Types\n•   An Explanation of Type Theory with Links to Handy Online Resources"

You may have stressful job, like manager reporting to executives or customer facing specialist, which makes you feel exhausted at the end of your long day. You may be on emotional rollercoaster as your partner is making your heart tear apart. Or you may simply be curious to know yourself better. This app may help! Bring your iMoodJournal to your therapist or discuss it with your close friend to maximize its positive impact on your life.\n\n* To get the best out of the app, please keep regular records (preferably 2 – 3 times a day) of your mood with tags and self-portraits for at least 1 – 2 weeks. The Weekly Cycle chart requires several weeks of records to generate meaningful output. We wish you the very best experience with iMoodJournal.

When the track is finished you will see a map of the track with the markers. A summary will show the length of the track, number of markers and the time it took for you to walk the track.\n\nWhen your dog walks the track Dog Track will draw a new track on the map and automatically mark the markers your dog finds. You will see the track you walked and in real time follow your dog's track.\n\nAfter you and your dog have walked the track you will see a map that shows both tracks, which marker your dog has found, track length and time. You can log weather and wind conditions and also write your own comments.\n\nDog Track requires that Location service, GPS and Mobile Data is enabled on your phone.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "Muskulär avslappning med Eva Johansson.\n\n\nAvslappningsträning är bland det mest effektiva hjälpmedel som finns för att sänka grundspänningen i kroppen. En sänkt grundspänning leder till enorma vinster i höjd livskvalitet. Att ha för hög muskelspänning även när du inte presterar eller gör någonting, tar onödig energi och gör att du lättare och fortare blir trött.\n\nEn stunds avslappning ger dig en djup vila och en känsla av återhämtning. Den kan användas för att samla kraft inför olika uppgifter. Din koncentrationsförmåga och ditt minne blir bättre. Du får mer energi och känner dig lugnare och gladare. Du har lättare att påverka dig själv i stressande situationer. Du förstår dina egna känslor och reaktioner bättre. Du får en större medvetenhet om det egna jaget och får bättre självinsikt, ser dina möjligheter tydligare och blir känsligare för kroppens signaler.\n\nAvslappning är också grunden i mental träning. När du kan hantera avslappningstekniken har du större kontroll över den omedvetna delen av ditt jag. Då kan du använda avslappningen till att samla kraft inför uppgifter och utmaningar du ställs inför. \n\nFörutom tre avslappningsövningar och en mer mindfulnessinspirerad övning får du träningstips och lära dig det du behöver om avslappning för att ta dig till din nästa nivå av mående och livskvalitet. \n\n  • muskulär avslappning\n  • muskelavslappning \n  • kort muskelavslappning \n  • medveten fokus\n\n\nMuskulär avslappning ingår i en serie appar gjorda och inspelade av Eva Johansson som brukar få feedback på att ha en av Sveriges skönaste avslappningsröster. \n\n\"Eva du har den skönaste avslappningsröst jag lyssnat på. Tack för all bra info som följer med, nu är jag på gång och ser fram emot fler appar.\"\nRoger Peterson\n\n\nBra anledningar att träna avslappning och mental träning.\n\nGrundspänningen. \nAlltför många går omkring och spänner fler muskler än vad som är nödvändigt för det de gör. Utan att ens vara medvetna om det. Det här gör att du i förlängningen töms på energi, blir trött och orkeslös. Regelbunden avslappningsträning sänker din grundspänning till normalnivå och kropp och sinne får chans till återhämtning.\n\nSjälvpåverkan. \nAvslappning är också grunden i mental träning med vars hjälp du kan ändra ditt liv genom att jobba med tankar och inre bilder som ger dig det du vill ha. Under det avslappnade tillståndet är du mer mottaglig för nya tankar och kan lätt påverka dig själv för att ta dig dit du vill. \n\nHälsan. \nOm huvudvärk, muskelvärk, återkommande förkylningar och trötthet är sådant som tillhör din vardag kan du säga adjö till dessa åkommor. Regelbunden avslappning gör att din sömn blir bättre, kommer fortare och att du vaknar mer utvilad. På sikt stärker avslappningsträningen immunförsvaret vilket ger kroppen en bättre läkningsförmåga. Avslappningsträningen löser dessutom både fysiska och psykiska spänningar. Bästa hjälpen att göra sig av med stress och behålla lugnet.\n\nInre balans. \nAvslappningen hjälper dig att hitta din inre balans, du tänker klarare och får mer energi. När du känner att du kan styra över din kropp och medvetet påverka dig själv på ett djupare plan kan du också hantera det som händer i ditt liv på ett mer konstruktivt sätt. Du får en större medvetenhet om det egna jaget och får bättre självinsikt, ser dina möjligheter tydligare och blir känsligare för kroppens signaler.\n\nMindfulskolan\nBlir du sugen på att lära dig mer om avslappning och mindfulness då rekommenderar jag Mindfulskolan. En webbutbildning som du gör där du är på tider som passar dig. Och den ger resultat! \nwww.utbildning-co.se/mindfulskolan"

      "label": "*************************\nSalatuk is your Muslim Prayers Companion.\n\nBy locating you automatically, this application gives you the appropriate prayer times as well as the direction of the Qibla. \n\nThe Salatuk algorithm supports many calculation methods adopted by most Muslim countries. Depending on your location, the application choose the appropriate calculation method and Fiqhi school. \n\nFor an accurate location, please ensure that your location settings and your Internet connection or your GPS are enabled!\n\nNote about App features :\n-------------------------------\nIf you are familiar with Salatuk in other platforms please note that this version DOESN'T SUPPORT some features like \"Turn Phone to Silent after Athan\". Other features like \"Full Athan\" and \"Custom Athan\" are supported only when the app is ope. This is because of technical limitations. We will try to fix it once iOS system allows it.\n\nNote about Athan :\n-----------------\nSalatuk remind you that it's time for prayer with a \"4 takbeerats\" instead of full Athan. Because of technical limitations, it's possible to play full Athan only if the app is open. \n\nAlso, if you have problems to hear the notifications, please make sure to enable the following parameters in your device :\n\n1) Settings>Sounds>Alerts \n2) Settings>Notifications>Salatuk \n3) Your phone is not on mute and volume is correct\n\nNote about Prayers times :\n-----------------------------------\nPlease note that we pay attention to ensure that the prayer times of Salatuk are accurate. However, in some countries those times may be not exact. In this case, please refer to the official islamic institutions or mosques in your country and adjust manually the prayer times in the application settings.\n\nSalatuk supports currently 3 languages : Arabic, English and French.\n\nTips for a better usage\n-----------------------------\n\n1- In order to refresh the prayer alarms, make sure to open the application once a week. Please do so also when you change your location or timing (summer time).\n\n2- The prayer alarms corresponds to 2 or 4 Takbeerats. If you want to hear the complete Athan you should open the app at the moment of the Athan.\n\n**********************************************************************************\n\nتطبيق صلاتك رفيقك للحفاظ على صلاتك.\nعن طريق تحديد موقعك  تلقائيا، بإمكان هذا التطبيق أن يعلمك بأوقات الصلاة وكذلك تحديد اتجاه القبلة. تطبيق صلاتك يستعمل عددا مهما من الطرق الحسابية  المعتمدة في أغلب العالم الإسلامي. اعتمادا على موقعك، يختار التطبيق طريقة الحساب والمدرسة الفقهية المناسبة. \n\nحول خصائص التطبيق \n---------------------\nإذا كنت ممن يستعمل صلاتك على أنظمة أخرى، المرجو الانتباه إلى أن هذه النسخة لا تحتوي على بعض الخصائص مثل \"التحويل إلى الصامت\" كما أن بعض الخصائص الأخرى مثل \"الأذان الكامل\" و\"إضافة أذان من الذاكرة\" لا تشتغل إلا إذا كان التطبيق مفتوحا. يرجع ذلك إلى بعض القيود التقنية الموجودة حاليا في نظام أبل وسنحاول دعمها حالما ترفع هذه القيود.\n\n\nحول سماع الأذان \n---------------\nمن ناحية  أخرى إذا كان عندك مشكل في سماع التنبيهات، المرجو التاكد من أن الإعدادات التالية مفعلة في هاتفك : \n1) الإعدادات > الأصوات > تنبيهات التذكير\n2) الإعدادات >التنبيهات > صلاتك   \n3) هاتفك ليس في الوضع الصامت والصوت في مستوى جيد\n\nحول مواقيت الصلاة:\n-----------------\nننوه إلى أنه رغم المجهودات لتدقيق مواقيت الصلاة التي يقوم بها فريق صلاتك، إلا أنه في بعض البلدان قد تكون المواقيت غير مضبوطة بشكل تام، في هذه الحالة نرجو منكم الاعتماد على المواقيت الرسمية في بلدكم أو المسجد القريب منكم، مع العلم أنه يمكنكم تعديل الأوقات يدويا في نافذة الإعدادات.\n\nنصائح من أجل استعمال أفضل \n-------------------------\n\n1- حتى يتم تحديث إشعارات الأذان إحرص على فتح التطبيق مرة كل أسبوع على الأقل أو عندما تغير مكانك أو يتغير التوقيت في بلدك (التوقيت الصيفي)\n\n2- تطبيق صلاتك يشعرك بدخول وقت الصلاة على شكل تكبيرتين أو 4 تكبيرات. إذا أردت أن تستمع إلى الأذان كاملا المرجو أن تفتح التطبيق أثناء الأذان."

Enjoy hundreds of lighting and sound environments at your fingertips...\n\n(Full Editor included with your purchase, dozens of designer collections other than \"Starter Pack\" available as in-app purchases) \n\nTake full advantage of Philips hue, LIFX, Nanoleaf, & Belkin WeMo*, or control them all at once with presets, animations, groups, triggers, transitions, and more! From theater productions, to mood lighting in a restaurant, to everyday home living, Lightbow has something for everybody! \n\n* Lightbow is an independent 3rd party app, and not affiliated with the companies that make Philips hue, LIFX, WeMo, or Nanoleaf *\n\n** Buy Lightbow for iPhone or iPad, then download on your Apple TV for free (or vice versa). See Lightbow's description on the Apple TV App Store for more details on current functionality. Check www.lightbow.net/hardware to see which features are supported in your specific setup. **\n\nPresets \n\n- Combine custom multi-step animation loops, static colors, or ON/OFF/Brightness commands for any sets of lights or groups. Activate them all with a single tap.\n- Light animations even run in the background (when you close the app, or hit the sleep button)\n- Share presets with others in your household on your local WiFi network—no emails or passwords necessary!\n- Give each preset a transition, such as crossfade, flashbulb, or fading through a specific color.\n- Randomization ranges offer interesting variations on colors each time you activate a preset.\n- Organize your Presets into Collections for greater flexibility and scalability.\n\nTriggers\n\n- Activate any preset with Siri, countdown timers, alarms, events like opening/closing Lightbow, or even a shake of your phone.\n- For hue tap owners, choose the colors and fade time that each button will trigger on your Philips lights.\n\nGroups \n\n- Put your Philips or LIFX hardware into groups to control sets of lights together.\n- Group lights by room, function, or anything else. Lights can be in multiple groups! \n- Set a color on different models of lighting hardware, and Lightbow will automatically calibrate that color to match up where possible.\n\nLight Control \n\n- From one simple screen, you can rename, reorder, and switch on or off any of your lights. \n- Set the mood of a room with control over the hue, saturation, brightness, and color temperature of each bulb.\n- Use your Belkin WeMo Outlet, LightSwitch, or Insight hardware to turn any electrical device on or off, not just lights!\n- Enjoy your LIFX bulbs using the same familiar interface.

All you need to know is one of the sizes — the application will tell the rest. Making a shopping trip to another country, online purchasing and an unexpected gift to your beloved will be easier when you can convert sizes on the go.\n\nWhy do we make Sizer?\n\nToday there is no easy way to order clothes online and be sure that it will fit on you well. Size charts do not help, because the size varies and depends on the brand, season, style and region. Size is the reason for the return of 30% of purchased goods online.\n\nSizer is designed to solve this problem - a smart algorithm that learns based on user data:\n1) be brave in online shopping;\n2) forget about returns;\n3) save shopping from stress.\n\n\nHow does Sizer work?\n\n1. You select sizes with the help of our algorithm.\n2. With the help of a button you give feedback - fit or didn’t fit.\n3. Sizer teaches the sizing algorithm.\n\nShopping is no longer a lottery with Sizer.\n\n\n\"An application that remembers that last year your jeans were two sizes smaller.\"\nGQ Russia\n\n\"You could've just said \"We have Beautiful Pixels!\". Seriously, loved the app.\"\n— BeautifulPixels.com"

As you listen your brainwaves fall into step with this inaudible beat, and after several minutes synchronize with the target frequency. \n\nBrain Wave Altered State uses the most advanced multi-stage binaural sequences available, combined with the flexibility to choose from a range of relaxing ambient backgrounds, other audio apps, or your own iTunes Music, allowing your mind you to relax and synchronize with your desired state.

The writing is clean and witty. The drinks? Delicious. \n\n5 Star - Fantastic!! \n(UK iTunes review)\nI didn't think that this application would be up to the same standard set by the book (which is THE definitive cocktail bible), but I couldn't have been more wrong! It's every bit as informative as the book, and the fact that it's interactive - it lists the cocktails that you can make from the drinks in your cabinet - makes it even easier to use. And at the price of half a pint of beer, it's astonishingly under-priced for such a brilliant application.\n\n5 Star - Marvelous \n(UK iTunes review)\nLooks as good as the books, fits in the pocket......."

      "label": "NEWS:\nFamily Tracker was used to locate a missing child - see news report on: http://www.reuters.com/article/net-us-app-missing-idUSBRE8460GZ20120507\n\n***SUPPORT NOTICE**** \nWe do help everyone who contacts us via our iphone@logsat.com email address, but unfortunately most users give bad ratings without ever contacting us for support. Please do contact us if you have any issues, we're always there to help! \n*************** \n\nFamily Tracker allows you to track your wife, husband, children and fiancée. You can now find out where they are, at anytime, as long as they have their phones with them. Family Tracker is available for other platforms as well, so you can track (and be tracked by) other devices as well - check our website for more details. \n\nPlease note that starting with the new iOS4 and supported hardware, Family Tracker runs in the background at all times, and, unlike previous versions of Family Tracker, user intervention is **NOT** needed for you to track them. Family Tracker runs at all times, continuously updating the GPS location of the device. Even if the iPhone is rebooted, Family Tracker will automatically resume tracking and updating its position! \n\nSo how does this work? \n\nSimple. Install Family Tracker on the iPhone/iPad you want to track. From then on, you can use either a web browser or via the Family Tracker app itself installed on your own iPhone/iPad to locate your family member. \n\nIf the device you wish to track does not support multitasking (for example, older iPhones 3G, iPads), you can still use Family Tracker to locate the family member. Using the web or your own iPhone, you will be able to \"ping\" the other iPhone. This is done by sending the other iPhone a (free) “Apple Push Notification” which will cause an alert to sound on your family member’s iPhone, even if the phone in is stand-by, just as would happen if the iPhone receives an SMS. As soon as this alert is acknowledged, their GPS position will be recorded, and their location will be updated on a map. If you are using an iPhone yourself to track them, you will be sent a Push Notification to inform you that the family member has accepted your \"ping\". These notifications will be automatically re-sent every 60 seconds until they are acknowledged. If the recipient is trying to ignore them or does not hear them, this repetition will help acknowledging them. \n\nFamily Tracker does not need to know your iPhone cell number to function, as it does not send SMS messages for notifications. Your email address is instead used to send free Apple Push Notifications to the iPhones being tracked. These notifications are free, specific to our Family Tracker application, and work anywhere in the world as long as the iPhone and/or iTouch being tracked has internet access via the cellular network or WiFi. \n\nNotice: ***Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.*** For this reason, we strongly recommend users to configure Family Tracker to use the \"Driving Only\" accuracy in the GPS setting. This special mode updates the GPS location only when a significant location change occurs, which results in a tremendous gain in battery life.\n\nAdditional pro features, such as the ability to see the past locations for the previous 2 weeks, and the ability to set geofences so you are alerted when users that you track enter or leave certain areas are available via an optional iTunes subscription.\nSubscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions are available for either $1.99/month, or $5.99/3 months, or $9.99/6 months or $19.99/year. Privacy policy & terms of use: http://logsat.com/family-tracker-privacy.asp"

      "label": "Pleasure Machine is a simple erotic game for couples with slot machine interface, and is ideal for heating up your foreplay.\n \nThe erotic slot machine features three rotating reels with displayed parts of the human body, erotic activities and time limits. By starting the slot machine, the first partner sets all three reels in motion. After the reels come to a halt, he/she can already look forward to the sweet prize - a random erotic experience being the combination of the activity, at which bodypart to be performed, and for how long. The partners take turns and so after the activity is over the other partner pushes the SPIN button and awaits his/her erotic price.\n \nBut be careful, because it is not always clear who is going to please whom. Each turn is a thrilling experience right to the last moment thanks to the negative time values on the time limit reel. When the negative time limit appears, the partner who spun the reels will treat his/her partner.\n \nIn this game, you can either use the provided slot machines or create your own. You can change the slot machines during the game to accommodate your taste for the softer or more daring tasks.   \n \nFor the quick start, there are five predefined erotic slot machines available, carefully created to avoid unreal combinations. You can adjust each slot machine to suit your preferences, and also to create your own.  There are many possibilities to think of and it’s up to you and your imagination which stimulating combinations you will create.\n \nThis erotic game is suitable for all couples regardless of their sexual orientation. Thus, each couple can spice-up their love life.  \n \nPleasure Machine is a game with erotic content and is for adults only. PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL IF YOU’RE UNDER 18.\n\nGame is also translated in Slovak, Czech and Polish language. You can set those languages directly in the game global settings."

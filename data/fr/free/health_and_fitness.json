      "label": "Macadam is the first step counter app that makes you earn money when you walk.\n\nEvery step you do is tracked in the app with our pedometer and is automatically rewarded with real financial gains. \n \nLooking for a pedometer that really motivates you by paying you for each step? It's right here!\n\n\nHOW TO MAKE PROFITS WITH MACADAM \n\nStep #1 Macadam connects to your phone's step counter via Apple Health \nStep #2 The app earns you corners every time you put one foot in front of the other, whether it's a walk or a real run. \nStep #3 You can then exchange this virtual currency for real euros, spend your earnings at our partners or request a bank transfer. \n \nPut on your sneakers and go for a walk or a run, we promise you that it pays off!\n\nMacadam works equally well for walking, hiking, running or even a marathon. \n\nWHY A PEDOMETER THAT PAYS ME? \n \nTo fight against sedentary lifestyle! One human out of 2 has a sedentary lifestyle, which is a real health problem. \n\nMany people find it difficult to motivate themselves and stay in shape. So we try a funny and modern approach: The Reward! Rewarding people with money when they motivate themselves by walking. \n\nWith Macadam you can either walk or run! What matters to us is to reward you for getting moving. \n\n\nSTEP COUNTER APP FEATURES: \n\n- Pedometer (Number of steps, distance and kilometers traveled)\n- Calorie Tracker (Number of KCAL calories burned) \n- Step converter (convert your steps into euros) \n\n\n\nWHAT HEALTH AND WALKING DATA IS AVAILABLE?\n\nLike all step counters, our pedometer gives you access to the number of your daily steps, as well as a tracking of caloric expenditure and distance traveled.\nOf course, your data is completely anonymous and we will never sell it. \n\nMacadam does not use any GPS data and does not affect your battery.  \n \n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS : \n\n- What currency do I earn with the Macadam pedometer? \n\nThe app allows you to earn coins. This currency can be exchanged into money (euros) with a few clicks in the app. \nAlthough it is a virtual currency, coins are not a cryptocurrency, and we are not a web3-based move-to-earn app. \n\n- Is the step counter reliable? \n\nYes, we use data from Apple Health pedometer step sensor. For even more accuracy, you can use any connected watch or bracelet compatible with Apple Health (Apple Watch, Withings, Honor, Suunto, Fossil, Garmin, Fitbit, etc.)\n\n- Can I use it for running? \n\nOf course you can! Macadam works perfectly with running. \n\n- Are you affiliated with any other apps that pay for walking (walk to earn)? \n\nMacadam is an independent walk to earn app and is not affiliated with Sweatcoin, StepN, Walk and Earn, million Steps, Fancy Gifts, Nike+ Running, Strava, Charity Miles, Runkeeper, Endomondo, Calo, Fitmint, Movn, Wirtual, Istep, Aglet, Moofit, Movez\n\n\nGrab your legs, your feet, put on your shoes, your sneakers, go for a run or a walk and start earning money with Macadam step counter. \n\nYou walk ? We reward! Download Macadam"

      "label": "Get to a healthier and more active life with Google Fit!\n\nIt’s hard to know how much or what kind of activity you need to stay healthy. That’s why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\n\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You’ll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO’s recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nSEE YOUR WORKOUTS\nGet insights and see stats such as heart rate, speed, pace, route, and more for your runs, walks, and bike rides.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and steps. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.\n\nMAKE EVERY MOVE COUNT\nAll physical activity can help you lead a healthier life, and with Google Fit you can track it all in one place. Working with your favorite fitness apps and devices, Google Fit builds a journal of your activity. And to make sure Fit never misses a workout, you can manually add any activity your other apps didn’t track - from Aerobics to Zumba!\n\nCONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES\nGoogle Fit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices that are compatible with Apple Health to give you a holistic view of your health, so you’ll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Headspace, and more.\n\nCHECK IN AT ANYTIME, FROM ANYWHERE\nSee a snapshot of your activity history across Google Fit and your integrated apps in your journal.

It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

Other health related functions include a heart rate monitor (which keeps track of your heart rate during exercise), a sleep pattern monitor as well as reminders to drink water and to get up and move around.\nSport plays an important role here too, as the system can track different kinds of activity, such as hiking, running, cycling or football and can also monitor calories, measure the distance covered and record the time spent doing a particular activity.\nLotus SmarTime offers dial customization, allowing the user to choose between different watch faces.  All models have a full touch display, giving easy access and flexibility when moving between other functions, which also include music and camera remote control, notification control and “Find my phone” options.\n\nThe SmarTime app can share your activity data with Apple's Health app."

      "label": "MIEUX VIVRE LE STRESS AVEC RESPIRELAX+\n\nDepuis sa création en 2012 par les Thermes d’Allevard, l’application RespiRelax+ vous permet de retrouver calme et détente en quelques minutes seulement. L’évolution que nous vous proposons aujourd’hui intègre toutes les demandes faites par les utilisateurs de RespiRelax depuis 2012. \n\nElles ont été longuement travaillées et mises au point avec le docteur David O’Hare expert international en la matière et auteur de différents ouvrages sur le sujet dont les fameux « 365 – guide de la cohérence cardiaque jour après jour » et « Maigrir grâce à la cohérence cardiaque ».\nMalgré la complexité des modifications proposées, l’esprit Respirelax+ est toujours présent : une application gratuite, efficace, à l’esthétisme particulièrement soigné et d’utilisation simple grâce à une ergonomie très intuitive.\n\nNouveautés 2017\nAvec cette nouvelle version, il vous est désormais possible :\n- De poursuivre l’utilisation habituelle de l’application à savoir un guide respiratoire vous amenant à l’état de cohérence cardiaque grâce à la respiration 5 secondes /5 secondes (5/5 soit 6 cycles complets par minutes) avec possibilité de travailler des effets dynamisants ou relaxants (légère augmentation ou réduction des phases d’inspiration ou d’expiration).\n- De pratiquer les yeux fermés grâce à l’ajout d’une musique qui suit le rythme 5/5. Cette musique originale a été aimablement composée par Pascal Gravante(1) (uniquement en mode équilibre).\n- Pour les débutants, la fonction « entraînement » permet d’arriver progressivement et facilement au rythme 5/5 sur une session de 10 minutes.\n- Pour les experts, il est désormais possible de régler le temps d’inspiration et le temps d’expiration en fonction des données physiologiques de l’utilisateur, notamment l’utilisation du rythme 5,5/5,5 qui semble procurer chez certains de meilleurs résultats. \n- Augmentation notable de la durée des sessions selon les effets désirés.\n- Refonte de l’environnement graphique\n- Disponible sur Apple Store et Google Store\n\nExercez-vous maintenant…\nVous pouvez faire cet exercice, en prévention, trois fois par jour ; avant un événement stressant (prise de parole en public, décision importante, …) ; lorsque vous vous sentez stressé ou irritable ; avant de vous endormir. Pour ce dernier cas, il faut débuter par une session de quelques minutes au rythme 5/5 puis passer au rythme 3/3 pour activer l’endormissement.\n\nEtape 1\nFaites les réglages du RespiRelax+ en fonction, du nombre de respirations complètes à la minute (par défaut 6), de l’effet escompté : équilibre, détente ou dynamique et de la durée de l’exercice (Pas moins de 3 minutes).\nLancez l’application RespiRelax+ et synchronisez votre respiration sur la bulle qui monte (j’inspire) et qui descend (j’expire). L’inverse est aussi possible (j’inspire à la descente et j’expire à la montée) si vous souhaitez coordonner votre exercice à la montée et la descente du diaphragme. \nDans tous les cas, vous devez respirer tranquillement, sans forcer. Une fois que vous êtes à l’aise Il s’agit tout simplement de centrer son attention sur la région du cœur au centre de la poitrine.\nEtape 2\nImaginez, ensuite, que votre respiration entre et sort de votre cœur, au niveau du plexus solaire. Inspirations et expirations restent calées, tout en douceur, sur la bulle qui monte et descend.\nEtape 3\nTout en maintenant votre attention sur le cœur et la respiration confortable, concentrez-vous sur le souvenir d'un moment agréable. Essayez, alors, de laisser venir, sans forcer, le sentiment de satisfaction, de bien-être, ou de plaisir attaché dans votre mémoire à ce moment privilégié.\n\nCette application a été développée par les Thermes d’Allevard (Isère-France), \nPour aller plus loin : www.thermes-allevard.com\n\n(1) – Pascal Gravante, compositeur suisse."

Range for close range control is up to 30 feet when you have a direct line of sight. 360° range is between 5-10 feet, based on your surroundings.\n\nUse two smartphones to drastically increase your partner's control range. This is perfect for those wanting discreet public play within larger spaces. Simply connect with your partner's phone within the app and give up control! The person with a toy should have their smartphone within 3-5 feet of them at all times. The app can run in the background, so it can be in your purse or pocket while your partner has complete control via their smartphone. This feature is also great for long distance couples. \n\nYou also have the ability to create your own vibration patterns. Our fun tap and slide control interface makes it easy to make unique patterns. Our powerful vibration motor allows a large range of possibilities. After creating a pattern, you can share it (anonymously) with the world. Take a look at the vibration patterns already uploaded and download the ones you like! \n\nOther Settings (must select for each partner):\n-\tGive full control to some (don't need to continually allow them to gain control)\n-\tVibration notifications during text messages\n-\tNotifications when you partner logs into the app\n-\tAuto-play a pattern when it’s sent to you\n\nNot seeing a feature you would like? Contact us at support@lovense.com! Our full time development team would love to incorporate your suggestions into our app."

      "label": "Virtuagym Food: Helping you to live healthy and feel great. Get a free personalized nutrition plan by answering a few questions about your lifestyle and goals. We support plans for many goals: weight loss, maintaining weight, weight gain and building muscle. Eat what you want, but keep an eye on those calories, carbs and fats!\n\nFEATURES\n* Food Database Validated by Expert Nutritionists\n* Add your own foods\n* Save meals and add them instantly next time\n* Nutrition tracking for several goals (e.g. weight loss & muscle building)\n* More than a calorie counter: keep an eye on those carbs, proteins and fats as well\n* Integrated with Virtuagym Fitness for home & gym workouts\n* Health app integration: Sync workouts from other apps, and save your eaten calories, carbs, proteins and fat in the Health app, so other apps can use this data\n\nWHY VIRTUAGYM IS THE BEST\n- Many other nutrition apps or calorie counters don’t have a lot of knowledge about fitness. Therefore, mistakes are being made with calorie tracking. Our apps are made in cooperation with fitness professionals and expert nutritionists, making Virtuagym the most accurate app on the market.\n- It’s not a regular calorie counter. We count everything: carbs, proteins and fats, allowing you to use Virtuagym food for other goals than weight loss, like gaining weight and muscle building.\n - We were one of the first apps in the Health and Fitness category and over the last few years we have been featured in the Health and Fitness category in several countries.\n\nVALIDATED FOOD DATABASE\nOur food database is linked to several official food databases. These food databases are updated on a regular basis. The foods on this list have been validated by expert nutritionists.\n\nFOR A VARIETY OF GOALS:\n- Weight loss: focus on those calories to lose weight. Combine our calorie counter with exercising with Virtuagym Fitness and reach your goals!\n- Maintaining weight: find the diet plan that’s right for you. You’ll get a balanced diet plan, with enough calories, carbs, proteins and fats.\n- Gain weight: eat, eat, eat. Find out which foods help you to reach your goals.\n- Building muscle: you’ll need protein. Lots of protein. Use our protein counter to see which foods are best for you.\n\nDIFFERENT DIET PLANS:\nWe have diet plans for multiple goals. You can select your own diet plan (low carb, high protein, low calorie, whatever you want), and we provide you with your personal diet plan. Virtuagym Food comes with several diet plans:\n- Durable\n- High Protein Diet\n- Low Carb Diet\n- Muscle Building Diet\n- Athlete\n- Cardio \n- After Weight Loss Diet\n- Custom: select your own percentages of carbohydrates, proteins and fats.\n\nAnother good thing about Virtuagym Food is that it can be used by vegetarians as well. You can eat whatever you want. Just keep an eye on the nutrients. So if you are vegetarian, just create your own vegetarian diet plan!\n\nFULLY INTEGRATED WITH VIRTUAGYM FITNESS\n- One account, access to everything you need\n- Complete Workouts\n- 3D-animated exercises\n- Written exercise instructions\n- Progress tracking: over 30 values available\n\nLIKE VIRTUAGYM?\nPlease rate us 5 stars, so we can keep improving it :) We’re continuously working on new features and we continuously add new 3D-animated exercises. If you have any suggestions, let us know. If you want to stay updated, get useful fitness tips or if you need motivation: follow us on Facebook and Twitter!\n\nPRO SUBSCRIPTION\nTo unlock the full app you can subscribe to our PRO membership.

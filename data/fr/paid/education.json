      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Steer the digger, fill the truck and repair the water pipe.\n2. Paint the house in different colours and unload the removals truck.\n3. Operate the crane and build a new roof for the house.\n4. Mix cement and build a real wall.\n5. Operate a big cement mixer and concrete a large area.\n6. Drive the street sweeper and clean the dirty road.\n7. Unload the crane truck and make sure it leaves on time.\n\nAmazing graphics, great animations, a user-friendly interface, no text and no in-app purchases.

      "label": "The advantages of Guido:\n\n     - Guido will help you learn to read music notes step by step:\n          - You start by learning with only two notes.\n          - When you master the first two notes, the application unlocks a new one.\n          - And so on until you have unlocked all the available notes.\n\n     - The application monitors your progress:\n          - Thanks to an experience system, the application will not unlock new notes until the previous ones are correctly assimilated.\n               - A correctly read note increases your experience.\n               - An incorrectly deciphered note reduces it.\n               - When you have enough experience, a new note is unlocked.\n               - If you lose some, a note will lock again so that you can strengthen your foundations.\n\n     - Guido motivates you:\n          - You have the possibility to set a daily objective.\n          - Chain up the most consecutive days in a row!\n          - Some successes are to be unlocked (50 notes in a row...).\n          - Unlock them all!\n\n     - Guido is easy to use and intelligent:\n          - No complex settings required.\n          - The application adapts the difficulty according to your level.\n          - The application has been designed to allow you to practice as soon as the application is launched.\n          - Guido calculates the scores for which you have difficulties and displays them more often.\n\n     - Play the notes directly on your piano:\n          - What is the point of learning to read notes if you can't find them on your piano to play them?\n          - Guido listens to your piano through the microphone of your device.\n          - Guido has an interface that allows you to find the notes on your piano.\n\n     - Continue your progress:\n          - Break your records (number of notes in 10 seconds, number of notes in a row).\n\n     - Correct your weaknesses:\n          - Guido's algorithm focuses on the notes for which you have the most difficulty.\n\n     - Support in english :\n          - Do you have a problem, a question, a suggestion for functionality? Guido support can be contacted from the application.\n\n\nSolfeggio allows you to read the notes of piano scores. When you master note reading you can use the unlimited and free resources available on the internet (downloadable scores) or read the score collection of your favorite composers. This will allow you to no longer be dependent on youtube applications or videos to learn how to play the song you want to play."

      "label": "A truly random coin flipping app.  Use it to decide the start of a game, or use it to help with your probability lesson in Math class.  Learn why this is a must have app by clicking the \"...More\" link now.\n\nCarter's Coin Flip Features:\n* Choose amongst 4 background images for different sports themes.\n* Record total Heads vs. Tails in stats mode.\n* Coins from France, Switzerland, Greece, Belguim, Great Britian and Spain\n* Export data from Statistics mode as CSV\n\n(4 Stars)\nUnlike most coin flips, this one has a random number key...so it's truly random and not just the same sequence every time.\n-Vintagengine\n\n(5 Stars)\nWhenever I use this app I win.  Gives me good luck!\n-Bsblfrk\n\nSo there you are, standing in the middle of the field; just you, the ref, and your opponent. Everyone’s waiting for the big moment—the coin toss. You anxiously await the words “Call it in the air”. Instead what you hear is “Anyone got a coin?” You look up and excitedly announce “Don’t worry, I’ve got it!” Quickly you run to the sidelines and return holding your iPhone or iPod Touch. You return and confidently hand your device to the referee. With a touch of his finger, or flick of his wrist he has activated this app right there on the spot, and you've saved the day.\n\nThough the original purpose of Carter’s Coin Flip is really pretty simple, the variety of tasks it can accomplish is anything but. This isn’t just another coin flipping device to make quick on-the-spot decisions; this also is a math aid as well. We’ve all been there…the dreaded “outcome and probability” assignments. We’ve done such tried and true concepts as “Rock, Paper, Scissors”, or maybe rolling dice. Although these activities are time consuming they are valuable demonstrations of probability rules and statistical principles. With Carter’s Coin Flip on your iPhone or iPod Touch, not only are the results quick, they are also totally random unlike many other coin flipping apps which operate on a repetitive sequence time after time. In Statistics mode, we also keep a running tally of all flips that were performed. You can go back and see which result you got on the first flip, the fiftieth flip, or the five thousandth flip.\n\nWith Carter’s Coin Flip app, you are also not restricted to solely using a single coin to “toss”. By simply double-tapping the screen you can change the coin. Pick from the British Pound, Swiss Franc or the Spanish Peseta (complete with a soccer ball encrusted on the piece and chosen especially with all of you soccer fans in mind). More coins will be added in future updates You can also pick from four different backgrounds. One of them is sure to match your favorite sport. Just tap the background to make that oh-so-important flip even more realistic.\n\nWhether you are on the field, in math class, or are just plain bored, Carters Coin Flip for your iPhone or iPod Touch is here to help you at kick-off time or math test time. This new and unique app clearly stands heads (and tails) above the rest."

Using all touch features which kids love with playful sounds and professionally recorded voiceovers, this is a complete learning experience for any child who is beginning to learn Sight Words or looking to enhance vocabulary and memory.\n\nThese high-frequency​ words should be recognized instantly by readers.\nDr. Edward B. Fry's Instant Words (which are often referred to as the \"Fry Words\") are the most common words used in English ranked in order of frequency.\n\n• 25 words make up approximately 1/3 of all items published.\n• 100 words comprise approximately 1/2 of all of the words found in publications.\n• 300 words make up approximately 65% of all written material.\nOver half of every newspaper article, textbook, children's story, and the novel is composed of these 300 words. It is difficult to write a sentence without using several of the first 300 words in the Fry 1000 Instant Words List.\nConsequently, students need to be able to read the first 300 Instant Words without a moment's hesitation.\n\nThe Fry 1000 Instant Words have been arranged in the order of frequency, which they occur in printed material.\nAfter Fry developed his word lists, he worked to inspire young children to memorize these sight words to jump-start the reading process. The Fry 1000 Instant Words and lists are widely used today and highly respected by both teachers and parents.\nMany of the Fry 1000 Instant Words are difficult to portray with pictures or hard to sound out through phonics methods. Therefore, these words must be learned as sight words and they must be quickly recognized in order to achieve reading fluency."

Then you’ll love Busy Shapes designed for children from 2 years old!\n\n*** Featured in App Store Best of 2014 ***\n*** Featured worldwide by App Store as a Best New App ***\n*** Featured in the USA Today ***\n*** Recommended by The Good App Guide ***\n*** Common Sense Media Editors' Pick 2014 ***\n*** Parents‘ Choice Awards 2014 ***\n*** Children's Technology Review Awards 2014 ***\n\n> Inspired by the pioneering works of famed Swiss scientist and intelligence expert Jean Piaget (1896-1980)\n> Helps children improve their ability to handle simple objects through a series of engaging puzzles\n> Real-time dashboard to monitor progress\n> Includes an array of kid-friendly features, such as “passing” swipe control & more!\n\nABOUT BUSY SHAPES\nBusy Shapes helps children improve their ability to handle simple objects through a series of puzzles, in which they must change simple shapes and place them in proper holes. Along the way, the app responds to each child’s actions with positive guidance and motivation. Plus, the app’s digital exploratory playground regularly refreshes with different objects, which keeps children interested and engaged.\n\nINSPIRED BY JEAN PIAGET\nBusy Shapes is inspired by the pioneering works of famed Swiss scientist and intelligence expert Jean Piaget (1896-1980), who believed that “children are little scientists”, and that a child's thoughts are built through experiences that encourage him or her to engage in the reasoning process.\n\nINNOVATIVE, SCALEABLE PLATFORM\nBusy Shapes’ innovative scaleable platform for evolving experimentation lets children take advantage of the time they spend on touch screens -- so they aren’t just having fun, but learning every second of the way.\n\nKID-FRIENDLY DESIGN\nBusy Shapes features a special “kid-friendly” design that compensates for the fact that when young children hold an iPad or iPhone, they often have a finger touching the screen.\n\n“PASSING” SWIPE CONTROL\nBusy Shapes features “passing” swipe control that is essential for young children's quick hands (i.e. even if a child's finger reaches an object after he or she was already touching the screen, the object is still grasped as intended).\n\nPOWERFUL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)\nBusy Shapes’ powerful AI supports each child’s unique learning journey. For example, the AI tracks the time it takes each child to complete a level, and increases or decreases difficulty accordingly.\n\nGUIDED ACCESS\nTo prevent children from exiting the app by pressing the “home” button, Busy Shapes features a customizable Guided Access. This feature also disables selected parts of the screen for safety and protection.\n\nSEAMLESS INTERACTION\nBusy Shapes’ seamless interactive game area never blocks or limits children, and lets them freely access shapes. The menu is also neatly hidden away.\n\nAUTOMATIC MEMORY\nSometimes the best learning is a combination of cognitive exercise and physical play. Busy Shapes’ automatic memory saves a child’s place in any particular game, which makes the app an ideal complement to physical play and for shorter games.\n\nMULTIPLE LANGUAGE SUPPORT\nThe app is now available in: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Greek, Dutch, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Turkish, Russian, Korean, Indonesian, Malay, Vietnamese, Thai, Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese\n\nCONNECT WITH US!\nIf you have any support request, please write at support@edokiacademy.com or visit the Edoki Academy Online Community at edokiacademy.com."

Crazy Gears is a new-aged digital puzzle game, designed with a real mechanical engine and with children's critical thinking skills in mind! Hours of fun guaranteed for everyone who is up for the challenge, yes, even you Mom & Dad!\n\n*** Children's Technology Review Awards 2015 ***\n*** Parent's Choice Gold Winner Fall 2015***\n*** App of the week by Fun2Tap ***\n*** Best of the Best by Best Apps For Kids ***\n*** Featured worldwide by App Store as a Best New App ***\n\n\nABOUT CRAZY GEARS\nExplore a captivating digital playground in this tantalizing puzzle game! Children manipulate gears, chains, rods, and pulleys, to pull themselves through each level, which teaches them how different mechanisms affect one another when constructing a machine. Each reasoning challenge was carefully designed to adhere to the theories of educational technology pioneer, mathematician, computer scientist, and designer of the first programming language for children, Seymour Papert.\n\n“The best use of games is to leverage their tendency to enhance learning”- Papert\nRecommended Ages 5-9 \n\nAs a child, Papert fell in love with gears. Their movement fascinated him in every way and inspired his career. Crazy Gears was conceived not only as a tribute to him, but with the hope of providing a child with the inspiration to discover and understand the physical properties of mechanisms found in their everyday lives. Such complex notions include tension, motion, and gravity. We achieve this by encouraging the child to manipulate the objects in each level to determine how they work together to accomplish a goal.  Interactions with technology give kids the power to construct their understanding of STEM/STEAM subjects in meaningful ways. Here we engage them in play that does just that!\n\n\nFEATURES\n• No rules\n• No explicit instructions \n• Kid-Friendly​ Design\n• Powerful Artificial Intelligence\n• Seamless Interaction\n• Multiple Language Support\n• Crash Resistant Design\n• Bold, bright colors\n• Automatic Memory\n• Special mode for children with CVI\n\nSTEM/STEAM TOPICS EXPLORED\n• Gears \n• Mechanical Systems (simple and complex) \n• Action and Reaction \n• Motion (circular, rotary, and reciprocating) \n• Ratios\n• Tension\n• Torque and Speed\n• Mechanical Advantage \n\nABOUT US\nEdoki Academy’s mission is to provide children with enjoyable early-learning activities using the latest technologies. Our team members, many of whom are young parents or teachers, strive to produce tools that motivate and inspire children to learn, play, and progress. \n\nPRIVACY\nWe take your child’s privacy very seriously, for this reason, we are proud to offer a product that is certified COPPA compliant by PRIVO. \n\nCONNECT WITH US!\nIf you have any support requests, comments, or questions do not hesitate to contact us at support@edokiacademy.com.

      "label": "From the multi award-winning animators and producers of BAFTA nominated pre-school learning favourites Alphablocks and Numberblocks, we bring you Numberblocks Hide and Seek.\n\nAs seen on Cbeebies.\n\nThis app helps your child get to grips with addition, number bonds and other key number skills. Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

      "label": "NoteWorks is a musical game, designed to teach note recognition and improve sight reading skills. Hungry Munchy is eager to swallow elusive blue notes. Your goal is to help Munchy catch each note as quickly as possible. \n\nThe game combines learning and fun into a single gratifying experience. The app is both educational and entertaining, with an intuitive and visually appealing interface. \n\nNoteWorks was created for: \n• iPhone, iPod touch and iPad users.\n• Players of all ages. \n• Beginners to advanced music students. \n• Families with multiple players. \n• Music teachers with multiple students. \n\nGame design features include: \n• A funny animated character. \n• User-friendly menus. \n• Superb graphics. \n• Engaging sound effects. \n\nNote reading options: \n• On-screen piano keyboard input.\n• On-screen guitar fretboard input.\n• MIDI keyboard input.  \n• \"A, B, C\" note naming:\n. . . CDEFGAB\n. . . CDEFGAH\n. . . ABCDEFG\n. . . AHCDEFG \n• \"Do, Re, Mi\" (Fixed Do) note naming. \n• Treble clef. \n• Bass clef. \n• Tenor clef. \n• Alto clef. \n• Custom note range in all four clefs.\n\nEducational features: \n• Students learn by playing and having fun. \n• Multiple game settings allow players to stay in control. \n• Students can choose to play with hints. \n• Students play without hints to earn points and stars. \n• Players learn to recognize notes instantly, on sight. \n• For beginners, the game starts by teaching a limited range of notes. \n• Note range can be easily customized as students advance. \n• After mastering accidentals, students learn key signatures. \n• Game speed is controlled to increase or decrease difficulty, or students may choose to play without any time limit.\n• Sharing of game progress: ability to share game results with teachers.\n\nWhile music teachers persistently stress the importance of sight reading, most teachers prefer not to spend valuable lesson time on basic note recognition skills. Thus, NoteWorks helps music teachers concentrate on more interesting aspects of their art, such as technique and musicality. \n\nSerious music students can take advantage of the game to learn clefs outside of their own instruments, as well as prepare for music theory exams. In addition, non-musicians could use NoteWorks as an interesting memory game, to help keep their minds sharp and quick. \n\nNoteWorks was created for people who like to learn by playing and having fun. It was designed with the objective of neither being too easy nor too hard, and never boring. We hope you'll find NoteWorks both useful and entertaining, and we would greatly appreciate it if you could share your thoughts and opinions about the game by rating it."

These questions come from each AP Human Geography unit.  Level 1 has easier questions and level 5 contains the most challenging. As you move through the levels, your learning improves.  \n\nDon’t worry about the quality of these questions!  All of the question writers are experienced expert AP Human Geography Teachers or Geography College Professors.  They know about the class and they know what types of questions to ask to prepare you for the AP exam. \nBut remember, they know you WANT TO HAVE FUN while you learn!  \n\nThink about it. Stop carrying all that review stuff.

Try this app!\n\n1. SOLVE REAL RUBIK'S CUBE\n    Place the Rubik's Cube in front of the camera, follow the prompts to scan the 6 Rubik's facets in turn, and then this app will show you the steps to solve the Rubik's Cube in 3D step by step!\n    Note: Automatic recognition of the Rubik's Cube needs to be done in a well-lit place, dim lighting environment will lead to recognition failure.\n    Tips: If the cube is not recognized when you scan it, you can rotate a random face of the cube and try scanning again.\n\n\n2. PLAY VIRTUAL RUBIK'S CUBE\n    Playing Rubik's Cube on iPhone feels playing a real one!\n    KEY FEATURES:\n    - Realistic 3D graphics makes you feel playing with real Rubik's Cube.\n    - Swipe the cube with your finger to rotate the layer of cube. Swipe through the blank area to rotate the cube.\n    - You can also tap the Undo button to undo the last action.\n    - Double-tap on the face of the cube to mark the face; double-tap again to remove it. After the face marked, subsequent rotations will generate guide lines to show the rotation action.\n    - Tilt the phone horizontally or vertically to change the viewing angle of the Rubik's Cube.\n    - Rubik's Cubes of 2, 3, 4 and 5- order included.\n   \nSuggestions or questions?

This teaches you the more common words fast and easy. The App includes integrated practice for more difficult words. Get new stories and audio for free with updates to this App!\n\nMethod: \n\nOur App is based on three elements to expand your mastery of the language fast and easy. Association by story, immediate availability of meaning and memorizing efficiency. Use the following method to attain new vocabulary fast:\n\n1. Read the stories and re-read them until you know most of the words: \n\nThis is a fast process because there's no lookup time with the unique word-for-word literal plus idiomatic translations, and most words or their root forms occur more than once, so you'll start recognizing them already after the first read.\n\nIf looking at (yes, not up) our word-for-word translation costs one second, and looking up a word in a dictionary costs a minute, it means our method is 60 times faster.\n\n2. Then focus on the remaining words that you still don't know by adding them to your wordlist: \n\nThe spaced repetition practice in the My Words section, and the direct links to the words on the pages support memorization of the more difficult words.\n\nWhere a google or dictionary translation might be 50% off track where it concerns the correct meaning in context and conjugation of low frequency words, the manually added literal word-for-word translation is 100% correct.\n\nThis means that on top of being much faster, you're memorizing two times more efficiently than with any other method.\n\nWho Are We: \n\nA terrific and enthousiastic team, dedicated to bringing you as much word for word literal plus idiomatically translated text, in as many languages as possible, in the coming years. Look out for updates on this piece of software with more functionality and more stories.\n\nTranslating word for word literally, and including idiomatically where necessary, is hard, painstaking work. However, to us, this project and the method we advocate mean that we can turn a language that is opaque to a beginner or even an advanced student into clear and easy learning material.\n\nSupport this project by buying the App, and more material will follow!"

Et seulement celles-ci.\n\nNous avons pensé et conçu cette interface afin de vous aider à préparer au mieux votre examen du permis côtier.\n\nL’École de Navigation Française prépare toute l’année des candidats aux différents permis bateau avec un taux de réussite proche de 100%.\n\nQuoi de plus rassurant que de faire confiance à de véritables professionnels de la formation ?\n\nCette application est entièrement autonome : vous la conservez en mémoire et vous pouvez réviser où bon vous semble.\n\nDes mises à jour régulières sont effectuées pour s'adapter à l'évolution du programme de l'examen du permis côtier. Si une mise à jour intervient, vous en serez averti.\n\nVous trouverez dans cette application trois modes de fonctionnement :\n\nLe mode « apprentissage », où vous pouvez choisir des questionnaires thématiques, et accéder à des explications que nous avons voulues claires.\n\nLe mode « entraînement » vous permettra de vous familiariser avec l’examen comportant 40 questions dont 5 sur la VHF mais sans aucune limite de temps.\n\nLe mode « examen » vous mettra dans les conditions réelles de l'examen avec une limite de temps pour répondre à chaque question.\n\nTrès important :\n\nNous attirons votre attention sur le fait que cette application n’est qu’une aide afin de vous permettre de vous entraîner à l’examen du permis bateau.\n\nEn aucun cas elle ne prétend se substituer à des cours dispensés par de vrais formateurs en bateau école.\n\nLa navigation est une activité très subtile, qui demande une pratique régulière afin d’en saisir la complexité. Ce n’est pas en répondant sans réfléchir à des questions d’examen que vous pourrez vous faire une idée de ce que vous allez trouver en mer !\n\nD’où l’utilité d’une vraie formation… avec de vrais formateurs…\n\nL’équipe de l’École de Navigation Française"

Way to go!\"\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSerpodile offers a new method for learning cursive writing by decomposing the 26 letters of the alphabet in 13 basic shapes (circle, candy cane...) using visual and audio directions.\n\nEach screen includes :\n\n* A colorful frame to help children orient themselves in space (ground, sky, beginning/green, ending/red )\n* A letter or a basic shape\n* Verbal instructions to draw the letter or basic shape\n* A green arrow showing where to start and a red dot showing where to stop\n* A carefully crafted minimalistic interface helps children stay focused. Even the interface hide itself during drawing.\n\nThe drawing direction is checked by the app. While the drawing is not done correctly, the child is corrected until he succeeds.\n\nThis method has been build and tested by occupational therapists (OT). This method is particularly adapted for children having disabilities like dyspraxia and autism, but is of course of great help for children just trying to learn to write cursive letters.\n\nThis application is a digital version of an existing writing method available as erasable workbooks at http://serpodile.com.\n\nIn our opinion, your privacy matters more than some marketing statistics. This app does not contain any sort of tracking code, nor does it collect nor transmit any data on the usage of our app. This app does not contain in-app purchase."

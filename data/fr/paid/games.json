It is also very hard, and I love it for that.” ***\n84/100 – PC Gamer\n \n***”It evokes lot of the more demanding thrills that modern games have left behind, the grit and the hard won satisfaction of overcoming intimidating challenges, or the experimental fun of spending hours tinkering with all the different ways you can play through a big, open-ended level. I had a blast inching my way through pretty much all of the harder stages in this game and I also think you might have a blast with it too.” ***\nSuper Bunnyhop\n \n“It’s a thing of beauty and manages to capture the planning and satisfying execution of more complex strategy games, as well as the gung-ho and the popping-off of growly man in military shooters. (...) It’s probably the best man-shootery game I’ve played in years.”\nIndie Statik\n \nDoor Kickers mixes old school, no-quarter action with modern ergonomic interfaces and puts you in command of a SWAT team during a tactical intervention.\n \nAnalyze the situation, plan team routes, choose equipment and breach points and coordinate multiple troopers to reach the hostage room before the bad guys get to press that trigger.\n \nIt may sound daunting, and like real world CQB combat, it sure is. But most levels can be completed in minutes and on the fly improvisation works. Achieving the perfect planning, getting the mission done with no false steps and losing no people, that’s a skill harder to master.\nQuick Points:\n§ 80 single missions, 6 campaigns and unlimited gameplay via mission generator\n§ Over 65 weapons and gear items to use and overcome the enemy.\n§ Top Down perspective  for optimal tactical analysis\n§ Real Time With Free Pause\n§ No turns, no hexes, no action points or awkward interfaces\n§ Realistic but action packed\n§ Non-linear levels, freeform gameplay\n\nWebsite https://inthekillhouse.com\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/KillHouseGames\nTwitter - @inthekillhouse"

Is there any way to restore it? \nAnswer: When saved games can’t be automatically restored, we’ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter „CatanWarp*“ (* = 1–15) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1–15). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well. \n\nQuestion: Are dice rolls really random? \nAnswer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We’re avid Catan players ourselves. We’ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game! \n\n*****\nQuestions or suggestions for improvements: \nMail to ios@usm.de \nWe are looking forward to your feedback! \n\nFor more information on news and updates: www.usmgames.com \nor visit us on www.facebook.com/UnitedSoftMedia and twitter.com/USM_News \n\n*****"

Digitally remastered in HD for mobile devices and with new, never-before-seen animated cutscenes, it’s time to run the cerebral marathon with Professor Layton and the Curious Village.\n\nThe tale begins as Professor Layton, a true English gentleman and famous archaeologist, drives to the remote settlement of St Mystere with his apprentice, Luke, in response to a request from the widow of a wealthy baron.

The animated cutscenes, remastered in HD, tell key parts of the tale in gorgeous detail.

In addition, rather than just selecting challenges from a list, players uncover puzzles through conversations with the villagers or by investigating their surroundings. \n\nIf you are obsessed with mind-bending puzzles, Professor Layton and the Curious Village is for you!\n\nGame Features: \n• 1st instalment of the Layton Series\n• Over 100 puzzles, designed by Akira Tago, that can be tackled on the way to solving the case\n• New!

Playing as a child whose role is yet unknown, you must safeguard yourself until 6am by watching the doors, as well as warding off unwanted creatures that may venture into your closet or onto the bed behind you.\n\nYou have only a flashlight to protect yourself.

If something has crept too close, then shining lights in its eyes will be your end.\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English.

Head to the Order Station to take orders from your wacky customers in the lobby.  Switch to the Batter Station to prep the pans with liners and add just the right amount of batter.  Move to the Bake Station to put the cupcakes into the oven and wait for them to bake.  Jump to the Build Station to add frosting to the cupcakes, and decorate them with a variety of shakers, drizzles, and festive toppers.  Each station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the cupcake-crafting process.\n\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Cupcakeria!

Your task is not just to pick up the calls, but also to react appropriately to the situation – sometimes giving first aid instructions is enough, at other times a police, fire department or paramedics’ intervention is a necessity. Keep in mind, that the person on the other side of the line might turn out to be a dying daughter’s father, an unpredictable terrorist, or just a prankster. Can you handle all of this?\n\nPLAY ON ANY CITY IN THE WORLD*\n\nCheck out thousands of cities from all around the world. The Free Play mode lets you choose a city to play on - the game will download its map, along with real streets, addresses and the emergency infrastructure. You can also try the Career mode, which contains 6 cities with unique events – survive an earthquake in San Francisco and save Washington, D.C. from bomb attacks.\n\nMANAGE TEAMS\n\nA number of police, fire department and paramedic units are at your disposal. The forces may use a variety of vehicles (from common ambulances to police helicopters), essential equipment (e.g., bulletproof vests, first aid kits and technical tools) and consist of team members with different abilities.\n\nPEOPLE’S LIVES ARE IN YOUR HANDS!\n\nMain features:\n\n- Over 50 recorded dialogues inspired by real calls: serious and dramatic, but sometimes also funny or annoying.\n- Real First Aid instructions.\n- Opportunity to play on any city in the world!\n- 6 selected cities in Career mode, featuring unique calls and events.\n- More than 140 types of reports to encounter.\n- 12 types of emergency vehicles (including helicopters, police cars and motorcycles).\n\n***\n(!) The game requires Internet connection to download free maps. The offline game is available after downloading the maps.\n(!) The game does check the user's location once to propose a city for download. User's location is anonymous and not stored. \n\nAll map data © OpenStreetMap authors\n\n* The term “city” is used within the meaning of OpenStreetMap service and relates to urban areas described as “city” or “town” therein."

However, Leonardo's workshop is full of puzzles, inventions, escape mechanisms and objects hidden in all corners of beautifully decorated rooms. You’ll need to use all of your brain cells to find out what’s really going on!\n\nWe’ve applied our own imagination to the story of the world’s greatest inventor, Leonardo da Vinci, providing players with unique special abilities throughout gameplay. We allow you to warp back into your early days as a young apprentice, exploring the 16th century world around you, peeking into Leonardo’s mechanisms, puzzles and devices, as you eventually become powerful enough to control time itself and learn the secrets hidden in the past.\n\nMany challenging puzzles are inspired by Leonardo Da Vinci's real inventions and ideas. Mysterious locations were created based on original artworks and the wonderful Florence, Italy of 1506.\n\n• LIKE THE HOUSE OF DA VINCI ON FACEBOOK • \nhttps://www.facebook.com/thehouseofdavinci\n\n• FEEDBACK AND SUPPORT • \nFor any feedback or support questions please do not hesitate to contact us at davinci@bluebraingames.com\n\n• MORE INFORMATION • \nFind out more about the game on http://www.thehouseofdavinci.com/.\n\n• LANGUAGES• \nThe House of Da Vinci is now available in English, French, German, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Slovak, Russian, Turkish, Italian, Polish, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, Hindi and Malay.\n\n• WHO ARE WE? • \nBlue Brain Games is an enthusiastic indie team of graphic artists and developers, all of whom are fans of both 3D puzzle games and the renaissance genius Leonardo Da Vinci.

Play the role of a monarch atop their steed and recruit loyal subjects, build your kingdom and protect it from the greedy creatures looking to steal your coins and crown. \r\n\r\nIn the brand-new campaign mode, monarchs must now work to build a kingdom that stands over time until finding a way to defeat the Greed for good. Explore the environments to discover new mounts and secrets hidden in the deep. \r\n\r\nBut you don’t have to rule alone! Introducing cooperative play to Kingdom Two Crowns, monarchs can now choose between a solo experience or seek the assistance of a friend, working together locally in classic split screen while sitting next to your fellow monarch, or even across from them on opposite sides of the device in the custom mobile feature of tabletop coop.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the traditional medieval setting, Kingdom Two Crowns also includes: \r\n\r\n• Dead Lands: Enter the dark lands of Kingdom. Play as unique monarchs, including the Shardbinder Miriam, with powerful traits from the gothic horror action-RPG Bloodstained. Ride the gigantic beetle steed to lay out traps, the eerie undead mount that summons barriers impeding the progress of the Greed, and from Bloodstained the mythic demon horse “Gamigin” with its powerful charge attack. Building your Kingdom has never been spookier!\r\n\r\n• Shogun: Journey to lands inspired by the architecture and culture of feudal Japan. Play as the mighty Shogun or Onna-bugeisha, enlist the support of the ninja, lead your soldiers to battle atop the mythological Kirin, and form new strategies as you brave the Greed hiding in the thick bamboo forests.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to keep the feeling of exploration, discovery, and strategy alive in Kingdom Two Crowns in post-release updates with more themed settings, each with unique styles that marvel the eye while changing how you rule the lands.\r\n\r\nA challenge awaits all who seek it here, whether you are a first-time ruler or a long-time fan. So be brave, great monarchs, for in the end Two Crowns shall reign stronger than one!"

These cards represent a building that the player uses in his city to develop it. There are different types of buildings: resource producers, commercials, military, scientists and civilian buildings.\n\nThe game is played in 3 ages, symbolizing the players' progress over time. When the last card of the last age is played, the player with the most victory points wins the game, unless a player achieves scientific or military supremacy during the game. In this case, the player wins immediately. \n\nAvailable in : FR, EN, DE, SP, IT, NL, PL"

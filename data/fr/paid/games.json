Her destiny is mysteriously linked to that of Peter, a young filmmaker covering a military expedition in the 1950s and Simon, a sailor of the Franklin expedition struggling to keep his crew alive.\n\nNavigate through time to discover what links them together.

In Inua, you’ll need to unravel space-time to solve mysteries and guide the characters on their journey.

The fate of this expedition is still largely unknown. Gather clues and discover its history!\n\nInua - A Story in Ice and Time:\n- A fantasy tale based on incredible historical facts..\n- An extraordinary story inspired by Inuit tales and legends, with support from Inuit writer Thomassie Mangiok and advisors Billy Gauthier and Monica Ittusardjuat.\n- A game designed by the creators of Bury Me, My Love, and Vignettes, adapted from the original story by Nathalie Frassoni and Frédéric Bouvier, with the breathtaking artistic direction of Delphine Fourneau from the Klondike collective."

Sven, as we like to call him, can use animals to aid his escape from an icey end. Each of the hillside animals have different attributes to make a speedier escape. Penguins glide further, Yetis are tougher, Eagles soar to great heights, each of these can provide useful advantage for Sven. Sometimes on the slopes Sven can find fast Snowmobiles which can ferry multiple animals a maintain a very high top speed.\n\nStaying ahead of the avalanche has its advantages and perks. Completing objectives can 'level up' Sven  and increase his score multiplier. Riding animals, performing backflips add to the score and with an increased score multiplier Sven will rocketing up the highscore table with ease."

Get your hands on all the management tools provided by International Basketball Manager 23 to take your team to the top. Managers! This is your moment!\n\n\r\n\r\nYou can take over world basketball with International Basketball Manager 23. Suit up and learn to deal with all the pressure from management, fans and the press. Are you up to the task?\n\n\r\n\r\nInternational Basketball Manager 23 provides a full range of management tools so you can manage your team your way.\r You’ll have over 20 leagues from different countries and continents at your fingertips, a total of 700 clubs and almost 10,000 players. You might want to think about taking on a scout.\n\n\n\r\nInternational Basketball Manager 23 is the only video game that simulates the market with official licenses known all over the world such as Euroleague Basketball -including Turkish Airlines Euroleague and the 7DAYS EuroCup- and other important licenses such as the Spanish acb, the French, Greek, Lithuanian and Turkish leagues, the Spanish FEB (LEB Oro), the BNXT League (Belgium and the Netherlands), the Argentine and Chilean leagues.\n\n\r\n\r\nWHAT’S NEW IN IBM 23\r\nEditor: This new version integrates a powerful editor for managers within the game. You can use this tool to customize competitions, teams and unlicensed players or even modify the attributes of licensed players in the game.\n\n\r\n\r\nThese changes are also easy to export and import using a file generated by the game. Share your “mods” with the community in the Steam “Workshop” or on the Discord channel or download the “mods” that most interest you. Our community is more important than ever! \n\n\r\n\r\nPlaybook: Select your plays and stamp your authority on game preparation and tactics. Bring in some of these actions for your players at crucial moments of the game. Will you steal a victory on the buzzer using your signature play?\n\n\r\n\r\nSigning players in contract year: Players in contract year can now be signed for the following season without a transfer fee. However, this option is not as simple as it sounds because some players have a Right of First Refusal clause and their respective teams can activate it to keep them on board.\n\n\r\n\r\nSigning U18 players: U18 players no longer have a contract with a salary and clauses and they will stay in their team until reaching senior age. To sign them, you should find out about their averages, progression and interest in signing for your team and persuade them to join you eventually. \n\n\r\n\r\nUnited States College League: Compete against some of the +350 Colleges in one of the 32 conferences, improve your reputation by recruiting the best young players and fight for the title during the final phase of the Championship."

Survive the seemingly never-ending gauntlet of requests from your advisors, peasants, allies, and enemies while maintaining balance between the influential factions of your kingdom. But beware; each decision you make might have implications and unfortunate consequences down the road that could put your reign and family’s dynasty at risk!\n\nEach year of your reign brings another important – seemingly random – request from your unpredictable kingdom as you strive for balance between the church, the people, the army, and the treasury. Prudent decisions and careful planning make for a long reign but unforeseen motivations, surprise events, and poor luck can take down even the most entrenched monarch. Extend your reign as long as possible, forge alliances, make enemies, and find new ways to die as your dynasty marches along through the ages. Some events will span on centuries, with an intrigue involving burning witches, scientific enlightenment, wicked politics and, maybe, the Devil himself.\n\n*iPhone 5 / iPod Touch 6 / iPad Mini / iPad Air or later recommended."

Thankfully Papa Louie has the perfect solution for you:  He's putting you in charge of making grilled cheese sandwiches in his newest restaurant!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to prepare sandwiches with delicious breads, melty cheeses, and a wide array of toppings and sauces for a gourmet grilled cheese.

      "label": "“[A] surprising iPhone and Apple Watch bestseller is pushing the boundaries of fiction” - boingboing.net\n“This is the best game on the Apple Watch” - Time.com\n\nLifeline is a playable, branching story of survival against all odds. Using your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch, you will help Taylor make life or death decisions, and face the consequences together.\n\nAcclaimed writer Dave Justus (Fables: The Wolf Among Us) weaves a gripping interactive story through the aftermath of a crash landing on an alien moon. Taylor is stranded, the rest of the crew are dead or missing, and Taylor’s communicator can only reach you.\n\nLifeline pioneered a new narrative experience enabled by modern devices. This story plays out in real time as Taylor works to stay alive, notifications deliver new messages throughout your day. Keep up as they come in, or catch up later when you’re free. You can even respond to Taylor directly from your Apple Watch or your iPhone lock screen, without launching into the app.\n\nOr, dive in and jump back to earlier points in the story, and see what happens when you make a different choice. Simple actions can have a profound effect. Complete any single path to restart the story and unlock this mode.\n\nLifeline is a deep, immersive story of survival and perseverance, with many possible outcomes. Taylor is relying on YOU.\n\nYou can play Lifeline in any of these languages:\n- English\n- French\n- German\n- Russian\n- Simplified Chinese\n- Japanese\n- Spanish\n- Korean\n\nNEW in version 1.8: Stick around after the game for a special story epilogue from Dave Justus. For players who have already finished the game, the Bonus Story becomes available under the game options. Witness the events leading up to Lifeline: Silent Night.\n\nInternet connection not required. No in-app purchases and no ads.\n\n\nPraise for Lifeline:\n\n“I’ve played many games that I find engrossing, but Lifeline may be one of the first that changed the way I thought about my daily routine, which leapt off the screen and became a part of my lived experience.” - Eli Cymet, Gamezebo\n\n“I felt an immediate attachment to a fictional character pinging me from a strange galaxy to my wearable.” - Luke Hopewell, Gizmodo Australia\n\n“[P]laying it on the Apple Watch makes you truly feel like you’re exchanging messages with an astronaut via a futuristic transmitter.” - Michael Andronico, Tom’s Guide\n\n“For a few brief hours I cared – really cared – about the fate of a completely fictional character. I don’t think any other game I’ve played has made me feel that way before.” - Matt Thrower, PocketGamer\n\n\nLifeline was created by:\nDave Justus\nMars Jokela\nDan Selleck\nColin Liotta\nJason Nowak\nBen “Books” Schwartz"

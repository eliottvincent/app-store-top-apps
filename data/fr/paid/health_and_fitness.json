      "label": "If you love working out with Apple Watch, but you need more advanced fitness stats, HealthFit is for you.\n\nBy analyzing the workout data stored in Apple Health, HealthFit provides the kind of indispensable tracking and insights you normally only get from premium subscription services. But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times. You can even log which bike or shoes you use, to monitor usage and flag when it’s time to replace them.\n\nHealthFit finds photos you take during your workouts automatically, bringing your activity feed to life with stunning images you can share on social media.\n\nRUNNING POWER ANALYSIS\n\nHealthFit provides advanced running power analysis with the automatically estimated critical power, the weighted average power, the power distribution chart by 25W Increments and the mean maximal power chart which shows your best average power for time periods of one second up to the length of your run.\n\nMULTISPORT AND INTERVAL WORKOUTS\n\nHealthFit is the only app to export multisport workouts as multisession activities\n\nSTATISTICS: UNCOVER HIDDEN FITNESS INSIGHTS\n\nApple Watch gathers so much fitness data, it can sometimes seem overwhelming. HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio.

It is important to break the habit of dropping into defeatist thoughts and attitudes and learn how to stop yourself from entering into a negative loop that blocks you from achieving your desired outcomes.\n\nThe Healing Your Thoughts App helps to shift the way you think throughout the day and will help to uplift you during challenging times. You are not denying any feelings you are experiencing. Rather it is a process of rephrasing your thoughts to change your train of thought which will lead you to a positive outcome.\n\nYou can program the app for the interval of when you would like to receive an alert of bells, a Tibetan bowl, or chimes being played. When you hear the alert you will read the message that asks you to reflect on: “What are you thinking about right now?” Your thoughts and words are seeds that when planted into your inner garden will grow into plants that do impact your life. It is important to cultivate a deep and rich inner garden to create true joy and health in your life.\n\nOnce you receive the alert go into the Library and tap on the category “word”, “phrase”, “blessing”, or “photo”. A word, phrase, blessing, or photo will appear that will inspire you to stop your current thinking and transmute/transform any negative thinking into positive thoughts. This will also help to shift your attitude and even create an inner smile.\n\nYou can use the words, phrases, blessings, or photos provided. Or you can upload your own.\n\nThe result will be that you will experience feeling more uplifted. In this way you feed yourself with love and light. This will improve your life, giving you more energy, and help you to be more creative in your life and in your work. You will be able to radiate love and light towards yourself, your loved ones, friends, co-workers, and into the world."

      "label": "This application is a sidekick to the beastmaker 1000 and 2000. It has been designed to assist the user into gradually getting stronger on a fingerboard. The app does this by way of prewritten workouts which are often general and aim to improve all trainable grips on the board. Some are specific (2000 series only at the moment) which aim to improve, sloper strength, pocket strength and crimp strength. \n\nThere is also a new custom workout program fully adjustable and includes the 1000,2000 and micros, so if you have your own hang regime and different timings then that is all programmable and can be saved.\n\nBoth the workouts and custom timer now record hang contraction time (time spent actually hanging off the board) We recommend most users get up to around 20:00 minutes on this clock whilst doing their workouts.\n\nOn the Workout screen after you've selected your work out it is now possible to adjust set and hang times. Users who are only finger boarding and are having a rest day prior to and after training may wish to do up to 3 sets and 7 hangs. Other users may prefer to go for 2 sets and 6 hangs, this is what we'd consider an average and more suited to people doing additional types of training.\n\nPlease note the grades for the workouts aren't actually meant to relate to anything other than themselves. E.G. 5c is easier than 6a but harder than 5b. If you find 5a hard on the 1000, use a weight removal technique such as putting one foot on a chair in front of the board or using a pulley with weights on. More advice on this and other things are available in the general advice section on the Workout Ratings page.\n\nTo record your hangs press the record button (red circle icon) whilst resting. The Workout Ratings function is much improved and should now be a really useful training aid which records gradual progress and improvement.\n\nFingerboard gains take time, remember to warm up thoroughly and move on to more difficult hangs at a slightly slower pace than you think you should to give pulleys time to catch up with muscles. For example 10% strength gains over a year is brilliant improvement. 5% is still effective training.\n\nBest of luck with the training, happy hanging and we hope this helps with the motivation."

It encompasses motor activities of the jaw muscles, such as jaw or teeth clenching, and teeth grinding, some of which may be associated with clinical signs and symptoms, like tooth wear, failed dental restorations, complications with implant-supported prosthesis, muscle fatigue and temporomandibular joint pain. A correct diagnosis is therefore fundamental to establishing early prevention and management regimens.\n\nSCIENTIFIC RESEARCH\nStudies with BruxApp have been supervised by experts, as part of an ongoing multicenter research project on bruxism epidemiology and management coordinated by Prof. Daniele Manfredini, University of Siena, Italy.\n\nDEVELOPMENT\nThe app was developed by Goran Djukic, program analyst at the Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Council of Research, University of Pisa, Italy.\nBruxApp is currently available in the following languages: English, Italian, , French, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish, Brazilian, Japanese, Hebrew, Chinese, Arabic, Greek, Polish, Lithuanian, Bosnian, Romanian, Turkish, Norwegian, and Croatian, with another 4 language versions soon to be released. \n\nIMPORTANT STATEMENT\nBruxApp is not a game or gadget.  In order for BruxApp to work correctly and be effective, please dedicate 5 minutes of your time to READING the simple instructions CAREFULLY. \n\nThe full compatibility is guaranteed by iPhone 6 and higher ones and iOS 9.3 and higher ones."

      "label": "\"Es gibt für den Menschen keine geräuschlosere und ungestörtere Zufluchtsstätte als seine eigene Seele. Halte recht oft solche stille Einkehr und erneuere so dich selbst.\" (Marc Aurel)\n\nDas Autogene Training (AT) wurde von J.H. Schultz in den 20er Jahren des letzten Jahrhunderts entwickelt und zählt zu den etablierten und wissenschaftlich fundierten Entspannungsmethoden. Das AT basiert auf dem Prinzip der Autosuggestion (Selbsthypnose).\n\nWirkungen und Anwendungsbereiche: Die positiven Wirkungen des Autogenen Trainings wurden in zahlreichen wissenschaftlichen Studien belegt. Anwendungsbereiche für das AT sind unter vielen anderen: Ängste, Schlafstörungen, Schmerzen, Stress, Burn-out, Versagensängste, Prüfungsangst, Süchte, Durchblutungsstörungen, Herzrhythmusstörungen, Bluthochdruck, Wechseljahrsbeschwerden, Rheuma, Hormonelle Störungen, ... Gegenanzeigen: keine. Denjenigen, die unter ausgeprägten Psychosen leiden, ist jedoch vorab eine ärztliche Rücksprache anzuraten.\n\nAufbau und Phasen des  Autogenen Trainings:\nIn dieser App werden alle Phasen (Übungen) des AT sowie das Komplett-Programm angeleitet und geübt. Die Herz-Übung wurde bewusst ausgelassen. Dies wird auch zunehmend von Therapeuten und Wissenschaftlern empfohlen, da viele Übende hiermit Schwierigkeiten bei der Entspannung haben. Das AT besteht aus 5 Phasen:\n\nPhase 1: Die Schwere-Übung\nPhase 2: Die Wärme-Übung\nPhase 3: Die Atem-Übung\nPhase 4: Die Bauch-Übung (Sonnengeflecht)\nPhase 5: Die Stirn-Übung\n\nZum Einschlafen oder mit Rücknahme:\nAlle Phasen sowie das Komplett-Programm können zum Einschlafen verwendet werden oder auch mit Rücknahme geübt werden. Bei der Phase 5 (Stirn-Übung) ist \"mit Rücknahme\" voreingestellt, da die Stirn-Übung eine belebende Wirkung haben kann daher beim Einschlafen hinderlich sein könnte.\n\nAnfänger und Fortgeschrittene:\nWenn du Anfänger bist, nimm dir für die ersten Tage nur die 1. Phase (Schwere-Übung) vor. Die Schwere-Übung ist die zentrale Übung beim AT, da sie Grundvoraussetzung für die Entspannung und damit auch für alle folgenden Phasen des AT ist; daher wird diese Phase am Anfang auch länger und intensiver angeleitet und geübt. Sobald du die Schwere fühlst, gehst du zur 2. Phase über und so weiter. Jede Phase beinhaltet auch die vorangegangenen Phasen – jedoch jetzt in kürzerer Form. Das bedeutet, dass z.B. die Phase 3 (Atem-Übung) auch die Schwere-Übung und die Wärme-Übung jeweils in Kurzform einschließt (Grundaufbau des AT).\n\nTimer-Funktion\nAuf alle Phasen zum Einschlafen kann eine beliebig lange Zeit (Voreinstellung: 60 min) für die Hintergrundmusik (Musik 1-5) mit/ohne Natur-Sounds eingestellt werden, so dass Musik & Natur-Sounds deine Entspannung noch weiter vertieft oder in den Schlaf begleitet.\n\nAudio-Qualität und App-Größe:\nUm die bestmögliche Audio-/Sound-Qualität anbieten zu können und alle Inhalte offline – also ohne Internet-Verbindung – auf mobilen Geräten verfügbar zu machen, ist die Größe der App unvermeidlich.\n\nHinweis\nDie App kann und sollte im Flugzeug-Modus (offline) genutzt werden."

      "label": "Heart Rate Variability measurements recorded by your Apple Watch can give you insight on the stress level your body is under. By using HRV Tracker to track short-term measurements and long-term trends, you can see how your workload during the day, workout sessions or sleeping etc affect your body's readiness, recovery and stress level. Simply put, the higher your HRV is, the better.\n\n***Requires an HRV capable Apple Watch with watchOS 6 or later***\nHRV Tracker for Watch integrates with the Health app and uses data stored in the Health app. To make sure your Apple Watch is capable of recording HRV measurements, please open the Health app on your iPhone to see if any HRV measurements exists. Go to > Health app > Browse > Heart > Hear Rate Variability.\n\n***Get Notified***\nHRV Tracker makes spotting changes in your HRV easy by monitoring your HRV measurements in the background and showing notifications after your HRV drops under or rises above your desired levels. HRV Tracker will monitor changes in individual measurements and also your 24 hour HRV average. You can change the default notification levels directly in your Apple Watch app. Please note that notifications can get postponed for example because of a low battery level.\n\n***Apple Watch for daily tracking***\nBrowse through last seven days of HRV measurements by using the digital crown. See how measurements compare to your seven day period and individual days. By tapping the graph you can toggle through the first values of each day. Use complications on your Apple Watch to stay informed on changes in your HRV. \n\nBesides the automatically recorded HRV measurements you can use the Breathe app on your Apple Watch to record new HRV measurements. Start a Breathe session in the Breathe app and after the session ends a new HRV measurement will be available in HRV Tracker.\n\n***Compare HRV to other key metrics***\nFind possible causes for changes in HRV by using the comparison graphs available on your Apple Watch:\n-Sleep hours: By default HRV Tracker will use sleep data provided by sleep apps that add sleep data to HealthKit. If no sleep data is available HRV Tracker will calculate estimated sleep hours per night (estimated sleep time will only be available in the Apple Watch app)\n-Activity: By default HRV Tracker will use your Active Energy (calories) as the activity metric. In the HRV Tracker Apple Watch app you can choose to use a custom activity score that emphasizes the intensity of daily activity.\n-Daily resting heart rate (RHR).\nToggle between comparison graphs by tapping the upper part of the screen.\n\n***Follow Long-term HRV trend***\nFollow your long-term HRV trend on your iPhone and compare your short term measurements to all-time data.\n-Select week from weekly graph to see daily HRV values of the selected week.\n-Browse through all daily HRV values of the selected day\n-Compare daily HRV averages to other relevant daily metrics: Activity, Sleep (if available in the Health app) and Resting Heart Rate\n\n***Widgets on iPhone***\n-Medium sized widget with chart showing all daily hrv values\n-Multiple small widgets to choose from\n\n***Privacy***\nData read from the Apple HealthKit database is only used to show information related to your Heart Rate Variability. Information read by HRV Tracker is only stored and used locally on your iPhone and Apple Watch. \n\n***How is it measured***\nHeart rate variability measurements used by HRV Tracker are calculated by measuring the variation between individual heartbeats. Your Apple Watch automatically measures your HRV in the background and stores the outcome into HealthKit. HealthKit uses SDNN heart rate variability, which is calculated using the standard deviation of the inter-beat (RR) intervals between normal heartbeats (measured in milliseconds). Besides background measurements generated automatically by your Apple Watch you can use the Breathe app on your Apple Watch to generate new measurements."

      "label": "RESPIROGUIDE PRO: THE NEWEST VERSION, MORE PERSONAL \n\n“Simple and amazingly effective for better concentration, stress anxiety, ADHD and trauma healing” –  Kees L. Blase, medical physicist,  National Centre for Stress Management,The Netherlands.\n\nRespiroguide PRO is brought to you by Vital-EQ the International Institute for Stress Management.\n**********\nTHE ABC of STRESSMANAGEMENT\nRespiroguide uses the most recent research in neurosciences and stress management, research that has been condensed into the most convenient one-touch tool. The knowledge is based on the heart's resonant frequency  which induces heart and breath coherence.\nRespiroguide Pro will train the reflexes and so the elasticity of your vascular system. This will help in lowering blood pressure, is effective in coping with stress and anxiety, and enhances better concentration at school and work. \nHeart rate is a dynamic body function that varies in each moment. \nIn an Active state (sympathic activity) heart rate increases, \nin a Calm and relaxed state heart rate decreases. \nCardiac Coherence is the Balanced  state of the autonomic nervous system in which you feel safe and happy, free from fear and anxiety and overstressed reactions.\nThe body can be brought into the state of Cardiac Coherence through guided breathing. Guiding the resonance frequency (Respiroguide Pro) can be compared with guiding someone on a swing by pushing at just the right moment to optimise their swing.   \nEach individual has his or her own personal respiratory frequency (resonance frequency) in which cardiac coherence is optimal. This ideal respiratory frequency is between 0,06 Hz and 0,12 Hz. The Respiroguide Pro will help you to find your personal resonance frequency, which depends on the length and width of your blood vessels. \nYou can set the guide in four different frequencies:\n1. Average: F6: 6 breaths a minute = 0,1 Hz\n2. Average: F5: 5 breaths a minute = 0,083 Hz\n3. Slow: F4: 4 breaths a minute = 0,066 Hz\n4. Quick: F7: 7 breaths a minute = 0,118 Hz\nTo find your resonance frequency it’s important to experience all four breathing frequencies and notice:\n-which one provides the most balanced feeling\n-which one can be comfortably sustained for a period of at least 5 minutes\n-which one gives a maximum amplitude in Heart Rate Variability. This last function requires  access to a HRV-biofeedback instrument with a Cardiac Coherence Coach.\nCardiac Coherence Coaches can be found at  www.hartfocus.nl (Netherlands) and www.heartintelligence.com/VitalEQ  (Europe, Asea). \nThe Respiroguide Pro is a medical tested safe device. More than 20 years of research showed positive effects:lowering bloodpressure, less anxiety, enhancing performance, coping with stress, effective treatment of trauma.Take care: do not  inhale too deeply, this occasionally make you dizzy. Focusing on the exhale is the most effective way. \n\nQUICK START: press the play button and just breathe in and out with the yellow dot. Breathe in as the dot goes up, breathe out as it goes down.\n\nThe default setting is a 3 minute long exercise. This is what it takes to lower your level of stress. \nYou can gradually increase the exercise lengths, but remember to exercise three times every day. Over one week of exercising you will notice the effects in your body.\n\nProbably the best investment you will ever make. If you use it!\n\nOther options:\n1. Turn the sea wave sounds on and off (the waves are synchronized to the specific 0,1Hz frequency)\n2. Choose the duration of the exercise; remember that the secret to stress   relief is practicing several times every day, so make it simple, use the Respiroguide!\n\nFor details access the following websites:\n- www.heartintelligence.com in English\n- www.nuvitaal.nu and www.hartfocus.nl in Dutch\n- www.emnergie.com in French\n************\nWe do appreciate your feedback!\n\nVital-EQ, the International Institute for Stress Management."

      "label": "This is the second app, in a series designed to assist you in harnessing the magnetic energies of the sacred geometries within the Octuple Dorje. Grandma Chandra’s 33rd Dimensional Masterhood will boost your ascension interconnections with these magnetic energies to accelerate your reach and interaction with the multiple dimensions within the Quantum Light Field. \nIn this app you will experience four different videos of the Octuple Dorje flashing, spinning, or multiple Dorjes merging in kaleidoscopic rotations. Meditating on these movements and listening to the audios facilitate Grandma Chandra’s delivering to you, layer-by-layer, these specialized codes and frequencies into your physical and etheric bodies so that you can progress into higher energetic frequencies much faster.\nThe term Dorje derives from the Sanskrit meaning both thunderbolt and diamond.  Using the Dorje, your light is further concentrated into lightening with greater intensities (thunderbolt) and the quality of your light becomes clearer, focused and strengthened into a diamond-like focus when directed by your aligned intent.\nBenefits of the Ascension Rising App:\n\t* Your expanding light holding can be bridged into ever greater flows of light.\n\t* Expands your energetic bodies, within the intuitive realms.\n\t* Boosts brain capacity by extending access to more of your neural networks.\n\t* Enriches your telepathic capabilities by facilitating greater details within wisdom & knowing.\n\t* The Octuple Dorje aligns with your energetic structure called the Merkaba, accelerating its spin, which, e.g., strengthens your connection with your Masters, Teachers and Guides.\n\t* Light energy flow expands into rising spirals that reach into higher dimensional levels.\n\t* This same light energy flow also expands out laterally through a dimension allowing wider usage of the energetic knowledge within that dimension.\n\t* Where the flowing light intersects with nodes (junction points), this opens instantaneous bridging between any combination of other dimensions. \n\t* As we expand our ability to navigate and direct our explorations within the multidimensional layers, we extend our consciousness, elevating our understanding and ability to create more consciously and robustly.\n\t* Use of this app brings in more joy and playfulness into our work and lives as we become more sensitive to the energetic value of these higher energetic frequencies in the flow of creation.  We can now know that our original birthright creative capabilities are being restored as we birth ourselves into this new energy.\n\nJust as dolphins, playfully and joyfully navigate different water layers with their sonar as they are swimming, they also access finely nuanced sublayers in their co-creative play.   The Octuple Dorje and the layering of frequencies and codes to us by Grandma Chandra, also invite us to likewise be more powerfully in joy and play, so that we too can take advantage of the energetic frequencies and properties within each dimensional layer, to more masterfully and consciously draw from the various  energetic properties of the different layers.  With our re-emerging awareness of our human sonar, we can now detect consciously, different frequencies and know telepathically, intuitively, their relative properties and value.  We can then create with this new spectrum of energetics, individually and in groups as we play and create our new human culture on and in the New Earth."

It has to be a walk or a run to provide enough heart rate data for the prediction algorithm to work.\n2. The workout app must be used with GPS enabled.\n3. This app must be connected to the Apple Health app so that the recorded data can be displayed in the watch app, the complication or on the iPhone.\n\nWith iOS 14, you can display the widget on the home screen of your iPhone to see the latest measurement directly.\nThis app only works with an Apple Watch Series 3 or later!"

      "label": "AutoWake is the first haptic smart alarm for your Watch. \n\nIt can wake you up by tapping you on your wrist using your Watch's haptic engine. You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

      "label": "Cardiograph is an application which measures your heart rate. You can save your results for future reference, keep track of multiple people with individual profiles, add notes and locations, and even print out your measurements for sharing or safe keeping.\n\nCardiograph uses your device's built-in camera to take pictures of your fingertip and calculate your heart's rhythm - the same approach used by professional medical equipment!\n\n\"I know you have the disclaimer on the screen but I don't care, Cardiograph saved my life. Your app was key to understanding what was going on and help the doctors understand too.\"\nBob Spadafora - *****\n\n\"Comparing heart rates with family over the holidays is fun.\"\nTxyak – ****\n\n\"Wanna impress a friend with a cool app. This is the one to get.\"\nMattyray – *****\n\n\"After having two heart valve replacements and a by-pass, I feel it is not only smart - but also necessary - to have such a reliable heart rate monitor with me everywhere I go.\"\nDantv – *****\n\n\"I am an EMT and it helps me actually see what is going on. It is by no means definitive like a monitor but it is a great indicator of problems I would not see otherwise.\"\nGranniem – ****\n\n\"I had a pulse oximeter on one hand, medical quality, and my iPhone app in the other and the app was dead-on accurate.\"\nLike it but hate it – *****\n\n\n=== See Cardiograph in action ===\nhttp://macropinch.com/cardiograph \nhttp://youtu.be/isIjcCFYEho\n\n\n• Measure your heart rate\n\nIt's never been easier to know what your heart rate is! Without any external hardware, just using the built-in camera of your smartphone or tablet, you can get accurate readings almost instantly.\n\nKnowing how fast your heart is beating can be very useful when exercising, if you're under stress, if you have a heart-related medical condition, or even just out of curiosity.\n\n\n• Track your results\n\nEvery measurement you take is saved to your personal history, so you can keep track over time. In addition to the date and time of the measurement, you can also save the location at which it was taken (and see them on a map), and even add a quick note to effortlessly organize your history.\n\n\n• Multiple profiles\n\nCardiograph is perfectly tailored to allow multiple people to use the app on a shared device. You can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them has their own individual measurement history.\n\n\n• Export & Print\n\nEach measurement can be exported in full detail to a portable format that you can later send via e-mail, upload on the web or even print right from the app itself (with an AirPrint™ compatible printer).\n\n\n• Clean and intuitive design\n \nInspired by real-life medical equipment, Cardiograph is a pleasure to use. The streamlined and clutter-free design makes it seem instantly familiar, so you can focus on using the app instead of navigating through series of confusing screens.\n\n\n• Built-in user guide\n\nIf you're having trouble with the app, or you want to make the most out of it, you can access the comprehensive help manual right from within the app itself.\n\n\n• Universal application with iCloud® sync\n\nCardiograph is an universal application - it runs on the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod touch.\nInstall Cardiograph on multiple devices with iOS 5.0+, and all your profiles and measurements will be in sync! Manage your profiles and measurements on one device, and the changes are instantly reflected on all the others.\n\n\nPlease note: If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\n\n\nFollow the latest news:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch \nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

      "label": "How can fruit and vegetable juices improve our physical condition, our health and our productivity?\n\nTo answer this question, we need to widen our views a bit and consider nutrition from a broader perspective.\n\n- The three times of food\nThis concept, proposed by Eben Pagan, suggests to consider the meals we eat in 3 different times:\n\n- 1. Immediately\nThe real-time experience of food: is good or bad?\n- 2. In the short term\nThe 2-3 hours that follow: if we feel energetic and effective, or heavy and listless\n- 3. Long-term\nWhat we eat affects our health for the rest of our lives, for example, it can add or remove fat from our body, promote or weaken our immune system, encourage or discourage the occurrence of degenerative diseases etc.\n\nIn this regard, we have to evaluate each meal in these three time periods, on a scale from 1 to 10.\n\nWhen you decide what to eat, ask yourself how much its value is from 1 to 10 in terms of:\n- Taste: do I like to eat it?\n- Energy: in the next 2-3 hours, how effectively will it give me energy?\n- Health in the long term: how does it affect my immune system, how does it affect the occurrence of diseases, how does it affect the rest of my life.\nIn 10 years, will I be proud to have eaten this meal?\n\nAlmost all of us are in the constant search for a 9 or 10 in the immediate. And in order to get it we are often willing to accept a 2, 3 or 4 in the short term. If it is not too heavy on the stomach or if we do not feel too much strain in digestion, that's fine... it's enough it has a good flavor.\n\nFor the long term, we have no idea how this food is going to affect our body and our immune system. So for example when we get sick, we feel depressed, when we have little desire to do anything, when we have problems in our relationships or go through periods where we feel apathetic and listless, we never put that in relationship with what we regularly eat and with the fact that food can have an effect on our health, our emotional state and our lives in general.\n\nMost of us eat almost exclusively for pleasure, for entertainment.\n\nWhat we should want for ourselves, is a 10 for the next 2 or 3 hours in terms of energy and mental clarity, and a 10 for our health, to limit the possibility of getting sick and to have a strong and responsive immune system throughout the course of our lives. And for this, we can also be prepared to accept a 5 or 6 (or maybe a 7) in the instant gratification that food can give us. In the immediate maybe we will not have the maximum enjoyment, but within 3 hours we will have energy and lucidity to the highest levels, and we will know that this meal will help to influence our health in a positive way in the long term, and we will be proud of this decision.\n\nFruits and vegetables juices are the best you can give yourself for the short and the long term!\n\nFeatures of the current version:\n- 52 Selected recipes\n- 40 Fact sheets of food with nutritional properties\n- High Quality photos\n- Therapeutic features food\n- Recommended seasons\n- Ability to filter according to the season, food and benefits\n- Select the ingredients you have at home to find which recipes you can achieve.\n- Ability to save favorite recipes\n- Practical tips for getting the most from one's eating habits\n- \"Pantry\" mode: select the ingredients you have at home to find which recipes you can achieve!\n- Ability to share recipes with friends or on major Social Networks\n\nFor suggestions and information:\ncanali.nicola@gmail.com\n\nFacebook page:\nwww.facebook.com/centrifugoapp\n\nNote:\nAn internet connection is required to update the database of the recipes.\n\nDislcaimer:\nThis information is the result of personal research on books and websites. It has the sole purpose of entertainment and should not be considered a remedy or cure for serious illnesses. For advice on your diet always consult a medical specialist.\n\nCentrifugo is only available on iOS."

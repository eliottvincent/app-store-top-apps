Get your ideas out or play until inspiration hits using a selection of Ableton Live’s drum kits, synths and melodic instruments. Or create your own sound palette by recording the sounds around you into Note’s sampler instruments using your phone’s microphone. \n\nIf you want to take your ideas further, use Ableton Cloud to send your projects to Live (version 11.2.5 or later) without leaving the app. Open your project from Live’s browser, then keep working – you can edit all your MIDI notes, and all your samples and sounds from Note are exactly the same.\n\n\nBegin with a beat: \n• Choose from 56 Drum Sampler kits\n• Tap out a beat using the 16-pad grid\n• Quantize your beat to fix any loose timing\n• Nudge notes to correct mistakes\n• Add more layers of rhythm\n• Create beat repetitions with Note Repeat\n• Change parameters to shape your sound\n• Experiment with effects \n\nStart with a melody:\n• Choose from 261 synth sounds and 36 Melodic Sampler instruments\n• Play your melody or chord progression with either the 25-pad grid or the piano roll\n• Set a key and scale to get instantly harmonic results, or leave your options open\n• Overdub more layers of harmony\n• Change parameters to shape your sound\n• Add effects to experiment with sound design\n\nSample your environment:\n• Create your own kits by recording percussive sounds into Note’s Drum Sampler \n• Record tonal sounds to create your own Melodic Sampler instruments\n• Manipulate your samples by cutting, filtering or repitching them\n• Shape or transform your sounds with effects\n\nCapture improvisations:\n• Play something, then tap the Capture button to keep it\n• Play at the tempo that feels comfortable and Note will detect it\n• Note will recognize the length of the phrase\n• A loop is created automatically\n• Quantize it, add to it, or change the sound\n\nCreate variations:\n• Note features a grid-based Session View layout\n• Double your loops to create variation within clips\n• Duplicate your clips and create different versions of your ideas\n• Create eight tracks with up to eight clips on eight scenes\n• Try different layer combinations and song structures \n• Export your work in Session View as an audio file to listen and share"

The playful touch UI invites anything from live performance, experimentation to learning and mastering the granular concept.\n\nMultiple plugins: Import, Record or Live Process\nYou can import your own WAVs (standalone & AUv3 Instrument plugin), Record audio (Record effect plugin) or live-process sound (Process effect plugin) to create anything from drones and granular echoes to moving microtonal audio textures.\n\nDesigned for touch: Kinetic Sliders\nAll sliders and XY pads are linked to a physics model which lets you flick and throw them around. Minimise the friction for endless bouncing motion, as an innovative substitute for traditional LFOs and modulation. There was never a better reason for using a touchscreen for music.\n\nShimmer Feedback effect\nLike a shimmer reverb, except it feeds the processed audio back into the grain engine. This lets you create an endless loop of pitch-shifting spaciousness, turning even the simplest of sounds into massive woolly mammoths. \n\n- 3 Voice grain engine, each with an independent playhead\n- Filter inspired by the Oberheim Xpander, including its resonant Phase filter\n- Kinetic sliders and pads for playful interaction with the sound\n- Universal design (iPhone and iPad; iPad Air 2 or higher recommended)\n- Custom scales, unquantised mode and even Scala-import for microtonal experiments\n- Use WAVs (or other audio files), record audio or load the app as a live-processing audio effect\n- Real world tested as an instrument in numerous live performances by Hainbach\n- Offers light mode and dark mode UI"

      "label": "Enjoy music at a deeper level with realtime visualization! Spectra is a lightweight music & audio visualizer app that allows you to select and visualize audio in realtime, right on your phone or mac. Want to export your visualization? We have you covered. Simply click the \"Create Video\" button from within the app. No longer do you need expensive software to create those beautiful animations you've seen on the internet. Want to customize the background image or put a logo in the center? We made that available as well. In fact, you can customize just about all aspects of the visualizer. You can even import audio files from apps like iMessage or Mail using the share sheet. We want to keep improving the app so If you have any suggestions, be sure to leave a review and tell us what feature you're missing!\n\nThe features:\n• Amazing, 60fps realtime visualization for any audio file, iTunes music (not Apple Music), or Spotify song\n• Video exporting of your audio visualization (does not support Spotify)\n• Custom background image\n• Background presets\n• Background effects\n• Custom logo image\n• Visualizer customization\n• Particle customization\n• Video export settings\n• Video animation options\n• Presets\n• More to come!!!\n\nHere's how it works:\nThe sound we hear is made up of many frequencies. The visualizer decomposes the audio input into its frequencies and displays the lower frequencies at the top/left of the audio spectrum and the higher frequencies at the bottom/right of the spectrum. This can create some cool-looking shapes that all correspond to the currently-playing audio track!\n\nWhether you're a producer that wants to see the frequency range of their song, an audiophile, or someone who wants to take a deeper look into their music, this app is definitely for you."

      "label": "Tempi measures you and your entire band’s tempo live, while you play, and lets you analyze the performance when you’re done. It's like a reverse metronome.\n\n* Tempi listens while you (or your entire band) play.\n* Tempi reports the BPM (beats per minute) of your performance in real time with remarkable accuracy.\n* When you’re done, Tempi lets you analyze the recording so that problem areas can be pinpointed and improved.\n* Use Tap for Tempo to quickly get a BPM reading at any time.\n* Switch themes for easy nighttime use or just to suit your style.\n* Export the audio recording of your performance to keep or share with others.\n\nHOW TO USE\n\nIn a band setting, place the iPhone or iPad in a position where the entire band can see it so everyone will know when the band is speeding up or slowing down. When you’re done playing the song, press the stop button to analyze the performance. You can scroll through the entire song, isolate where the tempo sped up or slowed down, and play back the song to get an idea of what went wrong.\n\nTempi is great for individual practice too. Use it instead of a metronome while practicing to pinpoint problem areas in a piece of music that you’re learning. If you can play through an entire song with the tempo only changing by 1 or 2 BPMs, you’ve arrived :-)\n\nTempi works best when there’s a distinct “pulse” to the song, like a kick drum/snare or a repeating chord, and assumes the player is trying to play at a consistent tempo. With less structured music it still does quite well but may occasionally report incorrect tempos.\n\nIf your song is very fast or very slow, tap the button at the top right to toggle between 1/2x, 1x, and 2x tempos."

      "label": "EōN is a new relationship to \"recorded\" music as we have always known it by immersing the listener in an endless sound (and visual) experience, like an album whose duration would have no fixed limit.\n\nEōN produces an infinite music, in constant evolution, abundant in variations, composed by electronic music pioneer Jean-Michel Jarre, accompanied by a constant progression of organic visual elements.\n\nOnce the EōN app is activated, you will listen and watch a new unlimited music experience constantly unfold, designed to be absolutely unique for each listener, always different each time the app is launched.\n\nYou can enjoy a different journey everytime, listening as many times and as long as you want, the only limit being your device’s battery!\n\nIn addition, once downloaded, EōN is fully autonomous requiring no internet connection. Thus it is possible to launch the app anywhere and at any time.\n\nJEAN-MICHEL JARRE ABOUT EōN:\n  \"-Eon- the name of an ancient Greek God associated with unlimited time and eternity.\n\nI named this project EōN as it symbolizes exactly what it is: an infinite musical and visual creation, which offers to everyone a unique experience, which will never happen again: on each device and each activation of the application EōN, you will hear and see an ever-evolving orchestration of music and visuals. EōN is an endless organic work, never repetitive, that will live and grow indefinitely at your fingertip.\n\nLike in life, every moment lived in EōN will never happen again.\n\nPersonally, I truly feel that EōN is probably one of my most exciting creative projects since Oxygene. I always wanted to create a specific music for each listener, able to evolve constantly in terms of rhythms, tones, tempo, melodies and textures. Here it is. EōN is conceived and composed as a different journey for everyone, with no end determined.\n\nI had a clear idea of the organic, living visuals I wanted to accompany my music, and I was very lucky to spend some time in Tokyo at Sony Computer Science Laboratories, Inc. (Sony CSL), where I discovered Alexis André and his singular visual world. Sony CSL with Alexis have conceived and developed an algorithm generating an endless flow of ever-evolving graphics, which, like the music, are infinite and never repeatitive.\n\nThe algorithm and audio engine that orchestrates the music of the EōN app have been engineered by Alexis Zbik & Vianney Apreleff from BLEASS after defining the rules of the system together. \"\n\n\nCREDITS\nConceived and composed by Jean-Michel Jarre\nDigital Graphics by Alexis André of Sony Computer Science Laboratories, Inc.

      "label": "Welcome to the ERSKN Afro-Cuban Essentials Play-Along app, featuring Aaron Serfaty. \n\nI have known Aaron for many years, and he is the “go-to” guy for Afro-Cuban and Brazilian drumming in Los Angeles. He is also my trusted colleague at the Thornton School at the University of Southern California. We are delighted to present this app to you. \n\nIt has been designed and created for use by all musicians who are interested in increasing their understanding of listening to Afro-Cuban music and raising the level of their skills and artistry when playing this music. \n\nThe heart of Afro-Cuban music is understanding clave and the role each instrument plays, all while being able to play the “standards” of this music in common keys and at different tempos. With the combined professional and pedagogical experiences between the three musicians, these tracks target and explore an essential variety of requisite Afro-Cuban modes and styles.\n\nUsing the built-in mixer, the user can create their own combo: full rhythm section (trio), music-minus- piano, music-minus-bass, music-minus-drums, or solo tracks of drums-only, bass-only or piano-only PLUS any combination of congas, bongo and timbale percussion tracks. There are click-track and count-off options, too.\n\nPDF lead sheets are included for the rhythm section. These charts can be printed or emailed from the app. There are also transcriptions of some of the piano montuno patterns as well as all of the relevant beats and patterns Aaron plays on a variety of instruments (drum set, congas, bongo and timbales, etc.)\n\nWe suggest you listen to the full band mixes at least once in order to hear how the musicians are playing this music — you now have a world-class Afro- Cuban rhythm section at your fingertips!\n\nI asked Aaron what he wanted to say in these introductory remarks, and this is what he told me: “I'd like you to insist on the fact that we don't need to be fluent in Spanish to play this music. Nurture Vs. Nature. No genetic code needed, just homework.”\n\nThere’s no better musical homework than listening and playing...and now, you can do both, any time and anywhere!\n\n-- Peter Erskine"

A must-have tool for musicians.\n\n• Simple to use with all the essential features.\n• Live pitch graph displays the exact pitch, note and deviation in realtime.\n• Extremely accurate (can be tuned to an accuracy of ±0.1 cents).\n• Tone generator that can generate reference tones over a note-range of 3 octaves.\n• Ability to set the frequency of A₄ (for tunings where A₄ is not 440 hertz).\n• Option to visualize pitch on piano keys.\r\n• Option to set detection latency - By setting a lower latency value, pitch detection will be faster. This works great for cases like vocal practice. By using a higher latency, pitch detection will not respond to momentary unintended sounds and noise (works great for instrument tuning).\r\n• Smart Detection - Use machine learning to enable pitch detection only when certain instruments or vocal sounds are detected."

      "label": "Chameleon is an AUv3 compatible sampler instrument plugin for your favourite DAW. \n\nThe program can run as a standalone app in order to record audio samples from the internal microphone or professional audio interface. It also supports incoming Inter-App Audio connections for sampling directly from other iOS applications, however it is primarily intended to be used as an AUv3 Instrument plugin for applications such as Cubasis, AUM, Auria, Meteor, Gargeband etc. The plugin can additionally be loaded as an AUv3 effect in order to record audio passing through it from other AUv3 Instrument sources, which makes it a very versatile and useful tool.\n\nSo what is a sampler? A sampler is a device that allows you to imitate other instruments with just a few short audio snippits. Although it comes with a library of presets it also allows you to create your own. You do this by recording multiple audio clips and mapping them to the notes on a MIDI keyboard and Chameleon does the rest using a sophisticated pitch shifting algorithm to fill in the blanks.  Recorded samples can either be layered or mapped freely over a 7 octave range and saved as individual presets. Presets are then organised into custom categorised banks which can be exported and shared with others.\n\nJust think, you can sample all your favourite synth sounds and carry them around on your iPhone/iPad without the inconvenience of lugging heavy gear around with you. Sample anything from musical instruments to vocal snippits, drum machines or ambient noises. The possibilities are endless.\n\nRecording is incredible easy. Just create a New Patch and press record. Chameleon will wait for you to play a note before recording begins. Once recorded press the LEARN button and tap the note range on the virtual or MIDI keyboard to map the sample. Repeat this as many times as required, tweak the settings and save your patch. Additionally you can setup loop points with the ability to apply crossfade. If all that sounds too complicated, just press auto sample and let Chameleon do all the sampling for you.\n\nChameleon also has a quite sophisticated arpeggiator which allows you to create complex mixtures of notes and chords with glide, hold and re-triggering options. \n\nOn board reverb, digital delay and chorus effects are available to give your samples a more polished touch. We also include 4 touch pads for quickly dialing in on a sound or for easy effect automation. Configurable touch ADSR and modulation options are available too.\n\nChameleon can also import audio samples using iOS Files integration or you can make use of Copy / Paste to quickly drop one of more samples into a patch. You can also freely edit samples using the built in tools such as normalise, fade in, fade out, crop, clear options etc. \n\nYou can run Cameleon as a standalone app and map external MIDI keyboards (Bluetooth MIDI support also included) and perform audio sampling outside of your DAW. This is provided for convenience since you can't record input when hosted as an AUv3 Instrument plugin.\n\nYes some DAW's have built in samplers which only have the ability to playback libraries provided with the software. Chameleon allows you to built your own libraries of sounds and share them with others. There's a budding rapper in you dying to get out and we have just the tool!\n\nFeatures:\n\nAUv3 Instrument and AUv3 Effect compatible\nRuns as a standalone app for sampling purposes.\nSupports incoming IAA connections to compatible apps..\nADSR touch envelopes and modulation.\nARP - Sophisticated programmable arpegiator.\nReverb, Chorus and Digital Delay Effects with BPM sync.\nBackup and Restore patches and banks.\nCreate your own user banks.\n4 Touch Pads for automation.\n16 MIDI Drum Pads\niOS Files App support for import and export.\nBluetooth MIDI support\nLoop Points and optional Crossfade supported.\nMonophonic and Polyphonic modes.\nAuto Sample feature.\nBuilt in Vocoder."

      "label": "MagicDelay is a professional, studio grade, spectral delay effect. Spectral because it allows the effect amount to be controlled per-frequency as if you had thousands of delays combined into one. Something not possible in the analogue world. Controlling thousands of delay times sounds complicated, but we made this process really simple. At the heart of MagicDelay is the Curve Editor where you can draw up to 4 separate curves and fluently morph between them using the adjacent XY pad. The final morphed curve can be inverted, shifted, and skewed for further creative control. The delay features two feedback types, control of the amount of feedback, and high and low pass filters.\n\nSync your delay times to your DAW when used in AUv3 supporting apps such as GarageBand is quick and easy. In just a few seconds you can have, for example, a regular eighth delay for the low-mids and a dotted eighth delay for the highs, or any other combination you can think of!\n\nA great delay needs a great modulation system. In the modulation panel tap on an empty modulation slot and get going. Tap the mapping button to enter mapping mode and choose which controls above should be modulated.\n\nRead our in-depth guides on our website for detailed descriptions of everything MagicDelay has to offer."

As seen on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\n\nhttps://loopyapp.com\n\n-- “This is the best loop station on the iPhone” -- Dub FX (dubfx.net) \n-- “I pretty much own every mobile looper out there and Loopy is HANDS DOWN the best. Super simple interface with powerful features.” -- J. Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support.

It can be set to different time signatures like 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 7/4, 9/4, 11/4, 13/4. You can also select or deselect the downbeats and offbeats separately.\nYou can listen and play to all chords in all twelve keys, see which notes are the chord notes and scale notes and read information about the chord and the corresponding scale.\nIn addition to that, all chords can also be played randomly. You can choose to just randomly change the root or the root and the chord type.\nThe app lets you filter the chords, which allows you to only randomly play the chords of for example the modes of melodic minor or harmonic minor.\n45+ Chords:\n▵7, 7, -7, ø7, o7, 5\n69, ▵7#11, ▵7#5, ▵7#5(11), ▵7#9, ▵7#9b13\n7sus4, 7susb9, 7#11, 7#5, 7b913, 7b9b13, 7b13, 7alt\n-6, -▵7, -▵7b13, -7b13, -7b9, -7#11, -∆7#11, phryg, ø713, o7b2b11\nmajor, major/3, major/5, major/b9, major/9, major/b3, major/11, major/#11, major/b13, major/13, major/7, major/▵7\nminor, minor/b3, minor/5\naugmented, diminished\nSounds: electric piano, piano, organ and strings\n\n•Progressions•\n\nIn this section you can practice more than 50 chord progressions in all twelve keys.\nThe metronome, with all its setting options, is also included in this section.\nThe volume of the root note, third and septime or rather the tensions is adjustable.\nIf you press one of the two random buttons, the app picks a random root or a random progression and root.\n50+ progressions:\nII-7 V7 I▵7, II-7 V7alt I▵7, II-7 bII7#11 I▵7, II-7 V7b913 I▵7, II-7 V7b9b13 I▵7, II-7 V7susb9 I▵7\nIIø7 V7 I-, Coltrane Changes and so on…see full list on my website.\nSounds: electric piano, piano, organ and strings\n\n•Pad•\n\nUsing the pad you can put together your own intervals and chords.\nYou have four octaves and five sounds to choose from, with which you can select up to five tones. The tones can sound both simultaneously and one after the other.\nThe metronome, with all its setting options, is also included in this section.\nYou can choose out of these sounds:\nelectric piano, piano, organ, strings and sine\n\n•Fingerings for saxophone and reed adjustment for saxophone and clarinet•\n\nThere are fingering charts about standard fingerings, false fingerings, altissimo and quarter tones and information about reed adjustment of sides, table, tip, shoulder and heart.\nIf you don´t play the saxophone, you can hide this part of the app.\n\n•Features•\n\n* Stealth Mode (Ear Training Mode). You can use stealth mode in drones, chords and progressions. This will hide the currently played chords and display them afterwards.\n* A practice timer that informs you when your set practice time has expired.\n* Landscape mode.\n* Light- and dark appearance (Night Shift).\n* You can set if you play a C, Bb, oder Eb Instrument.\n* Are you an advanced player? The expert mode offers you additional information which could be confusing to unexperienced musicians. If you have no idea what C▵7#5 means or if you have never heard of quarter tones you probably should choose the standard mode.\n* All sounds can be played from 432Hz to 444Hz."

      "label": "Benny Greb, well known for his contributions to the drumming education community, shared the approach that he has taken personally to develop his sense of groove and improve his own timing on his instrument in his course “The Art and Science of Groove”. Now with the Gap Click app, everyone can practice his method easily with a simple-to-use app! \n\nUnlike standard metronomes which simply state the time, Gap Click helps you improve your sense of time. Gap Click is more than a metronome with a focus on improving your ability to keep tempo, become more aware and comfortable with off beat clicks and by that, become bullet proof and accurate with all notes of the subdivision.\n\nGAP CLICK\nBy scrolling through the numbers of bars and patterns you can quickly configure a “gap” of time in which the metronome drops out. When the “one” comes back around, will your playing still be in time? How long of a gap can you play through and still maintain solid tempo?\n\nMOVING CLICK\nNext you can experiment with all kinds of off-beat patterns in the Gap Bar which moves the click from the downbeat position to a different location. Can you still play your instrument and maintain the downbeat internally even when you hear the click sound on an off-beat?\n\nBoth the “click” and the “gap” portion supports a variety of different syncopated patterns allowing you the ability to practice in binary or ternary rhythms - with more or less safety net depending on your settings.\n\nFeatures\n• Ability to choose from a variety of different syncopated patterns and # of measures for both the standard \"click\" as well as the \"gap\"\n• Use the nostalgic click wheel to find the right tempo or tap to set your desired tempo from 10 to 300bpm\n• Standard quarter-note time signatures: 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4\n\nPersonalize\n• See visual feedback for each note or rest that is played\n• Accent beat 1 of each measure or turn accents off for a greater challenge\n• Flash the screen for a visual indication when switching from the \"click\" to the \"gap\"\n• Find your favorite sound from a variety of click samples hand-picked by Benny\n\nBuy Once, Use Forever\n• There are no In-App Purchases - a one time purchase includes all current and future features. \n\nTESTIMONIALS\nWhat professionals are saying about GAP CLICK:\n• \"The skills you can sharpen by using this app are integral for what it takes to be a professional drummer in any genre.\" - Matt Halpern\n• \"When I first opened the app, it made (simple) sense, without a tutorial.\" - Chris Coleman\n• \"This app helps you lock in the pocket on a whole different level.\" - Luke Holland\n• \"The Gap Click app is something that every drummer should have in their toolbox.\" - Jared Falk, Drumeo\n\nWhat our users are saying about GAP CLICK: \n• \"If you think you have good timing, this will really put you in your place.\"\n• \"Gone are the days of programming gap clicks!\"\n• \"I’ve never had so much fun being destroyed in my practice session.\"\n• \"This is by far the best money I’ve ever spent on a practice tool.\"\n\nABOUT BENNY GREB\nBenny Greb is one of the most respected drummers in the world today. Not only has he headlined nearly every major drum festival and toured with his clinics and drum camps worldwide, but he is also recognized as a composer and bandleader in his own band Moving Parts, which won him the renowned “ECHO Jazz” award - the German equivalent to The Grammys in jazz.\n\nBenny Greb published two of the most successful and critically acclaimed educational products, “The Language of Drumming” and “The Art and Science of Groove” and he has helped create many signature products available to drummers today.\n\nFind him online at https://www.bennygreb.de as well as on social media."

      "label": "One of the first steps in ear training is recognizing intervals. Knowing what the distance is between two notes. Because every melody, chord or scale consists of a series of intervals, this is a very useful and also fundamental skill in music. \n\nThis app helps you to identify the intervals and at the same time how to find them on the guitar. \n\nWith an improved knowledge of intervals on the guitar you can figure out chord progressions more easily, can reproduce melodies as you hear them, get a better understanding of written music etc.\n\nFeatures\n\n- 17 selectable intervals, from unison, minor second thru major tenth.\n\n- Choice between melodic and harmonic intervals, ascending & descending.\n\n- A graphical representation of intervals on the guitar.\n\n- The root note can be chosen over two octaves.\n\n- Portrait, portrait upside down and both landscape modes.\n\n- Optional voice function, convenient for training in the car.\n\n- Practice and test (quiz)mode.\n\n- Intervals are grouped by difficulty level. Each group has 6 progress indicators corresponding to the different interval types  (melodic ascending/descending, harmonic ascending/descending, random melodic, random harmonic/melodic).\n\n- Optional reference melodies for each interval can be played. These should help in learning intervals faster.\n\n- In practicing harmonic intervals, the interval is classified as consonant/dissonant. Hearing this difference is beneficial in identifying harmonic intervals.\n\n- More than 10 alternate tunings e.g. the NST (new standard tuning) and all fourths tuning. The latter has the property that same intervals all have similar patterns down or across the fretboard.\n\n- Option to play only tapped notes (interval type \"None\"). Useful in figuring out melodies or trying alternate tunings. \n\n- In practice mode the root can also be played as the second note in the interval.\n\n- Support for left handed guitar.\n\n- Support for bass guitar.\n\n- To be in line with written music, enharmonic equivalent notes are used to have classical interval names. E.g. the 3 semitone interval C - D# will be called minor third C - Eb.\n\n- Intervals can be practiced and tested in a scale context. Sometimes the same intervals may sound quite different just because of being played in another scale. To strengthen the scale interval knowledge the partial scale runs of the interval can be played automatically backward and/or forward for a chosen scale.\n\n- More than 15 of the most important scales are implemented and can be visualized on the fretboard. The scale notes are clustered and colored to show clearly the root note for which the interval applies.\n\n- Universal app: designed for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, 64-bit compatible.\n\n- Support for all screen sizes.\n\n- Dark mode support.\n\n- iOS, iPadOS 16 tested."

Now with Drum Kit Designer feature and detailed online tutorials.\n\nFeatured in Modern Drummer 'New and Notable' - July 2018  \n\n\"an invaluable aid not only for drummers but also studio engineers and producers\" - Sound on Sound Magazine\n\n\"I can’t recommend this app highly enough ... for the money, it is indispensable. It's simple, accurate, looks good, and the tuning information is worth the cost of the app alone.\" - www.mikedolbear.com\n\n“***** I never knew I could have this much fun tuning drums!” – Adamrod (App Store review)\n\n“***** Just tuned my first drum and this app is awesome!” – bburt85 (App Store review)\n\n“***** Buy this app if you are a drummer!!!” Lildrummerboy (App Store review)\n\nThe original and most innovative electronic drum tuning app - iDrumTune Pro brings unrivalled accuracy and features that have never been possible before for assisting with drum tuning. Built by world experts in drums and musical acoustics, and backed up by a detailed online training course on Drum Sound and Drum Tuning.\n\niDrumTune Pro includes the following features:\n\n* Pitch Tuning – to make your drums sing and allow you to play musical phrases around the kit\n\n* Lug Tuning – to ensure that the drumhead is evenly tuned and gives a smooth and warm tone\n\n* Resonant Head Tuning – to allow you to be sure that the two heads are working together and giving rich overtones\n\n* Spectrum Analyzer – so you can really start to understand what frequencies are excited and heard when playing the drums\n\n* Drum Kit Presets – so you can save and load your favourite tunings and share them with the world. Now also includes the interactive Drum Kit Designer feature.\n\n* The Science of Drum Tuning – and extensive manual on the science and art of drum tuning and getting the best out of iDrumTune Pro \n\niDrumTune is the first and by far the most intelligent and accurate system for analyzing drum sounds and assisting tuning – developed by drummers, music producers and acoustics research Professors. iDrumTune provides you with a measurement of the drumhead vibration frequency, much in the same way to an acoustic guitar tuner which measures the vibration frequency of a guitar string. In Pitch Tuning mode, you simply hold the iPhone over the center of a drum, about 2-4 inches away, and strike the drum in the center.\n\nThe iDrumTune readout shows the recorded sound waveform and gives the strongest frequency recorded. There is also a tuning indicator bar which shows the drumhead tuning relative to musical notes, so iDrumTune can be used to ensure that your drums are in key with each other or the song you are playing. A frequency spectrum view also allows more detailed analysis and helps with tuning the drum at the lug positions.\n\niDrumTune provides advanced tuning features including an intelligent filter function, Lug Tuning mode and Resonant Head Tuning mode. The filter allows unwanted frequencies to be ignored by the analysis algorithm, whilst Lug Tuning mode offers the simplest and most innovative method for tuning an even frequency response at the lug positions on the drumhead.\n\nThe Preset Manager allows you to save all your favourite drum tunings and call them up when you are in the middle of the process. Drum kits can also be exported and imported, so you can share your favorite tuning setups and load new ones in from other drummers.\n\nDrum Tuning isn’t easy, and drums don’t respond exactly the same way every time you hit them. For that reason, it's valuable to know a little about the science of drum tuning. iDrumTune includes a comprehensive text on the science of drums and drum tuning in order to help you get the best of iDrumTune and to become an expert drum tuner!\n\nWatch the iDrumTune tutorial videos and read reviews on iDrumTune at www.idrumtune.com"

There's also an additional sub-oscillator strapped into the master section for added oomph.\n\nThe internal controllers will bring in the dynamics: an LFO and an envelope, there's a recordable XY field & a sequencer. Use these to modulate any knob – a simple long tap will do.\n\nThe sound springs to life when it hits the filter section. Needless to say, analogue high-pass, low-pass and band-pass varieties are in place, along with a comb filter.\n\nStandards aside, the actual intention behind this project, the Vowel Filter, also became its outstanding feature: string together two or four vowel formants and play them back in a multitude of ways.\n\nOnce you’ve built your sound, there’s tons of sound polish in two chained multi-effect units.\n\nFeatures\n\n•\tSawtooth, Triple Saw, Pulse, Triple FM, Noise with tonal Filter, Sub Sine\n•\t5 Filters with 5 Modulators each\n•\tDuophone Arpeggiator\n•\tVowel Filter\n•\tTwo Effect Sections\n•      Audio Unit v3\n•\tAbleton Link Kit\n•\tMIDI Learn & Host Automation\n•\t300 groovy presets by various artists"

K7D recreates the hardware echo machines of the past using Imaginando’s signature style of obsessive analog emulation, but with an enhanced level of control from a sleek, modern interface. Using this approach allows a whole new world of creative possibilities, while still retaining a warm, full-bodied analog sound, bursting with character and personality.\n\nTo give K7D it’s distinctive analog flavour, we studied and analysed the tiny details of what makes classic hardware delays great, and painstakingly recreated every subtle nuance for a fantastically authentic sound.\n\nAvailable as a standalone app and audio unit plugin, you can use it digital audio stations for iOS such as Garage Band, AUM, Cubasis, Auria, Audiobus, etc.\n\nFeatures\n\n- 1ms to 1 sec. dual playhead analog modeled delay with noise, tape distortion and mechanical vibration models\n- Modeled microphone input with pre-amp saturation\n- Normal and Ping Pong modes\n- Optimized gain staging and saturation algorithms for very musical results\n- Delay time spread between heads and stereo width control\n- High pass and Low pass filter on feedback path\n- Powerful LFO bipolar time modulation with multiple waveforms (sine, triangular, saw, square, sample and hold and filtered sample and hold) and possibility of inverted LFO phase on second play head (for added stereo imaging)\n- Delay time syncable with BPM\n- Possibility of delay time modulation via incoming midi notes\n- Oscilloscope visualisation of audio waveform and LFO waveform\n- Built-in patch manager\n- Audiounit compatible"

At large sizes, its soft attack and lingering, harmonic tails allow it to really shine on guitars, strings, vocals and pads. At small sizes those very same qualities can add an angelic sheen to vocals or turn a simple drum track into an otherworldly rhythm section.\n\nFeatures:\n- Incredibly easy to use with over 80 presets; many created by Eventide artists.\n- Ability to create extremely musical effects useful for highlighting key instruments.\n- Supernatural settings for abstract spatial effects and drones.\n- Subtle settings for ambient washes and track highlighting.\n- Unique “Gravity” control reverses the arrow of time by inverting the reverb's decay.\n- Innovative Ribbon and Hotswitch allow for changing any combination of parameters simultaneously.\n- Fully flexible mono and stereo options. Bring new realms of stereo imaging to mono instruments.\n- Mixlock allows for scrolling through presets or settings while keeping the wet/dry mix constant.\n- Available as an Audio Units AUv3 plug-in, Inter-App Audio, and Standalone App."

      "label": "Have you ever struggled to find confidence on stage or inspiration in the studio? AeroPads cues immersive pads and soundscapes that inspire and equip you to perform your very best every time.\n\nENHANCE YOUR SOUND. ENGAGE YOUR AUDIENCE.\nEvery musician has experienced an empty mix or an awkward transition. When using AeroPads, you instantly add more dimension and character to your sound. With a more immersive mix and the ability to perform smooth and seamless transitions, you will feel more confident while your audience will be more engaged.\n\nFOR EVERY MUSICIAN.\nPads and soundscapes are a versatile accompaniment to nearly any style of music. Whether you are a soloist or full band, AeroPads will take your sound to the next level. Rock bands, worship teams, wedding singers, producers, songwriters, and instrumentalists are just a few of the many types of musicians that have loved using AeroPads.\n\nDESIGNED FOR THE STAGE. INSPIRED BY SPACE.\nAeroPads features creative and immersive soundscapes paired with a beautiful and intuitive interface, all inspired by the pinnacle of exploration and inspiration: outer space.\n\nCREATIVITY THAT SPARKS CREATIVITY.\nAeroPads aren't your typical pads. Most pads out there are really boring or insanely obnoxious. However, AeroPads features thoughtfully crafted soundscapes that are meticulously fine-tuned with the perfect amount of harmonic and textural movement. Simply put, AeroPads won't step on the toes of your arrangement or get on the nerves of your sound guy (like most other pads out there).\n\n\nHighlighted Features:\n- A beautiful space-inspired interface with a simple and intuitive design.\n- Live View: Every key and three of your favorite patches are instantly accessible (best suited for experimentation, free-flowing sets, and songwriting).\n- Setlist View: Plan and build a detailed setlist (best suited for structured sets and seamless transitions).\n- The iconic Atmosphere Soundpack which includes five unique patches named after and inspired by the layers of Earth's atmosphere. \n- Three patches can be added to Live View to be made instantly accessible, so there's no need to dig through menus to just to change a patch when performing live.\n- Additional patches and soundpacks available for purchase.\n\n\nHow to Use:\n01. Cue a pad that matches the key of your musical arrangement.\n02. Play overtop of the accompanying pads and soundcapes.\n03. Enjoy the boost of audience engagement, musician confidence, and creative inspiration.\n\nPads and soundscapes are intended as a subtle accompaniment to musical arrangements/performances. They are designed to be cued according to the key of the arrangement. Once cued, you'll hear a droning pad centered around the root note with additional harmonic textures within the major scale. Pads can accompany arrangements of both minor and major scales. To accompany an arrangement within a minor scale, cue the relative major (Example: to accompany an arrangement in the key of A minor, cue \"C\"). A pad's key should not be changed to match chord changes within an arrangement. The only time a pad's key should change within a song is in the instance of a key change. For best results, mix AeroPads appropriately within the overall mix. When mixed too loud, AeroPads may compete with melodies and the arrangement. When mixed too quietly, AeroPads may be less effective. When mixed appropriately, they will sound awesome."

      "label": "SWAM Solo Strings has arrived on iOS! The incredibly powerful Physical Modeling technology is now MOBILE. Extreme Expressivity and Realism delivered in a package of only 46 MB\nThese instruments are NOT sample libraries. Unlike sampling, which uses recordings to replicate the sound of an instrument, physical modeling doesn’t generate a sound as such but creates the conditions for the system to create it according to an external input (like someone playing on a keyboard).\n\nWith our SWAM Violin for iOS, you now have the unique ability to express yourself with all the emotions  and subtleties of a natural string instrument sound as played by a real player, in any style — from classical to film scoring and even microtonal music.\nSWAM Violin for iOS can be used as a standalone instrument for playing in real-time, or as a plug-in for mobile music production. Play with your favorite external controller or directly from your iOS device through our intuitive interface.\n\nWith SWAM Violin for iOS you can:\n- Explore our collection of presets, create your own, or import them from your Desktop\n- Play in real-time using the standalone version of the app\n- Play with different instrument bodies\n- Play in a variety of styles like a real player\nControl the instrument’s expressivity in real-time directly through the touch control interface on your iPhone or iPad  including the exclusive virtual bowing touch surface!\n- Play and control the instrument’s expressivity in real-time using your favorite external controller (ROLI Seaboard, Akai EWI, breath controllers, regular keyboards, and more)\n- Use the included AUv3 plugin version to produce music with a mobile setup\n- Use the included AUv3 plugin version in combination with Camelot PRO for live performances\n- Adjust every aspect of the instrument’s sound (timbre, vibrato, amount of air, etc.) through an easy-to-use control panel\n- Micro-tune the instrument through the Pitch Manager (note: MAQAM device is supported with direct integration)\n- Add built-in effects such as Reverb, EQ, and Compressor\n- Have access to easy MIDI control configurations\n\nThe SWAM Violin for iOS is for you if:\n- You’re a wind controller player looking for a mobile setup to perform live without needing a computer while still having an incredible sound.\n- You’re a keyboard player and feeling frustrated by the limited expressive capabilities normal sample-based plugins give you.\n- You’re a music producer looking for a mobile setup to produce music from anywhere without having to carry around expensive gear.\n- You’re looking for a virtual instrument that allows you to express the full range of your musicality easily  on your iPhone or iPad.\n\nIMPORTANT: If you choose to play using an external controller, please note that a controller with the ability to continuously control the expression (like an expression pedal, breath controller, MPE device, wind controller, …) is REQUIRED. The same way real players need a bow to express themself on their instrument, SWAM Violin needs something to control its expressivity. SWAM instruments do not work with just note-on velocity."

Lock your screen, relax, and wake up on the right side of the bed!\n\nSupports playing the alarm Bluetooth devices connected to your iOS device.\n\nNotes\n• Click \"Developer Website\" below on this App Store page for the complete FAQ, or email me at iam@willsaid.com\n• A Free Spotify Account works! However, *you need a premium Spotify account to play the entire song in Spotify*\n• The Spotify Mobile App is not needed\n• Internet connectivity is required to find songs and \"set\" an alarm, but not needed when it goes off.\n• Alarms go off for one minute max, but you can always chain multiple alarms together if you are a heavy sleeper. Spotify's API currently only lets the app play 30 seconds of each song, although entire songs are coming soon.\n• As stated above, the app currently plays 30 second snippets of the best parts of songs, which should be more than enough to wake up.\n• Supports Snoozing, Days to Repeat, and the other features you'd expect from an alarm clock\n• The maker of this app is not attached to Spotify in any way. The app simply plays Spotify Content from Spotify's API.\n• Most but not all Spotify songs are currently available on the app. This is outside my control, and up to which artists approve third party app usage of their content. The selection size has improved since Version 1 and is continuing to do so. Artists not on the app include Bob Marley, Ariana Grande, and Frank Ocean. Please email me BEFORE downloading the app if there's a specific song you are looking for and I can quickly check. Email me at iam@willsaid.com and I will get back to you very quickly!"

Note Rush is great for teaching keyboard geography by making sure each note is played in the correct octave. An indispensable music theory must-have for learning sight reading at all levels of music education.\n\n\"Great app for learning notes!\" - App Store Review.\n\n\"So much better than flash cards!

See noterushapp.com/troubleshooting for help. ***\n\nListens to Your Instrument\n------------------------------\nNote Rush helps students learn a strong association between notes on the page and keys on your instrument by using your device's microphone to detect when you play each note. Works with pianos, keyboards, flutes, violins, you name it! (See Q&A below for more about supported instruments.)\n\nStudent-paced\n------------------\nNote Rush goes as fast or as slow as the student, with no time limits, so is suitable for complete beginners right through to being a fun challenge even for teachers!\n\nGrand Staff Context\n-----------------------\nThe whole grand staff is always visible, showing each note in full context and helping students improve their note recognition across the two staves.\n\nOctave-Sensitive Keyboard Geography\n---------------------------------------------\nIt's a \"B\", but which \"B\"?? Note Rush teaches keyboard geography by making sure you're getting the note in the right octave every time.\n\nGreat for Home Practise\n-------------------------\nStudents will rush to their instrument at home every day with NoteRush, chasing stars and high scores! Unlike flash cards, children can drill note identification at home with no music-reading parent required to check if they're getting them correct - Note Rush checks for you! Play every day and you'll be great at reading piano music in no time.\n\nLevels\n-------\nNote Rush has fifteen built-in Levels, from Middle C-Position right through to the full grand staff with 2 ledger lines above and below. There are Levels for Treble Clef, Bass Clef or full Grand Staff! Or make your own levels to practise reading specific notes, with sharps and flats for an added challenge!\n\nBetter Than Flash Cards!\n-------------------------\nUse Note Rush instead of printed flash cards! Note Rush was designed to replace the cards used in One Minute Club - a challenge you can run in your studio where students have to complete a given level in under a minute. Give it a try!\n\n--\nNote Rush is made by Thomas Grayston, a software developer, pianist, and husband to a piano teacher."

      "label": "A Real Time Analyzer for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. Test your speakers, tune your room, do acoustical analysis work or just have a better understanding of audio frequencies. RTA is a professional-grade acoustical analysis tool. All filters meet or exceed ANSI and IEC Class 1 specifications. \n\nIncludes Octave and 1/3 Octave modes, with selectable decay times, as well as Peak Hold and true linear Average mode.\n\n*** iOS Microphones\n\nWe have analyzied every iOS device, including all of the iPads, all iPhones, and iPod touches, and have created microphone compensation files that are applied automatically. You can trust the results you are getting, often within just a few dB of a far more expensive analyzer. Calibration is updated regularly, automatically, from our cloud-based calibration database.\n\nUpgrade to our iTestMic or iAudioInterface2 to bring your system up to full professional specs.\n\n*** Save and Recall Graphs\n\nYou can save and recall graphs, marked with the GPS location, date & time, and your comment, as well as store the image to your photo roll.\n\nExport the data as an XLS formatted file to your computer for inclusion in reports or further analysis.\n\n*** Max and Min Bars\n\nYou can also turn on resettable Max/Min bars (see image #4) to capture peaks. Double-tap to reset the bars.\n\n*** Specifications and Devices\n\nThe internal iPhone mic has a noise floor near 30 dB, and if your are running iOS 6, clips around 120 dB. \n\n*** Touch GUI\n\nFully interactive touch GUI features includes scroll up/down, pinch to zoom or compress the vertical dB scale, or swipe horizontally to get a cursor that reads out the exact dB level and frequency across the screen. To make the cursor disappear, swipe it off the graph to the left.\n\nThe landscape-mode display flips 180 degrees so that you can face the internal mic in either direction.\n\n*** Overlay Curves\n\nAlso included are optional noise curve overlays, in NCB, RC, PNC, NC, X-Curve and NR mode. See picture #2 for an example. Use this feature to get a quick reading on the noise levels in a room. Also includes the cinema large-room X-curve overlay.\n\n*** Calibration\n\nRTA can be fully calibrated, whether you are using it with the internal iOS microphone, or one of our professional test & measurement mic solutions. And, if you are using iTestMic, the mic calibration is transmitted directly to the app, so you are always calibrated.\n\n*** RTA or FFT?\n\nIf you are wondering if you should download this app or our FFT app, check out our website, we have a page devoted to this topic.\n\nSee our other acoustics and audio apps, including AudioTools."

      "label": "Learn to play 'In The Pocket' with Drummer ITP: The World's only intelligent metronome and rudiment training tool! *Worldwide Number 1 iPhone Music App in over 70 countries!*\n\nDrummer ITP can help you to learn exceptionally accurate timing with your drum performances and become a true 'In The Pocket' player. The app is designed for practicing rudiment patterns with a drum practice pad - incorporating an intelligent listening feature, which allows your performance against a metronome click to be measured and given as feedback scores. You can therefore track your progress and identify what rudiment patterns and tempos cause you most trouble with staying in time. \n\n*Please note: as with all professional audio and recording systems, Drummer ITP requires you to use wired headphones to enable zero latency analysis and measurements. Bluetooth headphones do not allow zero latency data exchange.\n\nDrummer ITP helps to identify the key tempos where your technique changes from wrist-action stick hits to faster speeds which require you to control the bounce of the drumsticks. Finding your breaking points with different stick pad rudiments and practice exercises will enable you to focus on the most challenging aspects of your personal stick technique and will underpin your development in all areas of drumming.\n\nThe main display shows both the rolling click waveform and the microphone readings from your performance on the practice pad, so you can easily see if you are playing ahead or behind the beat. There is also a unique accuracy indicator which shows how far ahead or behind the beat each of your hits is. Whilst performing rudiments and exercises on a practice pad, the app records an ongoing measurement of accuracy and consistency of the performance, so you can practice to keep the timing indicator right in the middle of the screen and achieve the highest possible scores. When playing an accented pattern, or an exercise with rests incorporated, the intelligent algorithm checks that the correct type of hits are performed at the right time. If you want to check how accurate the app is, just turn up the loudspeaker volume and you'll see it measure its own sounds to 100% accuracy - so you can see how close your own performance scores are to that of an electronic drum machine!\n\nDrummer ITP can be used in Manual Mode or Rudiment Mode. In Manual Mode the metronome runs freely, as a standard metronome whilst also keeping a measurement of the recent performance scores. With a rudiment pattern active (i.e. using the app's Rudiment Mode), a count in starts a 30, 60, 120 or 300 second rudiment test, the results of which become a benchmark for evaluating your performance progress over time, with all your best high scores being recorded. The app can also be used purely as a standalone high-precision metronome with advanced settings allowing you to choose different pitches, volumes and intervals for the click.\n\nIncludes a total of 68 practice patterns and rudiment exercises for combinations of:\n- standard timing exercises (quarters, eighths, sixteenths)\n- triplet timing exercises\n- single, double and triple paradiddles (including inverted, reverse and offset)\n- single and double paradiddle-diddle patterns\n- rudimental drum rolls\n- accented patterns\n\nAdditional features:\n- notation of all included rudiments and exercise patterns \n- real-time left/right hand pattern indicator \n- accent indicator and moving notation counter \n- tempo adjustment from 30-240 bpm\n- beat time intervals 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n- optional beat one accent for practicing specific time signatures\n- click designer with settings for pitch, tonality, click duration and volume\n- separate click design for the main beat and interval sounds\n- stick pad performance player, to hear what you are attempting to play\n- high scores chart for completed rudiments and exercises\n- preset click sounds\n- microphone sensitivity adjustment\n- intelligent 'learn latency' feature to ensure 100% accurate analysis"

      "label": "The next evolution in music software. Powerful wavetable sound. \nThe next generation ELECTRIBE produces state-of-the-art dance music.\n\nThe ELECTRIBE series first appeared in 1999. Since then each generation has inherited the iconic, intuitive operability of the original while incorporating the most up-to-date sounds and styles.\n\nThe ease of use, accessibility, sound and musicality of the ELECTRIBE reach new heights in this latest software version which features a powerful wavetable sound source, a “Quick Input” sequencer and a convenient chord pad that allows you to play a chord with one finger. Even if you aren't a musical virtuoso, with ELECTRIBE Wave you can create state-of-the-art dance music like EDM, Future Bass, and Trap.\n\n• Powerful wavetable sound suitable for the latest in EDM\nELECTRIBE Wave has a sound wavetable featuring sounds widely used in the latest music creation. Unlike a PCM synth, the wavetable allows you to repeatedly play fragments of short waveforms, and change the waveform position during playback. By combining the wavetable (which features a rich variety of presets) with a powerful filter and two modulation units, you can create an infinite number of innovative and sharp sounds that cannot be produced using standard PCM synths. Even without a deep knowledge of synthesis techniques, the carefully selected parameters make it easy to craft your sound.\n\n• Improved user interface for quick composition\nThe familiar 16-step pad in the ELECTRIBE series enables speedy rhythm production. The ELECTRIBE Wave also features a new keyboard to play chords and scales. Even without musical knowledge, you can have fun making tracks without worrying about wrong notes. The sequencer features Groove, which can be used to breathe life into rhythm parts, as well as a special keyboard to enable smooth step input for synth parts on the graphical user interface.\n\n• Convenient chord pad that allows you to play a chord with one finger\nELECTRIBE Wave features a chord pad that allows you to play  chords with one finger. If you use the \"Fetch\" function, it will automatically extract the chords from the song that you are in in the middle of creating and assign those chords to the pad for fast and easy song creation. You can also easily assign and save your favorite chords. In addition you can use the arpeggiator to create new phrases!\n\n• Motion Sequence records and plays temporal changes in sounds and effects\nThe ELECTRIBE series introduced a powerful motion sequence function that remembers and reproduces the movements of the knobs. ELECTRIBE Wave now offers this function for the synthesizer/drum parts so you can create a flow of sound overflowing with originality. If you use the built in KAOSS PAD you can change the sound to drastically with a single fingertip, easily storing and reproducing  temporal changes. Remember the wave table POSITION to make real time minute changes to the sound performance.\n\n• Song mode can combine patterns into finished songs\nUse song mode to create a new track by simply arranging the order of existing patterns. Using only the ELECTRIBE Wave, you can take a song all the way from inspiration to completion. With audio file export, you can send a complete song or individual patterns to your favorite DAW, or upload to services like SoundCloud.\n\nMore info at korg.com"

      "label": "The new way to practice jazz!\nGenius Jamtracks, the play-along app for jazz musicians that thinks and plays like an actual trio.\nWith an impressively realistic sound and feel, it helps you build your repertoire, your jazz vocabulary and master polyrhythms.\n\n>>> Brand New Features\n- Create your own songs with Genius Jamtracks using an easy and intuitive interface. Get creative and listen to how your compositions swing with the Genius Jamtracks trio.\n- Edit the charts for your favourite jazz standards however you like.\n\n\n“Genius Jamtracks is easily the best play along app out there! Particularly the piano voicings are more logical and realistic than other play-along apps. The bass and drums are not just a simple repetitive pattern, but actually use some jazz language. And it’s nice that you can make the band busy in unpredictable ways. As much like playing with a real group as you can get from an algorithm. Highly recommended!“\nPaul Bollenback  \n\n“It’s like a jazz musician wrote it. The drums and piano are just like how a jazz drummer and pianist would play. Couldn’t be an easy task to create that!”\nSteve Beskrone\n\n\n\n- Easy to read charts! \nCustom fonts make for beautiful, easy to read chord charts.\n\n- Rhythmic Complexity slider \nStart with simple comping and work your way up to mastering superhuman polyrhythms!\n\n- Harmonic Complexity slider\nStart with triads and work your way up to advanced substitutions and reharmonisation of the song.\n\n- The one and only polyrhythmic play-along!\nIn the Jam Session mode, the app decides on its own what to play and when to play it, based on the style of the song and the tempo. Experiment with how the app transforms the rhythm and the harmony according to the slider levels.\n\n- Master your polyrhythms!\nFocus on a specific grouping, polyrhythm or rhythmic displacement. Ask the trio – or an individual instrument – to include only what you’ve requested when they introduce polyrhythmic phrasing.\nAs you won’t know when or how it will be used though, this feature also helps sharpen your ability to improvise as well as mastering that rhythm!\n\n- Why it sounds great.\nIt’s all in the dynamics, note durations, space and feel. The Genius Jamtracks trio pays close attention to each of these elements to make the Genius Jam Session experience as close to the real thing as possible.\n\n- A real swing feel!\nForget the robotic triplets of other play-alongs. When changing the tempo, the app doesn’t simply play faster or slower, the swing feel changes as well. The app learned how to swing by internalising the jazz vocabulary and playing based on real transcriptions from the masters.\n\n- Actual voice leading!\nNo matter what your settings are, just press play and you’ll always have the same attention to voice leading from the pianist and the same effort in creating beautiful lines from the bassist to accompany you.\n\nReady to take your skills to the next level?"

      "label": "Undulator is Eventide’s classic modulated tremolo effect from the iconic H3000 effects processor. This unique, rhythmic effect combines ethereal feedback and detuned echos, run through an AM / FM modulated tremolo. Whether used for manipulating samples or adding movement to strings, pads, guitars, and keys, Undulator is a muse for creative musicians. Add Undulator into your plug-ins collection for the most playable tremolo-style effect on your DAW or iOS device.\n\nUndulator excels at evolving pads, sync’d chops, and time-lapsing dreamy soundscapes. Combined with a multi-tap delay and powerful tremolo, Undulator’s controls give any sound sustain and shape. This is perfect for transforming ordinary synths, keys, guitars, and even vocals into evolving pads, tempo synced production elements, or ethereal and fluctuant delays. Simply put, Undulator can make shorter sounds into longer layered effects, and give sustaining sounds shape and rhythmic character.\n\nUse the Ribbon to morph tremolo patterns into vacillating and varying rhythmic territories. This can be effective for calling attention to synth pads and creating a state of flux or rarity which is otherwise arduous to achieve.\n\n- Turn up the MIX to increase the dry/effect ratio\n- Utilize multiple modulation waveform shapes and sources to alter the rhythmic feel\n- Subtly finesse detuning of delays by using SPREAD\n- Add FEEDBACK to accentuate delays or create infinite loops\n- The Secondary LFO determines how fast the depth and speed modulation “wiggle” their targets\n- Lock the tremolo to tempo using SYNC\n- RETRIG at the top of the waveform for a more predictable effect\n- RIBBON lets you ‘play’ the effect in real-time and provides dynamic and fluid control to morph back and forth between the settings of your choice\n- SLOW/FAST button toggles on a “Slow LFO” mode. Holding it down to “BRAKE” temporarily slows down the LFOs at a constant rate until released\n- Update the tremolo speed in real time using the TAP button\n- Available as an AUv3 plug-in and Standalone App"

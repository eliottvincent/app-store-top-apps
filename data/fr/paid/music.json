Get your ideas out or play until inspiration hits using a selection of Ableton Live’s drum kits, synths and melodic instruments. Or create your own sound palette by recording the sounds around you into Note’s sampler instruments using your phone’s microphone. \n\nIf you want to take your ideas further, use Ableton Cloud to send your projects to Live (version 11.2.5 or later) without leaving the app. Open your project from Live’s browser, then keep working – you can edit all your MIDI notes, and all your samples and sounds from Note are exactly the same.\n\n\nBegin with a beat: \n• Choose from 56 Drum Sampler kits\n• Tap out a beat using the 16-pad grid\n• Quantize your beat to fix any loose timing\n• Nudge notes to correct mistakes\n• Add more layers of rhythm\n• Create beat repetitions with Note Repeat\n• Change parameters to shape your sound\n• Experiment with effects \n\nStart with a melody:\n• Choose from 261 synth sounds and 36 Melodic Sampler instruments\n• Play your melody or chord progression with either the 25-pad grid or the piano roll\n• Set a key and scale to get instantly harmonic results, or leave your options open\n• Overdub more layers of harmony\n• Change parameters to shape your sound\n• Add effects to experiment with sound design\n\nSample your environment:\n• Create your own kits by recording percussive sounds into Note’s Drum Sampler \n• Record tonal sounds to create your own Melodic Sampler instruments\n• Manipulate your samples by cutting, filtering or repitching them\n• Shape or transform your sounds with effects\n\nCapture improvisations:\n• Play something, then tap the Capture button to keep it\n• Play at the tempo that feels comfortable and Note will detect it\n• Note will recognize the length of the phrase\n• A loop is created automatically\n• Quantize it, add to it, or change the sound\n\nCreate variations:\n• Note features a grid-based Session View layout\n• Double your loops to create variation within clips\n• Duplicate your clips and create different versions of your ideas\n• Create eight tracks with up to eight clips on eight scenes\n• Try different layer combinations and song structures \n• Export your work in Session View as an audio file to listen and share"

A GPU-powered, fast and advanced integrated editor is part of TouchOSC on all platforms - create the most complex of control layouts with ease and precision.\n\nMIDI, OSC and more...\n\nTouchOSC supports sending and receiving any number of MIDI and OSC messages on many connections simultaneously. On top of OSC over UDP & TCP, we support every type of wired & wireless MIDI connection your device can offer, including MIDI over USB.\n\nCross-Network. Synchronized editing.\n\nMultiple instances of TouchOSC can be connected on the network for synchronized editing. Use the precision of your desktop's mouse and keyboard for fine-grained, detailed editing - test-drive and preview in real-time on all connected touch-screen devices at the same time.\n\nScripting and local messages.\n\nA lightweight and fast scripting engine allows deep access to all aspects of your controller and enables limitless customization and interactivity. For less complex tasks we've added local messages - simply wire up controls to transmit or display values; no need to break out the big (code) guns. Easy.\n\nThis is only the beginning...\n\nWe've supported and updated TouchOSC Mk1 for more than 10 years at this point and we're planning to do the same for this new version. We've already got a whole bunch of features cooking that were just not quite ready yet. There is so much more to come... \n\nWelcome to the next generation!"

      "label": "Benny Greb, well known for his contributions to the drumming education community, shared the approach that he has taken personally to develop his sense of groove and improve his own timing on his instrument in his course “The Art and Science of Groove”. Now with the Gap Click app, everyone can practice his method easily with a simple-to-use app! \n\nUnlike standard metronomes which simply state the time, Gap Click helps you improve your sense of time. Gap Click is more than a metronome with a focus on improving your ability to keep tempo, become more aware and comfortable with off beat clicks and by that, become bullet proof and accurate with all notes of the subdivision.\n\nGAP CLICK\nBy scrolling through the numbers of bars and patterns you can quickly configure a “gap” of time in which the metronome drops out. When the “one” comes back around, will your playing still be in time? How long of a gap can you play through and still maintain solid tempo?\n\nMOVING CLICK\nNext you can experiment with all kinds of off-beat patterns in the Gap Bar which moves the click from the downbeat position to a different location. Can you still play your instrument and maintain the downbeat internally even when you hear the click sound on an off-beat?\n\nBoth the “click” and the “gap” portion supports a variety of different syncopated patterns allowing you the ability to practice in binary or ternary rhythms - with more or less safety net depending on your settings.\n\nFeatures\n• Ability to choose from a variety of different syncopated patterns and # of measures for both the standard \"click\" as well as the \"gap\"\n• Use the nostalgic click wheel to find the right tempo or tap to set your desired tempo from 10 to 300bpm\n• Standard quarter-note time signatures: 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4\n\nPersonalize\n• See visual feedback for each note or rest that is played\n• Accent beat 1 of each measure or turn accents off for a greater challenge\n• Flash the screen for a visual indication when switching from the \"click\" to the \"gap\"\n• Find your favorite sound from a variety of click samples hand-picked by Benny\n\nBuy Once, Use Forever\n• There are no In-App Purchases - a one time purchase includes all current and future features. \n\nTESTIMONIALS\nWhat professionals are saying about GAP CLICK:\n• \"The skills you can sharpen by using this app are integral for what it takes to be a professional drummer in any genre.\" - Matt Halpern\n• \"When I first opened the app, it made (simple) sense, without a tutorial.\" - Chris Coleman\n• \"This app helps you lock in the pocket on a whole different level.\" - Luke Holland\n• \"The Gap Click app is something that every drummer should have in their toolbox.\" - Jared Falk, Drumeo\n\nWhat our users are saying about GAP CLICK: \n• \"If you think you have good timing, this will really put you in your place.\"\n• \"Gone are the days of programming gap clicks!\"\n• \"I’ve never had so much fun being destroyed in my practice session.\"\n• \"This is by far the best money I’ve ever spent on a practice tool.\"\n\nABOUT BENNY GREB\nBenny Greb is one of the most respected drummers in the world today. Not only has he headlined nearly every major drum festival and toured with his clinics and drum camps worldwide, but he is also recognized as a composer and bandleader in his own band Moving Parts, which won him the renowned “ECHO Jazz” award - the German equivalent to The Grammys in jazz.\n\nBenny Greb published two of the most successful and critically acclaimed educational products, “The Language of Drumming” and “The Art and Science of Groove” and he has helped create many signature products available to drummers today.\n\nFind him online at https://www.bennygreb.de as well as on social media."

      "label": "One of the first steps in ear training is recognizing intervals. Knowing what the distance is between two notes. Because every melody, chord or scale consists of a series of intervals, this is a very useful and also fundamental skill in music. \n\nThis app helps you to identify the intervals and at the same time how to find them on the guitar. \n\nWith an improved knowledge of intervals on the guitar you can figure out chord progressions more easily, can reproduce melodies as you hear them, get a better understanding of written music etc.\n\nFeatures\n\n- 17 selectable intervals, from unison, minor second thru major tenth.\n\n- Choice between melodic and harmonic intervals, ascending & descending.\n\n- A graphical representation of intervals on the guitar.\n\n- The root note can be chosen over two octaves.\n\n- Portrait, portrait upside down and both landscape modes.\n\n- Optional voice function, convenient for training in the car.\n\n- Practice and test (quiz)mode.\n\n- Intervals are grouped by difficulty level. Each group has 6 progress indicators corresponding to the different interval types  (melodic ascending/descending, harmonic ascending/descending, random melodic, random harmonic/melodic).\n\n- Optional reference melodies for each interval can be played. These should help in learning intervals faster.\n\n- In practicing harmonic intervals, the interval is classified as consonant/dissonant. Hearing this difference is beneficial in identifying harmonic intervals.\n\n- More than 10 alternate tunings e.g. the NST (new standard tuning) and all fourths tuning. The latter has the property that same intervals all have similar patterns down or across the fretboard.\n\n- Option to play only tapped notes (interval type \"None\"). Useful in figuring out melodies or trying alternate tunings. \n\n- In practice mode the root can also be played as the second note in the interval.\n\n- Support for left handed guitar.\n\n- Support for bass guitar.\n\n- To be in line with written music, enharmonic equivalent notes are used to have classical interval names. E.g. the 3 semitone interval C - D# will be called minor third C - Eb.\n\n- Intervals can be practiced and tested in a scale context. Sometimes the same intervals may sound quite different just because of being played in another scale. To strengthen the scale interval knowledge the partial scale runs of the interval can be played automatically backward and/or forward for a chosen scale.\n\n- More than 15 of the most important scales are implemented and can be visualized on the fretboard. The scale notes are clustered and colored to show clearly the root note for which the interval applies.\n\n- Universal app: designed for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, 64-bit compatible.\n\n- Support for all screen sizes.\n\n- Dark mode support.\n\n- iOS, iPadOS 16 tested."

Now with Drum Kit Designer feature and detailed online tutorials.\n\nFeatured in Modern Drummer 'New and Notable' - July 2018  \n\n\"an invaluable aid not only for drummers but also studio engineers and producers\" - Sound on Sound Magazine\n\n\"I can’t recommend this app highly enough ... for the money, it is indispensable. It's simple, accurate, looks good, and the tuning information is worth the cost of the app alone.\" - www.mikedolbear.com\n\n“***** I never knew I could have this much fun tuning drums!” – Adamrod (App Store review)\n\n“***** Just tuned my first drum and this app is awesome!” – bburt85 (App Store review)\n\n“***** Buy this app if you are a drummer!!!” Lildrummerboy (App Store review)\n\nThe original and most innovative electronic drum tuning app - iDrumTune Pro brings unrivalled accuracy and features that have never been possible before for assisting with drum tuning. Built by world experts in drums and musical acoustics, and backed up by a detailed online training course on Drum Sound and Drum Tuning.\n\niDrumTune Pro includes the following features:\n\n* Pitch Tuning – to make your drums sing and allow you to play musical phrases around the kit\n\n* Lug Tuning – to ensure that the drumhead is evenly tuned and gives a smooth and warm tone\n\n* Resonant Head Tuning – to allow you to be sure that the two heads are working together and giving rich overtones\n\n* Spectrum Analyzer – so you can really start to understand what frequencies are excited and heard when playing the drums\n\n* Drum Kit Presets – so you can save and load your favourite tunings and share them with the world. Now also includes the interactive Drum Kit Designer feature.\n\n* The Science of Drum Tuning – and extensive manual on the science and art of drum tuning and getting the best out of iDrumTune Pro \n\niDrumTune is the first and by far the most intelligent and accurate system for analyzing drum sounds and assisting tuning – developed by drummers, music producers and acoustics research Professors. iDrumTune provides you with a measurement of the drumhead vibration frequency, much in the same way to an acoustic guitar tuner which measures the vibration frequency of a guitar string. In Pitch Tuning mode, you simply hold the iPhone over the center of a drum, about 2-4 inches away, and strike the drum in the center.\n\nThe iDrumTune readout shows the recorded sound waveform and gives the strongest frequency recorded. There is also a tuning indicator bar which shows the drumhead tuning relative to musical notes, so iDrumTune can be used to ensure that your drums are in key with each other or the song you are playing. A frequency spectrum view also allows more detailed analysis and helps with tuning the drum at the lug positions.\n\niDrumTune provides advanced tuning features including an intelligent filter function, Lug Tuning mode and Resonant Head Tuning mode. The filter allows unwanted frequencies to be ignored by the analysis algorithm, whilst Lug Tuning mode offers the simplest and most innovative method for tuning an even frequency response at the lug positions on the drumhead.\n\nThe Preset Manager allows you to save all your favourite drum tunings and call them up when you are in the middle of the process. Drum kits can also be exported and imported, so you can share your favorite tuning setups and load new ones in from other drummers.\n\nDrum Tuning isn’t easy, and drums don’t respond exactly the same way every time you hit them. For that reason, it's valuable to know a little about the science of drum tuning. iDrumTune includes a comprehensive text on the science of drums and drum tuning in order to help you get the best of iDrumTune and to become an expert drum tuner!\n\nWatch the iDrumTune tutorial videos and read reviews on iDrumTune at www.idrumtune.com"

There's also an additional sub-oscillator strapped into the master section for added oomph.\n\nThe internal controllers will bring in the dynamics: an LFO and an envelope, there's a recordable XY field & a sequencer. Use these to modulate any knob – a simple long tap will do.\n\nThe sound springs to life when it hits the filter section. Needless to say, analogue high-pass, low-pass and band-pass varieties are in place, along with a comb filter.\n\nStandards aside, the actual intention behind this project, the Vowel Filter, also became its outstanding feature: string together two or four vowel formants and play them back in a multitude of ways.\n\nOnce you’ve built your sound, there’s tons of sound polish in two chained multi-effect units.\n\nFeatures\n\n•\tSawtooth, Triple Saw, Pulse, Triple FM, Noise with tonal Filter, Sub Sine\n•\t5 Filters with 5 Modulators each\n•\tDuophone Arpeggiator\n•\tVowel Filter\n•\tTwo Effect Sections\n•      Audio Unit v3\n•\tAbleton Link Kit\n•\tMIDI Learn & Host Automation\n•\t300 groovy presets by various artists"

      "label": "Have you ever struggled to find confidence on stage or inspiration in the studio? AeroPads cues immersive pads and soundscapes that inspire and equip you to perform your very best every time.\n\nENHANCE YOUR SOUND. ENGAGE YOUR AUDIENCE.\nEvery musician has experienced an empty mix or an awkward transition. When using AeroPads, you instantly add more dimension and character to your sound. With a more immersive mix and the ability to perform smooth and seamless transitions, you will feel more confident while your audience will be more engaged.\n\nFOR EVERY MUSICIAN.\nPads and soundscapes are a versatile accompaniment to nearly any style of music. Whether you are a soloist or full band, AeroPads will take your sound to the next level. Rock bands, worship teams, wedding singers, producers, songwriters, and instrumentalists are just a few of the many types of musicians that have loved using AeroPads.\n\nDESIGNED FOR THE STAGE. INSPIRED BY SPACE.\nAeroPads features creative and immersive soundscapes paired with a beautiful and intuitive interface, all inspired by the pinnacle of exploration and inspiration: outer space.\n\nCREATIVITY THAT SPARKS CREATIVITY.\nAeroPads aren't your typical pads. Most pads out there are really boring or insanely obnoxious. However, AeroPads features thoughtfully crafted soundscapes that are meticulously fine-tuned with the perfect amount of harmonic and textural movement. Simply put, AeroPads won't step on the toes of your arrangement or get on the nerves of your sound guy (like most other pads out there).\n\n\nHighlighted Features:\n- A beautiful space-inspired interface with a simple and intuitive design.\n- Live View: Every key and three of your favorite patches are instantly accessible (best suited for experimentation, free-flowing sets, and songwriting).\n- Setlist View: Plan and build a detailed setlist (best suited for structured sets and seamless transitions).\n- The iconic Atmosphere Soundpack which includes five unique patches named after and inspired by the layers of Earth's atmosphere. \n- Three patches can be added to Live View to be made instantly accessible, so there's no need to dig through menus to just to change a patch when performing live.\n- Additional patches and soundpacks available for purchase.\n\n\nHow to Use:\n01. Cue a pad that matches the key of your musical arrangement.\n02. Play overtop of the accompanying pads and soundcapes.\n03. Enjoy the boost of audience engagement, musician confidence, and creative inspiration.\n\nPads and soundscapes are intended as a subtle accompaniment to musical arrangements/performances. They are designed to be cued according to the key of the arrangement. Once cued, you'll hear a droning pad centered around the root note with additional harmonic textures within the major scale. Pads can accompany arrangements of both minor and major scales. To accompany an arrangement within a minor scale, cue the relative major (Example: to accompany an arrangement in the key of A minor, cue \"C\"). A pad's key should not be changed to match chord changes within an arrangement. The only time a pad's key should change within a song is in the instance of a key change. For best results, mix AeroPads appropriately within the overall mix. When mixed too loud, AeroPads may compete with melodies and the arrangement. When mixed too quietly, AeroPads may be less effective. When mixed appropriately, they will sound awesome."

      "label": "SWAM Solo Strings has arrived on iOS! The incredibly powerful Physical Modeling technology is now MOBILE. Extreme Expressivity and Realism delivered in a package of only 46 MB\nThese instruments are NOT sample libraries. Unlike sampling, which uses recordings to replicate the sound of an instrument, physical modeling doesn’t generate a sound as such but creates the conditions for the system to create it according to an external input (like someone playing on a keyboard).\n\nWith our SWAM Violin for iOS, you now have the unique ability to express yourself with all the emotions  and subtleties of a natural string instrument sound as played by a real player, in any style — from classical to film scoring and even microtonal music.\nSWAM Violin for iOS can be used as a standalone instrument for playing in real-time, or as a plug-in for mobile music production. Play with your favorite external controller or directly from your iOS device through our intuitive interface.\n\nWith SWAM Violin for iOS you can:\n- Explore our collection of presets, create your own, or import them from your Desktop\n- Play in real-time using the standalone version of the app\n- Play with different instrument bodies\n- Play in a variety of styles like a real player\nControl the instrument’s expressivity in real-time directly through the touch control interface on your iPhone or iPad  including the exclusive virtual bowing touch surface!\n- Play and control the instrument’s expressivity in real-time using your favorite external controller (ROLI Seaboard, Akai EWI, breath controllers, regular keyboards, and more)\n- Use the included AUv3 plugin version to produce music with a mobile setup\n- Use the included AUv3 plugin version in combination with Camelot PRO for live performances\n- Adjust every aspect of the instrument’s sound (timbre, vibrato, amount of air, etc.) through an easy-to-use control panel\n- Micro-tune the instrument through the Pitch Manager (note: MAQAM device is supported with direct integration)\n- Add built-in effects such as Reverb, EQ, and Compressor\n- Have access to easy MIDI control configurations\n\nThe SWAM Violin for iOS is for you if:\n- You’re a wind controller player looking for a mobile setup to perform live without needing a computer while still having an incredible sound.\n- You’re a keyboard player and feeling frustrated by the limited expressive capabilities normal sample-based plugins give you.\n- You’re a music producer looking for a mobile setup to produce music from anywhere without having to carry around expensive gear.\n- You’re looking for a virtual instrument that allows you to express the full range of your musicality easily  on your iPhone or iPad.\n\nIMPORTANT: If you choose to play using an external controller, please note that a controller with the ability to continuously control the expression (like an expression pedal, breath controller, MPE device, wind controller, …) is REQUIRED. The same way real players need a bow to express themself on their instrument, SWAM Violin needs something to control its expressivity. SWAM instruments do not work with just note-on velocity."

Create a new Alarm.\n2. Choose either one song or create a playlist of songs to shuffle.\n3. Lock your screen, relax, and wake up on the right side of the bed!\n\nSupports playing the alarm Bluetooth devices connected to your iOS device.\n\nNotes\n• Click \"Developer Website\" below on this App Store page for the complete FAQ, or email me at iam@willsaid.com\n• A Free Spotify Account works! However, *you need a premium Spotify account to play the entire song in Spotify*\n• The Spotify Mobile App is not needed\n• Internet connectivity is required to find songs and \"set\" an alarm, but not needed when it goes off.\n• Alarms go off for one minute max, but you can always chain multiple alarms together if you are a heavy sleeper. Spotify's API currently only lets the app play 30 seconds of each song, although entire songs are coming soon.\n• As stated above, the app currently plays 30 second snippets of the best parts of songs, which should be more than enough to wake up.\n• Supports Snoozing, Days to Repeat, and the other features you'd expect from an alarm clock\n• The maker of this app is not attached to Spotify in any way. The app simply plays Spotify Content from Spotify's API.\n• Most but not all Spotify songs are currently available on the app. This is outside my control, and up to which artists approve third party app usage of their content. The selection size has improved since Version 1 and is continuing to do so. Artists not on the app include Bob Marley, Ariana Grande, and Frank Ocean. Please email me BEFORE downloading the app if there's a specific song you are looking for and I can quickly check. Email me at iam@willsaid.com and I will get back to you very quickly!"

      "label": "Note reading made fun! Note Rush is a game for practising note reading on the music staff to help you learn to play the piano, keyboard, flute, saxophone, violin... you name it! Note Rush shows you one note at a time in random order then uses the microphone to listen as you play through them like you would with note reading flash cards, only these flash cards check that you're playing the right note! \n\nPlay with a bunch of fun themes and race to earn stars and beat your best time! Note Rush is great for teaching keyboard geography by making sure each note is played in the correct octave. An indispensable music theory must-have for learning sight reading at all levels of music education.\n\n\"Great app for learning notes!\" - App Store Review.\n\n\"So much better than flash cards! My son loves using this app and his note reading has improved tremendously since starting. I'm thankful he can do this on his own and it keeps track of his high scores which is highly motivating for him.\" - App Store Review.\n\n\"A blockbuster hit with teachers and students... I especially like using it at group lessons.\" - Leila Viss, 88pianokeys.me \n\n\"Note Rush has quickly become my favorite app for piano teaching.\" - Joy Morin, colorinmypiano.com\n\n\"Note Rush is a motivating app that engages students to improve quickly with their note reading skills. It is definitely one of my top favorites and will be used often!\" - Jennifer Foxx, musiceducatorresources.com\n\n\"Note Rush is a great way to review notes for the One Minute Club.\" - Susan Paradis, susanparadis.com\n\n*** Having trouble? See noterushapp.com/troubleshooting for help. ***\n\nListens to Your Instrument\n------------------------------\nNote Rush helps students learn a strong association between notes on the page and keys on your instrument by using your device's microphone to detect when you play each note. Works with pianos, keyboards, flutes, violins, you name it! (See Q&A below for more about supported instruments.)\n\nStudent-paced\n------------------\nNote Rush goes as fast or as slow as the student, with no time limits, so is suitable for complete beginners right through to being a fun challenge even for teachers!\n\nGrand Staff Context\n-----------------------\nThe whole grand staff is always visible, showing each note in full context and helping students improve their note recognition across the two staves.\n\nOctave-Sensitive Keyboard Geography\n---------------------------------------------\nIt's a \"B\", but which \"B\"?? Note Rush teaches keyboard geography by making sure you're getting the note in the right octave every time.\n\nGreat for Home Practise\n-------------------------\nStudents will rush to their instrument at home every day with NoteRush, chasing stars and high scores! Unlike flash cards, children can drill note identification at home with no music-reading parent required to check if they're getting them correct - Note Rush checks for you! Play every day and you'll be great at reading piano music in no time.\n\nLevels\n-------\nNote Rush has fifteen built-in Levels, from Middle C-Position right through to the full grand staff with 2 ledger lines above and below. There are Levels for Treble Clef, Bass Clef or full Grand Staff! Or make your own levels to practise reading specific notes, with sharps and flats for an added challenge!\n\nBetter Than Flash Cards!\n-------------------------\nUse Note Rush instead of printed flash cards! Note Rush was designed to replace the cards used in One Minute Club - a challenge you can run in your studio where students have to complete a given level in under a minute. Give it a try!\n\n--\nNote Rush is made by Thomas Grayston, a software developer, pianist, and husband to a piano teacher."

RTA is a professional-grade acoustical analysis tool. All filters meet or exceed ANSI and IEC Class 1 specifications. \n\nIncludes Octave and 1/3 Octave modes, with selectable decay times, as well as Peak Hold and true linear Average mode.\n\n*** iOS Microphones\n\nWe have analyzied every iOS device, including all of the iPads, all iPhones, and iPod touches, and have created microphone compensation files that are applied automatically. You can trust the results you are getting, often within just a few dB of a far more expensive analyzer. Calibration is updated regularly, automatically, from our cloud-based calibration database.\n\nUpgrade to our iTestMic or iAudioInterface2 to bring your system up to full professional specs.\n\n*** Save and Recall Graphs\n\nYou can save and recall graphs, marked with the GPS location, date & time, and your comment, as well as store the image to your photo roll.\n\nExport the data as an XLS formatted file to your computer for inclusion in reports or further analysis.\n\n*** Max and Min Bars\n\nYou can also turn on resettable Max/Min bars (see image #4) to capture peaks. Double-tap to reset the bars.\n\n*** Specifications and Devices\n\nThe internal iPhone mic has a noise floor near 30 dB, and if your are running iOS 6, clips around 120 dB. \n\n*** Touch GUI\n\nFully interactive touch GUI features includes scroll up/down, pinch to zoom or compress the vertical dB scale, or swipe horizontally to get a cursor that reads out the exact dB level and frequency across the screen. To make the cursor disappear, swipe it off the graph to the left.\n\nThe landscape-mode display flips 180 degrees so that you can face the internal mic in either direction.\n\n*** Overlay Curves\n\nAlso included are optional noise curve overlays, in NCB, RC, PNC, NC, X-Curve and NR mode. See picture #2 for an example. Use this feature to get a quick reading on the noise levels in a room. Also includes the cinema large-room X-curve overlay.\n\n*** Calibration\n\nRTA can be fully calibrated, whether you are using it with the internal iOS microphone, or one of our professional test & measurement mic solutions. And, if you are using iTestMic, the mic calibration is transmitted directly to the app, so you are always calibrated.\n\n*** RTA or FFT?\n\nIf you are wondering if you should download this app or our FFT app, check out our website, we have a page devoted to this topic.\n\nSee our other acoustics and audio apps, including AudioTools."

      "label": "Learn to play 'In The Pocket' with Drummer ITP: The World's only intelligent metronome and rudiment training tool! *Worldwide Number 1 iPhone Music App in over 70 countries!*\n\nDrummer ITP can help you to learn exceptionally accurate timing with your drum performances and become a true 'In The Pocket' player. The app is designed for practicing rudiment patterns with a drum practice pad - incorporating an intelligent listening feature, which allows your performance against a metronome click to be measured and given as feedback scores. You can therefore track your progress and identify what rudiment patterns and tempos cause you most trouble with staying in time. \n\n*Please note: as with all professional audio and recording systems, Drummer ITP requires you to use wired headphones to enable zero latency analysis and measurements. Bluetooth headphones do not allow zero latency data exchange.\n\nDrummer ITP helps to identify the key tempos where your technique changes from wrist-action stick hits to faster speeds which require you to control the bounce of the drumsticks. Finding your breaking points with different stick pad rudiments and practice exercises will enable you to focus on the most challenging aspects of your personal stick technique and will underpin your development in all areas of drumming.\n\nThe main display shows both the rolling click waveform and the microphone readings from your performance on the practice pad, so you can easily see if you are playing ahead or behind the beat. There is also a unique accuracy indicator which shows how far ahead or behind the beat each of your hits is. Whilst performing rudiments and exercises on a practice pad, the app records an ongoing measurement of accuracy and consistency of the performance, so you can practice to keep the timing indicator right in the middle of the screen and achieve the highest possible scores. When playing an accented pattern, or an exercise with rests incorporated, the intelligent algorithm checks that the correct type of hits are performed at the right time. If you want to check how accurate the app is, just turn up the loudspeaker volume and you'll see it measure its own sounds to 100% accuracy - so you can see how close your own performance scores are to that of an electronic drum machine!\n\nDrummer ITP can be used in Manual Mode or Rudiment Mode. In Manual Mode the metronome runs freely, as a standard metronome whilst also keeping a measurement of the recent performance scores. With a rudiment pattern active (i.e. using the app's Rudiment Mode), a count in starts a 30, 60, 120 or 300 second rudiment test, the results of which become a benchmark for evaluating your performance progress over time, with all your best high scores being recorded. The app can also be used purely as a standalone high-precision metronome with advanced settings allowing you to choose different pitches, volumes and intervals for the click.\n\nIncludes a total of 68 practice patterns and rudiment exercises for combinations of:\n- standard timing exercises (quarters, eighths, sixteenths)\n- triplet timing exercises\n- single, double and triple paradiddles (including inverted, reverse and offset)\n- single and double paradiddle-diddle patterns\n- rudimental drum rolls\n- accented patterns\n\nAdditional features:\n- notation of all included rudiments and exercise patterns \n- real-time left/right hand pattern indicator \n- accent indicator and moving notation counter \n- tempo adjustment from 30-240 bpm\n- beat time intervals 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n- optional beat one accent for practicing specific time signatures\n- click designer with settings for pitch, tonality, click duration and volume\n- separate click design for the main beat and interval sounds\n- stick pad performance player, to hear what you are attempting to play\n- high scores chart for completed rudiments and exercises\n- preset click sounds\n- microphone sensitivity adjustment\n- intelligent 'learn latency' feature to ensure 100% accurate analysis"

      "label": "The next evolution in music software. Powerful wavetable sound. \nThe next generation ELECTRIBE produces state-of-the-art dance music.\n\nThe ELECTRIBE series first appeared in 1999. Since then each generation has inherited the iconic, intuitive operability of the original while incorporating the most up-to-date sounds and styles.\n\nThe ease of use, accessibility, sound and musicality of the ELECTRIBE reach new heights in this latest software version which features a powerful wavetable sound source, a “Quick Input” sequencer and a convenient chord pad that allows you to play a chord with one finger. Even if you aren't a musical virtuoso, with ELECTRIBE Wave you can create state-of-the-art dance music like EDM, Future Bass, and Trap.\n\n• Powerful wavetable sound suitable for the latest in EDM\nELECTRIBE Wave has a sound wavetable featuring sounds widely used in the latest music creation. Unlike a PCM synth, the wavetable allows you to repeatedly play fragments of short waveforms, and change the waveform position during playback. By combining the wavetable (which features a rich variety of presets) with a powerful filter and two modulation units, you can create an infinite number of innovative and sharp sounds that cannot be produced using standard PCM synths. Even without a deep knowledge of synthesis techniques, the carefully selected parameters make it easy to craft your sound.\n\n• Improved user interface for quick composition\nThe familiar 16-step pad in the ELECTRIBE series enables speedy rhythm production. The ELECTRIBE Wave also features a new keyboard to play chords and scales. Even without musical knowledge, you can have fun making tracks without worrying about wrong notes. The sequencer features Groove, which can be used to breathe life into rhythm parts, as well as a special keyboard to enable smooth step input for synth parts on the graphical user interface.\n\n• Convenient chord pad that allows you to play a chord with one finger\nELECTRIBE Wave features a chord pad that allows you to play  chords with one finger. If you use the \"Fetch\" function, it will automatically extract the chords from the song that you are in in the middle of creating and assign those chords to the pad for fast and easy song creation. You can also easily assign and save your favorite chords. In addition you can use the arpeggiator to create new phrases!\n\n• Motion Sequence records and plays temporal changes in sounds and effects\nThe ELECTRIBE series introduced a powerful motion sequence function that remembers and reproduces the movements of the knobs. ELECTRIBE Wave now offers this function for the synthesizer/drum parts so you can create a flow of sound overflowing with originality. If you use the built in KAOSS PAD you can change the sound to drastically with a single fingertip, easily storing and reproducing  temporal changes. Remember the wave table POSITION to make real time minute changes to the sound performance.\n\n• Song mode can combine patterns into finished songs\nUse song mode to create a new track by simply arranging the order of existing patterns. Using only the ELECTRIBE Wave, you can take a song all the way from inspiration to completion. With audio file export, you can send a complete song or individual patterns to your favorite DAW, or upload to services like SoundCloud.\n\nMore info at korg.com"

Get creative and listen to how your compositions swing with the Genius Jamtracks trio.\n- Edit the charts for your favourite jazz standards however you like.\n\n\n“Genius Jamtracks is easily the best play along app out there! Particularly the piano voicings are more logical and realistic than other play-along apps. The bass and drums are not just a simple repetitive pattern, but actually use some jazz language. And it’s nice that you can make the band busy in unpredictable ways. As much like playing with a real group as you can get from an algorithm. Highly recommended!“\nPaul Bollenback  \n\n“It’s like a jazz musician wrote it. The drums and piano are just like how a jazz drummer and pianist would play. Couldn’t be an easy task to create that!”\nSteve Beskrone\n\n\n\n- Easy to read charts! \nCustom fonts make for beautiful, easy to read chord charts.\n\n- Rhythmic Complexity slider \nStart with simple comping and work your way up to mastering superhuman polyrhythms!\n\n- Harmonic Complexity slider\nStart with triads and work your way up to advanced substitutions and reharmonisation of the song.\n\n- The one and only polyrhythmic play-along!\nIn the Jam Session mode, the app decides on its own what to play and when to play it, based on the style of the song and the tempo. Experiment with how the app transforms the rhythm and the harmony according to the slider levels.\n\n- Master your polyrhythms!\nFocus on a specific grouping, polyrhythm or rhythmic displacement. Ask the trio – or an individual instrument – to include only what you’ve requested when they introduce polyrhythmic phrasing.\nAs you won’t know when or how it will be used though, this feature also helps sharpen your ability to improvise as well as mastering that rhythm!\n\n- Why it sounds great.\nIt’s all in the dynamics, note durations, space and feel. The Genius Jamtracks trio pays close attention to each of these elements to make the Genius Jam Session experience as close to the real thing as possible.\n\n- A real swing feel!\nForget the robotic triplets of other play-alongs. When changing the tempo, the app doesn’t simply play faster or slower, the swing feel changes as well. The app learned how to swing by internalising the jazz vocabulary and playing based on real transcriptions from the masters.\n\n- Actual voice leading!\nNo matter what your settings are, just press play and you’ll always have the same attention to voice leading from the pianist and the same effort in creating beautiful lines from the bassist to accompany you.\n\nReady to take your skills to the next level?"

      "label": "Undulator is Eventide’s classic modulated tremolo effect from the iconic H3000 effects processor. This unique, rhythmic effect combines ethereal feedback and detuned echos, run through an AM / FM modulated tremolo. Whether used for manipulating samples or adding movement to strings, pads, guitars, and keys, Undulator is a muse for creative musicians. Add Undulator into your plug-ins collection for the most playable tremolo-style effect on your DAW or iOS device.\n\nUndulator excels at evolving pads, sync’d chops, and time-lapsing dreamy soundscapes. Combined with a multi-tap delay and powerful tremolo, Undulator’s controls give any sound sustain and shape. This is perfect for transforming ordinary synths, keys, guitars, and even vocals into evolving pads, tempo synced production elements, or ethereal and fluctuant delays. Simply put, Undulator can make shorter sounds into longer layered effects, and give sustaining sounds shape and rhythmic character.\n\nUse the Ribbon to morph tremolo patterns into vacillating and varying rhythmic territories. This can be effective for calling attention to synth pads and creating a state of flux or rarity which is otherwise arduous to achieve.\n\n- Turn up the MIX to increase the dry/effect ratio\n- Utilize multiple modulation waveform shapes and sources to alter the rhythmic feel\n- Subtly finesse detuning of delays by using SPREAD\n- Add FEEDBACK to accentuate delays or create infinite loops\n- The Secondary LFO determines how fast the depth and speed modulation “wiggle” their targets\n- Lock the tremolo to tempo using SYNC\n- RETRIG at the top of the waveform for a more predictable effect\n- RIBBON lets you ‘play’ the effect in real-time and provides dynamic and fluid control to morph back and forth between the settings of your choice\n- SLOW/FAST button toggles on a “Slow LFO” mode. Holding it down to “BRAKE” temporarily slows down the LFOs at a constant rate until released\n- Update the tremolo speed in real time using the TAP button\n- Available as an AUv3 plug-in and Standalone App"

      "label": "SWAM Solo Woodwinds has arrived on iOS! The incredibly powerful Physical Modeling technology is now MOBILE. Extreme Expressivity and Realism delivered in a package of only 46 MB\nThese instruments are NOT sample libraries. Unlike sampling, which uses recordings to replicate the sound of an instrument, physical modeling doesn’t generate a sound as such but creates the conditions for the system to create it according to an external input (like someone playing on a keyboard).\n\nWith our SWAM Soprano Sax for iOS, you now have the unique ability to express yourself with all the emotions  and subtleties of a natural string instrument sound as played by a real player, in any style — from classical to film scoring and even microtonal music.\n\nSWAM Soprano Sax for iOS can be used as a standalone instrument for playing in real-time, or as a plug-in for mobile music production. Play with your favorite external controller or directly from your iOS device through our intuitive interface.\n\nWith SWAM Soprano Sax for iOS you can:\n- Explore our collection of presets, create your own, or import them from your Desktop\n- Play in real-time using the standalone version of the app\n- Play with different instrument bodies\n- Play in a variety of styles like a real player\nControl the instrument’s expressivity in real-time directly through the touch control interface on your iPhone or iPad  including the exclusive virtual bowing touch surface!\n- Play and control the instrument’s expressivity in real-time using your favorite external controller (ROLI Seaboard, Akai EWI, breath controllers, regular keyboards, and more)\n- Use the included AUv3 plugin version to produce music with a mobile setup\n- Use the included AUv3 plugin version in combination with Camelot PRO for live performances\n- Adjust every aspect of the instrument’s sound (timbre, vibrato, amount of air, etc.) through an easy-to-use control panel\n- Micro-tune the instrument through the Pitch Manager (note: MAQAM device is supported with direct integration)\n- Add built-in effects such as Reverb, EQ, and Compressor\n- Have access to easy MIDI control configurations\n\nThe SWAM Soprano Sax for iOS is for you if:\n- You’re a wind controller player looking for a mobile setup to perform live without needing a computer while still having an incredible sound.\n- You’re a keyboard player and feeling frustrated by the limited expressive capabilities normal sample-based plugins give you.\n- You’re a music producer looking for a mobile setup to produce music from anywhere without having to carry around expensive gear.\n- You’re looking for a virtual instrument that allows you to express the full range of your musicality easily  on your iPhone or iPad.\n\nIMPORTANT: If you choose to play using an external controller, please note that a controller with the ability to continuously control the expression (like an expression pedal, breath controller, MPE device, wind controller, …) is REQUIRED. The same way real players need a bow to express themself on their instrument, SWAM Soprano Sax needs something to control its expressivity. SWAM instruments do not work with just note-on velocity."

      "label": "Chord! is a chord and scale reference that works with any fretted instrument like guitar, basses, ukulele, banjos,… It computes and analyses all the possible fingerings for chords, scales, and arpeggios.\n\nWith Chord!, you can also write a song by simply dragging and dropping chords, transpose it in any key, compute the fingerings with any tuning and generate a beautiful print-ready PDF, etc.\n\nYou can also import your existing songs in text format (please note that the app does not ship with songs). You can also link audio tracks from your music library and play them at the same time while adjusting their pitch and/or speed.\n\nYou don't even have to know music theory to use it: behind its brute force, the app knows how to handle by itself some subtleties of music to give meaningful results.\n\nIf you don't have to be an advanced player to use the app, you can however take a look under the hood and tweak the parameters if you like! Whatever is your level or your instrument, Chord! will adapt and give you the most precise answer.\n\nYou can search for any chord, split (like D/F#), or not. If you're a beginner, you can choose the chord from a list, but you can also use the intelligent keyboard to enter the chord as it is written. If this keyboard is a great way to enter chords, it is also very useful to discover and understand how the chords are formed. You can also enter some notes on a neck to find which chords it can be. You can hear how each fingering sounds. Chord arpeggios are also supported, as well as drop voicings (drop 2, drop3, etc.).\n\nThe app also ships with the biggest list of named scales (and you can create your own scales). It analyses and presents them with nice interactive views (scale, score, and keyboard). Of course, it can also lay down these scales on a neck (with sound) and compute their fingerings. Like for chords, you can even search for a scale from its fingering!\n\nEach scale can be harmonized (decomposed into chords). You can also enter a sequence of chords to find which scale you can use to improvise onto.\n\nYou can use one of the hundred tunings that ship with the app, or you can add your own ones, for any instrument, with or without a capo, even with broken strings if you want!\n\nThe app uses custom and unique algorithms to generate charts, easily input complex harmonic structures, extract chords from fingerings, determine finger positions, compute keys of scales, generate chords from scales and find scales that go well with some chords.\n\nFor example, Chord! is the right tool in these situations:\n• You want to have your songbook available at any time, in your pocket;\n• You're a beginner and you want to know how to play easily a D/F# chord;\n• One gave you a ukulele and you want to know how to tune it and how to play the G Hawaiian scale;\n• You want to know on what scale you can improvise for some chord sequence (and the answer can be different than the Pentatonic minor!);\n• You want to print your song and share it with your band.\n• You want to experiment with this nice open tuning, moreover with a bottleneck;\n• Your little sister can't make bar chords and you want to show her how she can do without bars, with three (little) fingers only;\n• You want to impress your little sister by showing her how you can play the same chords with two bars!\n• You want to understand how this fingering for C13 is actually a fingering for C13;\n• You broke a string and want to know how to play some chords without;\n• You want to know how Django managed to play with two and a half fingers.\n\nThe app fully supports left-handed instruments.\n\nMain functions of the app:\n- Write, transpose, fingerize, print, and share songs;\n- Search chord fingerings (or chord charts);\n- Search chords from fingerings;\n- Search scale fingerings;\n- Search scales from fingerings;\n- Search chords from scale;\n- Search scales from chords."

It will leave out beats randomly to force you to strengthen your own inner time-keeping muscles, and it has other cool features for odd meters, drum machine-style patterns, and more... this is an awesome learning, grooving, solidifying tool.\"\n\nStrengthen your inner sense of rhythm! Time Guru is the only metronome with the ability to mute its sound at random, in sequenced patterns, or both, so that you can assess whether you tend to rush or drag or loose your place with odd meters. Time Guru can periodically leave you on your own so that you strengthen your own internal sense of time, rather than relying on the constant, rigid, external time keeping of a metronome. It's like training wheels that sometimes come up off the ground.\n\nTime Guru also features:  \n-the ability to play in different time signatures or sequences of time signatures\n-create rhythmic drum-machine like patterns\n-save presets for tempo, meter, sound and muting-\n-35 loud sound sets; \n-Human or robot voice counting in English, Chinese, French, German or Russian - great for teaching!\n-tap tempo (5 to 300 BPM range)\n-super accurate, rock-solid timing via a customized audio engine. \n\nAnd of course it can function as a normal metronome. \n\nNoTreble.com says: \"I love the aesthetic and layout of Time Guru. It’s very simple and elegant. Time Guru also offers ability to set randomness of your subdivisions (great for testing your internal clock)….There is one thing that Time Guru does that I absolutely love, and for which, this app will always live on my iPhone – at the top of the screen, you will see a series of numbers (1-7). When you press a number, it is set first in a sequence and you can choose a subdivision that will then repeat that number of times (or set it to rest that number of times). Sound confusing? It isn’t, because the layout is so simple. Every time you press a new number, it is set next in the sequence and you choose your continue to choose your subdivisions.\""

      "label": "Creating sounds with time-varying timbre, on your mobile device.\nKORG iWAVESTATION - A wave sequence synthesizer for iOS.\n\nThe WAVESTATION synthesizer went on sale in 1990. This instrument featured an advanced vector synthesis system which created new sounds by combining and connecting multiple waveforms; it provided a mix/morphing function that let you use a joystick to change the balance of four oscillators, and a distinctive wave sequence function that allowed you to place waveforms in a desired sequence to create sequence patterns. To this day, it continues to be considered a legendary and still-unique instrument.\n\nNow in 2016, the WAVESTATION has been reborn as \"KORG iWAVESTATION,\" an app for iPad/iPhone. In addition to completely reproducing the programs, it also features a renewed design that lets everyone experience the stupendous sound-shaping potential of the WAVESTATION. It features touch-based operation that's distinctive of iOS, in conjunction with a new graphic interface that allows you to visualize and edit the time-varying timbral changes that are distinctive of the WAVESTATION. \n\n[ Features ]\n\n- A faithful reproduction of the original WAVESTATION sound: In addition to providing the sounds from all PCM memories of the WAVESTATION, the new iWAVESTATION also reproduces in software every detail of the parameters, based on an analysis of the original hardware circuit diagram.\n\n- A new wave sequence view that can be graphically controlled: The iWAVESTATION, we advance another step with a graphical user interface that takes advantage of the touch operations that are a characteristic of iOS. Even more than ever, we've updated the screen design with an emphasis on creating sequences.\n\n- 1,500 sounds, more than 700 waveforms, 55 effects, and a powerful random sequence engine: This new instrument includes a stupendous number of presets and waveforms, covering all models of the series. iWAVESTATION also provides a new random sequence function which will give you different perspectives to inspire new sounds.\n\n- Produce music together with KORG Gadget integration: iWAVESTATION can be used in conjunction with the \"KORG Gadget\" music production DAW app that has won numerous awards around the world. If both apps are installed, it can be used as the \"Milpitas\" gadget inside the KORG Gadget app.\n\nMore info at korg.com"
